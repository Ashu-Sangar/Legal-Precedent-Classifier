Rex and West negligently treated appellant’s infection and also whether appellee Lankenau Hospital is liable for its intensive care unit staff’s failure properly to monitor appellant’s condition. Review of this record discloses that appellant presented sufficient evidence to warrant submission of these issues to the jury.

      <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>On Saturday evening, August 28,1965, appellant attended a wedding reception at the William Penn Civic Club in Philadelphia. Soon after arriving at the club, he obtained a roast beef sandwich and a glass of beer. His first bite of the thickly sliced beef sandwich became lodged deep in his throat, blocking the throat passage. He immediately attempted to remove the obstruction, but was unsuccessful. Appellant left the reception and went home. There he drank fluids, but still he could not remove the blockage.</p>
    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[272,816,1148,417]]]'>After a sleepless night, appellant went to the emergency room at Lankenau Hospital. There, appellee Dr. Rex, ordered x-rays, examined appellant, and recommended surgery for removal of the impacted piece of meat. Appellant initially refused surgery, preferring to await the natural passage of the beef. After Dr. Rex informed appellant that the procedure typically involved only an overnight hospital stay, appellant agreed to the operation.</p>

During the surgical procedure, Dr. Rex removed several small portions of meat, eventually reducing the size of the portion to allow its passage into appellant’s stomach. The surgery, however, was imperfect. Dr. Rex’s operative notes reflect that a screw on the forward grasping forceps broke while inside appellant’s esophagus. As a result, the forceps opened suddenly and its narrow, pointed ends touched the walls of the esophagus. Dr. Rex made a visual inspection of the esophageal wall in search of possible perforations. At that time, however, the doctor found no evidence of perforation.</p>

Shortly after appellant awoke from the anesthesia, he suffered abdominal cramps. By 8:00 p. m., appellant’s body temperature had increased to 100.4°. Hospital employees promptly notified Dr. Rex of this change in appellant’s condition. Dr. Rex in turn requested that appellee Dr. West, an associate surgeon at Lankenau, examine appellant. Dr. Rex left the hospital without informing <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>Dr. West that the forceps broke during the operation and possibly perforated the esophagus.</p>

Dr. West informed Dr. Rex that the x-ray did not clearly indicate a perforated esophagus. Dr. West ordered hospital employees to monitor appellant’s vital signs and to transfer appellant to the main surgical floor intensive care unit of the hospital. Dr. West then left the hospital.</p>

Appellant’s temperature then had risen to 100.6° or 100.8°. No additional temperature recordings were noted until several hours later that morning. At 8:00 a. m. Dr. West returned to the hospital and discovered that appellant’s temperature had increased to 101.8°. Appellant’s rate of respiration and pulse had also elevated. Despite appellant’s removal to the intensive care unit, no hospital personnel monitored this change in appellant’s condition. Nor did intensive care personnel notify Dr. West of these changed circumstances. At 8:00 a. m. Dr. West for the first time diagnosed appellant’s condition as a perforated esophagus. By way of treatment, he then ordered the administration of antibiotics.</p>

Appellant proceeded against Dr. Rex on the multiple theories of negligence, alleging that Dr. Rex (1) negligently punctured appellant’s esophagus during surgery when the forceps he used broke, (2) failed to diagnose and treat appellant’s punctured esophagus in a timely manner, (3) did not obtain appellant’s “informed consent” to this surgical procedure, and (4) failed to inform Dr. West of the forcep problem. Against Dr. West, appellant proceeded on the theory of failure to administer antibiotics at an earlier time. Finally, appellant alleged that Lankenau Hospital, on a theory of respondeat superior, failed to provide adequate care during the time appellant remained in the intensive care unit. At the close of appellant’s case, the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County granted involuntary nonsuits in favor of Lankenau, Dr. Neal and Dr. West. The court also refused to submit to the jury the issue of Dr. Rex’s failure to administer antibiotics at an earlier time. The court did permit appellant’s case against Dr. Rex to go to the jury on the other three issues: that the surgery was negligently performed, that Dr. Rex failed to notify Dr. West of the forcep problem, and that appellant had not “consented” to surgery.</p>
    <p id="b626-4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[261,1600,1149,462]]]'>The court justified the nonsuit in favor of Lankenau on the ground that appellant failed to introduce any expert testimony regarding hospital practice, and thus, the issue was not for the jury. As to the alleged negligence of Drs. West and Rex in failing to administer antibiotics, the court determined that appellant’s expert witness (1) “gave contradictory statements with regard to defendants’ negligence” and (2) made it clear that the doctors acted consistently with a respected body of medical thought.</p>

Here, appellant’s expert initially testified that he knew of no reason to await final diagnosis of esophageal perforation before administering antibiotics. Although on cross-examination the expert indicated that a “small respected body” of medical practitioners believed otherwise, this is a far cry from treatment <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>approved by a considerable number of physicians. Indeed, the expert witness reaffirmed on cross-examination that “the great majority” of physicians would not apply the practice appellee doctors utilized here. Thus, we cannot agree with appellees that Dr. Thompson’s testimony alone triggered the application of the <em>Duckworth </em>standard regarding “a course of treatment advocated by a considerable number of his brethren.”</p>

See generally, Restatement (Second) of Torts § 323B(d). We think it clear that staff failure to notify the attending physician of the deteriorating condition of one of his patients falls within the exception to the requirement of expert testimony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Dr. West, upon arrival at the hospital on August 30, discovered that appellant’s condition had deteriorated during the night. His testimony at trial, corroborated by Dr. Rex, indicated that the usual and customary practice in these circumstances requires that a hospital staff member notify the attending physician of changes in the patient’s status. See also <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Methodist Hospital, </em><a href="/f-supp/324/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="324 F.

Staff failure here so to notify the supervising physician is a glaring example of want of care. Thus, it was for the jury to consider Lankenau’s liability.</p>

When this case was on appeal to the Superior Court, the trial court filed an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925, that did not support the April 8 order of the court en banc. Rather, the trial judge concluded that appellant should be granted a new trial against Drs. Rex and West. The trial judge issued an order to that effect on September 7, 1976. Appellees moved to strike the September 7 order. Their motion was granted by the Superior Court on September 23, 1976, on the ground that the trial court acted beyond the scope of its jurisdiction in attempting to modify the April 8 order after an appeal had been filed.
