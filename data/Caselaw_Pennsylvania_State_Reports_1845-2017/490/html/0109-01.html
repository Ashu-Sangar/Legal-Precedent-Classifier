    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[237,1132,1147,542]]]'>Scott leased land that he owned in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh to the Civic Center Motel under an arrangement which permitted him to sublease and operate a restaurant in the motel in return for an annual rent of one dollar. During the summer of 1970, Scott learned that his land was to be taken by eminent domain no later than October 1, 1971. In his search for a replacement property, Scott met with Purcell, a real estate developer in the Oakland section who previously had been identified as a man capable of arranging financing for major commercial ventures.</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.7",145,[237,1710,1148,647]],["BL_146.1",146,[257,295,1145,96]]]'>At a meeting in Scott’s office in November, 1970, Purcell indicated that he could obtain financing necessary to build a new motel. In return, the parties agreed that he would receive a fifty percent interest in the project. It was further agreed that Scott would manage the motel and would operate his own restaurant there on a one dollar a year lease. The parties then visited the land here in dispute. Scott told Purcell that he had been interested in this property earlier, but that the price then sought by the owner, Mrs. Margaret Ferguson (“Ferguson”), had been too high. After returning to his office, Scott requested that Purcell act on his behalf in obtaining the property and Purcell agreed to do <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>so. Scott also requested Purcell to visit Ferguson at her home in Florida while he was vacationing there.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[256,424,1145,311]]]'>In February, 1971, after meeting with Ferguson in Florida, Purcell called Scott and informed him that her price for the land was approximately $250,000.00. Scott instructed him to make a counteroffer of $10,000.00 down and $225,-000.00 at closing. Purcell thereafter informed Scott that his counteroffer had been accepted.</p>

Purcell was instructed to discuss the preparation of an agreement with Ferguson’s attorney and to have him prepare the agreement with the space for the buyer’s name left blank.

Scott was “upset,” but Purcell reassured him by indicating “there was no reason to be concerned because it [the agreement between Scott and Purcell] could be carried on as we had originally agreed.” The meeting continued with an explanation, for the benefit of Nicklas, of the financing arrangements, and Purcell admitted that he was having difficulty in obtaining mortgage financing for the proposed motel because the income from the restaurant was not included in the motel operation. At the conclusion of the meeting, Purcell agreed to continue his efforts to obtain financing on the basis of the restaurant rental being only one dollar per year.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

In its opinion, the trial court noted that by the time trial commenced on October 25, 1976, all requests for relief other than for money damages had been mooted or abandoned, and that all parties agreed that the court should decide the issues without a jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Purcell and Oaklander, however, did not object to the trial court’s exercise of jurisdiction and the case was therefore properly before the trial court sitting in equity. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 1509(c).</p>

There is insufficient evidence to support a claim that the agency relationship between Purcell and Scott was modified or terminated prior to Purcell’s alleged abuse of that relationship. A modification of an agency relationship may occur when a principal acquiesces in conduct not included in the initial agreement. In the instant case, Scott did not “acquiesce” in the proposed agreement involving Lancer. Similarly, there is no indication that Scott wished to terminate the agency relationship; at the conclusion of the April 23, 1971 meeting, it was agreed that Purcell would continue his efforts to obtain financing for the project. For the same reason, it cannot be said that Purcell terminated the relationship by a renunciation; his actions at the April 23rd meeting compel a different conclusion.</p>
