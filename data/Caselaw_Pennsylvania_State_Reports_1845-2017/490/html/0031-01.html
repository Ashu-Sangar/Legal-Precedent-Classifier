If permission to convene the grand jury is granted, it may proceed to investigate a matter after it is brought to its attention by the district attorney or the court. Section 7 of the Act, 19 P.S. § 271. The investigation may proceed only after section 9 of the Act, 19 P.S. § 273, is complied with. This section requires the submission of a notice to the supervising judge which alleges that “the <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>matter in question should be brought to the attention of the investigating grand jury because the investigative resources of the grand jury are necessary for proper investigation” and “that one or more of the investigative resources of the grand jury are required in order to adequately investigate the matter.” After the notice is submitted and the matter is brought to the attention of the grand jury by the district attorney or the court pursuant to section 7 of the Act, 19 P.S. § 271, it begins its investigation of the matter and presumably, given the absence of any requirement of approval of the notice, may do so without any particular authorization by the supervising judge. The grand jury in conducting its investigation may then utilize its “investigative resources” to inquire into the matter which was brought to its attention subject to the limitation that the matter involved be an alleged offense “against the criminal laws of the Commonwealth.” Section 7 of the Act, 19 P.S. § 271. Finally, section 6 of the Act, 19 P.S. § 270, authorizes discharge of a grand jury by the supervising judge when a determination is made that the grand jury is not conducting proper investigatory activity and such an order is subject to appellate review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Obviously, such a discharge would normally occur only after an investigation was underway because only then could the investigation be improper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

We are not unmindful of the facts that our ruling today creates a close parallel between federal and state grand juries and that the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has said that “although federal grand juries are called into existence by order of the district court, . they are ‘basically ... a law enforcement agency.’ ” <em>In re: Grand Jury Proceedings, </em><a href="/f2d/486/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="486 F.2d 85" data-case-ids="222838" data-case-paths="/f2d/486/0085-01">supra at 89-90</a>, quoting <em>United States v.

But it is one thing to say the grand juries created by the Act differ substantially from grand juries allowed by this Court at common law in that they may be empaneled and allowed to investigate on a lesser showing, and it is quite another to say the judicial power has been infringed upon as a result of the Act. The latter requires a showing that the district attorney may dictate the empanelment of a grand jury while our examination reveals the Act requires that, at the proper time, he make a showing in accordance with standards from which the court determines the validity of the empanelment and investigation. In such circumstances and absent a clear violation of an individual’s rights or the judiciary’s function, we cannot second guess the wisdom of the Legislature in determining the standards under which a grand jury may be convened.</p>
