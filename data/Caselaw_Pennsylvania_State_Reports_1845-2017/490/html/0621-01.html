Post-verdict motions were denied on June 9, 1978, and, on June 27, 1978, Pounds was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction. Sentence was suspended on the other offenses. This appeal is from the judgment imposed on the murder conviction.</p>

The cause of death was later determined to be multiple gunshot wounds of the head, face, neck, and hands. Analysis of bullet fragments removed from the body indicated the bullets had come from a revolver of .32 or larger calibre. The victim was last seen alive at 6 a. m. on July 23, 1975 and several phone calls to the victim from his supervisor made between 7 and 8 a. m. had gone unanswered.</p>

Terry McGuane testified that, after being awakened by his mother and getting his shotgun, he saw Gary Pounds run past the side of the house towards a wooded area to the rear, chased him, and fired a shot at him. The police arrived at approximately 7 a. m. and found in the wooded area, <em>inter alia, </em>a cold six-pack of Duquesne beer, the brand Gary Pounds normally drank, and a windbreaker containing three spent and three live .38 calibre ammunition. In the garage underneath Mrs. McGuane’s automobile, the officers found a stained work shirt similar to those worn by Gary Pounds which contained a partial pack of Phillip Morris cigarettes, the brand Gary Pounds normally smoked.

Crim.P. 1122 requires the disposition of post-verdict motions within 30 days of argument except under unusual circumstances. In this case, post-verdict motions were not decided for 13 months after argument. The only explanations offered of record were the presiding judge’s heavy caseload and his admittedly inadequate administration of those cases. While the former offers some excuse for the delay, these <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>reasons do not justify a delay of a year beyond the time required for disposition of post-verdict motions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[228,451,1148,415]]]'>The next circumstance of importance is whether Pounds asserted his right to be sentenced without unreasonable delay or, more appropriately, requested timely disposition of his post-verdict motions. Although Pounds apparently sent several letters to the court, the substance of these letters does not appear of record and he did not file any formal petition seeking immediate decision on his post-verdict motions or immediate sentencing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

    <p id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.6",661,[228,887,1148,741]]]'>The final factor for our consideration is the prejudice from the delay. Pounds complains he has been prejudiced by his incarceration during the elongated period between conviction and sentencing. After his conviction for murder of the first degree, Pounds was subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment on that charge as prescribed by statute. Although a defendant is generally not released on bail after conviction of such an offense, where, as here, there has been an unreasonable delay in the disposition of post-verdict motions, it is within the discretion of the judge to allow bail. Pa.R.Crim.P. 4010(A)(1). However, as noted, Pounds did not petition for release on bail, and his incarceration during that period, thus, cannot be considered prejudice resulting from the delay in the post-verdict proceedings.</p>

We note that, within the body of his argument on his speedy trial claim, Pounds also claims his right to due process has been denied due to delay in the consideration of his appeal resulting from the delay in his sentencing and a further lapse of 17 months between the filing of his notice of appeal and the filing of an opinion by the judge presiding at his trial and post-trial proceedings. However, this contention was not set out or suggested by Pounds’ statements of questions involved nor was it adequately developed in the body of his argument. Therefore, we will not consider it. Pa.R.A.P. 2115, 2118. Moreover, were we to consider the issue, the same considerations <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>applicable in the context of a speedy trial claim are applicable to a claimed due process violation based on delays in proceedings.

Nevertheless, the majority then proceeds to ignore the latter part of that description and to misapply the law to the testimony in the instant case. According to appellant’s own testimony, during the crucial hour within which the decedent met his fate, appellant was alone, in or near his automobile, and within ten miles (all of which would be traversed on rural roads) of both where the body was found at decedent’s place of employment and the decedent’s home. This is not an alibi because, even if appellant had traveled to and been where he claimed, he was not so far removed from the scene of the crime as to “render it impossible for him to be the guilty party.” If two persons are in a house and one is found dead in the bedroom, the jury should not be instructed on the alibi defense merely because the other claimed that he never left the kitchen. That is precisely the situation in this case, and it is a misnomer to suggest that appellant’s testimony was in the nature of an alibi. In fact, a fair reading of appellant’s testimony shows it was no more than a general denial of guilt.

(That is, the majority’s simultaneous conclusions that, on the one hand, appellant did not receive a fair trial and, on the other hand, that his rights were <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>not infringed while he was incarcerated for the 30 months this appeal was delayed by the trial judge for no good reason, defy both logic and common sense.)
