On May 8, 1979 appellant petitioned that court to set aside the decree on the ground that her consent to the termination was not intelligently, voluntarily and deliberately given. Following a hearing, the orphans’ court dismissed appellant’s petition on June 18, <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>1979, and this appeal followed.

Around that time appellant had become dissatisfied with M.L.O.’s upbringing, and learned through an acquaintance that appellees would be interested in adopting M.L.O. Appellant met with appellees and their attorney, gave them custody of M.L.O., and agreed to their adoption of M.L.O.</p>
