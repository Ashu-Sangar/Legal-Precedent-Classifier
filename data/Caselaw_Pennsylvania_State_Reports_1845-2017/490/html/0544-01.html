Services normally began at 6:45 a. m. and Abramson arrived early to prepare breakfast for the small congregation. Abramson testified that shortly after 6:30 a. m. two men whom he did not know entered the synagogue. When Abramson asked if he could help them they replied that they just wanted “to see how you pray.” Abramson told them that the service would begin when the others arrived in about fifteen or twenty minutes. Abramson testified that during this conversation both men stared at the large safe located in the synagogue.</p>

By this time approximately eleven congregants had arrived and morning services had begun. The two men were again approached by Abramson and, separately, by another congregant and both times expressed a desire to observe the service. Shortly thereafter, however, as the prayers continued, one of the congregants suddenly began struggling with one of the two men, was pushed away and was shot twice at close range. As he fell, the congregant, Isadore Levin, cried, “He got me . .” The two men fled. Levin was pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital.</p>

In addition, Abramson and several other congregants made in-court identifications of appellant as one of the two men involved, although each witness indicated that appellant was not the man who fired the shots. A local merchant also identified appellant as one of the two men he saw, shortly after 7:00 a. m., riding a bicycle past his store. It was established that this was a route away from the synagogue and toward appellant’s home.</p>

Appellant then narrated to Wharton how he had been in the area on the morning of the killing looking for a way to make some money when he got the idea of holding up the synagogue.

This rule, however, had its origins at a time when co-conspirators were jointly tried. In that circumstance a single jury would hear the evidence of conspiracy and, rightly, would not be permitted to find the evidence sufficient to prove a conspiracy involving only one of those charged. The acquittal rule that developed was thus clearly a rule of verdict consistency. <em>Gardner, </em>supra <a href="/md/286/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="286 Md. 520" data-case-ids="2087429" data-case-paths="/md/286/0520-01">286 Md. at 522-524</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=408%20A.2d%201317" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="408 A.2d 1317">408 A.2d at 1319-20</a>; Developments, supra at 972-74; see e. g., <em>United States v.

Rather it signifies only that the Commonwealth has not proved its case to the satisfaction of the jury. Thus in the present case, different verdicts may well have been due solely to the different composition of the two juries. Alternatively, the difference may have been due to a variety of other circumstances, including a difference in the proof offered at trial. As the Fifth Circuit Court of <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>Appeals has recently explained, “acquittal [of one of the conspirators] could have resulted from a multiplicity of factors completely unrelated to the actual existence of a conspiracy.” <em>United States v.

The present appellant was tried and convicted before his co-conspirator’s acquittal and thus no claim of estoppel is asserted here. Yet this in no way suggests that <em>Brown </em>is inapposite. Rather the permissibility of trying a defendant after a co-defendant has already been acquitted on similar charges presents, if anything, a more difficult question. We note that although alleged principal Smith was acquitted of all charges at his subsequent trial, appellant does not challenge his own convictions of robbery or murder on this basis.</p>

As our prior cases have explained, the reason for the corpus delicti rule is to prevent conviction where no crime has been committed. See e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Turza, </em><a href="/pa/340/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="340 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="1203392" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0128-01">340 Pa. 128</a>, 134, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%20401" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="16 A.2d 401">16 A.2d 401</a>, 404 (1940). Yet there can be no doubt in this case that criminal activity was afoot. Appellant, it should be noted, does not challenge the existence of a corpus delicti for his murder conviction. For there is no question that the corpus delicti of homicide was produced: a death caused by some criminal agency. See <em>Commonwealth v. Ware, </em><a href="/pa/459/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="459 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="480994" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0334-01">459 Pa. 334</a>, 365-67, <a href="/pa/459/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="459 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="480994" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0334-01">329 A.2d 258</a>, 274 (1974). And appellant does not challenge the admission at trial of his statement to Wharton in order to fix the level of the homicide. See <em>Commonwealth v.
