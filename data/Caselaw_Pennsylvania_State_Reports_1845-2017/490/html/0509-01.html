The prior owners, Henry and Ann Cobham, had executed a “release” dated June 16,1881, in favor of the Buffalo, Pittsburgh &amp; Western Railroad Co., and its successors, concerning a strip of land 66 feet wide extending through a portion of appellee’s land. The Buffalo, Pittsburgh &amp; Western laid track and other equipment along this land and operated a railroad thereon for a number of years. The Penn Central Transportation Co., as the successor to the Buffalo, Pittsburgh &amp; Western, abandoned the line in the mid-1960s after the construction of the Kinzua Dam by the federal government. On May 26, 1977, the trustees in bankruptcy for Penn Central conveyed by quit claim deed to appellant all right, title and interest held by Penn Central to the strip of land, although Penn Central reserved the right to salvage the track and other material within six months of the conveyance. Penn Central failed to salvage the track within the six months and appellant began his own salvage operations. Appellee, believing the track and equipment to be hers, sought and obtained an injunction preventing appellant from removing the track and equipment and ordering him to replace and repair that which he already had taken away.</p>
