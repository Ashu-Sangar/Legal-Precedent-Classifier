A pretrial motion to suppress evidence was denied after a hearing and appellant was tried by a jury. Appellant was found guilty and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one and a half to three years. He was ordered to pay a fine of $50.00. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed per curiam.

As a result of this investigation, the police received information from a confidential informant which led them to believe that Deborah Taylor was to receive a shipment of heroin in the evening of February 8, 1975, and would be bringing the shipment into Lancaster. The police obtained a search warrant based upon this information and pursuant thereto conducted a search , of Deborah Taylor’s car. Packets of cocaine were seized from the vehicle and Ms. Taylor was then arrested. Three hours after the arrest, acting upon additional information provided by the informant that purchases of heroin had been made at the Taylor home, the police obtained a second warrant to search that residence. Ms. Taylor accompanied the police to the premises and led them into her home. At this time, appellant was inside Taylor’s home, sitting on a sofa, next to Taylor’s roommate. Upon seeing the police, appellant stood up, made a brisk movement with his hand, and then sat back down on the couch. One of the police detectives immediately walked over to the appellant and found at his feet a handkerchief which contained part of a hypodermic syringe and a “bottle cap cooker”, devices commonly used to administer certain drugs. The detective then noticed an envelope sitting half on and half off a coffee table which was immediately across <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>from the appellant. Discovered in the envelope were eleven aluminum foil packets of a brownish substance which later turned out to be phenobarbital, a Schedule IV substance the possession of<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>'* which is controlled. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 780-104(4)(i)(ll). No controlled substance was otherwise found on appellant’s person, although the police did discover, after a “pat down” search, the other section of the hypodermic syringe which had been found earlier at appellant’s feet. Appellant was arrested for possession with the intent to deliver the phenobarbital.</p>

    <p id="b36-11" data-blocks='[["BL_36.11",36,[286,1915,1141,203]],["BL_37.1",37,[212,297,1146,476]]]'>After the police entered the Taylor residence, the appellant, sitting on the sofa, stood up and made some “motions with his body and hands and [sat] directly back down”. A bottle cap cooker and a hypodermic syringe were found at <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>appellant’s feet. The packets of phenobarbital were discovered half on and half off the coffee table immediately across from the appellant. While the controlled substance was not found on the appellant’s person, when applying the appropriate standard of review,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the appellant’s actions upon the entry of the officers and the close proximity of the contraband to where appellant was in the room, lead us to conclude that the evidence would support an inference that appellant had possessed the substance.</p>
    <p id="b37-5" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[213,810,1145,259]]]'>The Commonwealth’s case, however, falls woefully short of the quantum required to sustain a finding of the second element, intent to deliver. The Commonwealth points to two facts from which it is contended an inference of an intent to deliver may be drawn. We cannot agree.</p>
    <p id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.6",37,[213,1106,1146,962]],["BL_38.1",38,[283,293,1143,477]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that appellant’s response to a question posed by the detective as to the contents of the packets provides a significant insight as to appellant’s intent to deliver the substance. Appellant stated that he believed the substance to be coffee. Admittedly, the substance had the general appearance of coffee. The Commonwealth, however, argues that this apparently innocent observation reflected sinister overtones, since they contend only a distributor would know that coffee may be mixed with phenobarbital to produce a substance which looked like “street heroin” and had the ability to cause a similar hypnotic effect. Even if we accept appellant’s answer as not being prompted by an honest belief, based upon the appearance of the substance, we could not reasonably reach the conclusion that the Commonwealth wishes to draw. First, it stretches the imagination that this process is such a well kept secret that only the actual dispensers, to the exclusion of the regular buyers of drugs and the habitue of this culture, <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>would be aware of the use of coffee to make such a mixture. Second, accepting for the sake of argument the premise that this knowledge revealed the possibility that at some point appellant may have delivered such a substance, logic will not permit us to jump to the further conclusion that he intended to deliver the substance in question, absent some additional evidence reflecting an intent relating specifically to the instant packet with which we are concerned. The record is barren of any such additional evidence.</p>
    <p id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[276,838,1148,1022]]]'>Finally, the Commonwealth cannot rely on the quantity and nature of the articles seized to assist in supporting an inference of an intent to deliver. In certain circumstances, the possession of large quantities of a controlled substance may justifiably suggest an inference of an intent to deliver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
