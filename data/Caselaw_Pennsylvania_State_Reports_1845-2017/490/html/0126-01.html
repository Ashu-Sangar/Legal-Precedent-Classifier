After denying appellant’s post-verdict motions, the court of common pleas suspended sentence on the aggravated assault conviction but imposed sentence of four to ten years imprisonment on the manslaughter conviction and a concurrent sentence of one and one-half to three years on the firearms violations. On appeal, represented by trial counsel, appellant challenged a search warrant authorizing police administration of a “Neutron Activation Analysis” test designed to determine if appellant had fired a weapon.

Among other things, appellant’s pro se petition sought to frame several objections to the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Appellant also contended that the prosecuting attorney improperly deprived appellant of two material witnesses, including the victim’s wife (appellant’s girlfriend) and the mother of the victim, allegedly subpoenaed as a defense witness but told by the prosecuting attorney to disregard the subpoena and “go home.” In his pro se petition, appellant stated his claims were not “finally litigated” or “waived” (see section 3(d) of the PCHA, 19 P.S. § 1180-3(d)) because:</p>

    <p id="A7u" data-blocks='[["BL_161.8",161,[218,1778,1148,455]]]'>Appellant, an indigent, simultaneously requested appointed counsel. The PCHA court granted the request, appointing Public Defender William M. Kern. Appointed counsel, however, did nothing to place appellant’s pro se petition in a proper frame or otherwise amend the pro se allegations. Thus, the Commonwealth answered appellant’s pro se petition, claiming appellant’s contentions were either finally litigated, waived, or frivolous and thus did not require an evidentiary hearing. See PCHA, § 9, 19 P.S. § 1180-9.</p>

After argument, the PCHA court, in October of 1978, filed an opinion summarily rejecting all but one of appellant’s pro se contentions. The court determined that appellant’s claim regarding alleged prosecutorial interference with defense presentation of the victim’s mother did not sufficiently allege what favorable testimony the witness might provide. Accordingly, the PCHA court ordered that</p>

Indeed, no action of record on appellant’s behalf was taken until some ten months after the PCHA court’s order, when in August of 1979 appellant filed an entirely new pro se PCHA petition. This new pro se petition did not respond to the PCHA court’s previous order. Instead, appellant made a new claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to secure attendance of the victim’s mother. Appellant claimed, among other things, that her testimony would have disclosed that the victim was ambidextrous, thus discrediting the Commonwealth’s theory that the victim, allegedly left-handed, could not have had shot himself in the right side of the head. Appellant’s pro se contentions also included a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call two witnesses who would have substantiated appellant’s position that he was shooting firearms at his hunting camp before the neutron activation analysis test was administered. The pro se petition also contained several other allegations of ineffectiveness, nearly all of which mirrored those claims appellant already presented in his original pro se petition.</p>

As to the new ineffectiveness claims the PCHA court stated that it failed to see how testimony of the victim’s mother would provide any useful new testimony that had not already been presented at appellant’s trial.

Here the record is clear that, just as in the proceedings involving appellant’s second petition, appellant was under <em>Fiero </em>uncounselled at proceedings involving his first petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> While appointed counsel did appear at oral argument, counsel failed either to amend appellant’s inarticulate pro se petition or to submit an explanatory brief. And the PCHA court’s opinion disposing of appellant’s first pro se petition in no respect reflects that counsel’s argument clarified or otherwise improved presentation of appellant’s claims. So too, even after the PCHA court granted specific leave to amend appellant’s first pro se petition, appointed counsel did nothing of record. Here, as in <em>Fiero, </em>it must be concluded that appellant had no legally trained counsel to advance his position in acceptable legal terms. See also <em>Commonwealth v.
