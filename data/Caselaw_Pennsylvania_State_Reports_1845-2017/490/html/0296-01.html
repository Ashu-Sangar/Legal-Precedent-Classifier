No post-verdict motions were filed, and prison sentences aggregating ten to twenty years were imposed. No appeal was entered. Subsequently, a pro se motion requesting a modification of sentence was filed nunc pro tunc in the trial court and denied. A <em>pro se </em>Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, § 1 et <em>seq., </em>19 P.S. § 1180-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. 1979-80) [hereinafter: P.C.H.A.], petition was filed, and counsel was appointed. Counsel filed an amended petition which the court dismissed without a hearing. This appeal is from the order denying the P.C.H.A. petition. We now reverse and remand.</p>

We cannot agree.</p>

This is so, inter alia, because an accused has no absolute right to raise baseless claims and counsel cannot be faulted for not advancing issues which will not at least arguably obtain some relief for the accused.</p>

This requirement that counsel protect the appellate right of an accused extends even to circumstances where the appeal is “totally without merit.” <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em><a href="/pa/464/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="464 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="1710335" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0272-01">464 Pa. 272</a>, 275, <a href="/pa/464/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="464 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="1710335" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0272-01">346 A.2d 554</a>, 555 (1975).

Of course, this, in itself, does not dispose of the instant appeal for counsel cannot be faulted for failing to file an appeal if Wilkerson effectively waived his right to appeal. Hence, we must review the P.C.H.A. court’s order denying relief without a hearing in light of Wilkerson’s allegations and the record.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[276,745,1149,735]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v. Sherard, </em>supra, we reiterated that a P.C.H.A. petition may not be summarily dismissed when the facts alleged in the petition, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. Wilkerson alleged counsel was ineffective in not filing an appeal because “correspondence indicates that [he] wanted an appeal and that he took steps to perfect an appeal on his own.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Clearly, if, as alleged, Wilkerson wished to appeal and counsel merely failed to file an appeal and an <em>Anders </em>brief, if appropriate, Wilkerson did not effectively waive his right and counsel would have to be deemed ineffective. Accordingly, the facts alleged, if proven, would warrant relief and the court should have granted a hearing and given Wilkerson the opportunity to prove he advised counsel of a desire to appeal.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[275,1500,1146,201]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that Wilkerson’s allegations are contradicted by the record which also demonstrates that Wilkerson effectively waived his right to appeal. The record reveals the following:</p>

Following the jury’s verdict, the trial court advised Wilkerson, inter alia, that he could file post-verdict motions; that, if they were adversely decided, he would be sentenced and could then appeal; that, if no motions were filed, he would be sentenced and could still appeal although the issues would be strictly limited; that he had a right to counsel and free counsel if he was unable to pay; that the court hoped private counsel would continue to represent him, but, if <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>counsel did not, Wilkerson should contact the public defender. Trial counsel then stated that he would confer with Wilkerson regarding his rights but that, in his opinion, no trial error occurred.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[215,550,1148,741]]]'>At sentencing on August 24, 1978, the trial court mentioned to trial counsel that post-verdict motions had not been filed. Counsel indicated he had advised Wilkerson that no basis for appeal existed and Wilkerson indicated he had been so advised. The court then advised Wilkerson, inter alia, that he could petition for modification of sentence; that such a petition would have to be filed within ten days; that he had the right to assistance of counsel to seek modification; that free counsel would be appointed if necessary; that he had a right of appeal; that a petition to modify would not toll the thirty-day appeal period; and, that, since post-verdict motions were not filed, the issues available on appeal would be limited but the validity of the sentences could be challenged.</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[217,1309,1148,366]]]'>On September 11, 1978, Wilkerson filed a pro se petition dated September 5, 1978 in which he requested the notes of testimony “for the purpose of filing, or perfecting an appeal to the court through the post conviction hearing act.” On September 12, 1978, the court entered an order directing that the notes be provided for use on appeal or for post-conviction purposes.</p>

The first part stated reasons the court should hear the modification of sentence petition out of time and included allegations that he believed counsel withdrew his representation after sentencing because counsel concluded no basis for appeal existed; that he was without counsel and was not capable of preparing an adequate petition; that he had sent a letter to the public defender seeking counsel to represent him in post-verdict motions and on appeal; that he had sent a letter to the clerk of the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas asking the trial court to appoint counsel to file an appeal; that he sent <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>a letter to the Supreme Court to preserve his appellate rights; and, that, given the absence of counsel, his modification petition should be heard out of time. The second part stated reasons the sentence should be modified. The court entered an order stating “AND NOW, September 21, 1978, defendant’s petition for modification of sentence is denied.” Given the order, the court apparently considered the petition for modification of sentence on its merits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
