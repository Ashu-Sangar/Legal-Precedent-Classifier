Instructions with respect to included offenses in such cases might well be an invitation to the jury to return a compromise or otherwise unwarranted verdict. Cf. <em>People v.

The submission of an included crime is justified only where there is some basis in the evidence for finding the defendant innocent of the crime charged and yet guilty of the included crime. <em>People v. Mussenden, supra. </em>The presence of such evidence is the determinative factor. For example, if the prosecutor’s evidence tends to show a completed robbery and there is no conflicting evidence relating to elements of the crime charged, a contention that the jury might accept the prosecution’s evidence in part and might reject it in part ought not to be sufficient. See <em>State v.

As a consequence, charging the jury on extraneous offenses in homicide trials would be inapposite and detrimental to the sound administration of justice.

It is thus necessary to select an approach to instructing the jury on lesser-included offenses which, while taking into consideration the relationship between the evidence and the requested instruction, ensures that the accused’s right to a fair trial will be well protected. To this end and to <em>finally </em>clarify this situation, we now hold that in a murder prosecution, an involuntary manslaughter charge shall be given only when requested, and where the offense has been made an issue in the case and the trial evidence reasonably would support such a verdict.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.5",217,[235,1027,1148,852]]]'>Having articulated the standard, we turn now to the evidence presented at trial. The uncontradicted evidence of the Commonwealth established that on January 19, 1977, appellant, co-felon Eughenia Jones, and three other men were riding in a car when it was decided that they would rob Taylor’s Variety Store. The impetus for this decision was appellant’s mortgage payment having come due, and Taylor’s Variety Store was selected because appellant believed the manager dealt in drugs. The five men entered the store and found the manager in the back room. Appellant and Eughenia Jones then remained in the back room with the manager while the other three men stationed themselves at the front door and the entrance to the back room. Appellant instructed the manager to lay down so that he could be searched and, after he had done so, Jones took his watch and ring.</p>
    <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[234,1897,1148,473]],["BL_218.1",218,[260,306,1144,97]]]'>It is here that the evidence conflicts. While the manager was on the ground being searched, a .38 caliber revolver was pressed against the back of his head. This weapon discharged and killed the manager after the watch and ring were taken, but it is unclear as to whether appellant or Jones was holding it at the time. The Commonwealth placed appellant’s statement into evidence wherein appellant stated that he shot the manager accidentally. Appellant, however, placed Eughenia Jones’ statement into evidence <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>wherein he also admitted to firing the fatal shot.

    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[258,428,1147,804]]]'>This conflict is, however, of no moment and completely irrelevant to the instant question. By either the Commonwealth’s or the defense’s version of the occurrences, appellant and Jones were engaged in an armed robbery at the time of the shooting. At minimum, this constitutes murder of the second degree, and that result obtains regardless of whether the revolver was discharged by appellant or Jones, intentionally or accidentally. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502(b) and <em>Commonwealth v. Yuknavich, </em><a href="/pa/448/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="448 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1944677" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0502-01">448 Pa. 502</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=295%20A.2d%20290" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="295 A.2d 290">295 A.2d 290</a> (1972). Thus, if the jury found that appellant participated in the instant acts, it could not rationally acquit him of murder and find him guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The trial court did not, therefore, err in refusing appellant’s request for a jury instruction on that offense. Consequently, the judgments of sentence are affirmed.</p>

Those issues raised by appellant which we find to be without merit and not requiring in-depth analysis are: 1) the trial court erred in permitting the wife of the deceased to testify, as she was eight months pregnant at the time; 2) the suppression court erred in finding appellant’s waiver of constitutional rights valid; 3) the suppression court erred in not finding that appellant’s statements to the police were the product of unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment; and 4) the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial on the basis of prejudicial and inflammatory remarks made by the prosecutor during summation.</p>

This attempted “clarification,” supported by nothing more than the majority’s assertion, wholly disregards the clear language of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2501(a).
