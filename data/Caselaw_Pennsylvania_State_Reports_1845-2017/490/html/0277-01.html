Lovette challenge the order of the Commonwealth Court upholding the State Dental Council and Examining Board’s suspension of their licenses. Appellants contend that insufficient evidence appears of record to support a finding of knowledge or intent to defraud Pennsylvania Blue Shield by submission of false claims. We agree with appellants and reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Clinic, owned solely by Dr. Richard Miller, provided oral surgery care to patients referred by general practitioners in that area. Many of the Clinic’s patients were covered by Pennsylvania Blue Shield dental insurance policies. Thus, the Clinic received reimbursements from Blue Shield for such services. Appellants, as salaried <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>employees, were not directly affected financially by the amount of reimbursement the Clinic received.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[237,439,1148,731]]]'>Because the Clinic received reimbursements in excess of $10,000 for the years 1969, 1970, and 1971, Blue Shield reviewed Clinic records to determine the accuracy of the claims presented. Of approximately 30,000 claims submitted by the Clinic during this three year period, investigation of four hundred files disclosed only twelve possible false claims. Blue Shield contacted the referring dentists and obtained their “bite wing” x-rays, taken of the twelve patients prior to surgery at the Clinic. From these x-rays, Blue Shield concluded that appellants performed surgical removal of erupted teeth and then submitted claims to Blue Shield for removal of impacted teeth. Surgical removal of impacted, but not erupted, teeth was covered under the dental insurance plans.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[246,705,1152,879]]]'>The Commonwealth Court recognized that “[w]hile [Dr. Miller] may have benefited from the fruits of the fraud, unless he knew of it and participated in it, he cannot be guilty of fraudulent or unlawful practices or fraudulent misleading or deceptive representations.” So too, we believe this analysis is equally applicable to appellants’ case. The Commonwealth Court found no evidence that Dr. Miller ever signed any of the claim forms submitted to Blue Shield. For that reason, the court determined that Dr. Miller lacked knowledge of the fraudulent practice. Likewise, it must be concluded that there is insufficient evidence of appellants’ knowledge of fraudulent practices. Although appellants’ “signatures” do appear on these twelve claim forms, those “signatures” were affixed only by rubber stamp. Actual knowledge of wrongdoing or intent to defraud cannot be presumed on this basis.</p>
