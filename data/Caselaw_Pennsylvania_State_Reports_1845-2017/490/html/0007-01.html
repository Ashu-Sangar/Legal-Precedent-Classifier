A jury convicted appellant of receiving stolen property, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3925, misapplication of entrusted property and property of government institutions, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4113, tampering with a witness, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4907, and criminal conspiracy, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 903.</p>

In January of 1975, appellant purchased the Case hi-lift in question from a gambling acquaintance, one “Rags” Rogozan, an employee of PennDot who was not authorized to sell such equipment. The purchase price was $500.00 plus the cancellation of a $400.00 gambling debt Rogozan owed appellant, which purchase price was substantially less than half the fair market value of the hi-lift. The day Rogozan delivered the hi-lift — bearing PennDot markings and paint — to appellant at the Sheraton Inn in West Middlesex,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> two men, at appellant’s behest, took the hi-lift to an airport hangar to make some minor repairs, to steam-clean, and to paint it a different color.</p>
    <p id="b41-6" data-blocks='[["BL_41.6",41,[227,1416,1145,203]]]'>This accomplished, the hi-lift was then brought back to the Inn, where it remained until April of 1975. At that time, appellant resold the hi-lift to Mr. Stephen Levitt of the American International Coal Company, for $2,500.00.</p>
    <p id="b41-7" data-blocks='[["BL_41.7",41,[227,1650,1145,522]]]'>When appellant became aware, in July of 1975, that an investigation into the theft of the hi-lift was underway, he initiated a “cover-up” of his part of the transaction. This “cover-up” included requesting one witness to refrain from testifying,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> requesting Mr. Levitt to destroy the cancelled check for $2,500.00 (used to purchase the hi-lift) as well as his bank’s microfilm record of the check, and a request that Mr. Levitt “dump” the hi-lift in the river. This evidence was sufficient to prove appellant’s guilt of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

      <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>Appellant next argues that he received ineffective representation by his trial counsel, because of an asserted conflict of interests. The circumstances surrounding these assertions are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[263,540,1143,454]]]'>In May of 1975, James Joiner was helping appellant load the hi-lift onto a flat-bed truck at the Sheraton Inn for delivery to American International. Present at the Inn were Mr. Joiner, a Russell Reed, appellant, and appellant’s trial counsel, James Joseph. Mr. Joiner overheard a remark about a “hot something,” but did not hear the entire conversation or the context in which the remark was made. Counsel was seated in appellant’s car when this remark was made.</p>
    <p id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.6",42,[262,1022,1144,305]]]'>On July 16, 1975, after appellant became aware of the investigation, he met with Messers. Levitt and Reed at a parking lot in Pittsburgh. At this time, appellant discussed with Levitt the possibility of destroying the check, and of obtaining the microfilm record of the check from the bank and destroying it. Levitt declined.</p>
    <p id="b42-7" data-blocks='[["BL_42.7",42,[260,1346,1145,783]]]'>Immediately thereafter, appellant arranged a meeting between Levitt, Reed and himself at attorney Joseph’s Pittsburgh office, located minutes away. At this meeting, the discussion focused on Mr. Levitt’s anticipated testimony when and if he was subpoenaed by a grand jury. Levitt testified appellant admitted at this meeting that he purchased the hi-lift from Rogozan in payment of a gambling debt. Mr. Levitt also testified there was no attempt at that meeting to influence his testimony, or to fabricate an explanation for the hi-lift transaction. At trial, counsel twice attempted to place into record the advice which he gave to appellant and Levitt at the July 16th meeting by asking Mr. Reed and appellant what had been said. Twice his attempts were thwarted by timely hearsay objections. Notes of Testimony, r. 1033a and r. 1110a.</p>

Appellant had initially requested Mr. Levitt to pay him in cash. When Mr. Levitt responded he would have to pay by check, appellant <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>agreed to accept the check, but he instructed Levitt not to put his (appellant’s) name on the check as payee. Instead, Mr. Levitt was to leave the payee blank and to deliver the check to appellant’s attorney’s office and “they would make it out to whomever it was to go to.” Notes of Testimony, r. 543a, r. 555a-r. 557a. When the cancelled check was returned from the bank, Mr. Joseph’s office had completed it by filling in the name of another attorney, George Ewing, as payee.</p>

If, on the other hand, counsel’s testimony would have tended to incriminate appellant, then under the circumstances presented here it would also have tended to impli<a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>cate counsel — obviously this situation would create a conflict preventing or substantially hindering, counsel from providing the “zealous advocacy to which appellant is entitled.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Gatewood, </em><a href="/pa-super/221/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="221 Pa. Super. 399" data-case-ids="800275" data-case-paths="/pa-super/221/0399-01">221 Pa.Super. 399</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=293%20A.2d%2080" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="293 A.2d 80">293 A.2d 80</a> (1972). Here, the record is clear that, despite any ethical considerations, retained counsel knowingly chose not to testify on appellant’s behalf. And appellant in no way even suggests either that he was unaware of his right to call retained counsel as a witness or that retained counsel declined such a request. Hence, unlike the majority, I would affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming judgment of sentence.</p>

The majority first speculates that counsel possessed information which <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>may have exculpated the client. Counsel has not testified to this fact nor has appellant asserted that this was the case. In any event, it is obvious that whatever information trial counsel may have been privy to, neither he nor his client was anxious to have it offered during the course of the trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

    <p id="b47-5" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[225,611,1147,682]]]'>Absent a showing that counsel possessed facts which would have been of benefit to the defense, and that testimony could not be and was not introduced because of the attorney-client relationship, there is no basis for concluding a conflict existed resulting in the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The alternative hypothesis of the majority is equally specious. Assuming arguendo, that trial counsel shared some guilty knowledge with appellant, I find it difficult to jump from that premise to the conclusion that counsel’s zeal in his client’s behalf would necessarily be diminished. To the contrary, such an affinity would be likely to provide an increased desire to achieve a favorable result for the client.</p>
    <p id="b47-6" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[228,1326,1145,420]]]'>Since the majority has seen fit to refer to the “further erosion of dwindling public confidence in our legal system” (Slip opinion, page 7), if such a trend is present, and I do not accept that it exists, decisions such as this would provide some justification for that loss of confidence. In my opinion allocatur should not have been granted in this case since the issues were properly decided below and the appeal should be dismissed as improvidently granted.</p>

The majority attempts to bolster its fantasy by directing attention to counsel’s efforts to elicit during trial from a Mr. Reed and appellant certain advice counsel had given to his client in the course of a conference. This testimony was properly excluded as hearsay. This “significant incident” ignores that counsel’s evidence as to what he said on that occasion, if offered, <em>would also have been subject to the same objection. </em>Nor can we conclude from this that counsel possessed knowledge of the facts of the case which might have substantially aided his client’s cause.</p>
