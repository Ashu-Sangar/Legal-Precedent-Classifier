The test to be applied is whether the Commonwealth engaged in either intentional or bad faith “overreaching.” <em>Commonwealth v. Starks, </em><a href="/pa/490/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="490 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1763769" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0336-01">490 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="490 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1763769" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0336-01">416 A.2d 498</a> (1980). In our view, reference to a polygraph examination in the instant case does not rise to either level of overreaching. Instantly, the prosecutor, in the heat of legal argument and responding to a question from the Court, informed the Court that the witness in question had taken a polygraph examination. The trial court recognized this misconduct as error and granted appellant a mistrial. In our view, however, this type of prosecutorial misconduct, although erroneous, does not require the extreme sanction of barring retrial of appellant. Appellant’s argument is thus without merit.</p>
