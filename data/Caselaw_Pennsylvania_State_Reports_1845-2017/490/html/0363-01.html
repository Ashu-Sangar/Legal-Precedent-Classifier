The case arose on the petition of the child’s father seeking custody of his daughter Carla. Carla, then eleven years old, had been living with her maternal grandmother. The court of common pleas denied the father’s petition and awarded custody of Carla to her grandmother. On appeal the Superior Court reversed, hold<a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>ing that the trial court, in failing to give the parent-child relationship sufficient consideration, did not apply the proper legal standard.

    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[269,1269,1147,626]]]'>The Superior Court in <em>In re Hernandez </em>distinguished three types of custody disputes, those between parents, those between a parent or parents and the state, and those between a parent or parents and a third party. As the court noted, in disputes between parents we have long been guided by the controlling statutory direction to award custody with “regard first being had” to the relative fitness of the contesting parents and “the best interest and permanent welfare” of the child. Act of June 26, 1895, P.L. 316, § 2, 48 P.S. § 92. Thus in such cases the burden of proof is shared equally by the contestants and the child’s well-being is the focus of consideration.</p>

And in these cases also our Legislature has established clear guidelines and procedures. Here either the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301 et seq., or the Child Protective Services Law, 11 P.S. § 2201 et seq. are controlling. Yet the Juvenile Act has as its first express purpose: “To preserve the unity of the family whenever <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>possible,” § 6301(b)(1) and thus permits state-enforced custody only when a child is found delinquent or dependent as defined by the Act. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302. Likewise, the Child Protective Services Law permits protective custody only in cases of abuse, defined in relevant part as “serious physical or mental injury.” 11 Pa.C.S. § 2203.</p>

Here we have neither the inevitability of family dissolution which attends a custody dispute between parents, nor a showing that state intervention is required to protect or rehabilitate the child. And as the Superior Court has correctly recognized, we are not guided in such cases by any similar legislative direction. Thus, in seeking an appropriate standard for the adjudication of such disputes, the Superior Court carefully and thoroughly reviewed prior decisions in this Commonwealth. The court then ultimately relied upon a number of prior decisions holding that parents have a “prima facie right to custody,” which “may be forfeited if convincing reasons appear that the best interests of the child will be served by awarding custody to someone else.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Thus, even before the proceedings start, the evidentiary scale is tipped, and tipped hard, to the parents’ side. What the judge must do, therefore, is first, hear all evidence relevant to the child’s best interest, and then, decide whether the evidence on behalf of the third party is weighty <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>enough to bring the scale up to even, and down on the third party’s side.”</blockquote>

Clearly these principles do not preclude an award of custody to the non-parent. Rather they simply instruct the hearing judge that the non-parent bears the burden of production and the burden of persuasion and that the non-parent’s burden is heavy.</p>
    <p id="b400-7" data-blocks='[["BL_400.6",400,[258,823,1148,943]]]'>No doubt in some instances the best interests of the child are served by awarding custody to a non-parent. Experience has taught the unhappy lesson that the parental relationship is not an infallible guarantee that the parent will provide the care and concern essential to a child’s proper development. Thus our Legislature has enacted those procedures already mentioned which allow the state to intervene in instances of delinquency, deprivation or abuse. In addition the Legislature has established express procedures to terminate parental rights in cases of refusal or failure to perform parental duties or in cases of repeated and continued incapacity, abuse or neglect. See Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, art. Ill, § 311, 1 P.S. § 311. Such a termination, however, must rest on a demonstration of unfitness or disinterest, and in such a case we are guided by a specific legislative judgment as to when those rights normally resulting from the fact of biological parenthood should be severed.</p>
    <p id="b400-8" data-blocks='[["BL_400.7",400,[256,1797,1146,576]],["BL_401.1",401,[222,336,1147,205]]]'>As we have indicated, however, in custody cases such as the present one, no such legislative judgment guides us, and often neither party is demonstrably unfit to act as custodian. In such circumstances the proper judgment as to which custody arrangement will serve the child’s best interest is likely to be less obvious and more subject to the discretion of the hearing judge. We do not question the ability of the judges of our courts of common pleas to reach fair and workable determinations. Nevertheless, we believe the rule we adopt today reflects the important need for restraint in an area where the judiciary should proceed with <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>the utmost caution. Thus where circumstances do not clearly indicate the appropriateness of awarding custody to a non-parent, we believe the less intrusive and hence the proper course is to award custody to the parent or parents.</p>

At the time of the hearing in this case, Carla, then eleven years old, had been living with her grandmother since she was less than two years old. Carla had developed stable and happy relationships with her grandmother, with neighborhood friends and, importantly, at school. In these circumstances we are unwilling now to disturb the trial court’s order granting custody of Carla to her grandmother.</p>

Therefore, the Superior Court reversed the hearing court and, finding *o convincing reason for overcoming a “presumption” favoring the parent, awarded custody to appellee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The governing principle heretofore applicable to resolution of custody disputes <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>between parents and third parties has become well established: parents have been “presumed” to merit custody absent convincing or compelling contraindications that such would not be in the best interests of their children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The legitimacy of determining custody by means of such a presumption is questionable.

Instead, we believe that our courts should inquire into the circumstances and relationships of all the parties involved and reach a determination based solely upon the facts of the case before the Court.” The same reasoning should apply where the custody dispute is between parents and third parties.</p>

Furthermore, it was founded on the premise that the affection flowing between those standing in the relationship of child and natural parent surpasses that existing between a child and any other person. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Children's Aid Society v. Gard, </em><a href="/pa/362/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="362 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="477325" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0085-01">362 Pa. 85</a>, 95, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20300" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="66 A.2d 300">66 A.2d 300</a>, 305 (1949). Nevertheless, the underlying tenor of the “presumption” reflects an archaic concept that children are <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>proprietary assets of parents. Serious question may be posed with respect to the soundness of the apriorism that mere biological relationship assures solicitude, care, devotion, and love for one’s offspring. Certainly, when such closeness exists, parenthood would be a strong factor to be prominently weighed in determining a child’s best interest, since effective parental affiliation is in itself of value to a child. However, where a third party better fulfills these needs, or where other circumstances indicate third party custody to be preferable, the courts, when exercising judgment as to a child’s welfare, should not be restrained solely by a presumption.</p>
    <p id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.5",405,[228,966,1148,636]]]'>The opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts well notes that the “fundamental issue is the best interest of the child” and that “the parent-child relationship should be considered to be of importance in determining which custody arrangement is in the child’s best interest”, but does not clearly identify the standard to be applied as solely that of the child’s best interest. The opinion quite properly proclaims that “special weight” and “deference” should be accorded the parent-child relationship, and that the relationship should not be disturbed “without some showing of harm” or unless circumstances “clearly indicate the appropriateness of awarding custody to a non-parent.”</p>

Indeed, Mr. Justice Roberts cites with approval a view that “parents have a ‘prima facie <em>right </em>to custody,’ which will be forfeited only if <em>‘convincing </em>reasons’ appear that the child’s best interest will be served by an award to the third party.” (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Hernandez, </em><a href="/pa-super/249/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="249 Pa.
