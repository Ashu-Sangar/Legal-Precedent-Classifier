One witness testified that at approximately 10:00 p. m. while in a bar with appellant, he stated he intended to kill his wife. Later, during the same evening, appellant repeated his intention to kill his wife. Appellant arrived home from the bar approximately 2:45 a. m., the morning of June 22. At about 3:30 in the morning, appellant’s son awoke and heard his mother crying, “You’re going to kill me.” Appellant’s reply was, “That’s what I mean to do.” At about 5:00 in the morning neighbors heard Mrs. Gordon say, “I can’t stand the pain any longer.” Appellant continued beating his wife until between 5:30 and 6:00 that morning when a neighbor, looking out a window, saw the victim, with appellant behind her, fall to the road. Mrs. Gordon’s partially clad body was later found. The pathologist’s post mortem report indicated Mrs. Gordon died of <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>“cardio-respiratory failure due to subdural hematoma and brain stem hemorrhage due to blunt trauma to the head.” She was bruised throughout most of her body; had multiple rib fractures and one lung was fully lacerated, producing hemorrhages caused by a broken rib hitting the lung.</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[263,606,1146,565]]]'>On December 6, 1978 appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of murder generally. After a degree of guilt hearing on December 18,1978, appellant was adjudged guilty of murder of the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Subsequently, appellant filed a “post verdict and post sentencing motion for a new hearing and motion in arrest of judgment” arguing that given the amount of evidence tending to show appellant’s intoxicated state, the court could properly have convicted appellant of only murder of the third degree. From the denial of this motion, appellant now appeals.</p>

Although he had been drinking, we conclude that his drinking did not deprive him of the ability to form the intent to kill, that this intent to kill — started before the episode began, repeated during it, and manifested by the degree of brutality and the ignoring of his wife’s pleas to desist — continued throughout the episode. There is nothing to suggest that to kill her, if he intended to, he would have sought out a gun or some weapon. He chose to beat her to death.</blockquote>
