    <p id="b118-16" data-blocks='[["BL_118.17",118,[254,2133,1147,204]]]'>This is an appeal from a decree entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County, Orphans’ Court Division, ordering the involuntary termination of appellant’s parental rights with respect to her minor child, L.A.G.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[236,307,1147,634]]]'>
      <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>On November 22, 1978, a petition was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County, Orphans’ Court Division, by the Clearfield County Children and Youth Services, appellee herein, seeking the involuntary termination of the parental rights of M.G.B., appellant herein and the child’s natural mother, with respect to L.A.G. A hearing was held on the petition on February 15, 1979. On April 5, 1979, a decree nisi was entered granting the petition. Exceptions were filed and argued. On May 31, 1979, the Orphans’ Court entered a final decree dismissing appellant’s exceptions and terminating her parental rights. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[237,958,1146,473]]]'>The facts are as follows: L.A.G. was born on April 1,1973, and is the natural daughter of appellant. During 1975 L.A.G. resided with appellant and appellant’s boyfriend, now appellant’s husband, in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. In February, 1976, appellant voluntarily placed L.A.G. in the custody of appellee, Clearfield County Children and Youth Services, following an investigation by appellee of reported child abuse. In May, 1976, appellant and her present husband moved to Benton, Marshall County, Kentucky.</p>
    <p id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[236,1451,1148,630]]]'>From February, 1976 through December, 1977, appellant maintained contact both with appellee and with her daughter: she communicated with appellee concerning L.A.G. on ten occasions, seven telephone calls and three letters, and visited L.A.G. six times. Late in 1977, appellee broached the possibility of placing L.A.G. in a foster home in Kentucky in order to facilitate visitation by appellant and to lay a foundation for the eventual return of custody to her. Appellant refused to entertain such a proposal, insisting that L.A.G. be returned only to her. Appellee advised appellant to engage an attorney should she intend to pursue a claim for custody.</p>

At the conference appellant indicated her desire to regain custody of L.A.G.; she was informed that both she and her husband would be <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>required to receive psychological counseling regarding their duties and responsibilities toward their children, and both were given six months to obtain such counseling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Also on December 28, 1977, appellant visited with L.A.G. for approximately one hour.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[271,583,1147,419]]]'>From December 28, 1977, until the filing of the instant petition on November 22, 1978, appellant had had no contact and made no communication with either appellee or her daughter, L.A.G. Appellant has made no attempt to undergo the counseling ordered by the Orphans’ Court. Although represented by counsel, appellant has not personally or by her attorney, made any claim for custody; nor has she inquired after the welfare of her child.</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.6",120,[268,1026,1148,363]]]'>On January 7, March 10, April 18, May 22 and July 14, 1978, appellee wrote to appellant for information concerning her desire to regain custody of L.A.G. No reply was made to any of the letters, although the last four were by certified mail and were receipted for by appellant. During this eleven-month period, no support was provided for L.A.G. by appellant.</p>

    <p id="b121-6" data-blocks='[["BL_121.6",121,[213,652,1148,313]]]'>Our standard of review in cases of involuntary termination of parental rights is well settled: we will not reverse a decree of the Orphans’ Court if the decree is supported by competent evidence. <em>In re Adoption of Baby Boy P., </em><a href="/pa/479/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="479 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1742110" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0138-01">479 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="479 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1742110" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0138-01">387 A.2d 873</a> (1978).

    <p id="b121-7" data-blocks='[["BL_121.7",121,[213,996,1147,313]]]'>Appellant’s single argument raises, essentially, three specific claims. First, appellant asserts the record does not support a finding that she evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to her child. Since the Orphans’ Court made no such finding, appellant’s argument in this regard is irrelevant.</p>
    <p id="b121-8" data-blocks='[["BL_121.8",121,[213,1362,1147,311]]]'>Second, appellant argues the record does not support a finding that she failed or refused to perform her parental duties. The evidence adduced at the hearing, recounted above and uncontradicted by appellant, clearly supports the determination of the Orphans’ Court. Appellant’s argument to the contrary is without merit.</p>
