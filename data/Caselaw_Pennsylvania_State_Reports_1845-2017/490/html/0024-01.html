Dr. Ramik’s reports thus concluded appellant “is incompetent to manage her own affairs.” Proper notice was given and the court issued a rule on appellant to show cause why she should not be adjudged incompetent and a guardian should not be appointed.

The parties’ agreement on the applicable standard of proof in applications for an adjudication of incompetency is well-founded. As long ago as <em>Bryden Estate, </em>supra, this Court, in adopting the opinion of the orphans’ court in that case, stated that “[ajpplications of this nature are not to be encouraged, and should not be granted except in a clear case.” Accord, <em>Colt's Case, </em><a href="/pa/215/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="215 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="948265" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0333-01">215 Pa. 333</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.%20597" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="64 A. 597">64 A. 597</a> (1906).

Cf. <em>Elliott v.

It must be emphasized that neither our holding nor the holding of the orphans’ court in any respect permanently forecloses appellant from personally managing her own property. Appellant is free to seek a subsequent adjudication of competency, 20 Pa.C.S. § 5517, which is to be granted if she establishes her competency by a “fair preponderance” of the evidence.
