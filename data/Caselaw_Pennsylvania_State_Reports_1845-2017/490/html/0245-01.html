Although the Dapps testified at appellant’s preliminary hearing, they failed to appear at trial despite having been served with Commonwealth subpoenas.

Counsel, however, never requested a continuance to secure the Dapp’s presence at trial.</p>

At the hearing held pursuant to the petition, appellant’s trial counsel testified that he had not subpoenaed the Dapps because both had been served with a subpoena issued by the Commonwealth. When Mr. and Mrs. Dapp failed to appear, to the surprise of both the Commonwealth and the defense, the District Attorney sent members of his staff to find the pair. Shortly thereafter, it was learned that the Dapps were out of state on vacation. As it was the next to the last day of the criminal division trial term in York County, appellant’s trial counsel realized that a continuance would, in all probability, be denied. Counsel thus considered that his best alternative would be to read into the record the testimony of Mr. Dapp from appellant’s preliminary hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As trial counsel testified on cross examination:</p>

[and] may well have been sufficient to convince the jury that the crime did not rise to murder of the first degree.” Majority opinion at 453 n. 1. Moreover, trial counsel admitted at the PCHA hearing, in testimony quoted by the majority, that when Mr. Dapp did not appear at trial, trial counsel concluded that he could not seek a continuance in order to obtain the missing witness’s appearance because of his own failure to subpoena Mr. Dapp. Though counsel did try to make the best of a bad situation by introducing the testimony given by Mr. Dapp at the preliminary hearing, there is no doubt, as trial counsel’s testimony indicates, that this witness’s appearance at trial was crucial to appellant’s defense. Because trial counsel’s own neglect prevented him from effecting his own fundamental trial strategy, I must conclude that counsel was ineffective. Accordingly, I would grant appellant a new trial.</p>
