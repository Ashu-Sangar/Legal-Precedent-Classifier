The donee’s will was probated in Iowa, where an Iowa probate court held that the power of appointment was validly exercised. We agree with the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County that this determination of the Iowa court may not be relitigated in or disturbed by a Pennsylvania court.

The Iowa District Court for Jasper County ordered that notice of the proceedings on the petition for construction be given to those persons designated in Paragraph Fifth (4) of Matthew McMullin’s will to take in the event the power of appointment was not validly exercised.

Objections were filed by appellants Ottomer McMullin, Hazel Burnett, Charlotta Platt and Joy McMullin Jones, takers under the will of Matthew McMullin in default of the exercise of the power by Leona McMullin. After a hearing, the claims of appellants were denied by a decree dated July 12, 1979. Exceptions to the decree were filed, and the matter argued before the court en banc.

Here, the donor directed that the donee transfer the principal of the trust “by her Last Will and Testament.” The only condition imposed by the donor on the exercise of the power by donee was “specific references to this Will and to the power herein granted.” There is no indication that the donor intended that the validity of the donee’s “Last Will and Testament” be determined by a Pennsylvania court or by any particular <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>court. Absent any express restriction on the donee, it is reasonable to presume that the donor intended the power to be exercised by a document determined to be the valid last will and testament of the donee according to the law of the state where the will is duly probated. For it is the law of the donee-testator’s domicile which governs the validity of the will.</p>

As previously indicated, although appellants were given notice of the petition to construe the will, they chose not to appear or interpose any objection at the appropriate time in the Iowa proceeding.
