Because it is often difficult to prove a common law marriage, the law has created a rebuttable presumption of marriage where two absolutely essential elements co-exist, namely, constant cohabitation and general, as distinguished from partial or divided, reputation of marriage. <em>Manfredi Estate, </em><a href="/pa/399/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="399 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1290587" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0285-01">399 Pa. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="159 A.2d 697">159 A.2d 697</a> (1960). Instantly, the record does not reveal any evidence of constant cohabitation and general reputation; accordingly, no such presumption of common law marriage has been established.</p>
