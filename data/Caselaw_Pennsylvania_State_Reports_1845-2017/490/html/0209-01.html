It is in fact the cost of the loan (or finance charge) that is often determinative from the borrower’s perspective. This information goes to the very heart of the bargain and, if not properly set forth, the borrower’s position is weakened, his choice made with less than adequate information, and good faith which lies at the foundation of all commercial transactions is offended. Often the debtor does not know of the improper disclosure until the creditor’s action forces legal <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>assistance. The superior position of the lender in today’s market may cause a consumer to be so elated over the ability to obtain the loan proceeds, that detailed analysis of the cost if not properly disclosed would be inadvertently overlooked. Further, a fear that the loan may be “called in” after a period of faithful payments or of the lender’s hostile retaliation often renders the debtor incapable of initiating the action. Finally, by allowing the statute of limitation to preclude a TILA counterclaim, instead of encouraging prompt action on claims, we would ironically “discourage creditors from prompt vindication of their contractural rights.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Thus, the TILA counterclaim, asserted in such a situation, becomes purely defensive in nature, “founded upon an equitable reason, inhering in the same transaction,” which explains “why the plaintiff’s claim in equity and good conscience should be reduced.” <em>Pennsylvania R.

The purpose of such statutes is to keep stale litigation out of the courts. They are aimed at lawsuits, not at the consideration of particular issues in lawsuits. Here the action was already in court and held to have been brought in time. To use the statute of limitations to cut off the consideration of a particular defense in the case is quite foreign to the policy of preventing the commencement of stale litigation. We think it would be incongruous to hold that once a lawsuit is properly before the court, decision must be made without consideration of all the issues in the case and without the benefit of all the applicable law. If this litigation is not stale, then no issue in it can be deemed stale.</blockquote>
