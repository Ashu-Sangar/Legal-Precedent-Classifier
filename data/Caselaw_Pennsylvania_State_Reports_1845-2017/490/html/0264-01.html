By order of January 15, 1974, the PUC allocated the expenses of the project as follows:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), forty percent (40%) to be paid by the City, and ten percent (10%) to be paid by Allegheny County. Payments to the City were to be made when and as certified by the PUC. Certification occurred on October 30, 1974, and costs totalling $667,139.00 were allocated to PennDOT.</p>

However, on February 14, 1975, PennDOT petitioned the PUC to open the record challenging certain items billed by the City, namely costs incurred before August 17, 1972 and engineering and inspection costs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After a hearing on May 8, 1975, the PUC clarified its order of January 15, 1974 and issued a modified certification on July 21, 1976. This time costs of $655,731.00 were allocated to PennDOT. This sum reflected a reduction equal to sums expended by the City before August 17,1972. The original order was amended to include specifically the challenged costs of engineering and inspection.</p>

PennDOT filed preliminary objections to the effect that the Court could not order payment of funds which had not been appropriated by the legislature. Later, PennDOT withdrew the preliminary objections and paid the City the sum of $655,731.00, but refused to pay interest on that sum. The City moved for judgment on the pleadings and requested an order directing PennDOT to pay interest at the statutory rate from the date of initial certification. The Commonwealth Court awarded interest dating back to July 21, 1976, the date on which the cost certification was modified. Both parties appeal from that order; PennDOT claims no interest is due; and, the City claims interest should be computed from the date of the initial certification.</p>

We believe the Commonwealth should be subject, under these circumstances, to the same rule as any other party before a court. Although an action in mandamus lies on the law side of the court, equitable principles guide the issuance of the writ and any grant of incidental relief. See <em>Dombrowski v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/431/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="431 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1917375" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0199-01">431 Pa. 199</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=245%20A.2d%20238" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="245 A.2d 238">245 A.2d 238</a> (1968); <em>Taggart v.

However, the claimant in <em>Wyoming Sand and Stone, </em>supra, was not able to establish a clear right to the principal fund in question. Therefore, mandamus did not lie, and no basis for an incidental award of interest existed. More to the point is <em>Alberts v.

When the PUC initially certified costs of $667,139.00 allocable to PennDOT, PennDOT took no appeal, nor did it file a timely petition for a rehearing asserting the existence of new or additional evidence which would have tolled the appeal period. See <em>In re Application of PennDot, </em>29 Pa.Cmwlth. 368, <a href="/citations/?q=370%20A.2d%201257" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="370 A.2d 1257">370 A.2d 1257</a> (1977). When no appeal is taken from a PUC order allocating costs for reconstruction of a railroad crossing bridge, that order becomes final and the obligation of a party to pay the allocated costs ordinarily becomes “an adjudicated fact similar, in many respects, to a money judgment.” <em>Department of Highways v.

In its brief, PennDOT also maintains the award of interest is improper because payment of the principal could not be made in the absence of legislative authorization and appropriation of the necessary funds. In the Commonwealth Court, PennDOT filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer asserting the court was without power to order payment by PennDOT absent legislative appropriation of the funds. PennDOT withdrew the preliminary objections by letter of March 11, 1976. The argument now advanced by PennDOT does not appear in the pleadings. Therefore, it is waived. See <em>Dilliplaine v.

Unlike the majority and the Commonwealth Court, I view the City of Pittsburgh’s “Petition for Review” seeking interest on the sum PennDOT reimbursed the City as an impermissible effort to enlarge the order of the PUC directing PennDOT only to reimburse the City and not to pay the City interest. Thus I would hold that the Commonwealth Court erred in awarding the City interest on the sum PennDOT reimbursed.</p>
    <p id="b304-7" data-blocks='[["BL_304.9",304,[288,938,1148,561]]]'>In August of 1972, the PUC ordered the City to demolish and reconstruct a city bridge carrying traffic over tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. The City was to perform the demolition and reconstruction work initially at its own expense. The PUC directed, however, that after the City performed the work PennDOT was to pay fifty percent of the actual cost of materials and work, “when and as certified” by the PUC. Nothing in this initial order even purports to suggest the City is entitled to interest on Penn-DOT’s allocable share. The City took no appeal from the PUC’s determination.</p>
    <p id="b304-8" data-blocks='[["BL_304.10",304,[288,1523,1146,254]]]'>In October of 1974, the PUC certified PennDOT’s share of City costs at $667,139.19. Again, however, this order does not suggest PennDOT is to pay the City interest. As with the previous order, the City never questioned this order in any respect.</p>
    <p id="b304-9" data-blocks='[["BL_304.11",304,[286,1793,1147,570]]]'>PennDOT believed the PUC’s certification order improperly included certain costs incurred before the PUC ordered demolition. After negotiations with the City proved unsuccessful, PennDOT petitioned the PUC to open the record and permit a reduction of PennDOT’s allocable share. After a hearing, in July of 1976 the PUC agreed in part with PennDOT and entered a revised order certifying PennDOT’s share of costs at $655,731.75. As with the previous PUC orders, however, nothing in this revised order indicates PennDOT is to pay the City interest on the sum reimbursed. The City again took no appeal.</p>
    <p id="b305-3" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[254,331,1149,821]]]'>
      <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>PennDOT did not immediately reimburse the City only because it believed then, as it believes now, that the Legislature first had to approve the demolition and rebuilding project. Nonetheless, the City began its efforts to compel reimbursement by way of judicial proceedings. Nothing on this record indicates that the City sought either the PUC’s or the Attorney General’s enforcement of the revised PUC reimbursement order. See Public Utility Law, Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1053, §§ 903 &amp; 904, 66 P.S. §§ 1343 &amp; 1344 (1959). Instead, the City proceeded directly against Penn-DOT by filing a Petition for Review in the Commonwealth Court. The City’s petition sought not only an order directing PennDOT to pay the principal sum of reimbursement but also interest from October, 1974, the date of the original, subsequently revised PUC order.</p>

Section 16 provides:</p>

Thus it <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>denied the City’s request for interest from October, 1974, the date of the PUC’s first certification order.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[260,444,1147,432]]]'>The majority now upholds the Commonwealth Court’s award of interest from July, 1976, the date of the PUC’s revised certification order. The majority also holds, however, that the Commonwealth Court erred in denying the City interest from October, 1974 on the principal sum of $590,438. The majority concludes that PennDOT’s failure to question its obligation to pay this amount of principal requires PennDOT to pay interest.</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[255,914,1149,815]]]'>Fundamental to the error of both the majority and the Commonwealth Court is their acquiescence in the City’s view that only the Mandamus Act of 1893 is relevant to the propriety of the City’s present action. The City’s action, here a Petition for Review pursuant to Pa.R.App.Proc. 1501 et seq., in reality seeks enforcement of the PUC’s revised certification order. Nothing in the Public Utility Law expressly gives the City authority to enforce a PUC order. Power to obtain enforcement of PUC orders is specifically conferred only upon the PUC and the Attorney General. See Public Utility Law, §§ 903 &amp; 904, 66 P.S. §§ 1343 &amp; 1344. Surely if the City cannot bring the present enforcement proceeding it cannot seek the supplemental relief of interest on the principal sum the PUC ordered PennDOT to pay.</p>

Sound, general principles of administrative jurisprudence suggest otherwise. The PUC’s orders directing reimbursement are final and thus to be accorded the same res judicata effect paid any other judgment. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments, § 131 (Adjudication by Administrative Tribunal) (Tent. Draft No. 7, 1980). Moreover, nothing <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>in sections 903 and 904 of the Public Utility Law would permit either the PUC or the Attorney General to enlarge the PUC’s order of enforcement to include interest. Far from permitting supplemental relief of interest to be entered, section 903 permits a court to enter a writ of mandamus compelling compliance with the extant order “in such modified or other form as will afford appropriate relief.” Surely it cannot be contended that a party such as the City, not mentioned in the Public Utility Law as a proper enforcing party, can accomplish any more by way of the general language of the Mandamus Act of 1893 than can those governmental bodies statutorily authorized to enforce a PUC order.</p>
    <p id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[249,1066,1150,812]]]'>Finally, there is the “well-settled rule that a sovereign state is not liable for interest in any case except where, expressly or by reasonable construction of a contract or statute, it has placed itself in a position of liability.” <em>Purdy Estate, </em><a href="/pa/447/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="447 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1942907" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0439-01">447 Pa. 439</a>, 442, <a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%2093" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="291 A.2d 93">291 A.2d 93</a>, 95 (1972). This rule is especially appropriate where, as here, one governmental body is seeking to compel another governmental body to pay interest. Nowhere in the relevant cost-allocation statute, Public Utility Law, § 411(a), 66 P.S. § 1181(a), or anywhere else does the Legislature even suggest that an award of interest against the Commonwealth is appropriate in this class of litigation. Indeed, an award of interest would mean only that one governmental body would be obliged to pay tax dollars to another. I cannot impute to the Legislature the intent to permit such an untoward result.</p>
