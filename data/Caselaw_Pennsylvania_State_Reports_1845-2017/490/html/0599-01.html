      <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>This case stems from the armed robbery of a Philadelphia hardware store. At trial, the Commonwealth called Mr. Kessler, the proprietor of the store and an eyewitness to the crime. He testified that on July 20, 1974, a man later identified as Jerome Gethers entered the hardware store, looked at some mirrors and then departed. Soon after Mr. Kessler closed the store, Gethers reappeared and gained entrance by claiming that he dropped something while inside. When the door was reopened, Gethers and two other men entered the store. One of the men carried a shotgun wrapped in newspaper.</p>
    <p id="b633-5" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[209,921,1149,364]]]'>As the men entered the store, a shot was fired. Kessler drew, but dropped a .38 caliber handgun he carried at his waist and ran to the back of the store. Although the men fired several times, no bullet struck Kessler. Kessler left the store through a back exit and telephoned police. During this time, the three men ran out the front door, got in their car, and drove away.</p>
    <p id="b633-6" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[209,1304,1149,356]]]'>At trial, appellant presented the testimony of Jerome Gethers, a participant in the crime who had already pled guilty to the charges. This witness stated that appellant had not participated in the robbery. Gethers testified that appellant was given a ride by the fleeing robbers just before police stopped their car. When called to testify, appellant corroborated this account of the event.</p>

Secondly, you should examine Mr. Gethers’ testimony closely and accept it only with caution and with care. Thirdly, you should consider whether or not his testimony is supported in whole or in part by other evidence aside from his own testimony, for if it is supported by independent evidence, certainly it is more dependable.”</blockquote>

      <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>The jury convicted appellant of robbery, criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. Following the denial of post-trial motions, the court imposed concurrent sentences of two to ten years for robbery and one to two years for each of the conspiracy and assault charges. Sentence was suspended on the reckless endangerment charge. Defense counsel failed to file a timely direct appeal. Appellant subsequently sought relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. § 1180-1 et seq. The PCHA court denied appellant an appeal. The Superior Court reversed and, on remand, the PCHA court granted appellant the right to file a direct appeal as though timely filed to the Superior Court. By order entered October 26, 1977, the Superior Court, without opinion, affirmed appellant’s conviction. We granted allowance of appeal.</p>

There, we held that the court improperly cautioned the jury to view with disfavor the exculpatory testimony of a defense witness simply because the witness admitted participation in the crimes charged. This Court stated that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b634-6" data-blocks='[["BL_634.6",634,[309,1464,1109,719]]]'>“[a] legitimate basis exists for charging the jury to view an accomplice’s testimony with suspicion when the accomplice testifies for the Commonwealth. Such a witness, out of a reasonable expectation of leniency, has an interest in inculpating others. This basis is inapplicable, however, when the accomplice testifies on behalf of the defense. One implicated in a crime cannot reasonably expect such leniency by exonerating others, particularly where, as here, the witness has already been sentenced for committing the crime. Thus, it is unreasonable to infer, and improper for the court to charge, that because this defense witness stood convicted of the crime in question, his testimony must be viewed ‘with disfavor’ and accepted only with ‘caution and care.’ ”</blockquote>

Russell, </em><a href="/pa/477/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="477 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1738251" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0147-01">477 Pa. 147</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="477 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1738251" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0147-01">383 A.2d 866</a> (1978), we held (Mr. Justice Pomeroy dissenting) that it was error for a jury to have been instructed to view the exculpatory testimony of a convicted and sentenced alleged accomplice “with disfavor because it comes from a <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>corrupt and polluted source,” to accept the testimony “only with caution and care,” and to consider whether the testimony was “supported by independent evidence.” The majority in <em>Russell </em>reasoned that while an accomplice testifying for the prosecution may have an interest in inculpating others due to a reasonable expectation of leniency for himself, “[t]his basis is inapplicable, however, when the accomplice testifies on behalf of the defense. One implicated in a crime cannot reasonably expect such leniency by exonerating others, particularly where, as here, the witness has already been sentenced for committing the crime.” <em><a href="/pa/477/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="477 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1738251" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0147-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/477/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="477 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1738251" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0147-01">477 Pa. at 153</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="477 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1738251" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0147-01">383 A.2d at 868-869</a>. The <em>Russell </em>holding relied upon the very doubtful rationale that, absent a reason to falsify testimony to achieve leniency for oneself, an accomplice testifying for the accused lacks a motive to commit perjury. As Mr. Justice Pomeroy noted in his dissent, however, many other motives could lead one to the same end: “. feelings of friendship, loyalty or even fear of future revenge . such a person moreover, would have nothing to lose by lying for a colleague, having already been convicted and sentenced himself.” <em><a href="/pa/477/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="477 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1738251" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0147-01">Id.,</a> 4T1 </em>Pa. at 156, <a href="/pa/477/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="477 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1738251" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0147-01">383 A.2d at 870</a>.</p>

McComb, </em><a href="/pa/462/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="462 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="485153" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0504-01">462 Pa. 504</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="462 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="485153" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0504-01">341 A.2d 496</a> (1975). A defendant has the right to have an accomplice testify in his behalf, and it is an accepted practice for courts to give cautionary instructions regarding an accomplice’s testimony. The decision to give such a cautionary instruction is merely part of the general conduct of a trial over which a judge’s powers are discretionary. See <em>United States v. Nolte, </em><a href="/f2d/440/1124-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="440 F.2d 1124" data-case-ids="760467" data-case-paths="/f2d/440/1124-01">440 F.2d 1124</a> (5th Cir. 1971). Where the accomplice’s testimony is offered for the defense, the possibility of perjury is sufficient to warrant exercise of judicial discretion to advise a jury to accept the testimony only with caution, provided that the jury is clearly informed that with it, alone, rests the ultimate authority to accept all, part, or none of the testimony, despite the cautionary instruction. Certainly, a judge <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>could not properly charge that such a witness <em>must </em>be disbelieved, or that a witness’s testimony <em>must </em>be corroborated to be believed, or that the testimony <em>must </em>be believed true beyond a reasonable doubt before it may be considered, for such would invade the jury’s province and defeat the presumption of innocence. <em>Cool v. United States, </em><a href="/us/409/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="409 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="6171965" data-case-paths="/us/409/0100-01">409 U.S. 100</a>, <a href="/us/409/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="409 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="6171965" data-case-paths="/us/409/0100-01">93 S.Ct. 354</a>, <a href="/us/409/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="409 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="6171965" data-case-paths="/us/409/0100-01">34 L.Ed.2d 335</a> (1972). Having come to regard the rationale in <em>Russell </em>as suspect, and viewing that case as too far restricting judicial discretion with respect to the jury charge, the holding in <em>Russell </em>should be overruled.</p>
