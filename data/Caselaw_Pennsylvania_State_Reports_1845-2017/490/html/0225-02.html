The record reveals that the victim entered an after-hours tavern and was confronted by Bonds; that an argument ensued between the two; that Bonds struck the victim; and, that Bonds and Anderson fired several shots at the victim.

In view of our disposition, we need not consider the following claims raised by Anderson: (1) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress identification <em>testimony; (2) </em>trial counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct an investigation and for want for preparation; (3) a one-on-one pre-trial identification confrontation violated Anderson’s rights to due process and to assistance of counsel; (4) the failure of the district attorney to inform defense counsel and the trial court of an improper pre-trial identification was reversible error; (5) in-court identifications were not of “independent origin”; (6) remarks by the district attorney constituted “adverse comment” on Anderson’s election to not testify; (7) the trial court erred in refusing Anderson’s request for a charge on voluntary manslaughter; (8) comments by the trial judge, in his charge to the jury, deprived Anderson of a fair trial; and (9) Anderson was denied due process because the P.C.H.A. court did not consider his legal arguments, but merely adopted the legal memorandum of the Commonwealth.</p>

There, the Superior Court found no error where the trial court referred to a killing as an “assassination-type” killing because the term only implied the killing was premeditated. The <em>Kennedy </em>court was not confronted, however, with unsupported statements and the use of epithets by the district attorney.</p>
