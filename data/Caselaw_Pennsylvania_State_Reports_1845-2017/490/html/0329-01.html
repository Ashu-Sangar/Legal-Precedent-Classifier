Later that morning, Smith engaged in another fistfight in the same neighborhood with Jerry Crew. Smith left the scene of the second fight but warned he would return. After he tried unsuccessfully to locate his brothers, Smith joined several of his friends including Eugene Blocker and Alan Blocker. Smith’s group went to Mayo’s house and confronted Mayo, Crew, Darryl Hill, and several other youths. Smith and Crew resumed fighting in front of Mayo’s house. After the police broke up their street fight, Smith and Crew continued fighting for twenty minutes or more in an alley behind the house. Mayo’s sister broke up the alley fight, and Mayo’s group walked to West Philadelphia High School where they <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>were again confronted by Smith and his friends. Smith told Mayo he wanted to continue the fight with Crew. Mayo explained Crew had not come with them because he did not want to fight anymore. Smith suddenly dashed toward the corner where Eugene Blocker stood and shouted, “now, now” while simultaneously making two downward motions with his right hand, index finger pointing. Thereupon, Blocker fired one shot from a gun striking the decedent, Hill, as he attempted to run from the scene. The police transported Hill to the hospital where he was pronounced dead as a result of a gunshot wound to the lung and heart.</p>
