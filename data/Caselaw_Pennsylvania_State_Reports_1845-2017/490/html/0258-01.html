    <p id="b293-9" data-blocks='[["BL_293.9",293,[216,1451,1147,628]]]'>That the Commonwealth exercised due diligence in bringing the defendant to trial is attested to by the mere fact that almost thirteen years had elapsed since the murder and original investigation in this crime. Judge Morgan observed in his opinion denying the motion below that “[a]fter thirteen years, an extension of only three weeks to continue the criminal investigation confirms rather than impugns the diligence of the District Attorney.” This is especially true where incriminating oral and written statements made by the defendant which were used and significantly relied upon by the Commonwealth in the first two trials were, by decisions of this Court, no longer available for use at trial.</p>

The defendant argues that due diligence is hardly shown by wait<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>ing approximately ninety days after the remand of the ease to re-open the investigation of a murder case tried twice before. This argument, however, fails to recognize the fact that because of the complex nature of the case and because of three decisions of this Court in the case, a thorough review of all appellate issues was made and there was extended deliberation whether the decision of this Court in <em>Romberger III, supra, </em>should be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The District Attorney engaged in a continuing consultation with an expert, a Mr. Zagel in Chicago, in the matter, and the final decision was not made until close to the expiration of the period in which to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. (The United States Supreme Court Rules allow a petition for writ of certiorari to review the judgment of a State Court of last resort in a criminal case within ninety days of the entry of the State Court judgment. U.S.Sup.Ct. Rule 22, 28 U.S.C.A.)</p>

It is on the facts of <em>this </em>case, where the legal issues posed by the <em>Romberger </em>line of cases were considered repeatedly by this Court and once by the United States Supreme Court and where, had the holding of <em>Romberger III </em>been overturned on appeal, the necessity of re-opening investigation would have been obviated, that a finding of due diligence is appropriate. As a corollary to the above, it may also be noted that to impose a requirement of immediate investigation on remand in the instant case would be a consummate waste of taxpayer money and police resources. The business of criminal prosecution involves the weighing of alternatives in hope of following the most <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>propitious path and Rule 1100 contemplates this decision-making process, often a time-consuming one. “Due diligence is the most that should be expected from the district attorney and if, despite such efforts, he cannot prepare for trial within the prescribed period, an extension is permissible.” <em>Commonwealth v. Mayfield, <a href="/pa/469/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="469 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1722083" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0214-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/469/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="469 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1722083" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0214-01">469 Pa. at 218</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="469 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1722083" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0214-01">364 A.2d at 1347</a>. It must be noted also that at the hearing held on the Commonwealth’s petition for extension, the testimony offered established other reasons for the requested extension in addition to the time taken up in deciding whether to appeal. From the record, it appears that the pathologist in the case, Dr. Brayson, had re-located to Canada and was not anxious to return for another trial. It was also alleged that there was difficulty in obtaining another witness.</p>

The cases that could not be tried at this session for the foregoing reasons were put over and added to the list for the February session which began on February 13, 1978. On February 8, 1978, a scheduled Miscellaneous Court for pleas and waivers had to be cancelled because of another winter storm and these cases also were added to the February list. All of these cases could not be tried at the February session. The District Attorney, having demonstrated at the hearing on his petition that certain January cases also involved Rule 1100 considerations and other cases of serious nature were ready for trial, it was not reasonable to insist on a <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>February trial date, especially since the trial at the March session required a short extension of only three weeks. <em>Commonwealth v.
