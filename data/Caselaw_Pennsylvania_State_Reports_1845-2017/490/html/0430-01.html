    <p class="author" id="b464-8" data-blocks='[["BL_464.9",464,[309,1105,346,41]]]'>O’BRIEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b464-9" data-blocks='[["BL_464.10",464,[263,1168,1149,419]]]'>This is an appeal from an order entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, Civil Action, Law, granting appellee’s motion to take off judgment. The question presented asks whether one of multiple defendants in a trespass action, not served with process, remains subject to valid service of process after the plaintiff’s action has been non prossed for failure to proceed. The unusual procedural history of the case is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b464-10" data-blocks='[["BL_464.11",464,[260,1608,1149,571]]]'>On March 5, 1976, three days prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, Anna M. Vandegrift, a/k/a Anna M. Vandergrift, appellant herein, commenced an action in trespass in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County. Named as defendants were appellees, Knights Road Industrial Park, Inc., J. Camerlengo Contractors, Inc., and J. Camerlengo Builders Supply Corporation. The action was commenced by a writ of summons in trespass, and although two defendants were served with process, the sheriff returned “not found” as to defendant Industrial Park.</p>
    <p id="b464-11" data-blocks='[["BL_464.12",464,[258,2209,1148,150]],["BL_465.1",465,[220,327,1148,261]]]'>On March 29, 1976, counsel entered his appearance “for defendants,” and it was so entered on the docket. On June 3, 1976, counsel for defendants filed a praecipe for rule on <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>plaintiff to file a complaint. After much dilatory action on the part of plaintiff, counsel for defendants, on November 18, 1976, obtained a judgment of non pros for failure to proceed. To that date defendant Industrial Park had not been personally served with process in this action.</p>
    <p id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[221,610,1147,422]]]'>On November 23, 1976, appellant filed complaint against Industrial Park and its co-defendants at the same number and term, and on November 30, 1976, obtained personal service of the complaint on all three defendants through the Bucks County sheriff’s office. Counsel for defendants filed preliminary objections to the complaint, pleading prior judgment of non pros; plaintiff simultaneously filed a petition to open judgment of non pros.</p>
    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[221,1054,1147,197]]]'>On January 7, 1977, the trial court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed appellant’s complaint. No disposition of the petition to open judgment has as yet been made.</p>
    <p id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.7",465,[221,1282,1148,584]]]'>On April 5, 1977, appellant obtained a judgment for default of appearance or answer against Industrial Park only, presumably on the basis that it had not been served prior to the original judgment of non pros and was therefore not affected by such judgment. On April 21, 1977, Industrial Park, by the same counsel who had appeared “for defendants” in the prior proceedings, moved to take off the judgment by default which motion was granted by the trial court on May 23, 1977. The Superior Court affirmed on March 3, 1978, <em>per curiam </em>and without opinion. We granted allowance of appeal.</p>
