That statute provided that, in the case of convicted defendants who were able to pay all or part of the expenses incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant, including costs for the convicted persons’s appointed counsel, be repaid to the state. In that case appellant argued that the statute had a “chilling” effect on the exercise of constitutional rights because a defendant’s knowledge that he might remain under an obligation to repay might impel him to decline the services of an appointed attorney.

The rule provides: “All costs accruing from a change of venue shall be paid by the county in which the complaint was filed.” This rule does not operate to fix the costs upon the county instead of the defendant but, rather, determines as between the two counties which one shall initially bear the expense of a change of venue. It does not prevent the county from recouping the costs expended from the defendant upon conviction, but specifies which county has the responsibility of securing payment from the defendant.

As discussed above, a defendant may be required to only pay costs authorized by statute. 16 P.S. § 1403, supra, permits the expenses of the District Attorney and those who assist him in the prosecution to be included as a part of the costs, but only to the extent that those expenses are “necessary.” The District Attorney must provide a defendant, who is charged with costs, a reasonably specific bill of costs and show how such costs were necessary to the prosecution. In the instant case, the District Attorney and the County Controller initially submitted a lump sum of over $10,000 for court approval, and, apparently <em>ex parte, </em>the court approved an order for appellant to pay that sum. Only after appellant objected and court ordered a bill of costs to be filed was any itemization of costs presented to appellant. Some expenses, such as jurors’ expenses and those of certain court personnel, were found to be improperly charged to appellant. As to the other categories of expenses, the District Attorney did not demonstrate how the expenses of various witnesses or other persons assisting the district attorney were necessary to the prosecution. During the evidentiary hearing, the court below erred by placing the burden on appellant to show the costs were unnecessary, rather than requiring the Commonwealth to adequately demonstrate that these costs were necessary.</blockquote>

This court refused to apportion the costs between the first and second counts since all the costs were necessary to try the defendant on the second count. We have nothing in the record before us indicating what costs, if any, were solely attributable to the charges which were dismissed. We cannot, therefore, arbitrarily apportion costs solely on appellant’s conviction on only two of the charges. If the Commonwealth demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that all the witnesses were reasonably necessary to prove the charges for which appellant was convicted, the Commonwealth may recover the expenditures arising from their attendance at the trial. When the new hearing is held on the question of unnecessary costs, it should be determined whether any of the costs are solely attributable to the charges which were dismissed in granting the motion in arrest of judgment.

This statute<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> does not represent a “patently impermissible” attempt to “penalize a criminal defendant for exercising so fundamental a right by imposing costs of the venue charge.” (At 411, Roberts, J., dissenting opinion). Moreover, it does not exert a constitutionally prohibited “chilling effect.” I am satisfied that the United States Supreme Court’s discussion of the question in <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em><a href="/us/417/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="417 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1519339" data-case-paths="/us/417/0040-01">417 U.S. 40</a>, <a href="/us/417/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="417 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1519339" data-case-paths="/us/417/0040-01">94 S.Ct. 2116</a>, <a href="/us/417/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="417 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1519339" data-case-paths="/us/417/0040-01">40 L.Ed.2d 642</a> (1974), adequately responds to these contentions. It cannot be successfully argued that the right to a change of venue is any more important in assuring a fair trial than the right to counsel.</p>
    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.7",235,[198,1068,1147,624]]]'>Nevertheless, I believe that it is important to emphasize that my agreement with the majority’s result is premised upon an interpretation of the statute in question which limits the enforcement of this type of assessment to situations where the defendant has the capacity to meet it without manifest hardship. I note that in this case appellant was provided an opportunity to question the legitimacy of the bill of costs and that the court did, in fact, reduce the figure arrived at by the Commonwealth. I also assume, since there is nothing to the contrary being urged before us, that this defendant has the financial capacity to meet this obligation without manifest hardship.</p>

Neither the Commonwealth nor the majority refers to any case in this or any other jurisdiction, and research reveals none, in which the prosecution has been permitted to impose such costs. Unlike the majority, we agree with the Superior Court that this unprecedented imposition of costs is impermissible.</p>

The majority’s result is even more remarkable, however, in light of existing statutory provisions and rules of this Court. Pa.R.Crim.Pro. 312(b) expressly provides that “[a]ll costs accruing from a change of venue shall be paid by the county in which the complaint was filed.” See also Act of May 18, 1875, P.L. 30, § 3, formerly 19 P.S. § 553.

The majority’s determination to ignore these plain mandates, as well as its failure to protect fundamental constitutional rights, once again unnecessarily forces a Pennsylvania litigant to seek redress in a federal court for vindication of rights that should have been respected in the state system. The order of the Superior Court should be affirmed. The majority’s failure to do so compels dissent.</p>
