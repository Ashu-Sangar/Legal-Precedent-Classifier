We conclude that the individual so acting may not arbitrate the dispute. Thus we reverse the Commonwealth Court order affirming the arbitration award.</p>
    <p id="b324-11" data-blocks='[["BL_324.12",324,[278,1612,1148,528]]]'>Appellee Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board contracted with appellant Felix Abramovich for the distribution of liquor and supplies in the northwestern region of the Commonwealth. Shortly after the contract was executed, appellant experienced a labor dispute which threatened his ability to perform under the contract. Appellant settled the dispute, but incurred additional labor expenses as a result. Pursuant to paragraph 42 of the contract, appellant sought an adjustment for the increased labor costs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The PLCB denied appellant’s request.</p>

W. Anderson, to act as the sole arbitrator of the dispute. Appellant did not know that Anderson was the Deputy Attorney General assigned to the PLCB.</p>

Anderson wrote opinions of the Attorney General on issues involving the PLCB. On behalf of the PLCB, Anderson reviewed all contracts exceeding $500,000, like the contract involved here. Finally, Anderson’s representation of the Board required him to review and to approve contract language identical to that presently placed in controversy by appellant.</p>

At those meetings Anderson discussed both the possibility of settling this controversy and the financial status of appellant’s business. Prior to the arbitration hearing, Anderson failed to disclose this past and continuing relationship with the Board because he “did not consider it to be an issue.” Once <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>informed of Anderson’s involvement with the PLCB, appellant challenged Anderson’s appointment as hearing officer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellant’s petition for reconsideration was denied and appellant petitioned for review in the Commonwealth Court. That court declined jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. See Act of April 25, 1927, P.L. 381, as amended, 5 P.S. § 161 et seq. The common pleas court denied appellant’s petition for review. An appeal improperly taken to the Superior Court was transferred to the Commonwealth Court. After argument a three judge panel affirmed, without opinion, the trial court’s denial of relief. We granted allowance of appeal.</p>
