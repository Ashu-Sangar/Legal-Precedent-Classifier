Central also argues that the entire interim assessment is void because of County’s failure to comply with the notice provision of Section 6-677.1. The reappraisal of the property was made on January 14, 1976, while notice of the change in assessment was not mailed until February 17, 1976. Section 6-677.1 requires the assessor “to give notice of such reassessment within ten days to the authority responsible for assessment, the school district and the <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>properly owner.” While Central is correct in alleging non-compliance with the notice requirement, the conclusion that failure to notify a property owner of the change in assessment within the prescribed time period automatically voids the entire interim assessment does not necessarily follow. Here, Central does not allege, nor does it appear, that Central was in any way prejudiced by the delay; Central was able to appeal the reassessment to the County Board and suffered no penalty because of the delay. Under these circumstances, we will not declare the interim assessment void because of an insignificant delay of notice. <em>See Taylor Borough </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/408/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="408 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1308415" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0056-01">408 Pa, 56</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20754" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="182 A.2d 754">182 A.2d 754</a> (1962).</p>

Central argues that the interim assessment procedure of Section 6-677.1 is intended for school purposes only and, therefore, the assessor cannot attempt to utilize the interim school assessment for the purpose of fixing assessed valuation for other taxing entities. We agree. The statute, by its clear language, applies only to a building “not included in the tax duplicate <em>of the school district </em>” and provides that “such property shall be added to the duplicate, and shall be taxable <em>for school purposes </em>at the reassessed valuation.” (Emphasis supplied).

For example, by failing promptly to assess the property, County, which also acted as the assessor and the Board of Assessment Appeals, could delay the establishment of the “base year,” and thereby avoid its obligation under the tax escalation clause for at least one year. Moreover, by delaying the tax “base year,” Central’s tax burden would be increased and County’s decreased.</p>
