At or about noon on June 22, the wife of the owner of the stolen van was driving on Route 8 when she saw the van approaching from the opposite direction in which she was travelling. She turned her vehicle around, followed the van and when she was satisfied that the vehicle was her husband’s van, radioed the police by CB radio. In response to her call, the township police gave chase in two patrol cars over a distance of three miles. The patrol used sirens and overhead lights but the driver of the van refused to heed their direction to stop. The van was eventually stopped by a roadblock set up by the police.</p>

Thus, we must look to determine whether there was a basis from which an inference could be drawn that appellant knew or should have known that the van was stolen.

Further, there are too many lawful reasons that might explain the necessity in starting a vehicle in this manner to charge a passenger with guilty knowledge from the fact that he was aware that the operator started the vehicle without the use of the key.</p>
