      {
        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nJohn Gavula died testate on November 21, 1975. In his last will, dated May 15, 1963, the deceased directed his just debts, funeral expenses, and testamentary expenses to be paid and left the remainder of his estate to his two sisters.\nOn March 5, 1976, Anna Ardos, appellant, petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Carbon County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, for a \u201cspouse\u2019s allowance\u201d and a \u201cspouse\u2019s exemption.\u201d Ardos claims that she is the wife of the deceased by virtue of a common law marriage which purportedly occurred on April 23, 1966.\nOn June 18, 1976, the trial court appointed a master to determine Ardos\u2019 rights as the purported spouse of the deceased. Testimony was taken at three hearings, and the testimony of Ardos was taken subject to a standing objection, by counsel for the estate, based on the Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, \u00a7 5(e), 28 P.S. \u00a7 322 [hereinafter: Dead Man\u2019s Act].\nOn July 11, 1977, the master filed a report in which he concluded Ardos was incompetent to testify under the Dead Man\u2019s Act. The master further concluded that Ardos failed to prove that she was the common law wife of the deceased by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the master recommended that Ardos\u2019 petitions be dismissed with prejudice.\nArdos duly filed exceptions to the master\u2019s report, and the trial court ordered the matter returned to the master for appropriate recommendations. In the exceptions, Ardos argued that there was evidence to support a common law marriage and that evidence offered by the estate, regarding the non-existence of the common-law marriage, rendered Ardos competent to testify under the Act of June 11, 1891, P.L. 287, \u00a7 1, 28 P.S. \u00a7 325 [hereinafter: Act of 1891].\nThe master again recommended that Ardos\u2019 petitions be dismissed. The trial court adopted the recommendation and on January 5, 1978, entered a decree dismissing Ardos\u2019 petitions with prejudice. This appeal followed.\nArdos claims initially that the trial court erred in ruling her testimony, about events prior to the deceased\u2019s demise, incompetent under the Dead Man\u2019s Act. Ardos argues that the \u201cdevisavit vel non\u201d exception, expressed in the Dead Man\u2019s Act, is applicable and that, therefore, she is competent.\nWe will not address this claim because it was not raised at trial or in the exceptions to the master\u2019s report, and, therefore, it is not preserved for appellate review. Bell v. Koppers Co., 481 Pa. 454, 392 A.2d 1380 (1978); Commonwealth v. National Federation of the Blind, 471 Pa. 529, 370 A.2d 732 (1977); Keystone Building Corp. v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, 468 Pa. 85, 360 A.2d 191 (1976).\nArdos next argues that her testimony was not incompetent under the Dead Man\u2019s Act because the estate called two witnesses who testified \u201cto facts and circumstances purporting to indicate appellant [Ardos] and decedent were not married.\u201d Accordingly, Ardos maintains this rendered her testimony competent under the Act of 1891. We disagree.\nUnder the Act of 1891, a surviving party is competent to testify to matters* which occurred prior to the death of the deceased only if:\n\u201cthe party representing the decedent calls a witness who testifies adversely to the interests of the surviving party about a transaction which occurred in the presence of the survivor and the witness . . . .\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]\nGelb Estate, 425 Pa. 117, 122, 228 A.2d 367, 370 (1967). See also, Bowman\u2019s Estate, 301 Pa. 337,152 A. 38 (1930); Krumrine v. Grenoble, 165 Pa. 98, 30 A. 824 (1895).\nInstantly, the testimony of the two witnesses for the estate, about matters which occurred prior to the deceased\u2019s demise, was adverse to Ardos in that the testimony related statements by the deceased that he and Ardos were not married. These statements, however, were not made \u201cin the presence of the survivor [Ardos] and the witness.\u201d Accordingly, the Act of 1891 is of no avail to Ardos.\nFinally, Ardos claims she met her burden of proving the purported common law marriage between herself and the deceased. Ardos argues that her testimony and that of her witnesses is \u201csufficient, in law, to establish the existence of a common law marriage. . . . \u201d Since Ardos\u2019 testimony about events prior to the deceased\u2019s demise is incompetent under the Dead Man\u2019s Act, we will only consider the testimony of Ardos\u2019 other witnesses and her rebuttal testimony about events after the deceased\u2019s demise in determining the sufficiency argument.\nUnder the law of this Commonwealth, marriage is a civil contract. The contract does not require any specific form of words, and all that is essential is proof of an agreement to enter into the legal relationship of marriage at the present time. In re Estate of Garges, 474 Pa. 237, 378 A.2d 307 (1977).\nThe burden to prove the marriage is on the purported spouse. Davis\u2019s Estate, 204 Pa. 602, 54 A. 475 (1903). Moreover, since our courts have regarded common law marriage as a fruitful source of perjury and fraud to be tolerated and not encouraged, see Manfredi Estate, supra; Wagner Estate, 398 Pa. 531, 159 A.2d 495 (1960); Baker v. Mitchell, 143 Pa. Super. 50, 17 A.2d 738 (1941), the law imposes a heavy burden on one who grounds his or her claim on an allegation of common law marriage. This is especially so where one of the parties is dead and the claim, so grounded, is to share in the distribution of the estate. Manfredi Estate, supra; Baker v. Mitchell, supra. As this Court stated in Stevenson\u2019s Estate, 272 Pa. 291, 301, 116 A. 162, 165 (1922):\n\u201cwhen the lips of a man are sealed by death, and he leaves no satisfactory evidence as to the existence of such contract, courts will be very slow to establish it in derogation of the undoubted rights of those who follow him.\u201d\nAccord, Osterling\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 23, 185 A. 790 (1936); McGrath\u2019s Estate, 319 Pa. 309, 179 A. 599 (1935). Finally, when an attempt is made to establish a marriage without the usual formalities, we are called upon to examine the purported marriage contract with great scrutiny. Manfredi[\u2019s] Estate, supra; McGrath\u2019s Estate, supra; Baker v. Mitchell, supra.\nInstantly, the record reveals the following: Ardos called four witnesses to support the existence of the common law marriage. Thomas Zizic, the son-in-law of Ardos, testified that when he first met the deceased, the deceased stated he and Ardos \u201chave been married for a little over 3 years and we exchanged our vows and have a common law marriage . . ..\u201d The substance of the \u201cvows\u201d was not revealed. The deceased\u2019s statement was made when Ardos and the deceased went to Maryland to help Zizic and his wife, Ardos\u2019 daughter, move into a rented house in 1969. Zizic also testified the deceased referred to Ardos as \u201cMrs. Gavula\u201d during Christmas of 1969 when Ardos, the deceased, and Zizic\u2019s parents visited Zizic and his wife. Zizic could not recall any occasion after 1969 where the deceased referred to Ardos as his wife. Zizic\u2019s testimony was substantially corroborated by his wife. Mrs. Zizic did not reveal the substance of the \u201cvows.\u201d\nZizic\u2019s parents, Lubo and Dorothy Ciric, were the other witnesses called by Ardos. They stated they first met the deceased when the deceased and Ardos traveled to Maryland to visit the Zizics during Christmas of 1969. Mrs. Ciric testified that, at that time, the deceased said: \u201cwe had gotten married in April of 1966; it\u2019s a common law marriage; but we went through the vows ourselves and we are married.\u201d The substance of the \u201cvows\u201d was not revealed. Mrs. Ciric also corroborated Zizic\u2019s testimony that the deceased referred to Ardos as \u201cMrs. Gavula.\u201d Mr. Ciric substantially corroborated the testimony of Mrs. Ciric.\nThe estate called several witnesses who testified to the non-existence of the common law marriage. A1 Svercheck testified that he had a conversation with the deceased one week before the latter died. Svercheck testified he asked the deceased: \u201cJohn, when are you going to get married?\u201d The deceased replied: \u201cWhy should I; everybody\u2019s out to see what they could get, not what they could give.\u201d\nJohn Cipko, the executor, testified that, several days after the deceased died, Ardos stated she and the deceased planned to marry after stock owned by the deceased split. This testimony was corroborated by John Paulik, the deceased\u2019s nephew, who was also present when Ardos made the above statement. Paulik also testified that when the deceased and Ardos visited the home of Paulik\u2019s mother, Paulik was under the impression that Ardos was the deceased\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d\nJulia Korin, the deceased\u2019s first cousin, testified that, prior to the deceased\u2019s demise, a woman stated to Korin: \u201coh, I hear your cousin John is getting married ...\u201d and that, in a conversation with the deceased, Korin stated: \u201cI heard that you\u2019re getting married; you have a girlfriend.\u201d The deceased replied: \u201cDon\u2019t believe in any gossip you hear.\u201d\nFinally, Mary Lunz, the deceased\u2019s sister, testified that she asked the deceased: \u201cdo you plan to marry Ann . .\u201d and the deceased replied: \u201cno \u2014 never . . . you know my condition; that I can\u2019t ever marry.\u201d This conversation occurred in August 1975. Lunz also testified that on several occasions the deceased said Ardos was only a friend that he liked to occasionally visit and \u201ctake on drives when he went shopping . . .\u201d; that Lunz and the deceased planned to live together in Connecticut after Lunz retired; that Lunz and the deceased planned to \u201cshare\u201d several insurance policies and to hold several bank accounts as joint owners; and that after the deceased\u2019s demise, Ardos showed Lunz an engagement ring and stated she was \u201cengaged.\u201d\nIn rebuttal, Ardos denied stating that she and the deceased would marry after the above-mentioned stock split. Ardos also denied making the statement that she was engaged.\nOther competent testimony in the record reveals that the deceased owned and lived alone in his apartment and that he filed federal income tax returns as a \u201csingle\u201d person claiming only one exemption.\nThe only competent record evidence that Ardos and the deceased entered into a present agreement intending to thereby establish the relationship of husband and wife is the evidence of the deceased\u2019s admissions of marriage to Ardos and other evidence concerning the deceased\u2019s reference to Ardos as \u201cMrs. Gavula.\u201d These admissions and references were made only to a few people who were closely associated with Ardos through her daughter. Moreover, these admissions and references were contradicted by competent evidence elicited on behalf of the estate and are inconsistent with the deceased\u2019s maintenance of a separate residence and his federal income tax filing status. We are not persuaded that the trial court erred in ruling that the evidence of admissions and references disclosed herein failed to satisfy Ardos\u2019 burden of proving the existence of a common law marriage. See Levy\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 522, 161 A. 740 (1932) (deceased\u2019s admissions to a few individuals that purported widow was his wife is not sufficient to prove common law marriage).\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result.\n. Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2102(3) and 2507(3) (1975).\n. Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121 (1975).\n. The Dead Man\u2019s Act provides in pertinent part as follows:\n\u201c[Nor], where any party to a thing or contract in action is dead . . . and his right thereto or therein has passed, either by his own act or by the act of the law, to a party on the record who represents his interest in the subject in controversy, [shall] any surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract, [or] any other person whose interest shall be adverse to the said right of such deceased . . . party, shall be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of said party . unless the issue or inquiry be devisavit vel non, or be any other issue or inquiry respecting the property of a deceased owner, and the controversy be between parties respectively claiming such property be devolution on the death of such owner, in which case all persons shall be fully competent witnesses.\u201d\nThe Dead Man\u2019s Act has been substantially reenacted at 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5930 (Supp.1979).\n. The act of 1891 provides in pertinent part as follows:\n\u201cHereafter in any civil action or proceeding . although a party to the thing or contract in action may be dead . . . and his right thereto or therein may have passed . . . to a party on record who presents [sic] his interest in the subject in controversy, nevertheless any surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract or any other person whose interest is adverse to the said right of such deceased party, shall be a competent witness to any relevant matter although it may have occurred before the death of said party ... if and only if such relevant matter occurred between himself and another person who may be living at the time of the trial and may be competent to testify, and who does so testify upon the trial against such surviving or remaining party or against the person whose interest may be thus adverse, or if such relevant matter occurred in the presence or hearing of such other living or competent person.\u201d\nThe Act of 1891 has been substantially reenacted at 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5933(a) (Supp. 1979).\n. See n. 3 ante.\n. The testimony of Ardos\u2019 witnesses was not and is not now challenged under the Dead Man\u2019s Act or any other basis.\n. Because it is often difficult to prove a common law marriage, the law has created a rebuttable presumption of marriage where two absolutely essential elements co-exist, namely, constant cohabitation and general, as distinguished from partial or divided, reputation of marriage. Manfredi Estate, 399 Pa. 285, 159 A.2d 697 (1960). Instantly, the record does not reveal any evidence of constant cohabitation and general reputation; accordingly, no such presumption of common law marriage has been established.",
