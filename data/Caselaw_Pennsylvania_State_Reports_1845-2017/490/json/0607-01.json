        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the decision of the Commonwealth Court which affirmed the orders of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board), appellee, denying benefits to appellants under Section 402(d) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, Act of December 5, 1936, Second Exec. Sess., P.L. (1937) 2897, art. IV, \u00a7 402, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(d).\nAppellants are members of three separate groups, each of whom were employed by Townsend and Bottum, Inc., for the construction of the Bruce Mansfield Fossil-Fuel project at Shippingport, Pennsylvania during 1976. The three groups consisted of: (1) members of various building and construction craft unions (Craft Unions); (2) members of the Iron Workers Local 3 (Ironworkers); and (3) members of Millwrights Local 2235 (Millwrights).\nA review of the record reveals the following sequence of events. On May 31, 1976, various labor-management agreements covering among others, the appellants, expired. On or before June 1,1976, the Craft Unions did reach an accord, but neither the Ironworkers nor the Millwrights were able to reach mutually satisfactory agreements with Townsend and Bottum. Prior to the expiration of the respective contracts, the Ironworkers and Millwrights offered to enter into an interim agreement but required as part of that agreement that any wage increase subsequently won for the new contract be retroactive to June 1, 1976. Management refused and stated as a matter of policy \u201cthat if no agreement tentative or otherwise, was reached by June 1, 1976, . it would . . . not allow the Ironworkers and Millwrights to enter the various construction sites. . . \u201d (Board\u2019s Finding of Fact 15). No further formal offer to continue work was conveyed by either party before the deadline. No evidence of a formal strike vote nor any instruction from union leaders to its membership not to report for work on June 1, can be found in the record.\nThe construction site security guards were advised by management that as of June 1, 1976, Ironworkers and Millwrights were to be denied entry while all other building and craft union members could be admitted as usual. On the morning of June 1, 1976, certain job stewards and union representatives reported to the construction site and were denied entry by the security guards. The same occurred on June 2,1976. On June 3,1976, the two foreclosed unions set up peaceful picket lines at various job sites throughout Western Pennsylvania including the instant project. Their \u201cpicket signs\u201d asserted the failure of management to bargain in good faith. The Craft Union members reported for work that morning, but did not enter the project for work nor did they do so until after the labor dispute was resolved on June 21, 1976.\nAppellants filed for unemployment compensation for the period from June 1, to June 21, 1976. After their claims were denied by the Bureau of Employment and Security, the referee agreed with that determination, and the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review affirmed on appeal. The matters were consolidated before the Commonwealth Court and after argument, it found the Board\u2019s determination supported by the evidence and thus denied appellants\u2019 request for relief. 40 Pa. Cmwlth. 353, 397 A.2d 471 (1979).\nWe turn first to the claim by appellants, Millwrights and Ironworkers that the lower court erred in affirming the denail of compensation under Section 402(d). Our scope of review is limited to a determination as to whether any errors of law were committed and, \u201cabsent fraud,\u201d that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v. Tickle, 19 Pa.Cmwlth. 550, 339 A.2d 864 (1975); see, e.g. Erie Forge and Steel Corporation v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 400 Pa. 440, 163 A.2d 91 (1960).\nThe Millwrights and Ironworkers assert their entitlement to unemployment benefits under Section 402(d) on the grounds that they were \u201clocked-out.\u201d That provision provides:\nAn employe shall be ineligible for compensation for any week\u2014\n(d) In which his unemployment is due to a stoppage of work, which exists because of a labor dispute (other than a lock-out) at the factory, establishment or other premises at which he is or was last employed: Provided, That this subsection shall not apply if it is shown that (1) he is not participating in, or directly interested in, the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work, and (2) he is not a member of an organization which is participating in, or directly interested in, the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work, and (3) he does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in, or directly interested in, the dispute. (Emphasis added.)\nThe determinative factor to the requested relief thus becomes whether the work stoppage was caused by an employer \u201clockout.\u201d The test for assessing responsibility for the work stoppage for purposes of the instant provision was enunciated in Erie Forge and Steel Corporation v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, supra, 400 Pa. at 444-445, 163 A.2d at 91.\n. The law contemplates that collective bargaining will be conducted in good faith, with a sincere purpose to find a basis for agreement. Neither an adamant attitude of \u201cno contract, no work\u201d on the part of the employees, nor an ultimatum laid down by the employer that work will be available only on his (employer\u2019s) terms, are serious manifestations of a desire to continue the operation of the enterprise. While either or both of these positions may legitimately be taken by the parties during the bargaining negotiations prior to the expiration of the existing contract, when the contract has in fact expired and a new agreement has not yet been negotiated, the sole test under \u00a7 402(d) of the Unemployment Compensation Law . of whether the work stoppage is the responsibility of the employer or the employees is reduced to the following: Have the employees offered to continue working for a reasonable time under the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment so as to avert a work stoppage pending the final settlement of the contract negotiations; and has the employer agreed to permit work to continue for a reasonable time under the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment pending further negotiations? If the employer refuses to so extend the expiring contract and maintain the status quo, then the resulting work stoppage constitutes a \u201clockout\u201d and the disqualification for unemployment compensation benefits in the case of a \u201cstoppage of work because of labor dispute\u201d does not apply. (Emphasis added).\nThis test has been consistently followed. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v. Sun Oil Co., 476 Pa. 589, 383 A.2d 519 (1978); Philco Corporation v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 430 Pa. 101, 242 A.2d 454 (1968). As was recognized in Philco Corporation, supra, the Erie Forge test while \u201ceasy to verbalize (is) most difficult to apply to any given set of facts.\u201d The practical approach suggested there is \u201cto determine which side, union or management, first refused to continue operations under the status quo after the contract had technically expired, but while negotiations were continuing.\u201d Id., 430 Pa. at 103, 242 A.2d at 455 (Emphasis added).\nAppellee contends that the Millwrights\u2019 and Ironworkers\u2019 demand for retroactive application from the date of expiration for any additional benefits won under the new contract as a prerequisite to its continuing work, caused the work stoppage and thus blame lay with those parties and not with the employer. Both the Board and the Commonwealth agreed. The problem with this reasoning is it fails to apply the Erie Forge test. Under that test the focus is upon the actions of the parties \u201cafter the contract has in fact expired\u201d and immediately preceding the work stoppage. The assertions, demands and threats of the parties prior to that time are not to be controlling. Such responses are to be anticipated in the effort to reach agreement before the expiration deadline. What is of concern is which party is responsible for causing the work stoppage once it is evident that the expiration date has been reached and a new agreement has not been signed. The demand for retroactive benefits was prior to that point and thus is of no moment in the analysis.\nThe reasoning for this view is that the parties are entitled to use all legitimate pressures they can bring to bear during the negotiations. However, in determining the workers\u2019 right to unemployment benefits, entitlement must turn on the actual conduct of the respective sides and not upon the rhetoric of the negotiations.\nThe testimony reveals a policy decision on the part of management to exclude the Millwrights and Ironworkers if no contract was signed. A directive to that effect went to the guards manning the construction site entrance gates. On the other hand no evidence was presented which showed any directive from the unions\u2019 leaders to membership instructing them not to report. In fact the testimony of the business agent for the Iron workers who also acted as negotiator, shows that the workers were affirmatively told to report.\nThe evidence presented goes on to establish that members of the unions reported for work at the usual time on June 1, 1976, approached the gates to enter the project and were rebuffed by the security guards. In one instant, a union representative (Mr. Jack Doyle), who was able to gain admittance under the guise of a visitor, was tracked down and bodily removed from the premises. An employee of Townsend and Bottum, Inc., who was responsible for the maintenance of security at the gates corroborated the Iron-worker\u2019s testimony. The exclusion procedure was also explained by another security guard. Finally, the Project Labor Coordinator for the employer admitted that the Millwrights and Ironworkers were denied entry to the project site on June 1, 1976.\nQ: I\u2019m talking about June 1 and 2, now.\nA: Yes.\nQ: They were turned away, the ironworkers and mill-rights?\nA: That\u2019s correct.\n(N.T. 568)\nAppellees would have us find that the failure of the Millwrights and Ironworkers to have presented, through an authorized union representative, a written offer to continue working disqualified the members from receiving benefits. In effect, this would be an attempt to require a commitment that Section 402(d) was not designed to elicit. Section 402(d) was not designed to confer a preference at the bargaining table. The evidence presented at the Board hearing showed that several representatives and members of the Millwrights and Ironworkers reported for work on the morning of June 1, 1976. The first contact between the parties following the expiration of the contract reflects that the appellants were willing to continue to work under the terms of the prior, agreement and was prevented from doing so by the employer. By so doing, the appellants offered to continue working for a reasonable time under the circumstances, at the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment.\nTownsend and Bottum, Inc. by directive to their security guards specifically turned away those union members and thereby failed to permit work to continue under the same conditions. The evidence overwhelmingly proves that it was the employer who first refused to maintain the status quo, and thus the work stoppage was the result of a lock-out.\nAlthough the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility to be afforded the witnesses are within the province of the Board as finder of fact, Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v. Tickle, supra; Shira v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 10 Pa.Cmwlth. 457, 310 A.2d 708 (1973), such a body is not free to ignore the overwhelming evidence in favor of a contrary result not supported by the evidence. Here the Board\u2019s findings are contrary to the corroborated credible testimony and cannot be upheld. The record clearly establishes that the Millwrights and Ironworkers were locked out and their rights to benefits should not have been foreclosed.\nWe now turn to the remaining appellants from the Craft Unions who present a different question for our consideration. When the Craft Union reported for work on June 3, 1976, they found that the Millwrights and Ironworkers had established picket lines. Appellee asserts that the Craft Unions\u2019 failure to enter the project that day was caused by their choice to honor the picket lines. We agree that the record amply supports such a view and as a result, these appellants became \u201cparticipants in the labor dispute\u201d and thus not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits under the first proviso of Section 402(d). Appellants counters with the claim that they did in fact cross the picket line only to find the gates locked. Thus it is asserted, they too were \u201clocked-out\u201d and fall within the exclusion of Section 402(d).\nWhile the perimeters of honoring a picket line for purposes of Section 402(d) is one of xirst impression for this Court, the Commonwealth Court has decided a number of cases which dealt with the question of when it is permissible for a union not to cross a picket line and still recover benefits under Section 402(d). These decisions have held that where members of a union voluntarily choose to honor a peaceful picket line, they become participants in the labor dispute and thus ineligible for benefits. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v. Tickle, supra. Only where there is a reasonable fear of violence, based on a showing of threats of violence and force on the picket line can a choice not to cross be rewarded with unemployment compensation benefits. Wright v. Com., Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 45 Pa.Cmwlth. 375, 405 A.2d 991 (1979); Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v. G. C. Murphy Co., 19 Pa.Cmwlth. 572, 339 A.2d 167 (1975); Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v. Tickle, supra.\nTestimony was presented from the guards that were on duty that the entrance gates were never locked on the morning of June 3,1976. The project Construction Manager told the Board that work was available on June the third, but that the \u201cmen were not crossing the picket line.\u201d Moreover, a Craft Union member stated in response to questioning, that he was able to and did enter the site to work on June 3, 1976 and, that while the gate was closed, it was not locked. It is conceded by all parties that the pickets behaved in a peaceful fashion at all times. We affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation of the 402(d) lock-out exception in this regard. The decision to respect the picket line of another, where there is no danger presented, is no different than the judgment to strike. In both situations the legislature has expressed an intention to deny unemployment benefits. The striker and those who stand with him are on the same footing and the legislature has determined that both should be denied benefits under Section 402(d).\nAccordingly, the Commonwealth Court Order affirming the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review is reversed-in-part and affirmed-in-part . That portion of the Order denying benefits to the Millwrights and Ironworkers is reversed and the matter remanded to the Board for the entering of an award in accordance with this Opinion. That portion of the Order denying benefits to the Craft Union is affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., joins in the majority opinion and files a separate concurring opinion.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins the opinion of the Court and also expresses his agreement with the sentiments set forth in the concurring opinion of LARSEN, J.\n. An exception to the Erie Forge test was created in another decision handed down the same day, also authored by Justice Cohen. Hershey Estates v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 400 Pa. 446, 163 A.2d 535 (1960). It was held that where the nature of the industry involved is such that \u201cit would be almost impossible to operate adequately on a day to day basis,\u201d a last minute offer by the union to continue working under the existing terms and conditions, does not \u201cconstitute an offer to continue working for a reasonable time.\u201d Id., 400 Pa. at 450-451, 163 A.2d at 537. In that instance, an additional burden is placed on the union to make an offer which is reasonable and indicates a \u201csincere willingness to continue working for a reasonable time under the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment pending negotiations \u201cprior to the technical expiration of contract.\u201d Id., 400 Pa. at 451, 163 A.2d at 537. Only when \u201cit appears that such an offer would definitely not be acceptable by management\u201d is that burden alleviated. Philco Corporation v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 430 Pa. 101, 104, 242 A.2d 454, 456 (1968). (Emphasis added).\nThe industries involved in the Hershey Estates case and cited as triggering the exception consisted mostly of \u201cservice industries, i. e., hotel, laundry, department store, community inn, etc.\u201d Hershey Estates v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 400 Pa. at 451, 163 A.2d at 537. The industry involved here, construction of a fossil-fuel project, does not fall within the category of \u201cservice industries\u201d that would be impossible to operate on a day to day basis. Thus the Hershey Estate exception is inapplicable to the instant appeal.\n. The Board made the following finding:\nThe union must bear legal responsibility for the work stoppage by its refusal to work under the terms and conditions of the expired labor-management agreement without the guarantee that any new agreement would be retroactive. The employer was willing to continue to provide work under the same terms and conditions of the expired agreement, but would not agree to retroactivity. The union\u2019s demand of retroactive benefits as a part of any interim agreement cannot constitute a bona fide offer to continue work under the terms and conditions of the expired agreement.\nThe employer did deny work to the members of the union at the expiration of the then existing labor-management agreement. However, it was the union\u2019s duty to offer to continue working for a reasonable time under the same terms and conditions of the expired agreement. The union did not meet this duty and responsibility for the work stoppage must be assessed against the union as the party which first refused to maintain the status quo. (Emphasis added.)\nAppeal No. B-76-7-D-695 at 4, Appeal No. B-76-7-K-481 at 4.\n. The Commonwealth Court opined:\nBecause of the demand for retroactive benefits by the Millwrights and Iron Workers, as established by the findings of fact, we must conclude that these claimants did not make a bona fide offer to continue work under the preexisting terms and conditions of employment and therefore the work stoppage here must be assessed against these claimants as the ones which first refused to maintain the status quo. (citations omitted). Borello v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, 40 Pa.Cmwlth. at 364, 397 A.2d at 476.\n. As noted in n. 1, the exception set forth in Hershey Estates, supra, is not here applicable.\n. This was revealed by the testimony of Townsend and Bottum\u2019s Construction Manager.\nQ. But that\u2019s not necessarily the way it would come down from the home office, that\u2019s the way you have interpreted it in your own mind, is that correct?\nA. No, it\u2019s come down from the home office that if we don\u2019t have a signed contract or a signed interim agreement that does not include retroactivity or in the case of master builders, a telegram telling us that they\u2019ve reached tentative agreement, to go ahead and work, you don\u2019t work them.\nSfS * \u2666 * * *\nBY THE REFEREE\nQ. Any other employer? Let the Referee ask you another question, I\u2019m still trying to get this clear in my mind Mr. Butcher, let me give you a hypothetical situation and I ask you weigh it heavily before you answer.

However, I believe there should be an exception to the general rule rendering ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits those employes who refuse to cross a picket line. That exception should allow employes who honor the picket line of locked-out employes to collect unemployment compensation.\nI believe the legislature did intend, as the majority notes, that \u201cthe striker and those who stand with him are on the same footing . . . \u201d and that, in the situation presented herein, the \u201clocked-out\u201d picketers and those who stand with them should be on equal footing, i. e., both groups should be eligible for benefits. Unfortunately, the present language of section 402(d) prohibits us from reaching this conclusion and from finding the Craft Unions\u2019 members eligible for unemployment compensation. I urge the legislature to reconsider this issue.",
