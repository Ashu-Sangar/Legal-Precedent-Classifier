        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn this malpractice action, appellant Stephan Brannan seeks to recover from appellees, Lankenau Hospital and Drs. Eugene Rex and Clifton West, Jr. We are asked to review the trial court\u2019s removal from the jury\u2019s consideration questions of whether appellees Drs. Rex and West negligently treated appellant\u2019s infection and also whether appellee Lankenau Hospital is liable for its intensive care unit staff\u2019s failure properly to monitor appellant\u2019s condition. Review of this record discloses that appellant presented sufficient evidence to warrant submission of these issues to the jury. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court, 254 Pa. Super. 352, 385 A.2d 1376, affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motions to remove the nonsuits.\nOn Saturday evening, August 28,1965, appellant attended a wedding reception at the William Penn Civic Club in Philadelphia. Soon after arriving at the club, he obtained a roast beef sandwich and a glass of beer. His first bite of the thickly sliced beef sandwich became lodged deep in his throat, blocking the throat passage. He immediately attempted to remove the obstruction, but was unsuccessful. Appellant left the reception and went home. There he drank fluids, but still he could not remove the blockage.\nAfter a sleepless night, appellant went to the emergency room at Lankenau Hospital. There, appellee Dr. Rex, ordered x-rays, examined appellant, and recommended surgery for removal of the impacted piece of meat. Appellant initially refused surgery, preferring to await the natural passage of the beef. After Dr. Rex informed appellant that the procedure typically involved only an overnight hospital stay, appellant agreed to the operation.\nAt approximately 4:00 p. m. on August 29, Dr. Rex performed an esophagoscopy on appellant to relieve the blockage. During the surgical procedure, Dr. Rex removed several small portions of meat, eventually reducing the size of the portion to allow its passage into appellant\u2019s stomach. The surgery, however, was imperfect. Dr. Rex\u2019s operative notes reflect that a screw on the forward grasping forceps broke while inside appellant\u2019s esophagus. As a result, the forceps opened suddenly and its narrow, pointed ends touched the walls of the esophagus. Dr. Rex made a visual inspection of the esophageal wall in search of possible perforations. At that time, however, the doctor found no evidence of perforation.\nAppellant was taken from the operating theatre and placed in the recovery room. Shortly after appellant awoke from the anesthesia, he suffered abdominal cramps. By 8:00 p. m., appellant\u2019s body temperature had increased to 100.4\u00b0. Hospital employees promptly notified Dr. Rex of this change in appellant\u2019s condition. Dr. Rex in turn requested that appellee Dr. West, an associate surgeon at Lankenau, examine appellant. Dr. Rex left the hospital without informing Dr. West that the forceps broke during the operation and possibly perforated the esophagus.\nAt about 11:00 p. m., Dr. West, reviewed appellant\u2019s x-rays, then telephoned Dr. Rex at home to discuss appellant\u2019s condition. Dr. West informed Dr. Rex that the x-ray did not clearly indicate a perforated esophagus. Dr. West ordered hospital employees to monitor appellant\u2019s vital signs and to transfer appellant to the main surgical floor intensive care unit of the hospital. Dr. West then left the hospital.\nAt 4:00 a. m. the next morning hospital personnel transferred appellant to the intensive care ward. Appellant\u2019s temperature then had risen to 100.6\u00b0 or 100.8\u00b0. No additional temperature recordings were noted until several hours later that morning. At 8:00 a. m. Dr. West returned to the hospital and discovered that appellant\u2019s temperature had increased to 101.8\u00b0. Appellant\u2019s rate of respiration and pulse had also elevated. Despite appellant\u2019s removal to the intensive care unit, no hospital personnel monitored this change in appellant\u2019s condition. Nor did intensive care personnel notify Dr. West of these changed circumstances. At 8:00 a. m. Dr. West for the first time diagnosed appellant\u2019s condition as a perforated esophagus. By way of treatment, he then ordered the administration of antibiotics.\nAppellant received the first dosage of antibiotics at 12:30 p. m., more than four hour after Dr. West\u2019s order. By that time infection had set in. As a result of the infection, appellant suffered a meningeal stroke, was forced to undergo several additional surgical procedures and lost the full use of his right arm and left leg. These disabilities kept appellant from continuing his previous employment.\nAppellant initiated this malpractice action against Lankenau Hospital on August 28, 1967. Lankenau joined Drs. Rex, West and Hunter S. Neal as additional defendants. The parties engaged in extensive pre-trial discovery, and trial began on December 10, 1974. Appellant proceeded against Dr. Rex on the multiple theories of negligence, alleging that Dr. Rex (1) negligently punctured appellant\u2019s esophagus during surgery when the forceps he used broke, (2) failed to diagnose and treat appellant\u2019s punctured esophagus in a timely manner, (3) did not obtain appellant\u2019s \u201cinformed consent\u201d to this surgical procedure, and (4) failed to inform Dr. West of the forcep problem. Against Dr. West, appellant proceeded on the theory of failure to administer antibiotics at an earlier time. Finally, appellant alleged that Lankenau Hospital, on a theory of respondeat superior, failed to provide adequate care during the time appellant remained in the intensive care unit. At the close of appellant\u2019s case, the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County granted involuntary nonsuits in favor of Lankenau, Dr. Neal and Dr. West. The court also refused to submit to the jury the issue of Dr. Rex\u2019s failure to administer antibiotics at an earlier time. The court did permit appellant\u2019s case against Dr. Rex to go to the jury on the other three issues: that the surgery was negligently performed, that Dr. Rex failed to notify Dr. West of the forcep problem, and that appellant had not \u201cconsented\u201d to surgery.\nThe court justified the nonsuit in favor of Lankenau on the ground that appellant failed to introduce any expert testimony regarding hospital practice, and thus, the issue was not for the jury. As to the alleged negligence of Drs. West and Rex in failing to administer antibiotics, the court determined that appellant\u2019s expert witness (1) \u201cgave contradictory statements with regard to defendants\u2019 negligence\u201d and (2) made it clear that the doctors acted consistently with a respected body of medical thought.\nAfter consideration of the limited issues presented, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Rex. Appellant filed motions for judgment n. o. v. and a new trial. Following argument, on the motions, the court en banc on April 8, 1976, denied appellant\u2019s post-trial motions. On appellant\u2019s appeal, the Superior Court, (Van der Voort, J., dissenting in part), rejected appellant\u2019s contentions and affirmed the trial court order denying appellant relief. We granted allowance of appeal.\nIn passing on the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant appellant\u2019s motion to strike the nonsuits entered in favor of appellees, we must view \u201cthe evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff as true; reading it in the light most favorable to him; giving him the benefit of every reasonable inference that a jury might derive from the evidence and resolving all doubts, if any, in his favor.\u201d Auel v. White, 389 Pa. 208, 210, 132 A.2d 350, 352 (1957). Appellant\u2019s evidence, when reviewed in light of this standard, is sufficient to avoid the entry of a nonsuit in favor of Drs. Rex and West.\nAppellant must satisfy the burden of proving that the act of the physicians or hospital fell below the standard of care owed him. Hamil v. Bashline, 481 Pa. 256, 392 A.2d 1280 (1978); Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 263, 282 A.2d 206 (1971); Donaldson v. Mafucci, 397 Pa. 548, 156 A.2d 835 (1960). To satisfy his burden of proving Drs. Rex and West negligent in failing to administer antibiotics earlier, appellant must introduce expert testimony to show that appellee physicians\u2019 conduct varied from accepted medical practice. Chandler v. Cook, 438 Pa. 447, 265 A.2d 794 (1970); Dornon v. Johnston, 421 Pa. 58, 218 A.2d 808 (1966). This requirement stems from judicial concern that, absent the guidance of an expert, jurors are unable to determine relationships among scientific factual circumstances. McMahon v. Young, 442 Pa. 484, 276 A.2d 534 (1971); Florig v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 388 Pa. 419, 130 A.2d 445 (1957).\nWe are satisfied that appellant offered competent testimony to establish that Drs. Rex and West failed to administer antibiotics at the earliest opportunity. On direct, appellant\u2019s expert Dr. Thompson testified that the recognized standard of care among physicians required the administration of antibiotics immediately upon suspicion of a perforated esophagus. Dr. Thompson stated that both Dr. Rex and Dr. West acted negligently in failing to administer the drugs at the earliest time perforation was suspected.\nWe cannot accept the Superior Court\u2019s view that Dr. Thompson sufficiently equivocated on his direct and re-direct testimony to justify the conclusion that a verdict based upon his testimony would be conjecture. Although after one day of direct testimony Dr. Thompson did indicate on re-direct the next day that he \u201ccan\u2019t answer\u201d whether appellees\u2019 conduct fell below the 1965 standard of care in medical practice, when asked again in that same testimony Dr. Thompson reaffirmed his earlier direct testimony that appellees\u2019 conduct was below the standard. It is true we have previously held that a plaintiff\u2019s case will fail when the testimony of his two expert witnesses is so contradictory that the jury is left with no guidance on the issue, Mudano v. Phila. Rapid Transit Co., 289 Pa. 51, 137 A. 104 (1927). There, however, we stated that the plaintiff\u2019s experts must \u201cso vitally disagree on essential points as to neutralize each other\u2019s opinion evidence.\u201d Id., 289 Pa. at 61, 137 A. at 108. Indeed, since that decision, this Court has allowed juries to consider and resolve conflicts among expert witnesses. See Morrisey v. Commonwealth, Department of Highways, 440 Pa. 71, 269 A.2d 866 (1970) (conflicts in expert testimony on valuation); Abrams v. Phila. Transp. Co., 438 Pa. 115, 264 A.2d 702 (1970) (jury may resolve conflict between parties\u2019 medical experts). See Ayoub v. Spencer, 550 F.2d 164 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S.Ct. 2952, 53 L.Ed.2d 1079 (1977). Furthermore, we have held that conflicts in testimony are fatal only if absolute. Menarde v. Phila. Transp. Co., 376 Pa. 497, 103 A.2d 68 (1954). See Simmons v. Mullen, 231 Pa.Super. 199, 331 A.2d 892 (1974); Fady v. Danielson Construction Co., 224 Pa.Super. 33, 302 A.2d 405 (1973). Thus, unlike the Superior Court, we do not believe this relatively minor divergence in only a part of appellant\u2019s expert testimony, when viewed against the testimony as a whole sufficiently compromised the witness\u2019 testimony on direct to justify removal of this issue from jury consideration.\nIt would equally be error to hold that Dr. Thompson\u2019s testimony established sufficient support for appellee doctors\u2019 conduct. There is, of course, the longstanding rule that the jury may not decide which of \u201ctwo methods, both having their respective advocates and followers of respectable authority, was the safer and better from the surgical standpoint.\u201d Tobash v. Jones, 419 Pa. 205, 217, 213 A.2d 588, 593 (1965), quoting Remley v. Plummer, 79 Pa.Super. 117 (1922). In Duckworth v. Bennett, we stated the rule as, \u201cwhere competent medical authority is divided, a physician will not be held responsible if in the exercise of his judgment he followed a course of treatment advocated by a considerable number of his brethren in good standing in his community.\u201d 320 Pa. 47, 51, 181 A. 558, 559 (1935). Here, appellant\u2019s expert initially testified that he knew of no reason to await final diagnosis of esophageal perforation before administering antibiotics. Although on cross-examination the expert indicated that a \u201csmall respected body\u201d of medical practitioners believed otherwise, this is a far cry from treatment approved by a considerable number of physicians. Indeed, the expert witness reaffirmed on cross-examination that \u201cthe great majority\u201d of physicians would not apply the practice appellee doctors utilized here. Thus, we cannot agree with appellees that Dr. Thompson\u2019s testimony alone triggered the application of the Duckworth standard regarding \u201ca course of treatment advocated by a considerable number of his brethren.\u201d\nThe trial court similarly erred in granting the non-suit in favor of Lankenau Hospital. We have previously discussed the rule requiring that expert testimony be introduced in malpractice actions to establish negligence. Hamil v. Bashline, supra; Chandler v. Cook, supra; Dornon v. Johnston, supra. There is an exception to that rule when, \u201cthe matter under investigation is so simple, and the lack of skill or want of care so obvious, as to be within the range of ordinary experience and comprehension of even non professional persons.\u201d Chandler v. Cook, supra, 438 Pa. at 451, 265 A.2d at 796; Collins v. Hand, 431 Pa. 378, 246 A.2d 398 (1968); Smith v. Yohe, 412 Pa. 94, 194 A.2d 167 (1963). See generally, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 323B(d). We think it clear that staff failure to notify the attending physician of the deteriorating condition of one of his patients falls within the exception to the requirement of expert testimony. Dr. West, upon arrival at the hospital on August 30, discovered that appellant\u2019s condition had deteriorated during the night. His testimony at trial, corroborated by Dr. Rex, indicated that the usual and customary practice in these circumstances requires that a hospital staff member notify the attending physician of changes in the patient\u2019s status. See also Keene v. Methodist Hospital, 324 F.Supp. 233 (N.D.Ind.1971). On the preceding evening, Dr. West left explicit orders that appellant was to be moved to an intensive care unit and that hospital personnel were to monitor appellant\u2019s vital signs. During the night, no hospital staff member monitored changes in appellant\u2019s condition or notified Dr. West. Staff failure here so to notify the supervising physician is a glaring example of want of care. Thus, it was for the jury to consider Lankenau\u2019s liability.\nWe conclude that the trial court erroneously removed from the jury the issue of appellee\u2019s negligent failure to administer antibiotics at the time esophageal perforation was first suspected. Likewise, the trial court improperly entered a nonsuit in favor of appellee Lankenau Hospital.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n. This case arose prior to the enactment of the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, Act of October 15, 1975, P.L. 390, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.101 et seq. Thus, the action proceeded to trial in the court of common pleas, rather than before an arbitration panel.\n. Dr. Neal treated appellant following Dr. West\u2019s diagnosis of infection. Most of the additional surgery on appellant was performed by Dr. Neal, and appellant consulted with Dr. Neal, throughout his treatment for the injuries resulting from the infection. Dr. Neal, however, was removed as a defendant when the trial court granted a nonsuit in his favor. Appellant does not challenge that portion of the trial court\u2019s order.\n. When this case was on appeal to the Superior Court, the trial court filed an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925, that did not support the April 8 order of the court en banc. Rather, the trial judge concluded that appellant should be granted a new trial against Drs. Rex and West. The trial judge issued an order to that effect on September 7, 1976. Appellees moved to strike the September 7 order. Their motion was granted by the Superior Court on September 23, 1976, on the ground that the trial court acted beyond the scope of its jurisdiction in attempting to modify the April 8 order after an appeal had been filed. See Pa.R.C.P. 1701(a).\n. For the same reasons we cannot accept appellees\u2019 alternative contention that Dr. Thompson\u2019s suggestion, on cross-examination, that a \u201csmall respected body\u201d of medical practice supported appellees\u2019 actions makes Dr. Thompson\u2019s testimony unavailable for jury consideration.\nWe note that appellant does not contend appellees\u2019 cross-examination of Dr. Thompson barred appellees\u2019 motion for a nonsuit. See generally Smith v. Standard Steel Car Co., 262 Pa. 550, 106 A. 102 (1919); Hughes v. Westmoreland Coal Co., 104 Pa. 207 (1883).\n. With respect to Lankenau, it is not clear why the hospital failed to administer until 12:30 p. m., antibiotics ordered by Dr. West at 8:00 a. m.\n. From the record, it is not clear why the order Dr. West issued at 11:00 p. m., removing appellant to intensive care, was not executed until 4:00 a. m.\n. In light of our disposition on these claims, we need not reach appellant\u2019s additional contentions of trial court error.",
