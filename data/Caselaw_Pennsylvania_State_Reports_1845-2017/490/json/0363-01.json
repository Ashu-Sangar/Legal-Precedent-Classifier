        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is a child custody case involving a dispute between a parent and a non-parent. The case arose on the petition of the child\u2019s father seeking custody of his daughter Carla. Carla, then eleven years old, had been living with her maternal grandmother. The court of common pleas denied the father\u2019s petition and awarded custody of Carla to her grandmother. On appeal the Superior Court reversed, holding that the trial court, in failing to give the parent-child relationship sufficient consideration, did not apply the proper legal standard. We granted allowance of appeal to consider the important question of what standard should be applied in custody disputes between a parent or parents and non-parents. We conclude that the standard adopted by the Superior Court is the appropriate one.\nThere can be no doubt that in every custody dispute the fundamental issue is the best interest of the child. Yet there can also be no doubt that the parent-child relationship should be considered of importance in determining which custody arrangement is in the child\u2019s best interest. The principles carefully fashioned by the Superior Court in In re Hernandez, 249 Pa.Super. 274, 376 A.2d 648 (1977), and followed by the Superior Court in this case give appropriate weight to these important considerations and we now adopt those principles.\nThe Superior Court in In re Hernandez distinguished three types of custody disputes, those between parents, those between a parent or parents and the state, and those between a parent or parents and a third party. As the court noted, in disputes between parents we have long been guided by the controlling statutory direction to award custody with \u201cregard first being had\u201d to the relative fitness of the contesting parents and \u201cthe best interest and permanent welfare\u201d of the child. Act of June 26, 1895, P.L. 316, \u00a7 2, 48 P.S. \u00a7 92. Thus in such cases the burden of proof is shared equally by the contestants and the child\u2019s well-being is the focus of consideration.\nAt the other extreme are custody disputes between a parent or parents and the state. And in these cases also our Legislature has established clear guidelines and procedures. Here either the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6301 et seq., or the Child Protective Services Law, 11 P.S. \u00a7 2201 et seq. are controlling. Yet the Juvenile Act has as its first express purpose: \u201cTo preserve the unity of the family whenever possible,\u201d \u00a7 6301(b)(1) and thus permits state-enforced custody only when a child is found delinquent or dependent as defined by the Act. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6302. Likewise, the Child Protective Services Law permits protective custody only in cases of abuse, defined in relevant part as \u201cserious physical or mental injury.\u201d 11 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2203.\nBetween these two extremes are custody disputes between a parent or parents and a third party. Here we have neither the inevitability of family dissolution which attends a custody dispute between parents, nor a showing that state intervention is required to protect or rehabilitate the child. And as the Superior Court has correctly recognized, we are not guided in such cases by any similar legislative direction. Thus, in seeking an appropriate standard for the adjudication of such disputes, the Superior Court carefully and thoroughly reviewed prior decisions in this Commonwealth. The court then ultimately relied upon a number of prior decisions holding that parents have a \u201cprima facie right to custody,\u201d which \u201cmay be forfeited if convincing reasons appear that the best interests of the child will be served by awarding custody to someone else.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Kraus v. Kraus, 185 Pa.Super. 167, 170, 138 A.2d 225, 226-27 (1958); see In re Hernandez, supra, 249 Pa.Super. at 284, 376 A.2d at 653 (citing cases). Based on these decisions, the Superior Court, through Judge Spaeth, articulated the following approach:\n\u201cWhen the judge is hearing a dispute between the parents, or a parent, and a third party, . . . [t]he question still is, what is in the child\u2019s best interest? However, the parties do not start out even; the parents have a \u2018prima facie right to custody,\u2019 which will be forfeited only if \u2018convincing reasons\u2019 appear that the child\u2019s best interest will be served by an award to the third party. Thus, even before the proceedings start, the evidentiary scale is tipped, and tipped hard, to the parents\u2019 side. What the judge must do, therefore, is first, hear all evidence relevant to the child\u2019s best interest, and then, decide whether the evidence on behalf of the third party is weighty enough to bring the scale up to even, and down on the third party\u2019s side.\u201d\nId., 249 Pa.Super. at 286, 376 A.2d at 654 (footnote omitted). We agree that this approach is appropriate. Clearly these principles do not preclude an award of custody to the non-parent. Rather they simply instruct the hearing judge that the non-parent bears the burden of production and the burden of persuasion and that the non-parent\u2019s burden is heavy.\nNo doubt in some instances the best interests of the child are served by awarding custody to a non-parent. Experience has taught the unhappy lesson that the parental relationship is not an infallible guarantee that the parent will provide the care and concern essential to a child\u2019s proper development. Thus our Legislature has enacted those procedures already mentioned which allow the state to intervene in instances of delinquency, deprivation or abuse. In addition the Legislature has established express procedures to terminate parental rights in cases of refusal or failure to perform parental duties or in cases of repeated and continued incapacity, abuse or neglect. See Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, art. Ill, \u00a7 311, 1 P.S. \u00a7 311. Such a termination, however, must rest on a demonstration of unfitness or disinterest, and in such a case we are guided by a specific legislative judgment as to when those rights normally resulting from the fact of biological parenthood should be severed.\nAs we have indicated, however, in custody cases such as the present one, no such legislative judgment guides us, and often neither party is demonstrably unfit to act as custodian. In such circumstances the proper judgment as to which custody arrangement will serve the child\u2019s best interest is likely to be less obvious and more subject to the discretion of the hearing judge. We do not question the ability of the judges of our courts of common pleas to reach fair and workable determinations. Nevertheless, we believe the rule we adopt today reflects the important need for restraint in an area where the judiciary should proceed with the utmost caution. Thus where circumstances do not clearly indicate the appropriateness of awarding custody to a non-parent, we believe the less intrusive and hence the proper course is to award custody to the parent or parents.\nViewed in this light, deference to the parental relationship is not an archaic adherence to any property rights theory of the family. Rather, as the United States Supreme Court has stated:\n\u201cThe private interest here, that of a man in the children he has sired and raised, undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection. It is plain that the interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children \u2018come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.\u2019 Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 95, 69 S.Ct. 448, 458, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\u201d\nStanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972). See May v. Anderson, 345 U.S. 528, 533, 73 S.Ct. 840, 843, 97 L.Ed. 1221 (1953); Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). Our determination today is only an appropriate recognition that the blood relationship of parenthood has traditionally served and continues to serve as our society\u2019s fundamental criterion for allocating control over and responsibility for our children, and that without some showing of harm, the courts should not interfere with that arrangement. As the United States Supreme Court has emphasized:\n\u201cIt is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\u201d\nPrince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 1090 (1944). There is no suggestion that this historical and traditional arrangement is invalid or impermissible and we do not believe that it is the role of the courts hastily to dismiss it. See Developments \u2014 The Family, 93 Harv.L.Rev. 1156, 1177-87 (April 1980). As Mr. Justice Powell has written in another context, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions \u201cestablish that the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 1938, 52 L.Ed.2d 53 (1977) (plurality opinion) (footnote omitted).\nFinally, today\u2019s judgment is fully consistent with other recent decisions of this Court, such as Commonwealth ex rel. Spriggs v. Carson, 470 Pa. 290, 368 A.2d 635 (1977). In Spriggs a plurality of this Court discarded the \u201ctender years doctrine\u201d which, as usually applied, had created a presumption that the mother of a young child was a more appropriate custodian than the father. See, e. g., Commonwealth ex rel. Lucas v. Kreischer, 450 Pa. 352, 299 A.2d 243 (1973). Spriggs discarded the \u201ctender years doctrine\u201d because it was improperly based on a \u201cstereotypic\u201d view of the \u201croles of men and women in a marital union,\u201d a view which we considered \u201coffensive to the concept of the equality of the sexes which we have embraced as a constitutional principle within this jurisdiction. See Pa.Const., art. I, \u00a7 28; Conway v. Dana, 456 Pa. 536, 318 A.2d 324 (1974).\u201d 470 Pa. at 299, 300, 368 A.2d at 639, 639-40. Yet because the rule we adopt today accords the same benefits to both fathers and mothers in custody disputes against third parties, nothing said in Spriggs casts any question on this approach. More importantly, a rule giving special weight to the parent-child relationship simply cannot be seen as an outmoded, stereotypical prejudice. Unlike gender, parenthood has never been thought an impermissible basis for legal distinctions. Accordingly, we agree with the Superior Court that the trial court did not apply the appropriate standard in this case.\nThe Superior Court went further, however, and, based on its own review of the record, awarded custody to the father. Although this procedure may not be inappropriate in some cases, we do not believe the present record requires such a result. Rather, our review of the record convinces us that the trial court\u2019s determination may still stand. At the time of the hearing in this case, Carla, then eleven years old, had been living with her grandmother since she was less than two years old. Carla had developed stable and happy relationships with her grandmother, with neighborhood friends and, importantly, at school. In these circumstances we are unwilling now to disturb the trial court\u2019s order granting custody of Carla to her grandmother.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and the order of the Court of Common Pleas is reinstated.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins in this opinion and files a concurring opinion in which NIX, J., joins.\nThis case was reassigned to the present writer on May 27, 1980.",

        "text": "FLAHERTY, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI join with the opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts that the interests of the child, Carla, who is the subject of this custody dispute, would clearly best be served by permitting custody to remain with the child\u2019s grandmother. I am compelled to address, however, the question of the standard to be applied in the resolution of custody disputes, as the opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts does not sufficiently set forth what I would view as a warranted departure from the long-standing rules governing such cases.\nThe hearing court, which awarded custody to Carla\u2019s grandmother, stated in its opinion: \u201cThis court has always been guided by one controlling principle in these matters: the benefit, health and welfare of the child.\u201d Such a statement of the law clearly omitted recognition of a prima facie presumption that parents have a right to custody of their children as against third parties. Therefore, the Superior Court reversed the hearing court and, finding *o convincing reason for overcoming a \u201cpresumption\u201d favoring the parent, awarded custody to appellee. The governing principle heretofore applicable to resolution of custody disputes between parents and third parties has become well established: parents have been \u201cpresumed\u201d to merit custody absent convincing or compelling contraindications that such would not be in the best interests of their children. The legitimacy of determining custody by means of such a presumption is questionable. In Commonwealth ex rel. Spriggs v. Carson, 470 Pa. 290, 300, 368 A.2d 635, 640 (1977), where we overruled the \u201ctender years\u201d presumption that custody should be awarded to mothers rather than fathers, we stated: \u201cCourts should be wary of deciding matters as sensitive as questions of custody by the invocation of \u2018presumptions\u2019. Instead, we believe that our courts should inquire into the circumstances and relationships of all the parties involved and reach a determination based solely upon the facts of the case before the Court.\u201d The same reasoning should apply where the custody dispute is between parents and third parties.\nThe prima facie right here questioned arose not as an absolute property right but rather as a reciprocal of the obligation to care for, support, maintain, and educate one\u2019s offspring. Furthermore, it was founded on the premise that the affection flowing between those standing in the relationship of child and natural parent surpasses that existing between a child and any other person. Commonwealth ex rel. Children's Aid Society v. Gard, 362 Pa. 85, 95, 66 A.2d 300, 305 (1949). Nevertheless, the underlying tenor of the \u201cpresumption\u201d reflects an archaic concept that children are proprietary assets of parents. Serious question may be posed with respect to the soundness of the apriorism that mere biological relationship assures solicitude, care, devotion, and love for one\u2019s offspring. Certainly, when such closeness exists, parenthood would be a strong factor to be prominently weighed in determining a child\u2019s best interest, since effective parental affiliation is in itself of value to a child. However, where a third party better fulfills these needs, or where other circumstances indicate third party custody to be preferable, the courts, when exercising judgment as to a child\u2019s welfare, should not be restrained solely by a presumption.\nThe opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts well notes that the \u201cfundamental issue is the best interest of the child\u201d and that \u201cthe parent-child relationship should be considered to be of importance in determining which custody arrangement is in the child\u2019s best interest\u201d, but does not clearly identify the standard to be applied as solely that of the child\u2019s best interest. The opinion quite properly proclaims that \u201cspecial weight\u201d and \u201cdeference\u201d should be accorded the parent-child relationship, and that the relationship should not be disturbed \u201cwithout some showing of harm\u201d or unless circumstances \u201cclearly indicate the appropriateness of awarding custody to a non-parent.\u201d\nHowever, although according recognition that a child\u2019s best interest should be the paramount concern of a judge, the opinion unfortunately states that the standard applied by the Superior Court in this case was the correct one, rather than the rule applied by the hearing court which omitted recognition of a \u201cpresumption\u201d or \u201cright\u201d favoring the parents. Indeed, Mr. Justice Roberts cites with approval a view that \u201cparents have a \u2018prima facie right to custody,\u2019 which will be forfeited only if \u2018convincing reasons\u2019 appear that the child\u2019s best interest will be served by an award to the third party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In re Hernandez, 249 Pa.Super. 274, 286, 376 A.2d 648, 654 (1977). Such an approach should be replaced with a rule which would simplify and clarify application of the best interest standard. By clearly eliminating the presumption per se, and mandating that custody be determined by a preponderance of evidence, weighing parenthood as a strong factor for consideration, custody proceedings would be disentangled from the burden of applying a presumption that merely beclouds the ultimate concern in these cases: the determination of what affiliation will best serve the child\u2019s interests, including physical, emotional, intellectual, moral, and spiritual well-being.\nNIX, J., joins in this concurring opinion.\n.
