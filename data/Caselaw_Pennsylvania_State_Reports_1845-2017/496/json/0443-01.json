He alleges that the evidence adduced at trial is insufficient, as a matter of law, to sustain the conviction. After a thorough review of the record, we are satisfied that there was ample evidence to prove appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of murder of the third degree.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
