On direct appeal to this Court, appellant contends that (1) the evidence does not support his convictions and (2) because the time to be served for the three convictions runs consecutively and is hence in excess of six months incarceration, he is entitled to the opportunity for a jury trial.\nAfter a thorough review of the record and the issues involved, we conclude that appellant\u2019s arguments are without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
