        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nAppellant Harold L. Scott was originally convicted of murder of the first degree and a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment with a concurrent prison term of two and one-half to five years for the firearms violation. On direct appeal, this Court reversed and granted appellant a new trial because the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence concerning prior racial incidents in the neighborhood. Commonwealth v. Scott, 480 Pa. 50, 389 A.2d 79 (1978).\nOn retrial, which is the subject matter of this appeal, appellant was convicted of murder of the third degree and a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. Post-verdict motions again were denied and appellant was sentenced to a prison term of ten to twenty years with a consecutive prison term of one and one-half to five years for the firearms violation. This appeal followed.\nThe facts are set out in detail in our opinion following appellant\u2019s direct appeal from the original trial. For our purposes here it is sufficient to note, that appellant, a black man, shot a white victim following a racial incident. The Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, friends of the victim, testified that appellant had not been provoked. Appellant has claimed that he acted in self-defense.\nAppellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for violating the Uniform Firearms Act. Appellant was convicted of violating 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6106, which provides:\n\u201cNo person shall carry a firearm in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person, except in his place of abode or fixed place of business, without a license...\u201d\nAct of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 6106. Appellant claims that since the Commonwealth offered no proof of concealment, the evidence was insufficient to sustain this conviction.\nIn Commonwealth v. Butler, 189 Pa.Super. 399, 403, 150 A.2d 172, 173 (1959), the Court stated:\n\u201c. . . The issue of concealment depends on the particular circumstances present in each case, and is a question for the trier of fact.\u201d\nTwo Commonwealth witnesses testified that they saw appellant pull from his waistband something that looked like a gun. Appellant, on the other hand, testified that he approached the group with his gun in his hand, making no attempt to conceal the weapon. Resolving questions of credibility is a function of the trier of fact and apparently the jury chose to believe the Commonwealth witnesses and disbelieve appellant. Further, the testimony of the two Commonwealth witnesses referred to above is sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s conclusion that appellant had, in fact, concealed the weapon. Accord: Commonwealth v. Horshaw, 237 Pa.Super. 76, 346 A.2d 340 (1975). Appellant\u2019s argument is thus without merit.\nAppellant also argues that the trial court erred in ruling that proposed defense witnesses, who intended to testify that appellant had a good reputation for honesty and peacefulness, could be cross-examined about appellant\u2019s two prior arrests, neither of which had led to a conviction. The facts are as follows.\nNear the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief appellant\u2019s attorney informed both the court and the prosecutor, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, that as part of appellant\u2019s defense he intended to call various witnesses who would testify that appellant had a reputation for being honest and peaceful in the community. Appellant\u2019s attorney then asked the trial court to rule preliminarily that the prosecution be prohibited from asking the proposed witnesses on cross-examination if they had heard people in the community mention that appellant had, on two prior occasions, been arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and illegally possessing a firearm. Although neither of the arrests resulted in a conviction, the court denied appellant\u2019s request. Because of the court\u2019s ruling, appellant\u2019s trial counsel announced he would not call the proposed witnesses.\nThis Court has stated:\n\u201cIt is a well established general rule that evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior arrests is inadmissible as tending to prove his disposition to commit crimes generally, or his commission of the specific crime for which he is then standing trial. See 3A Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 980a (Rev. Third Ed., 1970); American Law Institute, Model Code of Evidence, Rule 306 (1942). Wigmore has adequately summarized the purpose of this rule: \u2018.. . a mere arrest or indictment will not be allowed to be inquired after, since the fact of arrest or indictment is quite consistent with innocence, and since the reception of such evidence is merely the reception of somebody\u2019s hearsay assertion as to ... guilt. To admit this would involve a violation both of the hearsay rule and of the rule forbidding extrinsic testimony of misconduct.\u2019 3A Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7 980a (Rev. Third Ed., 1970). When, however, the defendant introduces evidence of his own good character, as was done in the instant case, the Commonwealth is permitted to cross-examine the character witnesses \u2018as to whether or not they ever heard persons in the neighborhood attribute particular offenses to the defendant.\u2019 Commonwealth v. Jenkins, 413 Pa. 606, 607-08, 198 A.2d 497, 498 (1964). (Emphasis in original.)\n\u201cSuch cross-examination is allowed for the purpose of testing the accuracy of the character witness\u2019 testimony to determine whether he is indeed thoroughly familiar with the defendant\u2019s reputation in the community. Commonwealth v. Becker, 326 Pa. 105, 191 A. 351 (1937); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 282 Pa. 20, 127 Atl. 427 (1925). Under this exception to the general rule the prosecution has been permitted to question a character witness as to a prior arrest, whether or not it culminated in an indictment, trial or conviction. Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469 [69 S.Ct. 213], 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); Commonwealth v. Amos, 445 Pa. 297, 300, 284 A.2d 748 (1971).\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Little, 449 Pa. 28, 30-31, 295 A.2d 287, 289 (1972). Appellant specifically asks, however, that we overrule prior case law to the extent that it allowed cross-examination of character witnesses concerning arrests which did not result in convictions.\nThe entire area of the law concerning character witnesses is generally recognized as somewhat of a paradox. As Professor McCormick has stated:\n\u201cBy a rule of relatively recent origin and doubtful expediency, the only way in which character . . . can be proved is by evidence of reputation. This excludes evidence of specific acts or blameless life and rules out opinion evidence as to the character of the accused for the trait in question based on the witness\u2019 knowledge and observation. Reputation evidence, though muted and colorless, is thought to have the advantage of avoiding distracting side issues as to particular acts and incidents in the past life of the accused. The same advantage is, however, also possessed by opinions and exclusion of this latter type of convincing evidence is difficult to justify.\u201d\nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 191, at 455-56 (2d Ed., 1972) (footnotes omitted). Character witnesses, like any other witnesses, can be subjected to cross-examination and it is the scope of the cross-examination that has been a troublesome area for courts, commentators and the profession.\nA vast majority of jurisdictions allow inquiry into past arrests, even if not resulting in convictions, for the reason set forth in Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948).\n\u201cArrest without more may nevertheless impair or cloud one\u2019s reputation. False arrest may do that. Even to be acquitted may damage one\u2019s good name if the community receives the verdict with a wink and chooses to remember the defendant as one who ought to have been convicted. A conviction, on the other hand, may be accepted as a misfortune or an injustice, and even enhance the standing of one who mends his ways and lives it down. Reputation is the net balance of so many debits and credits that the law does not attach the finality to a conviction, when the issue is reputation, that is given to it when the issue is the credibility of the convict.\n\u201cThe inquiry as to an arrest is permissible also because the prosecution has a right to test the qualifications of the witness to bespeak the community opinion. If one never heard the speculations and rumours in which even one\u2019s friends indulge upon his arrest the jury may doubt whether he is capable of giving any very reliable conclusions as to his reputation.\u201d\nId. at 482-83, 69 S.Ct. at 221-22. In these jurisdictions, the inquiry is generally limited to questions in the form, \u201cHave you heard that the defendant was arrested?\u201d Commonwealth v. Amos, 445 Pa. 297, 284 A.2d 748 (1971). Further, where such questioning is permitted, a cautionary instruction must be given informing the jury of the very limited purpose of such evidence, i. e., to refute the evidence of good character and not as substantive evidence of guilt. The Commonwealth thus argues that such questioning must be allowed to subject the defendant\u2019s proof of reputation for good character \u201cto tests of credibility designed to prevent him from profiting by a mere parade of partisans.\u201d Michelson v. United States, supra, at 479, 69 S.Ct. at 220.\nA minority of the jurisdictions at the opposite end of the spectrum forbid any questioning concerning specific incidents of misconduct. Mr. Justice Rutledge, in his dissent in Michelson, represented this minority view.\n\u201cMy own preference and, I think, the only fair rule would be to foreclose the entire line of inquiry concerning specific incidents in the defendant\u2019s past, both on cross-examination and on new evidence in rebuttal. This would leave room for proper rebuttal without turning the defendant\u2019s trial for a specific offense into one for all his previous misconduct, criminal or other, and would put the prosecution on the same plane with the defendant in relation to the use of character evidence.\u201d\nId. at 496, 69 S.Ct. at 228 (Dissenting Opinion). At least three states forbid any questioning concerning specific incidents of misconduct. State v. Williams, 111 Ariz. 511, 533 P.2d 1146 (1975); State v. Robinson, 226 N.C. 95, 36 S.E.2d 655 (1946); People v. Page, 365 111. 524, 6 N.E.2d 845 (1937). As the Arizona Supreme Court has held, cross-examination of character witnesses should be limited\n\u201cTo questions as to the source from which the witness has obtained his knowledge of the reputation of the defendant, and, when he states those sources, permitting questions as to what he has heard therefrom regarding such reputation.\u201d\nViliborghi v. State, 45 Ariz. 275, 286, 43 P.2d 210, 215 (1935). The prosecution, of course, can always call, on rebuttal, its own witnesses who could testify concerning the defendant\u2019s bad reputation for the traits raised by defendant\u2019s character witnesses.\nInstantly, appellant argues, and quite convincingly in our view, that his proposed evidence concerning his reputation for being honest and peaceful was essential to his defense. As appellant states in his brief:\n\u201cIn the instant case the appellant, a black man, was accused of killing a white man without provocation and with racial overtones. The friends of the victim who were involved in chasing some young blacks and fighting with them prior to the shooting so testified. The appellant, who testified, his wife and a neighbor seriously and critically disputed the facts as presented by the Commonwealth witnesses. Appellant claimed that he killed in self defense.\n\u201cIn other words, the fate of the appellant rose or fell with his credibility and the impression that the jury formed of him \u2014 was he an honest and believable person, and in addition, was he a peaceful person. Had the jury put more credence in either of these traits \u2014 honesty or peacefulness (not necessarily both \u2014 a verdict of something less than third degree murder might have resulted).\u201d\n(Appellant\u2019s brief at 13-14). Appellant, however, chose not to introduce the evidence because of the trial court\u2019s ruling refusing to limit the Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination. We agree that appellant did not receive a fair trial and therefore is entitled to a new trial.\nEven a proponent of the rule allowing cross-examination concerning arrests which have not resulted in convictions has stated:\n\u201cWe concur in the general opinion of courts, textwriters and the profession that much of this law is archaic, paradoxical and full of compromises and compensations by which an irrational advantage to one side is offset by a poorly reasoned counterprivilege to the other. But somehow it has proved a workable even if clumsy system when moderated by discretionary controls in the hands of a wise and strong trial court. To pull one misshapen stone out of the grotesque structure is more likely simply to upset its present balance between adverse interests than to establish a rational edifice.\u201d\nMichelson v. United States, supra at 486, 69 S.Ct. at 223. We believe, however, that when that one misshapen stone is so prejudicial to an accused that the prejudicial effect greatly outweighs the limited probative value, that stone must be removed.\n\u201cThe rule permitting the cross-examiner to ask the character witness whether he \u2018has heard\u2019 ... of other particular crimes of accused involving the same trait is pregnant with possibilities of destructive prejudice.\u201d\nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 191, at 451 (2d Ed. 1972).\nUnder this rule which we abrogate, the cross-examination must have pertained to arrests which relate to the character trait vouched for on direct. McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 191, n. 14 (2d Ed. 1972). Thus, the Commonwealth would have been permitted to ask appellant\u2019s character witnesses if they had heard that appellant had been arrested for assaulting his wife and on a weapons charge. Despite any cautionary instruction the court may have given the jury, the undue prejudice to appellant is obvious. On one hand, the jury would have heard that appellant had a reputation for being peaceful while on the other hand, the jury would also have heard that appellant had been arrested on two charges. Had appellant been convicted of the charges, it would be easier to say that he must suffer the consequences of placing his character at issue. But instantly, the arrests which would have been alluded to never resulted in convicti\u00f3ns. Since an arrest is equally consistent with either guilt or innocence, the eases allowing such cross-examination are overruled.\nJudgment of sentence is reversed and case remanded for a new trial.\n. A defendant is entitled to a charge that character evidence alone may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt and thus justify an acquittal of the charges. Commonwealth v. Cleary, 148 Pa. 26, 23 A. 1110 (1892); Commonwealth v. Shapiro, 223 Pa.Super. 15, 297 A.2d 161 (1972).\n. In Commonwealth v. Summers, 269 Pa.Super. 437, 410 A.2d 336 (1979), the Superior Court held that a defendant could show that the charges had been dismissed. We believe the Commonwealth would then have to be allowed to offer evidence as to why the charges had been dismissed. Rather than allowing inquiry into areas which are far afield from the question of a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on the charge for which he is standing trial, we believe a better solution is simply to forbid such cross-examination.",
