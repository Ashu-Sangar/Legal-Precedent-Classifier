        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nAppellee, Catherine Maurizio, was served with a lawful subpoena directing her appearance as a Commonwealth witness at the homicide trial of Richard M\u00e1rchese. Because she failed to appear, appellee was arrested pursuant to a bench warrant issued by the trial court. Following a hearing, the trial court ruled that appellee\u2019s failure to appear at the M\u00e1rchese trial constituted indirect criminal contempt of court. Appellee was sentenced to pay a fine of $300.\nThe Commonwealth filed a direct appeal to this Court, and now argues that the trial court committed an error of law in ruling that appellee\u2019s conduct constituted only indirect criminal contempt. We believe, however, that the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal must be quashed.\nIt has long been well-settled that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the prosecution from appealing a verdict of acquittal. United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896). Further, the verdict of acquittal need not be expressed to allow application of the aforementioned principle. Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). Even where the acquittal is the result of an error of law, the judgment of acquittal bars any retrial. Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141, 82 S.Ct. 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962), Commonwealth v. Haines, 410 Pa. 601, 190 A.2d 118 (1963). Over a century ago, this Court stated:\n\u201cIt must be remembered that criminal contempt of court is a specific criminal offense. It is punished sometimes by indictment, and sometimes in a summary proceeding, as it was in this case. In either mode of trial, the adjudication against the offender is a conviction, and the commitment in consequence is execution: ([Kearney\u2019s Case] 7 Wheat. 38.)\u201d\nPassmore Williamson\u2019s Case, 26 Pa. 9 (1855).\nThere are two classes of criminal contempt recognized in this Commonwealth, i.e. direct and indirect. As we stated in Commonwealth v. Marcone, 487 Pa. 572, 579, 410 A.2d 759, 762-763 (1980):\n\u201cThe essence of [direct criminal] contempt is that the misconduct constitutes a direct affront to the dignity and authority of the court. . . . Where that disobedience or misbehavior occurs in the actual presence of the court or has the capacity of directly affecting the proceeding then in progress, it may be properly classified as a direct or the most grievous type of contempt. All other behavior which may have a more remote impact upon the dignity of the court and its ability to fulfill its responsibilities are classified as indirect criminal contempts.\u201d\nIn providing for the allowable punishments for contempt, the legislature has recognized the direct-indirect classification.\n\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, the punishment of imprisonment for contempt as provided in Section 4131 (relating to classification of penal contempts) shall extend only to such contempts as shall be committed in open court, and all other contempts shall be punished by fine only.\u201d\nAct of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, as amended, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4132.\nBoth this Court and the legislature have thus recognized that conduct which constitutes indirect criminal contempt is less egregious than that required for direct criminal contempt. With that being so, we are unable to distinguish the instant case from one where either a judge or jury convicts a defendant of voluntary manslaughter and either expressly or impliedly acquits that defendant of the higher degrees of criminal homicide. In the latter situation, the Commonwealth could not appeal and argue that the defendant should have been convicted of either murder of the first degree or murder of the third degree. Neither can the Commonwealth do so in the instant case. Commonwealth v. Wimberly, 488 Pa. 169, 411 A.2d 1193 (1980), Commonwealth v. Haines, supra.\nAppeal quashed.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. In Green, the defendant was tried for murder and the Court informed the jury that they could find defendant guilty of either murder of the first degree, or murder of the second degree. The jury, without making any express finding on murder of the first degree, convicted the defendant of murder of the second degree. Following a retrial, the Court ruled that the implied acquittal of the former offense precluded retrial on that charge.\n. In Fong Foo, the trial court directed, without any authority, the jury to return verdicts of acquittal as to all defendants. Despite the clearly erroneous action by the trial court, the Supreme Court held the prosecution could not appeal from the judgments of acquittal.\n. While appellee has never filed a motion to quash the appeal on these grounds, this Court can always raise its lack of jurisdiction sua sponte. Commonwealth v. Saunders, 483 Pa. 29, 394 A.2d 522 (1978).",

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. The majority has misconstrued the issue in this appeal: the focus of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is not on whether appellee\u2019s contempt was direct or indirect, but is, rather, on whether appellee\u2019s contempt was committed in open court, thus justifying the imposition of a term of imprisonment.\nIn this case, the trial court found that appellee\u2019s failure to appear in court pursuant to a lawful subpoena constituted indirect criminal contempt as defined in 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4131(2), and that the contempt was not committed in open court. In accordance with its findings, the trial court imposed a fine of $300, but no term of imprisonment.\nThe punishment of imprisonment for those criminal con-tempts defined in 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4131 \u201cshall extend only to such contempts as shall be committed in open court.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4132. Thus, the distinction between direct and indirect criminal contempt is irrelevant for purposes of sentencing under this statute and for purposes of resolving this appeal.\nThis Court has defined \u201copen court\u201d as a court \u201c \u2018which has been formally convened and declared open for the transaction of its proper judicial business.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Ferrara, 487 Pa. 392, 400, 409 A.2d 407, 411 (1979). The defendants in Ferrara were convicted of contempt for their failure to appear in court when required, and this Court concluded that \u201c[ajppellants\u2019 failure to appear on the scheduled dates for arraignment and for trial were acts committed in \u2018open court\u2019 (that is, in a court \u2018convened and declared open for the transaction of its proper judicial business\u2019) and therefore, their contemptuous conduct can be punished by imprisonment.\u201d Id.\nIn this case, appellee was subpoenaed to appear as a witness in a criminal trial \u2014 in a court convened and declared open for the transaction of its proper judicial business. Therefore, appellee\u2019s contempt was likewise committed in open court. The trial court thus committed an error of law when it concluded that the contempt in this case was not committed in open court within the meaning of 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4132, and that appellee could not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for her contumacious behavior.\nI am also at a complete loss as to the majority\u2019s reason for quashing the instant appeal. The majority cannot have it both ways: it cannot decide this appeal on the merits, and then quash the appeal because this Court lacks jurisdiction. Even though a direct appeal to this Court was not available in cases of indirect criminal contempt at the time this case arose, appellee\u2019s failure to object to such a lack of jurisdiction operates to perfect this Court\u2019s jurisdiction:\nThe failure of an appellee to file an objection to the jurisdiction of an appellate court within such time as may be specified by general rule, shall, unless the appellate court otherwise orders, operate to perfect the appellate jurisdiction of such appellate court ....\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 704(a). See also Rule 741(a), Pa.R.A.P.\nI would vacate the judgment of sentence and remand this case for resentencing.\n. The Commonwealth, in its brief before this Court, states: \u201cThe sole question before this Honorable Court is whether the contempt herein was a contempt in \u2018open court\u2019 warranting the imposition of a term of imprisonment.\u201d\n. The criminal contempt in this case is defined as follows:\nThe power of the several courts of this Commonwealth to issue attachments and to inflict summary punishments for contempts of court shall be restricted to the following cases:\n(2) Disobedience or neglect by ... witnesses of or to the lawful process of the court.\n. The majority\u2019s reliance upon double jeopardy arguments is likewise irrelevant for purposes of resolving this appeal.\n. The defendants in Ferrara were charged with contempt under Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 784, \u00a7 23, 17 P.S. \u00a7 2041 (replaced as of June 27, 1978 by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4131), and, like appellee in the present case, were convicted of contempt for their \u201cdisobedience or neglect by officers, parties, jurors or witnesses of or to the lawful process of the court.\u201d\n. The instant appeal is from an order of the Allegheny County Court of Common-Pleas filed on July 1, 1980. At that time, this Court had jurisdiction over direct appeals in cases of direct criminal contempt. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(4), as it existed prior to its amendment in September, 1980.",
