Following denial of post verdict motions, appellant was sentenced to two consecutive ten-to-twenty year terms for the robbery and burglary convictions, and a concurrent sentence of life imprisonment for the murder conviction. This appeal followed. We affirm.</p>

The body was found by Norman Richardson, the child’s father, when Mr. Richardson returned home from work. Mr. Richardson called the police, who unsuccessfully attempted to revive the boy, but when the first police officer arrived, the body was already cold. The pockets of the victim’s trousers were turned inside out and the money his parents had given him that morning, a little more than two dollars, was missing.</p>

A piece of weather stripping, which the medical examiner indicated may have been used to cause death, was also found. Additionally, appellant’s palm print was found on the cover of the stereo. Although appellant lived a few doors from his uncle’s house, the scene of the killing, evidence at trial established that prior to June 2,1978, he had not been in his uncle’s house since October of 1977, and further, that the palm print was of recent origin.</p>

In order to prevent any reference to the burglary from being made, the prosecutor instructed his witnesses not to mention the burglary directly, but to refer to it by date, October, 1977, if it were appropriate to refer to the prior burglary. Further, the prosecutor, on several occasions, cautioned defense counsel to be careful in this area of cross examination, and defense counsel stated that he appreciated “the prosecutor’s concern over this dangerous line of cross examination.”</p>
    <p id="b599-10" data-blocks='[["BL_599.9",599,[203,1366,1153,418]]]'>The date of the prior burglary was relevant because the prosecutor wanted to establish that the appellant had not been permitted in his uncle’s house since October, 1977, and thus, his palm print on the stereo must have been placed during his commission of the robbery-murder.
