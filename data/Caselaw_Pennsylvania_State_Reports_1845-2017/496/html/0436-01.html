This Court has adopted the test for legal sanity announced in <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>M’Naghten, </em>10 Cl. &amp; Fin. 200, 8 Eng.Rep. 718 (1843), which provides that an accused is criminally responsible unless at the time of committing the act, due to a defect of reason or disease of the mind, the accused (1) did not know the nature and quality of the act or (2) did not know that the act was wrong. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant introduced psychiatric testimony that she did not know right from wrong, hence appellant’s insanity claim rests on the second part of the <em>M’Naghten </em>test. We find, however, that the evidence (read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, <em>Commonwealth v. Green, <a href="/pa/493/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="493 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="8732961" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0409-01">supra)</a> </em>proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant did know the killing was wrong.</p>

Demmitt, supra. </em>Appellant confessed that she told her dead child, “I had to kill you, I’m sorry.” Moreover, when asked by the interrogating detective, “Do you know the difference between right and wrong?” Appellant responded, “Yes, I know killing Greg was wrong.” All other portions of appellant’s confession are coherent and evince appellant’s lucidity. Furthermore, the testimony of lay witnesses can establish appellant’s sanity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em><a href="/pa/485/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="485 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1755620" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0344-01">485 Pa. 344</a>, <a href="/pa/485/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="485 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1755620" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0344-01">402 A.2d 995</a> (1979). The interrogating detective testified that appellant was lucid and responsive throughout the interview. Appellant’s husband, the first person on the scene, testified that his wife <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>was calm. Finally, the medical testimony in this case belies appellant’s insanity claim. Dr. Burt and Dr. Glass, both called for the defense, testified that appellant could tell right from wrong. Dr. Glass so stated unequivocally. Dr. Burt, while admitting that appellant could tell right from wrong “on the surface”, claimed that she <em>really </em>could not, due to her psychosis. The trial court expressly rejected Dr. Burt’s testimony as vacillating and imprecise. The trier can repudiate even expert psychiatric testimony of insanity. <em>Commonwealth v. Hicks, <a href="/pa/483/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="483 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1751231" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0305-01">supra.</a> </em>Accordingly, the evidence is sufficient to sustain a finding that appellant was sane.</p>

Appellant told her husband that she planned the killing three days in advance. (In fact, appellant pondered “bumping off” her husband as well.) Appellant told Dr. Glass that she considered using poison, drowning, or firearms on her child and husband. Further, appellant’s confession contains the following exchange:</p>

    <p id="ADl" data-blocks='[["BL_516.8",516,[268,605,1158,1212]]]'>Filling the tub with additional water to facilitate the drowning compels the inference that appellant possessed the specific intent to kill. The very manner of the killing also supports this inference. The medical examiner testified that Gregory had cuts and scratches on the left side of his neck and his upper left arm. This corroborates appellant’s account of Gregory’s struggles while he was held under water. Appellant persisted in holding Gregory down despite his plea, “Mommy you’re drowning me.” We can infer the specific intent to kill from the act of forcibly holding a thrashing victim under water until he ceases to struggle. This is similar to inferring a specific intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital 'part of the body. <em>See Commonwealth v. Thornton, </em><a href="/pa/494/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="494 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1769124" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0260-01">494 Pa. 260</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="494 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1769124" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0260-01">431 A.2d 248</a> (1981). Finally, while demonstrating motive is not necessary to prove murder of the first degree, it is probative evidence of specific intent to kill. <em>Commonwealth v. Tomoney, </em><a href="/pa/488/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="488 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1761023" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0324-01">488 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/pa/488/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="488 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1761023" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0324-01">412 A.2d 531</a> (1980). Appellant repeated, at various times, her motive for the killing — that Gregory got on her nerves and that she wanted her husband and child out of her life. We conclude that the Commonwealth has adduced ample evidence to reject the diminished capacity defense and prove that appellant possessed the specific intent to kill.</p>

The record, however, reveals that after having been advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant waived them and gave a voluntary confession. In a conversation with Dr. Glass over two years later, appellant remembered receiving her <em>Miranda </em>warnings. After the warnings, appellant was fully aware of why she was in the police station: “Because I drowned my son.” The interrogating detective testified that she was lucid and <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>responsive throughout the interview, and her coherent confession bears this out. Appellant recalls being treated well at the station. Dr. Glass testified that appellant’s memory of events was intact, and that her intelligence was the “dull normal” range. Dr. Glass also testified that in his opinion appellant understood the words of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that her confession was voluntarily given. This evidence supports the lower court’s findings that appellant’s confession was voluntary and that her waiver of her <em>Miranda </em>rights was not defective.</p>
