The burden must be affirmatively met, however, and is not to be merely <em>presumed </em>satisfied by the bare fact that the terminated employee held membership in a defeated political party. In the court below, appellant’s <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>proffered testimony indicated that he was a politically active member of the Democratic Party, maintained a meritorious performance record in the position of employment from which he was discharged, and lost his job after Governor Thornburgh, a Republican, assumed office. In addition, appellant’s immediate supervisor and certain other Department of Labor and Industry officials subordinate to Secretary Joseph testified that they were not, at the time of appellant’s dismissal, aware of a high-level personnel review that appellees assert culminated in the dismissal. Such a showing, alone, falls considerably short of that necessary to prove that political affiliation was a “motivating factor” in the dismissal.</p>

Acceptance of such a suggestion would, as a corollary, require that a terminated employee’s threshold burden of proof, under <em>Mount Healthy, </em>supra, be regarded as satisfied merely upon a showing that the employee was not a member of the “in-party”. Such an approach presents a substantial danger to the efficiency of government, and constitutes an impediment to the implementation of the voters’ mandates. When public officials are elected to invoke policies promoting governmental efficiency, they must not be shackled to a system that unnecessarily inhibits actions deemed necessary to meet efficient administrative and budgetary requirements. The <em>Mount Healthy </em>allocation of burden of proof adequately protects the First Amendment interests of employees. Yet, unless the threshold burden set forth in <em>Mount Healthy </em>is <em>strictly </em>met by terminated employees, successful political candidates will repeatedly be subjected to the needless and undesirable burden of proving the propriety of wholly responsible and legitimate reductions in governmental employment. Furthermore, a lax application of the threshold requirement would result in governmental employees enjoying a certain degree of immu<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>nity to dismissal <em>solely </em>by reason of their <em>not </em>being members of the “in-party”.</p>
    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[241,407,1161,1660]]]'>An ample basis appears in the record to sustain the lower court’s determination that appellant’s allegation of a political dismissal rested merely on “his own belief, with nothing more to support it beyond the fact that the present administration is Republican and he is Democratic.” Indeed, appellant made no attempt to prove more than his own belief, leaving entirely to unsupported inference the threshold burden of proving motivation for his dismissal. The facts that an employee with a good performance record is discharged, and that supervisors not alleged by appellees to have participated in the review culminating in the dismissal were unaware of the review being conducted, do not create an inference of a tainted motive for the administration’s actions. Certainly, a multitude of reasons may exist for employment terminations. Here, appellant has failed to establish that political animus was, to any extent, a motivating factor in his dismissal. No evidence was introduced of wholesale dismissals of “out-party” members by the incoming administration; of statistics indicating employment retention or replacement policies were based on political affiliation as opposed to merit selection; of appellant’s having been replaced by a less qualified affiliate of the incoming administration; of inquiries by that administration into the political alliances of employees; of statements of political animus by the employer indicating membership in the “in-party” to be a prerequisite to retention or hiring; or of any other form of evidence bearing on motivation. Our decision, therefore, affirming the Commonwealth Court’s dismissal of the petition in question, rests solely upon appellant’s failure to meet the <em>threshold </em>burden of proof established by <em>Mount Healthy, </em>supra.</p>

Evidence adduced on behalf of the appellees included testimony of former Secretary Joseph, who is a member of the Democratic Party, and of the Deputy Secretary for Administration in the Department of Labor and Industry, setting forth numerous apolitical reasons for the employment termination. These included the consideration that appellant and his supervisor both had the same job classification, resulting in an unusual lack of subservience in the organizational structure and creating a surplus of supervisory personnel for a bureau as small as the Division of Prevailing Wage. In addition, there was testimony that appellant’s job was one of forty positions eliminated pursuant to an administrative and budgetary review conducted by the Secretary and Deputy Secretary in compliance with instructions from the Office of Budget Administration. Significantly, appellant’s position was never refilled; hence, there is not even an allegation that cronyism guided the selection of a replacement.</p>

Aside from expanding the morass of bureaucratic paperwork, such a requirement of documentation would reflect the unjustified presumption that, in the usual case, a dismissal is naturally attributable to an illegitimate motive. Further, it presupposes that administration officials will prevaricate to establish an ex <em>post facto </em>apolitical rationale for their action. The lower court’s determination that the dismissal in question was motivated by a review of personnel and budgetary requirements was, therefore, quite amply supported by competent evidence.</p>

To the contrary, the notice of dismissal recognized and commended appellant for his faithful service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Nevertheless, the majority sustains the dismissal because appellant has failed to establish that he was without fault. In so doing, the fundamental evidentiary principle that one cannot fairly be required to prove a negative has been ignored. <em>See Barrett v.

The judgment today unnecessarily constitutionalizes another element of American life — an element certainly not without its faults but one which generations have accepted on balance as having merit.
