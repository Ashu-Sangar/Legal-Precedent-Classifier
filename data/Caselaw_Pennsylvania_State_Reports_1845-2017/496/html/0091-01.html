The entire incident lasted several minutes. One of the men wore a red ski mask and was armed with a shotgun. During the robbery, the gunman shot and killed James T. Hogan, a patron of the bar. Thomas McBride, another patron, attempted to disarm the gunman after the shooting. The gunman’s ski mask came off during his fight with McBride at which time McBride found himself face to face with the gunman. After a brief struggle, McBride was struck from behind on the head, became momentarily stunned, and gave up the fight.</p>
    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[256,838,1157,208]]]'>That morning, McBride gave police a description of all three robbers. McBride’s description of the gunman included the gunman’s race, height, weight, color of hair, and hair length.</p>

    <p id="b169-6" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[211,874,1151,629]]]'>There are many factors which support the reliability of McBride’s identification from the videotaped lineup. McBride had several minutes to observe the gunman at the time of the offense. When the gunman’s ski mask came off in the struggle over the shotgun, he and McBride were less than a foot apart. Although the lighting in the bar was dim there was enough light for McBride to make out the features of the gunman. Shortly after the shooting, McBride gave police a detailed description of the gunman. The videotaped lineup from which McBride identified appellant as the gunman was conducted less than a month after the incident.</p>
    <p id="b169-7" data-blocks='[["BL_169.6",169,[209,1549,1152,792]]]'>Despite these indicia of reliability, appellant asserts that the videotaped lineup was impermissibly suggestive because four of the six persons in appellant’s lineup had also participated in another videotaped lineup which had been previously viewed by McBride. However these four men were clean shaven when they appeared in the earlier lineup. When they appeared in appellant’s lineup all had donned mustaches so that their facial appearance would conform to appellant’s. Moreover, both lineups were taped in black and white thereby minimizing distinctions that might have appeared if the lineups had been taped in color. Weighing the allegedly “corrupting effects” of the lineup against the factors which support the validity of the identification, we conclude that McBride’s out-of-court identification is reliable.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.3",170,[287,287,1159,564]]]'>
      <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>Appellant's challenge to the in-court identification on the ground that the out-of-court identification was unduly suggestive necessarily must fail. In any event, McBride’s in-court identification similarly satisfies the reliability standard. The factors supporting the validity of McBride’s out-of-court identification also support the validity of his in-court identification.

The Commonwealth introduced evidence at trial that the murder victim had lost a substantial amount of blood, that the gunman had been in close proximity to the victim and that appellant had been wearing work boots on the night of the incident. The Commonwealth then introduced a pair of work boots belonging to appellant. The expert witness testified for the Commonwealth that the soles of these boots tested positively for hemoglobin. The expert was unable to state the age of the hemoglobin or whether it had been derived from human or animal blood.</p>

Although the probative value of the evidence may have been weakened by the inability of the expert to testify that it was human blood, so was the possible prejudicial effect. A determination of the weight merited by such testimony was therefore properly left to the jury to make, in light of all the testimony before it.”</blockquote>
