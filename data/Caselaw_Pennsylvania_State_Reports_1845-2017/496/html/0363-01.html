(Some of these cases have spoken of the authority of the legislature to “abolish” or “extinguish” a cause of action. None of these cases, however, dealt with legislation which extinguished a cause of action <em>in toto </em>leaving a plaintiff who had suffered a legal injury completely without any remedy. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the “abolition” language of these cases could support a total extinction of a cause of action without substituting some sort of remedy. For example, could the legislature abolish <em>all </em>causes of action for, say, the common law tort of trespass, leaving no viable, substitute remedy for injuries caused by <em>any </em>of the various types of trespass? I think not, despite the dicta to the contrary in the above cited cases. Or, could the legislature say “Because suits in assumpsit are a drain upon our judicial system, we hereby abolish all causes of action based upon breach of contract.”? Again, such a sweeping “abolition” would probably not withstand the proscription of Article I, § 11.)</p>
