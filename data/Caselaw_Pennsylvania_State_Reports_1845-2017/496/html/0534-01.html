William R Jordan (“Jordan”), an “investigator” employed by appellants’ law firm (“firm”), frequently appeared at accidents, hospitals, and the homes of accident victims for the purpose of persuading potential claimants to retain the firm. Contingent fee agreements were then filed by appellants in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia which falsified referral sources in an effort to conceal their unethical solicitations. Appellants thereafter compounded their earlier transgressions by counseling and requesting clients and former clients to testify falsely before the investigating judge in the Special Judicial Investigation. The sufficiency of the evidence establishing these facts is not challenged.</p>

On the same day, appellants filed a Notice of Appeal and requested this Court to stay the trial until their double jeopardy claim had been resolved. We orally denied appellants’ request for a stay, and the trial proceeded. The Disciplinary Court issued its Adjudication and Imposition of Discipline on August 6,1980. An appeal was taken to this Court, and on September 2, 1980, the Disciplinary Court stayed imposition of discipline. On December 2, 1980, all pending appeals were consolidated by this Court.</p>

In those cases, the courts held that the introduction of evidence of prior convictions was so inflammatory and prejudicial that fair trial was not possible. Here, on the other hand, the allegedly prejudicial information related solely to appellants’ prior invocation of the right against self-incrimination and this information was provided to the Disciplinary Court by appellants. Cf. <em>Baxter v. Palmigano, <a href="/us/425/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="425 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="6176514" data-case-paths="/us/425/0308-01">supra, </a></em><a href="/us/425/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="425 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="6176514" data-case-paths="/us/425/0308-01">n.11</a>.</p>

Appellants also contend that the Disciplinary Court erred in refusing to conduct a complete evidentiary hearing on their claim of selective prosecution. It is settled, however, that not all selective prosecution is forbidden; only selective prosecution based on some unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification is constitutionally proscribed. <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em><a href="/us/368/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="368 U.S. 448" data-case-ids="6173353" data-case-paths="/us/368/0448-01">368 U.S. 448</a>, <a href="/us/368/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="368 U.S. 448" data-case-ids="6173353" data-case-paths="/us/368/0448-01">82 S.Ct. 501</a>, <a href="/us/368/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="368 U.S. 448" data-case-ids="6173353" data-case-paths="/us/368/0448-01">7 L.Ed.2d 446</a> (1962); <em>Shade v.

Appellants here have not even alleged selective prosecution based on race, religion, or other suspect classification, and have failed to demonstrate even a colorable entitlement to the claim of selective prosecution. The Disciplinary Court thus did not err in refusing to conduct a full evidentiary hearing on the issue. <em>United States v.
