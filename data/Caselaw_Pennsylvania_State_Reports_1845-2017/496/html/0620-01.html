The duty of the appellate court is to examine the testimony in the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the fact-finder has ruled, giving that party the benefit of all logical and reasonable inferences from the testimony, to see if substantial evidence exists to support the ruling. <em>Id; see Fitterling v.

Originally, the Act spoke in terms of compensation for “total unemployment” but, with the removal of the word “total” in 1945 and the redefinition of “unemployed” in section 4(u) in 1951 to include weeks of less than full-time work, it has been unquestioned that temporary unemployment is compensable. <em>Susquehanna Collieries Division, the M.A. Hannah Co. v.

The brief submitted by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce rather cavalierly suggests that a person unemployed for such a brief period of time and expecting to return to work for the same employer is not really distressed and therefore not in need of unemployment compensation because such person is in little danger of “immediate poverty”, brief at 7, and is “merely inconvenienced.” Brief at 8. Perhaps the members of the chamber of commerce and the writers of the brief have been fortunate enough to have been spared the anxiety and distress of living from day to day with the disastrous consequences that even a relatively minor disruption to the flow of income can produce. They should not allow their good fortune, however, to blind them to the needs of those less fortunate. Indeed, in the instant matter, appellant lost seven days of work — and seven days of income — in one month. To some, perhaps, this might be a “mere inconvenience”; to others, however, it might mean a week’s groceries or a month’s heat.</p>
