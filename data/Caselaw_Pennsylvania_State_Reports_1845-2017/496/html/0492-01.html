We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b567-10" data-blocks='[["BL_567.10",567,[205,1261,1153,413]]]'>Appellant was found guilty by a court sitting without a jury on January 3, 1977. Appointed trial counsel filed a timely motion in arrest of judgment or for a new trial on appellant’s behalf. On March 15, 1977, the court denied relief and imposed a sentence of six to twenty years’ imprisonment for the murder. The court also imposed a sentence of five to ten years’ imprisonment for the conspiracy, to run concurrent to the murder sentence.</p>

I’m going to tell you what they are right now. You may wish to appeal the judgment of guilty in this case because there was insufficient evidence. You may wish to appeal because something was improperly or illegally done at any point in this case prior to the trial or after the trial. In the event you wish to take an appeal you must take it within 30 days from today’s date. If you appeal the murder conviction it has to be appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. If you appeal the conspiracy conviction you must appeal it to the Superior <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>Court of Pennsylvania.

Appellant alleged that, following his convictions he had “wished to take an appeal and thought that his counsel had filed an appeal for [him].” This Court remanded the petition to the court of common pleas with the direction to treat the matter as a petition for post-conviction relief.</p>
