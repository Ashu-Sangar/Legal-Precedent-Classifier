Appellant alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>to raise a timely motion to dismiss charges on the ground that trial was not commenced within the time required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100. Because we conclude that the requirements of Rule 1100 were in fact satisfied, we hold that appellant’s allegation of ineffectiveness is without support on the record. Thus, we affirm the order of the PCHA court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Thus, because jury selection did not begin until February 26, the 181st day, appellant argues that his Rule 1100 rights were violated. See <em>Commonwealth v.

When the delay attributable to appellant is excluded from the period between the filing of the complaint and trial, there is no violation of appellant’s Rule 1100 right to a speedy trial.
