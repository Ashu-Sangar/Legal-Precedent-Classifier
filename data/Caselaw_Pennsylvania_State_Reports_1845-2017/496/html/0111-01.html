    <p class="author" id="b187-7" data-blocks='[["BL_187.7",187,[242,693,345,41]]]'>LARSEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b187-8" data-blocks='[["BL_187.8",187,[198,755,1149,686]]]'>In this appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief, appellant raises four issues: 1) the trial court erred in not suppressing his confession which was obtained as a result of unnecessary delay between his arrest and arraignment; 2) appellant’s counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of unnecessary delay between his arrest and arraignment; 3) the PCHA court erred in appointing an attorney to represent appellant from the same office as the attorneys that represented him at trial and on appeal; and 4) the delay of approximately six years in this resolution of his PCHA petition is a violation of his due process rights. We have reviewed the record and find these contentions to be entirely without merit.</p>
    <p id="b187-9" data-blocks='[["BL_187.9",187,[240,1460,1105,43]]]'>Accordingly, the order of the court below is affirmed.</p>
