The following December 12, PennDOT paid Myers interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the sum of $491,-807.55 for the period December 30, 1972 to August 19, 1977, in the amount of $136,789.87. (August 19 is the date Penn-DOT anticipated Myers would have received the first check). Subsequently, PennDOT agreed to pay an additional $404.23 as interest on $491,807.55 from August 19 to August 24, 1977. Myers filed a petition for review in the nature of mandamus in the Commonwealth Court seeking judgment against PennDOT in the amount of $4,517.27. This amount <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>represents interest on the unpaid balance to December 12, 1977. Commonwealth Court characterized Myers' claim as one for compound interest and entered judgment for Penn-DOT on the pléadings, there being no issue of fact to be determined. We granted Myers’ petition for allowance of appeal and reverse.</p>

    <p id="b274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[280,710,1163,1476]]]'>Preliminarily, we address the question of what constitutes the total award on which interest then accrues. Penn-DOT argues the language is ambiguous, that it is not clear whether the amount of the award ($491,807.55) <em>already includes </em>interest from December 30, 1972 to the date of the award or whether interest is <em>to be added </em>to $491,807.55; and, therefore, the total debt at the time of the entry of the judgment was $491,807.55. However, it is clear from Penn-DOT’s brief that it has at all times regarded interest “to be calculated at 6% per annum on the principal sum of $491,-807.55 from the date the obligation arose (December 30, 1972, as determined by the Board’s order).” PennDOT did pay interest at 6% on the principal amount of $491,807.55 for the period commencing December 30, 1972, over and above the payment of the principal. This activity is not consistent with PennDOT’s present assertion that the Board’s award constituted a sum total including principal and interest as opposed to a principal sum due equal to $491,807.55 with interest to be added at the specified rate. It ,is obvious Myers understood the award to be the sum of $491,807.55 <em>plus </em>interest at 6% from December 30, 1972. Additionally, Commonwealth Court, in its effort to avoid an award on the Board’s judgment that would include “compound interest” or interest upon interest, awarded Myers simple interest from December 30, 1972 until August 24, 1977. Implicitly, then, Commonwealth Court acknowledged that under the award interest was to be computed on $491,807.55 from December 30, 1972 to the date of the award.</p>

      <em>[A]s to the recovery of interest, </em>there is no difference between a <em>scire facias </em>and an action of debt. ... In an action of debt, and a <em>scire facias, </em>the object is the same: the obtaining the fruits of the original judgment. Assuming then, that so far as concerns the recovery of interest, there is no difference between an action of debt, and a <em>scire facias, </em>we have only to inquire what interest could be recovered, if instead of each <em>scire facias </em>in the present case, actions of debt were substituted. In the first action of debt, the plaintiff would have recovered the amount of his original judgment, with interest. The principal and interest would then be thrown into one consolidated sum, which would form the amount of the judgment in the first action of debt. In the second action of debt, the recovery would be, of the amount of the sum recovered in the first action of debt, with interest; and so, <em>toties quoties. </em>This is the principle contended for by the plaintiff. Nor is there any thing against equity in it. The payment of interest is occasioned by the default of the defendant. It is equitable, that he should pay interest on the whole sum detained from the plaintiff. And at each time when the plaintiff obtains judgment on a <em>scire facias, </em>the defendant, who makes default, detains from him the amount of the sum for which judgment was obtained.</blockquote>
