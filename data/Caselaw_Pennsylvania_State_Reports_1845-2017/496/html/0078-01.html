When the prosecution contested appellant’s testimony as to how he acquired the gun, he offered as corroboration the testimony of John Kirsch (“Kirsch”), who allegedly had accompanied him on the bus trip. As appellant’s counsel attempted to call Kirsch to the witness stand, however, the prosecutor objected, arguing that Kirsch, in violation of a sequestration order, had been in the courtroom during appellant’s testimony. Although appellant’s counsel admitted at side bar that he had seen Kirsch in the courtroom during the direct examination of appellant, he stated that he had immediately ordered Kirsch outside.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The trial court agreed and, without further hearing, refused to permit Kirsch to testify. The jury subsequently found appellant guilty of third degree murder and the weapons offense, for which he received sentences of 7V2 to 15 years and <em>2V2 </em>to 5 years, to be served concurrently.

In <em>Martin, </em>the defendant in a murder trial attempted to proffer the testimony of a witness, who had violated a sequestration order, concerning the frequency of defendant’s drinking and how he typically behaved under the influence of alcohol. In upholding the trial court’s exercise of discretion to exclude the testimony, we noted that the evidence was so obviously remote that it could have been excluded on the independent ground of irrelevancy, entirely separate from the defense witness’ violation of the sequestration order.</p>
