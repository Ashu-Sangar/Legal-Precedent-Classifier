Such is not the situation in the instant case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Here the witness later clarified his remarks to indicate that the gang leader, not the <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>appellant, was responsible for the threats on his life and the killings he had mentioned. Even if the jury drew the inference that the defendant had been involved in threatening the witness, “[i]t has been held that it is proper for the Commonwealth to show an attempt by a defendant to intimidate its witnesses.” <em>Commonwealth v. Baranyai, </em><a href="/citations/?q=278%20Pa.%20Super.%2088" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="278 Pa. Super. 88">278 Pa.Super.Ct. 88</a>, 89, <a href="/pa-super/278/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="419 A.2d 1368" data-case-ids="146620" data-case-paths="/pa-super/278/0083-01">419 A.2d 1368</a>, 1371 (1980). In addition, appellant testified to some of the criminal activities of the gang. Further, the instant killing can also be viewed as an event which grew out of previous gang activities. The car was stolen to transport the victim. As the trial court noted: “The instant criminal homicide was inextricably interwoven with a history of gang warfare.” <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>141 January Term, 1979, slip op. at 19. Testimony of this type is admissible. <em>Commonwealth v. Coyle, </em><a href="/pa/415/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="415 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1891898" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0379-01">415 Pa. 379</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20782" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="203 A.2d 782">203 A.2d 782</a> (1964). Thus when reviewed within the context of the entire trial, it cannot be said that the witness’ testimony deprived appellant of a fair and impartial trial.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[220,1259,1155,900]]]'>Secondly, appellant alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to (1) object to and request a cautionary instruction to the admission of the evidence of other crimes which was previously discussed; (2) obtain a corrupt source (accomplice) charge for the jury; (3) object to more of the prosecutor’s remarks during final argument; and (4) preserve the few objections made to the prosecutor’s closing. To determine whether or not counsel was ineffective, it must be determined whether counsel had some reasonable basis for selecting a particular course of action which is designed to effectuate his client’s interest. <em>Commonwealth v. Musi, </em><a href="/pa/486/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="486 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1757605" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0102-01">486 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="486 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1757605" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0102-01">404 A.2d 378</a> (1979). Since we have decided that evidence of other crimes was admissible, the claim of ineffectiveness based on admission of that evidence fails. “[CJounsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to assert a meritless claim.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The instant case presents a striking parallel. Defense counsel stated in a side-bar conference that there never was a conspiracy involving the witness and the appellant. Instead, defense counsel stated his' theory that the key witness, leader of a splinter group involved in drug dealing, wanted to frame the appellant as part of the witness’ plan to eliminate, through death or imprisonment, opposition from gang members who opposed the drug trafficking. Since it is clear from the record that failure to request the discretionary accomplice instruction was within the realm of counsel’s trial strategy, it cannot be held to constitute ineffectiveness.</p>

In addition, the judge’s cautionary instruction covered any emotional appeal contained in that statement as well as the other references to which trial counsel objected.
