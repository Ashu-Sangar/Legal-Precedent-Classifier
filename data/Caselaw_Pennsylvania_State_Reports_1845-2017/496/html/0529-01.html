Police officers were alerted by a radio dispatch that three or four black males in a light-colored sedan, sought in connection with the crime, may have concealed themselvejs in the area. The dispatch contained no further description of the vehicle or its occupants. At 8:15 p. m. that same day, a police officer observed a white 1960 Oldsmobile sedan, occupied by two black males, traveling on Route 23 in Morgantown, approximately eight miles from the robbery scene. Although the vehicle was being operated in a lawful manner, the officer, recalling the radio alert, made an investigatory stop. The driver alighted to converse with the officer, and the appellant, who had been riding on the passenger side, removed an open shopping bag from the floor of the automobile and deposited it on the highway adjacent to the passenger door. The officer proceeded to the passenger side to investigate, and observed, in plain view within the bag, a quantity of marijuana. Appellant and the driver were arrested; neither was, however, in fact connected with the bank robbery. A joint trial ensued in which both were convicted of related conspiracy and controlled substance possession offenses.</p>

Nor were specific and articulable facts present, such as would create a reasonable suspicion of criminal involvement, to warrant an investigatory stop. Indeed, as the Commonwealth acknowledges, the sole factors motivating the stop in question were the light color of the vehicle and the race of the appellant and his companion. The arresting officer noted nothing suspicious about the vehicle, its manner of operation, or its occupants. The radio alert issued subsequent to the bank robbery stated that three or four black males were traveling in the automobile being sought, yet appellant’s automobile contained only two persons. Furthermore, when appellant was stopped, in excess of nine hours had elapsed since the occurrence of the robbery, and the location of the stop was separated from the crime scene by approximately eight miles. Hence, the stop lacked a close nexus to the criminal incident, and any reasonable suspicion that may have existed with regard to black males in light-colored sedans, proximate, in time and location, to the crime scene certainly abated prior to the occurrence of the instant stop. The police officer acted upon <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>a bare suspicion, as opposed to a reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts, that appellant and his companion were robbery suspects. The radio alert was singularly lacking in the particularity of its description of the robbery suspects and their vehicle. No specific and articulable descriptive facts were provided to the officers, aside from the suspects’ race and the lightness of their vehicle’s color. The latter factors, however, are so all-encompassing as to render it impossible to reasonably suspect that any given automobile or person was an object of the search.</p>
