We do have a record of the proceedings, a statement of Mr. Harper at that time that he did not and would not represent the defendant. We now have the same situation arising at or about the time that the Commonwealth is close to the conclusion of its case, and while a defendant, with the permission of the Court, may change his plea from guilty to not guilty, it has to be considered in the terms of your representing to the Court that you now desire to withdraw from this case, and have the representation of Mr. Harper, who has turned down this representation, as far as the record at this time is concerned.</blockquote>

What, of course, is of more consideration, is that at the time that the plea was entered in this case, the Court took particular pains to make absolute certain, not only through the interrogation of Defense Counsel, but the Court, itself, that this plea as entered was voluntary and freely made, that it was made in consideration of all the factors which have been disclosed to Defense Counsel prior to the commencement of these proceedings and, therefore, a plea which has been made voluntarily at that time and knowingly, should not lightly be withdrawn when the Commonwealth is about to conclude its case. We are also considering the fact that Defense Counsel has indicated to this Court that the defendant desires to be represented by Mr. Harper, and at the very beginning of these proceedings, a record was made prior to the arraignment of this defendant, giving Mr. Harper the opportunity of talking not only to the accused, but his parents, as well, in order to determine whether or not he would undertake a representation of this case, and the record will show that after he had this opportunity to converse with both the accused and his parents, that he refused to enter this case. It, therefore, is the conclusion of this Court that the plea, which has been voluntarily made and entered in this case, shall stand, and permission will not be granted to withdraw such a plea. It is further the direction of this Court that Mr. Baxter, of the Public Defender’s Office, shall continue to represent this defendant for the remainder of this case. The opinion of the Court is that the accused, under the circumstances as here has developed, has had proper and adequate representation, and this representation will continue.”</blockquote>
