Patricia McAloose, a nurse-anesthetist, administered a general anesthetic and remained in the operating room during the course of the surgery. The three procedures employed required different positioning of the patient on the operating table. The D&amp;C was performed with the patient in a flat (modified lithotomy) position with the operating table parallel to the floor and the patient’s legs in stirrups. For the laparoscopy, the patient was placed in a Trendelenberg position in which the angle of the operating table is changed in order to have the body at an angle, with the head lowered. Subsequent to the laparoscopy, the patient’s legs were removed from the stirrups and the table returned to a supine position parallel to the floor. After the initial incision for the laparotomy was made, the patient was again placed in a Trendelenberg position for further examination. At the end of the operation, prior to the closing of the incision, the patient was returned to a flat or supine position.</p>

        <em>Defendant’s exclusive control. </em>The plaintiff may sustain this burden of proof with the aid of a second inference, based on a showing of some specific cause for the event which was within the defendant’s responsibility, or a showing that the defendant is responsible for all reasonably probable causes to which the event can be attributed. Usually this is done by showing that a specific instrumentality which has caused the event, or all reasonably probable causes, were under the exclusive control of the defendant.

He may be responsible where he is under a duty to the plaintiff which he cannot delegate to another, as in the case of a landlord who leases premises dangerous to persons on the public highway, which his tenant undertakes to maintain. He may be responsible where he is under a duty to control the conduct of a third person as in the case of a host whose guests throw objects from his windows. It may be enough that the defendant was formerly in control, at the time of the probable negligence, as in the case of a beverage bottler whose product poisons the consumer, when there is sufficient evidence to eliminate the responsibility of intermediate dealers. <em>Exclusive control is merely one fact which establishes the responsibility of the defendant; and if it can be established otherwise, exclusive control is not essential to a res ipsa loquitur case. </em>The essential question becomes one of whether the probable cause is one which the defendant was under a duty to the plaintiff to anticipate or guard against.

Because plaintiff has produced expert testimony tending to show that the injury sustained here does not usually occur without negligence, the majority’s discussion of the need generally for expert testimony in medical malpractice cases is unnecessary. Here, the sole <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>dispute is whether plaintiff sufficiently eliminated the existence of “other responsible causes” as required by Restatement (Second) of Torts § 328D(l)(b) (1965) and <em>Gilbert v. Korvette’s, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/457/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="457 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="478202" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0602-01">457 Pa. 602</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%2094" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="327 A.2d 94">327 A.2d 94</a> (1974). Plaintiff’s evidence permits the conclusion that Dr. Beittel actively participated throughout the entire operation, including the period when Dr. Rohrabaugh performed the laparoscopy. Thus, this is not a case where there “is no doubt” that the negligence of Dr. Rohrabaugh was equally probable. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, at Comment f. Rather, it is a case where the jury reasonably could conclude that Dr. Beittel was at all times the “responsible cause” of the injury.</p>
