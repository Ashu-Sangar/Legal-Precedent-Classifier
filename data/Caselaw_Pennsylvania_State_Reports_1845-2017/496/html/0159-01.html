The facts germane to the matters before us now are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.6",237,[201,744,1149,533]]]'>The Act of the Legislature popularly known as the “Public Officials Ethics Law”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">1</a> was signed by the Governor on October 4, 1978, to become effective January 1, 1980. The Act, generally, proscribes certain conduct involving conflicts of interest on the part of public officials, and, accordingly, requires that candidates for public office, elected officials and certain appointed officials file financial disclosure statements with a State Ethics Commission. The Commission is created by the Legislature in the Act to implement and administer its provisions.</p>
    <p id="b237-7" data-blocks='[["BL_237.7",237,[200,1313,1151,901]]]'>Subsequent to certain preliminary proceedings not relevant here, appellants, on February 21,1979, filed an Amended Petition for Review invoking the original jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court. Appellants are elected school directors in three school districts in the Commonwealth, and by their Petition sought relief for themselves individually and for all members of a class to which they belong: elected school directors. Named as respondents were the Governor, the Treasurer, the Auditor General and the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, the State Ethics Commission and its members individually, and the county boards of elections and district attorneys as a class. By their petition appellants alleged the Act is violative of the Constitutions of the Commonwealth and of the United States and sought relief in three counts: declaratory relief, injunctive relief; and, in a count in <em>quo warranto, </em>the ouster from office of certain members of the Ethics Commission.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b238-7" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[297,867,1158,526]]]'>Appellants claim initially that the Act is violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Appellants argue an unconstitutional effect is worked by a definitional item in section two of the Act. The statute provides that a “public official” may not take the oath of office or perform any of his official duties until he has filed a “statement of financial interests.” The disclosure requirement thus established must be fulfilled by all candidates for elective office as well as by appointed officials who receive compensation for the performance of their duties.</p>
    <p id="b238-8" data-blocks='[["BL_238.7",238,[297,1423,1156,690]]]'>But the Act further provides that “ ‘public official’ shall not include any appointed official who receives no compensation other than reimbursement for actual expenses.” 65 P.S. § 402. Appellants claim that by this definitional distinction the Legislature has created a constitutionally impermissible classification. The dichotomy perceived and complained of by appellants, is as follows: Alone among the political subdivisions of this Commonwealth, the City of Philadelphia is authorized to,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and has chosen to,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> appoint rather than elect its school directors. Additionally, vacant, unexpired elective school board positions throughout the Commonwealth are filled, pursuant to the Public School Code, by appointment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>Since all school board members in Pennsylvania serve without compensation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the classification created by the terms of the Act becomes apparent. On the one hand are all the elected school directors in Pennsylvania, to whom the disclosure provisions of the Act apply. And on the other are the school directors of Philadelphia and a certain number of temporarily appointed school directors elsewhere, all of whom are exempt from the strictures of the Act.</p>

This common source is manifested in what is perhaps the most fundamental principle of statutory construction: the presumption that the legislature has acted constitutionally. This presumption “reflects on the part of the judiciary the respect due to the legislature as a co-equal branch of government.” <em>School District of Deer Lakes v. Kane, </em><a href="/pa/463/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="463 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1708056" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0554-01">463 Pa. 554</a>, 562, <a href="/pa/463/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="463 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1708056" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0554-01">345 A.2d 658</a>, 662 (1975).

In fashioning a remedy we determined that “in view of the Legislature’s intent ...” we could sever one sentence from the Act and thereby cure the constitutional defect. We further noted that “the valid part of [the Act], standing alone, is easily executed in accordance with the legislative intent; this valid portion is independent and complete within itself.” <em>Butler, <a href="/citations/?q=328%20A.2d%20851" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="328 A.2d 851">Id.,</a> </em>458 Pa. at 303 n.22, <a href="/citations/?q=328%20A.2d%20851" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="328 A.2d 851">328 A.2d 851</a>.</p>

The fact that at the moment only appointed school directors might fall within this exception is of no consequence. The exception provided the opportunity to permit political subdivisions to create positions whereby they could tap the expertise of those who have developed unique talents in their private business and professional careers, to offer volunteer public service. Most of these individuals, who would be able to offer significant contributions, would not be induced by public salaries and probably would be deterred by the requirements of the Act.

It cannot be presumed that a person has control over his spouse so as to compel disclosure of the spouse’s financial affairs.
