Upon hearing the intruder, the victim, Otto Ehritz, proprietor of the café, went downstairs from his residence on the second floor of the building, carrying his gun. His wife also went downstairs, using another set of steps. Mrs. Ehritz testified that as she went through the downstairs kitchen approaching the bar, she heard a shot. When she reached the bar area, she saw her husband slumped over a bottle cooler and appellant holding up his body. Appellant then fired a shot at her. As she fled back upstairs, she heard two more shots. She told her daughter to call the police, and both women then ran to second-floor windows and called for help. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and apprehended appellant a short distance from the café.</p>

At the moment of his apprehension, appellant stated, “I did it with a knife; I did it with a knife.” A few moments later, after receiving his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and without having been asked any questions, appellant stated to police, “I only wanted a drink. I’m an alcoholic. I stabbed a man. I did something bad.” Two hours later, during the course of a conversation with Dr. Robert Stein, a physician who later testified for the Commonwealth, appellant asked the doctor if there was a death penalty in Pennsylvania and also whether he would have a <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>lawyer to help defend him.

Dr. Roop was asked to assume an extensive list of facts established by the Commonwealth’s evidence. He was then asked whether he had an opinion as to whether a hypothetical individual to whom these facts applied would be able to comprehend the nature and quality of his act and to distinguish between right and wrong. Appellant concedes that all facts stated in the question were of record but complains that the question omitted certain other facts which allegedly could have influenced Dr. Roop’s opinion. It is settled, however, that a hypothetical question need not be based on every fact of record. To the extent that opposing counsel believes that relevant facts have been omitted, he is of course free on cross-examination to pose his own hypothetical question which includes those facts. <em>Battistone v.
