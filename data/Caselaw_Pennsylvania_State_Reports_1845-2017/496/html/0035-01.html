Hearing Committee 4.12 was empaneled and after a hearing which produced over 800 pages of testimony, found respondent in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) as to both charges and recommended disbarment. Respondent excepted to the report and recommendation of the Hearing Committee and a three member <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>panel of the Disciplinary Board heard oral argument on May 1, 1980.

Oral argument was heard by this Court on September 14, 1981.

Bayard Johnson, Jr. (Johnson) the possibility of Johnson investing in a business venture which respondent was helping develop for a group of individuals. The venture concerned a patented invention known as an “energy enricher” for which respondent was trying to obtain investment capital for development of the device and possible formation of a corporation. Respondent told Johnson that he would be paid $200 a week for promoting investment in the invention provided he agreed to put $10,000 down in escrow to show he had the means to invest when the new company was formed. Finally, on March 21,1977, Johnson transferred $10,000 to respondent’s escrow account at the Pittsburgh National Bank pursuant to a letter agreement executed by both parties on the same day. The agreement, in addition to alleging that respondent was counsel for undisclosed parties with rights to an “energy enricher” invention, stated that Johnson was transferring the money to respondent’s 5% interest bearing escrow account with the option to either invest the money at a later date or have the money returned upon written notice no sooner than sixty days from the date of transfer, March 21, 1977. The agreement also contained language prohibit<a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>ing Johnson from disclosing any information about the invention to any persons other than those designated by respondent. Within three months after transferring the money to respondent, Johnson came to the conclusion that he had made a foolish investment and decided to reclaim the money. On June 24, 1977, Johnson orally requested the return of the funds only to be informed by respondent that the money had just rolled over into another Certificate of Deposit (C.D.) and would not be available for thirty more days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On August 18, 1977, Johnson made a written request for the money as required by the aforementioned agreement, but received no response from respondent. On August 31, 1977, respondent told Johnson in a telephone conversation that the funds would be returned with interest by September 8,1977. This promise was confirmed in a certified letter, return receipt requested, sent by Johnson to respondent pn September 1, 1977. Johnson agreed not to file a complaint with the Disciplinary Board if the money was returned as promised by September 8. The funds were not returned on September 8; rather, Johnson was requested to appear at respondent’s office on September 9 and sign an affidavit reaffirm<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>ing that there had been no breach of the non-disclosure portion of the original agreement. Johnson signed the affidavit on September 9 and was given a check post-dated to September 15, 1977. Johnson attempted to cash the check on September 16, 1977, but was told the check could not be honored because the account was overdrawn.

In May, 1977, respondent was contacted by James J. Kelly, a representative of a newly formed corporation, Keleco Enterprises, Inc. (Keleco).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Keleco required start-up capital and was interested in having Dictor handle the necessary financing. On May 19, 1977, Kelly signed a letter of intent supplied by respondent whereby Keleco sought to borrow $20,000 from Dictor. A printed heading on the top of the letter read as follows: “Lender Designated by George E. Ewing, Attorney for Dictor Capital Corporation.” In addition to the execution of the letter of intent, respondent required a fee of $1,000 before he would arrange the financing with Dictor. Kelly paid the fee within the next week under the assumption that respondent was acting on behalf of Dictor and that Dictor required the fee as a condition precedent to financing. When close to a month had passed without receipt of the $20,000, Kelly <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>informed respondent by mailgram dated June 20, 1977 that he intended to search elsewhere for financing and requested return of the $1,000. Rather than return the money, respondent convinced Kelly that the financing would be provided shortly and that it would help if some local people could be persuaded to invest in Keleco. Thereafter, a Dr. Hennon from Pittsburgh signed a subscription agreement prepared by respondent for $8,000 worth of “10% convertible nine-month judgment notes,” each convertible into Keleco common stock. Dr. Hennon actually paid $4,000 to respondent by way of two $2,000 checks dated July 22, 1977 and August 8, 1977 respectively. However, instead of depositing the funds into the Keleco checking account, respondent deposited the funds into his own escrow account. Shortly thereafter, several checks drawn by Kelly on the Keleco account were dishonored because of insufficient funds. In early September, 1977, Kelly sent Dictor a copy of the letter of intent only to learn that Dictor was not aware of any relationship between itself and Keleco, had never received any fees from Keleco, had never anticipated financing Keleco, and that respondent was not authorized to solicit a “front fee” as a condition to financing by Dictor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Further, when Kelly requested that control of the check book and financial <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>records of Keleco be turned over to him, respondent refused and demanded that Keleco stock be issued to him in compliance with an alleged subscription agreement of which Kelly had no knowledge. Finally, as of the date of the proceedings before Hearing Committee 4.12, Keleco was in receivership and the bulk of the funds expended by Kelly and Dr. Hennon were not áccounted for.</p>
