On September 7,1973, Bigley was a passenger in a vehicle belonging to Unity and operated by a co-worker when it became involved in an accident. As a result of the injuries sustained, Bigley is now a quadriplegic. At the time of the accident Bigley was 21 years of age and had just graduated from Penn State University. He was married and the couple had one child. Following the áccident, American Hardware Mutual Insurance Company, the workmen’s compensation carrier for Unity, filed an official form of notice to the Commonwealth reporting the injury and indicating that compensation would be paid to Bigley at the rate of $62.67 weekly.. The payments were not accepted by Mr. Bigley. Instead, Bigley and his wife instituted a trespass action in the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> They named as defendants Unity as well as Jean<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>nette Auto Parts, Inc.,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Isadore Friedman<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and Albert R.

It was also agreed that the insurance companies of the defendants in the trespass action could be subrogated out of the award Bigley might receive under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. § 319, 77 P.S. § 671.</p>

On February 28, 1977 Referee Kenney approved the request and permitted the withdrawal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> No appeal was taken from that order. Subsequently, new counsel for Bigley filed on his behalf on October 3, 1977 a petition to reinstate his workmen’s compensation claim. Unity filed an answer alleging (a) that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations; (b) that the original petition had been withdrawn and no appeal taken and was therefore <em>res judicata; </em>and (c) that the petition for reinstatement was untimely. The referee before whom the hearing on the petition for reinstatement was held dismissed the petition. This decision was upheld by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board and the Commonwealth Court, 49 Pa.Cmwlth. 448, <a href="/citations/?q=411%20A.2d%20575" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="411 A.2d 575">411 A.2d 575</a>.

Mr. Fox filed a claim on July 19, 1971 seeking workmen’s compensation benefits as a result of an injury allegedly suffered on October 29, 1970. On June 5, 1972 during the hearing before the referee, Mr..Fox agreed to withdraw his claim petition upon the promise of the employer to pay the medical bills incurred as a result of the <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>injury. On that date an order was entered permitting the withdrawal. Later Mr. Fox obtained counsel and appealed to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board seeking a reversal of the Referee’s order permitting the withdrawal of the claim petition. He argued that he acted without the advice of counsel and contended he was under medication at the time which vitiated his capacity to intelligently decide to withdraw the claim. The Board decided against Mr. Fox and no further appeal of that ruling was taken.</p>

In <em>Fox </em>claimant’s reasons for the request to vacate the order to withdraw received an administrative airing. Rather than seeking judicial review of that ruling, appellant sought to reinstate the administrative process through the guise of a “petition for modification.” The Commonwealth Court in <em>Fox </em>properly perceived the “petition for modification” as an attempt to relitigate an abandoned claim. The abandonment of the claim did not stem from the original agreement to withdraw by the claimant but from his failure to properly pursue his contention that the agreement to withdraw was not intelligently made.</p>

The Commonwealth Court’s reliance in that case upon the bar of section 315 was merely the device used to reach a desired result. In our present consideration, we must not permit the rationale employed in <em>Fox </em>to obscure the real question that we must resolve.</p>

The reliance upon the decision in <em>Fox </em>and the forfeiture provision of section 315 merely obscures the question to be here decided. It is clear that the obvious purpose of section 315 is to dictate the time within which a formal claim for compensation must be <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>made. The suggestion implied by appellee’s argument that section 315 may also insure the expeditious disposition of the claim petition is neither warranted by the wording of the section itself nor the general scheme of the act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The rights of the parties to this lawsuit do not depend upon a fictional determination of whether the petition to reinstate should be considered a new claim which would be barred by the time constraints of section 315 or an attempt to revive the original action which would not face that impediment. To the contrary, the true question raised is whether the Act or some rule of policy precludes further consideration of the claim. The time in which the effort was commenced to revive the claim is only one possible factor to be considered in that judgment.</p>

The heart of appellee’s argument is grounded upon the premise that the administrative authority prior to an agreement or an adjudication differs from that which follows either of those events. Appellee concedes that a petition to reinstate a claim is an appropriate administrative tool to reactivate a case where there has been an agreement or an adjudication of compensability and liability. It is argued that prior to the establishment of the underlying validity of the claim, a withdrawal of the claim may not be reopened absent a showing that it was not voluntarily, knowingly or intelligently withdrawn.

We find that no purpose of the Act would be served by an iron-clad rule that the decision to file a claim must be irrevocable and can only be terminated by adjudication or agreement. Concomitant with the implied power to permit a withdrawal prior to adjudication or agreement is also the power to reinstate that claim in appropriate circumstances. An analysis of appellee’s position reveals that there is no real quarrel with our judgment that there is an implied administrative power to accept a withdrawal at that stage and to reinstate the claim in appropriate circumstances. The area of question is when should the power to reinstate be exercised.</p>

The power to adjust inequities prior to an administrative determination on the merits must necessarily be as broad as the powers that are available after such a determination. The power to reinstate a gratuitous unilateral withdrawal should be liberally exercised absent a significant showing of prejudice by the other parties involved.</p>

This argument misperceives the nature of the administrative power to grant reinstatement of a withdrawn claim. Section 423 affords an opportunity to dissatisfied litigants in the administrative process to receive a judicial review of asserted errors in the administrative process. Here appellant is not charging that the approval resulted from an administrative error. Rather, what is sought is the exercise of the sound administrative discretion to reinstate the claim petition. The initiation of the consideration here sought could not be achieved through resort to section 423 and no adverse consequences may follow from the fact that relief was not pursued under that section.</p>

Not only was the applicability of the Act one of the principal areas of dispute at the time of the settlement, but one of the terms of the settlement agreement was that appellant obligated himself to seek an adjudication of that very question. Thus it is apparent that the parties to the settlement agreement, Unity being one of those parties, did not contemplate that the agreement would foreclose further recovery under the Act. There can therefore be no basis for concluding that there was a contractual basis for foreclosing relief under the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

There are two limitation sections in the Act: the period for notice of injury, 77 P.S. § 631, and the period for claiming compensation, 77 P.S. § 602. If, as the majority claims, the prompt and efficient disposition of claims is not a purpose of the Act, there would be no underlying reason for the legislature to have included a time limitation for the assertion of a claim for benefits. Section 311 of the A.ct, 77 P.S. § 631, requiring notice of the injury to the employer within 120 days of the injury, would be <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>sufficient to put the employer on notice that he <em>may </em>have to investigate the facts surrounding an injury to an employee <em>in case </em>the employee makes a claim for benefits. This was the posture of the case when the initial claim petition was withdrawn. Although the employer had notice of the injury, the claim petition was withdrawn, indicating that no claim for benefits would be pursued. To require the employer to anticipate <em>ad infinitum </em>that a claim for Workmen’s Compensation benefits might be forthcoming is an absurd and illogical burden that section 315 was designed to alleviate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
