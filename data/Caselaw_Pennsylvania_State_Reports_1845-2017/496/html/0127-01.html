Ballou, is a private practitioner who has among his clients four second class townships, a borough, a county coroner and an industrial development authority. On April 29, 1980, appellee filed a petition in the Commonwealth Court for declaratory and injunctive relief from the application of the financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics Act, 65 P.S. § 401 et seq. (Supp. 1981-82),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which appellant, the State Ethics Commission, had by regulation declared to apply to borough and township solicitors. Appellant, in turn, filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The Commonwealth Court overruled appellant’s preliminary objections and, by order of February 4, 1981, granted relief to appellee. The court reasoned that, as a “municipal solicitor,” appellee is a “public employee” subject to the financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics Act, but that the financial disclosure provisions of the act as applied are “unconstitutional as an infringement on the Supreme Court’s exclusive power to govern the conduct of persons privileged to practice law in Pennsylvania.” <em>Ballou v.

The Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that, as solicitor, appellee is a “public employee” within the meaning of the Ethics Act, is premised on the erroneous theory that compensation from public funds is synonymous with employment by the Commonwealth. Contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s supposition, it is commonplace for a person to perform services and to be compensated for those services, and yet not be “employed,” as that term is commonly understood. The Ethics Act recognizes this distinction by providing for a classification of “state consultant” separate and apart from the categories of “public employee” and “public official.” Indeed, a municipal solicitor, functioning as a legal advisor to the appointing body, closely resembles a consultant who, as defined in the Ethics Act, “performs professional, scientific, technical or advisory services .. . <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>[and] receives a fee, honorarium or similar compensation for such services.” 65 P.S. § 402.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The financial disclosure provisions of the Act, however, do not regulate attorneys’ conduct; nor are they inconsistent with the Code of Professional Responsibility. These provisions merely require financial disclosure as an incident to appellee’s duties as a public official and employee, and interfere with this Court’s powers to regulate attorneys’ conduct no more than does the unchallenged requirement that an oath be taken before assuming public office. The Legislature plainly has the constitutional power to define the duties of all public officials and employees, including those who also happen to be attorneys. Realistically, the myriad of non-ministerial public duties performed by <em>any </em>public employee or official, as those positions are defined by the Act, extend far beyond the practice of law as contemplated by the Code of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, any exception to the general duty of financial disclosure artificially carved from the Act solely for attorneys would be manifestly unjust and unreasonable.</p>
