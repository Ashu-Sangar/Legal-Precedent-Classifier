The individual appellants participated in a hearing conducted by the Board on the application of El Rancho Grande, Inc.

Over the protests of the individual appellants, the Board approved the application, having determined that Portage Township was a “resort area,” see 47 P.S. § <em>4r-</em>461(b), and that facilities provided by the existing license holders were inadequate to meet the needs of the resident and transient population of the area, see <em>Willowbrook Country Club, Inc.

The Legislature did not define the term “resort area” but instead has left the definition to judicial interpretation. Construing the relevant legislative history, our courts have determined that the. “resort area” exception was intended “to render an equitable distribution of such licenses in areas where, during certain seasons, the population is'increased to such an extent that the usual number of licenses <em>is not adequate to serve the needs of the people.” Willowbrook </em>

Thus it is clear that the Legislature did not intend the Board to have unlimited discretion in awarding licenses in excess of the prescribed quota; rather, in keeping with its purpose to restrain the sale of liquor, the Legislature intended that the Board award an additional license only in an area which undergoes a seasonal increase in population and only when the applicant has demonstrated that the area has an “actual need” for an additional license. <em>Willowbrook Country Club, Inc.

The record reveals that the site of Applicant’s proposed establishment is an open field in a sparsely populated area, with only one farmhouse and a seasonal “camp” located nearby. Under Applicant’s theory of the exclusivity of the Liquor Code provisions relating to appeals, no one in Portage Township but the owners of the farmhouse and the “camp” would have standing to challenge the Board’s determination that Portage Township needed another liquor licensee. In fact, under this theory, were it not for the chance location of the farmhouse and “camp” within five hundred feet of the proposed establishment, no one at all would have standing to challenge the Board’s granting of the additional license or, indeed, as many additional licenses as there are open areas in Portage Township.</p>

Although they may not obtain a remedy at law solely on the basis of their economic injury, the injury is nonetheless so inextricably intertwined with the fundamental goals which the Liquor Code seeks to achieve as to make the individual appellants vigorous and reliable representatives of the public interest. Therefore, in keeping both with the concepts of standing enunciated by this Court and with the legislative intent to provide increased judicial review of the actions of its agencies, we conclude that the individual appellants have standing to appeal the Board’s determination to grant Applicant a “resort area” license in excess of the statutory quota.</p>
