There is no question that sales datum contained in the County’s report can be a “factor . . . entitled to evidentiary weight and due consideration” in the determination of fair market values within the taxing district. As discussed in <em>Keebler Co., </em>supra, this Court’s decision in <em>Deitch Co. v.
