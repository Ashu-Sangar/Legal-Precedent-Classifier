Their application for preliminary injunction alleged, essentially, that appellees acted either without authority or in an arbitrary, capricious or bad faith manner, and that the proposed staff reduction posed an immediate threat of irreparable injury to the health, safety and welfare of patients and prospective patients at SSGH.

    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[274,520,1159,1268]]]'>The cutbacks in nursing staff, if implemented, would result in the elimination of one of SSGH’s medical/surgical units (15 beds) and the entire obstetrical/maternity unit (13 beds). Appellants asserted in their petition for review, and attempted to demonstrate at the hearing, that the elimination of their units would cause certain specific injuries. First, they asserted that the elimination of the obstetrical/maternity unit would prove dangerous to expectant mothers for two reasons — the “extended” drive (travel time) to alternative facilities and the inadequacy of the Ashland State General Hospital, the closest alternative facility, which would, according to a witness, Dr. Peter W. Ross, Jr., provide insufficient protection against the risk of infection. Second, appellants maintained that the remaining medical/surgical units would be inadequately staffed, threatening the health, safety and welfare of the patients there. Third, they argued that the reduction would reduce, by furlough, one member of the three member nurse anesthetist staff presently providing anesthesia at the hospital. This, they claim, would severely hinder SSGH’s ability to perform emergency services. Finally, appellants contended that the reduction in the total number of rooms in the hospital would impede its ability to deal with infectious outbreaks.</p>

Expectant mothers have access to three other facilities in the area which are within 30 minutes driving time of SSGH — Ashland State General Hospital, Sunbury Hospital and the Geisinger Community Center. Some prospective SSGH patients are undoubtedly closer to one of these facilities than to SSGH, and, in case of emergencies, SSGH would remain equipped to provide comprehensive emergency obstetrical services. And, Dr. Ross’ res<a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>ervations due to the risk of infection at Ashland (because of the presence of other types of patients on the maternity floor there) was undermined by the fact that he continued to be affiliated with Ashland and has delivered numerous babies there without complication. Moreover, Ashland maintains full accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.</p>
    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[206,688,1152,521]]]'>Concerning, the inadequate staffing on the medical/surgical units, appellants introduced much testimony to the effect that they were already understaffed, and that furloughs planned in compliance with the staff reduction would further reduce the staffing of that unit to a dangerous level. However, the director of nursing at SSGH, Helen Wahofky, admitted that personnel could be shifted from the units which were being eliminated to the remaining medical/surgical units; thus, adequate staffing of the operational units would be provided.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[205,1229,1151,359]]]'>As to the reduction in the nurse anesthetist staff by one member, the nurse anesthetist whose full-time position would be abolished would remain at the hospital as a nurse and would be available during emergency situations. Further, an anesthesiologist has been retained under contract with DPW to provide consultation and, when necessary, to direct care at the hospital.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.6",87,[203,1608,1150,567]]]'>Finally, regarding the risks of the spread of infection due to the elimination of rooms, the testimony supports the opposite inference, i. e., that the elimination of the beds will reduce the risk. As presently planned, the medical/surgical unit to be closed is an “open” (no separation between patients) unit and the services previously provided there will be transferred to the present location of the obstetrical unit. The transfer will increase the number of private and semiprivate rooms available for medical/surgical patients and, accordingly, improve the hospital’s capacity to isolate patients.</p>

While no one wishes to see a hospital in which one works or receives services reduce its capabilities, the record supports Judge Williams’ findings that the announced staff reduction at SSGH poses no immediate threat to the health, safety and welfare of the patients.</p>
