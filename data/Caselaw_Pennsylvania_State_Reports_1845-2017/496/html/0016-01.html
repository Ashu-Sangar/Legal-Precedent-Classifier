The requisite element of intent is satisfied if the contemnor has the intent to obstruct the proceedings. When that intent manifests itself in misconduct in the presence of the court which, as on this record, in fact obstructs the administration of justice, criminal contempt has been committed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Appellant’s reliance is misplaced. <em>Codispoti </em>holds that the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial on multiple charges of direct criminal contempt when two conditions are satisfied: (1) the court postpones adjudication and sentence for contempt until the end of trial; and (2) the court imposes sentences which either alone, or when aggregated, exceed six months’ imprisonment. The rationale underlying the rule enunciated in <em>Codispoti </em>is that, unlike during trial, at the end of trial there is “no overriding necessity for instant action to preserve order and no justification for dispensing with the ordinary rudiments of due process.” <a href="/us/418/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="418 U.S. 506" data-case-ids="6173667" data-case-paths="/us/418/0506-01">Id.,</a> <a href="/us/418/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="418 U.S. 506" data-case-ids="6173667" data-case-paths="/us/418/0506-01">418 U.S. at 515</a>, <a href="/us/418/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="418 U.S. 506" data-case-ids="6173667" data-case-paths="/us/418/0506-01">94 S.Ct. at 2692</a>.
