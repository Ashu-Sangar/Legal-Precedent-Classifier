Each of the jurors was thereafter individually asked whether he or she found the defendant guilty. The first two responded “I do,” rather than “Yes.” Similarly, jurors Three and Four responded “Yes, I do.” Although the final eight jurors simply responded “Yes”, their reply was directly to the clerk’s plain and simple question, “[Name of particular juror], you say you find the defendant guilty?.” <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>Thus, none of the responses was a perfunctory “yes” even arguably resulting from a belief that the clerk’s instruction had prohibited any other response.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
