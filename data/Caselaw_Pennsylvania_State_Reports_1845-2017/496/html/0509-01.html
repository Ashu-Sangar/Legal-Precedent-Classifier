King denied the petition as untimely filed because, as he had computed the 180 day period, the run date had occurred on September 18, 1975. After an ex parte presentation of a petition for reconsideration by the Commonwealth on October 23, 1975, Judge King vacated the order of denial of October 21, 1975, and a full hearing was held on January 6, 1976 before the Honorable Stanley Greenberg. At this hearing Judge Greenberg granted the Commonwealth an extension of time, and trial was set for January 15, 1976.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Superi- or Court agreed, reversed the trial court and dismissed the charges against the appellee. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the Superior Court held that because the trial court denied the Commonwealth’s petition on October 21, 1975, which was after the run date, the trial court could not entertain a petition to reconsider its denial. According to the Superior Court, once the original petition had been denied, “[t]he matter was then closed. The Commonwealth cannot keep the question alive indefinitely by petitioning for a reconsideration of a decision to deny a petition for extension. Denial of such a petition differs from granting it. If the petition is granted, the grant relates back to the date of filing of the petition, but this is not the case when the petition is denied. Such would permit the Commonwealth to extend the proceedings interminably by merely filing for a reconsideration and appealing that decision.” <em>Commonwealth v.

To say that “the matter is closed” as of the denial of the petition effectively denies the lower court its inherent<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and statutory<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> powers to reconsider its own rulings.

    <p id="b587-4" data-blocks='[["BL_587.5",587,[180,455,1154,1100]]]'>Moreover, how can the matter be “closed” when the Commonwealth had the right to directly appeal the denial of the petition for extension? <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em><a href="/pa-super/263/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="263 Pa.

Had the Commonwealth exercised that procedure in the first place and the Superior Court reversed the lower court on appeal (which it would have done given its recomputation of the run date to October 9th, thus rendering the petition for extension timely), there is no question that the case would have been remanded and would have proceeded as if the petition had been granted originally. The Superior Court’s ruling would deprive the lower court of the opportunity to correct its own erroneous rulings (here it was an erroneous computation of time) and thereby force the Commonwealth to resort to the time consuming appellate process to obtain correction of the error. Thus, the concern of the Superior Court — the “interminable” extension of the proceedings — is heightened by their dubious and unfounded distinction between the grant of a petition for an extension of time at the outset and the grant of such petition following reconsideration of the original denial.</p>

Appellee was not brought to trial until 300 days after the commencement of proceedings against him, 120 days beyond the time permitted under Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1100(a)(2).
