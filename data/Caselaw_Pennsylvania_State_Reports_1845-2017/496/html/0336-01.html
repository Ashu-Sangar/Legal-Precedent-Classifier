However, the record nowhere indicates that Amoco ever gave Bums any quota of gasoline sales. The record is clear that Amoco decided to terminate Bums’ franchise because of its unprofitability, and not because its gasoline sales fell below any particular amount.” <a href="/pa-super/268/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="268 Pa.

We further noted that Arco and Razumic had executed a separate writing authorizing Razumic to use Arco’s property to the rear of the service station for parking rental vehicles which the Hertz Corporation authorized Razumic to rent to the public. We concluded that the fact that this writing conferred upon both parties the right to terminate upon thirty days notice “with or without cause” underscored the absence of a similar provision governing Arco’s right to terminate the “Dealer Lease.”</p>

If Amoco had sought to <em>replace </em>Bums’ or to assume operation of the station itself, his position might have arguable merit. Here, however, Amoco sought only to close the station and to divest itself of a property which had become a financial liability.</p>
