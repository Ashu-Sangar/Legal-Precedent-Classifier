Claimants appealed to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review [hereinafter “Board”] and the cases were referred to referees who heard the appeal. The employers were present at the referees’ hearings and the cases were tried on the defense theory that claimants quit. The referees affirmed the Bureau’s determination. Claimants again appealed and the Board affirmed the referees. Claimants next appealed to the Commonwealth Court. That court reversed the Board and held that the evidence in both cases, under the applicable case law, was not sufficient to show that claimants had quit. <em>Wing v.

The <em>Dilliplaine </em>and <em>Clair </em>rationales are perfectly apposite in administrative law cases as well: the administrative law tribunal must be given the opportunity to correct its errors as early as possible; diligent preparation and effective advocacy before the tribunal must be encouraged by requiring the parties to develop complete records and advance all legal theories; and the finality of the lower tribunals’ determinations must not be eroded by treating each determination as part of a sequence of piecemeal adjudications.</p>
    <p id="b191-8" data-blocks='[["BL_191.7",191,[194,1535,1152,652]]]'>The Board correctly notes that the question of whether a particular claimant quit or was fired is a question of law and not of fact. <em>See Chinn v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>57 Pa.Cmwlth. 582, <a href="/citations/?q=426%20A.2d%201250" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="426 A.2d 1250">426 A.2d 1250</a> (1981). The gist of the Board’s argument seems to be that since the theory upon which the case is decided (being a question of law) is somehow out of the hands of the employer, the employer should not suffer if the theory is wrong. This argument is meritless because even if the Bureau, the Referee, and the Board all espouse an incorrect theory, the employer must at least propose the allegedly correct theory or waive consideration of it.</p>

We cannot agree with this suggestion. Recent cases have clearly stated that the employer must carry the burden of proof in a willful misconduct case. <em>See Chinn v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, supra. </em>An adversary system is created whenever the burden of proof is allocated to either party. Moreover, in Anglo-American law, the adversary system is highly lauded and considered the best means of bringing truth to light. The waiver rule is perfectly appropriate in unemployment compensation proceedings.</p>

This claim is patently merit-less. It is difficult to imagine what could be more prejudicial to claimants than if, after nearly two years of litigation and appeals, they find themselves before the lower tribunal and again forced to litigate issues long since waived, and uncertain if yet other, novel theories will be thrust upon them in another two years.</p>
