On this appeal the Commonwealth does not dispute that appellant’s claims of ineffectiveness are properly before the Court. Indeed, it is a matter of record that on this PCHA petition appellant is for the first time represented by counsel other than the counsel whom he claims to have been ineffective. Because counsel cannot be expected to raise his own ineffectiveness, appellant’s claims of ineffectiveness have clearly been raised at the earliest opportunity. See <em>Commonwealth v.
