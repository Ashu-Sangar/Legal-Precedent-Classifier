Relying upon the former finding, the majority proceeds to conclude that “[bjecause assigned insurers are obligated precisely <em>as if they had issued basic loss insurance policies, </em>and because every policy of basic loss insurance issued in Pennsylvania <em>must include uninsured motorist coverage, </em>the right to uninsured motorist benefits under the assigned claims plan follows <em>a fortiori </em>from a straightforward reading of the statute. ...” ante at 623.</p>

Rather, the two Acts are free-standing <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>acts, adopted more than ten years apart, and evidence no intent that their remedial measures, though in instances complimentary, must be co-extensive in all situations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Moreover, the financial impact of the majority’s ruling will have serious ramifications as to the possibility of providing the <em>low-cost </em>coverage sought to be achieved under the No-Fault Act.</p>

Before passage of the Uninsured Motorist Act, an <em>insured </em>accident victim seeking compensation could proceed only in tort. If the negligent driver was uninsured the victim would ordinarily receive no <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>compensation for his injuries. The purpose and intent of the Uninsured Motorist Act was to assure widespread availability to the public of insurance protection against financial loss caused by negligent financially irresponsible motorists and thereby placing the insured in the same position he would have been if the uninsured motorist had minimum liability insurance coverage. Thus, uninsured motorist coverage was provided “for the protection of persons <em>insured </em>under a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance, 40 P.S. § 2000(a) (emphasis added) who are promised that with payment of an additional premium they will have available to them limited coverage from their insurance carrier if they become involved in an accident with a negligent uninsured motorist.” No such promise is made to the uninsured person whose sole source of recovery is under the assigned claims plan.</p>
    <p id="b299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[195,1148,1153,828]]]'>In contrast, the thrust of section 108 of the No-Fault Act is to provide limited compensation to an accident victim without regard to fault when there is no insurance applicable to the accident. The fact that the legislature under the terms of the assigned claims plan of the No-Fault Act, Section 108, deemed it advisable to permit recovery of benefits thereunder without the issuance of a policy or the payment of premiums does not reflect a decision to discard the requirement of an existent policy and payment of premiums for the recovery of uninsured motorist benefits. Nor can we say that the situations are so similar that there are no policy considerations that would justify different results. Such a significant change in the law relating to entitlement for uninsured motorist benefits should be clearly announced and not inferred from a contrived ambiguity.</p>

This premise is offered even though there is no direct reference to the earlier Uninsured <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Motorist Act at any place in the No-Fault Act. Moreover, the premise ignores that the No-Fault Act set forth explicit findings and its purpose, Section 102, without reference to this presumed intent to coordinate the two Acts. Nor is there any expressed conflict between the provisions of the two Acts which would necessitate an attempt on our part to reconcile the two pieces of legislation.</p>

Again, there is no direct reference to the benefits recoverable under the earlier Uninsured Motorist Act.

The significance of this terminology, as urged, was obviously not perceived by the legislature who made no effort to define it or to specify its importance. From this single departure from the term “basic loss benefits” which is defined and used throughout the Act the majority concludes that the assigned loss claim section, Section 108, requires the payment of uninsured motorist benefits in addition to no-fault even though no policy for such coverage existed nor premiums paid for such protection.</p>

Even in this aspect the argument is specious. The mere fact the Insurance Commissioner sought to coordinate the provisions of the two Acts regarding the requirements for the issuance of a policy of motor vehicle insurances does not in any way reflect a legislative judgment to dispense with an issued policy and the payment of premiums for the recovery of uninsured motorist benefits. The regulation merely coordinated the No-Fault Act with the Uninsured Motorist Act regarding the requirements for the <em>issuance </em>of a policy of motor vehicle insurance. It did not intend to effectuate such a significant change in the law through such an oblique method. It is a well established principle that statutes are not presumed to make changes in the rules or principles of prior existing law beyond what is expressly declared in their provisions. <em>Commonwealth v.
