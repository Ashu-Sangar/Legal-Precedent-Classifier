These explanatory notes have not been officially adopted or promulgated by this Court, nor do they constitute part of the rule. However, they indicate the spirit and motivation behind the drafting of the rule, and they serve as guidelines for understanding the purpose for which the rule was drafted.</p>
    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[213,627,1151,792]]]'>Rule 238 awards damages for delay only in cases where the defendant made no settlement offer prior to trial or where the defendant made an offer of settlement which was 25% less than the amount of the jury verdict. Such language clearly reflects a primary desire to encourage pre-trial settlement. In those instances where the settlement offer is not accepted and the jury verdict does not exceed the offer by 25%, the interest is only computed up to the date of the settlement offer. By tolling the running of interest, this provision demonstrates the prominent goal of fostering <em>early </em>settlements. Undeniably, this rule serves to compensate the plaintiff for the inability to utilize funds rightfully due him, but the basic aim of the rule is to alleviate delay in the disposition of cases, thereby lessening congestion in the courts.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[212,1439,1151,573]]]'>This objective is even more visible when compared with pre-judgment interest rules in other states. New Jersey’s Rule 4:42-11, which also has been subjected to procedural-substantive scrutiny,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> uniformly provides interest at 6% per annum on the amount of the jury verdict or award from the date the lawsuit is filed or six months after the tort, whichever is later. Successful plaintiffs are compensated for delay whether they receive and reject any reasonable settlement offers or not. There is no impetus to the plaintiff to accept an early yet reasonable settlement offer, since the interest continues to run after the offer is made.</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.6",133,[212,2040,1150,203]],["BL_134.1",134,[271,273,1156,459]]]'>The restrictions placed on the Pennsylvania rule encourage early disposition of tort litigation in a way that New Jersey’s rule does not.

Should the plaintiff reject it and not recover an award 25% greater than the offer, the defendant is assessed interest only from the date on which the complaint is filed or one year from the accrual of the action, whichever is later, up to the date of the settlement offer. Thus, the format of Rule 238 is responsive to its fundamental goal of prompting meaningful negotiations in major cases so as to unclutter the courts.</p>

First, the plaintiffs and defendants were apparently viewed as similarly circumstanced, yet disparately treated because, according to the trial court, “[t]he rule does not provide for delay damages to be awarded to the defendant if it is the plaintiff who is delaying the action.” Secondly, the trial court, even when it conceded that the reason for the rule evolved from this Court’s desire to speed cases along and reduce backlog, observed,</p>

This is simply wrong. Rule 238 obviously creates distinctions between plaintiffs and defendants. The difference upon which the classification rests is that the plaintiffs have <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>been wrongly injured and have suffered financial losses because of the defendants’ action. The losses then become exacerbated by defendants’ refusal to settle the lawsuit in a timely fashion. The defendants, on the other hand, have suffered no wrong. They, as the tortfeasors, are not unjustly deprived of compensation during the course of pre-trial delays. On the contrary, it is in the best interests of the defendants to protract the litigation process as long as possible, so that they may benefit from the funds rightfully owing to the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b143-4" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[205,876,1150,1015]]]'>The crucial question now before us is whether the above distinction advances the objective of Rule 238 in the manner consistent with the precepts of the Equal Protection Clause. Here, the opinion of the trial court falters in its reliance upon the need for the trial judge’s discretionary administration of Rule 238 as a deterrent to pre-trial delay. We believe that the operation of the Rule in question bears a fair and substantial relation to its articulated goal — the encouragement of defendants to settle meritorious claims as soon as is reasonably possible. The policy of uniformly adding pre-judgment interest to all judgments where the defendant did not make any offer of settlement, or where the judgment exceeded the offer by 25%, encourages early activity on the part of the defendants to resolve legitimate claims in an expeditious fashion and deprives them of the opportunity to benefit from needless delays and last-minute settlements. In light of the above, we cannot say that the difference in the treatment of defendants is constitutionally invalid. <em>See Bullins v.

It is true that Rule 238 does disgorge profit on funds placed in reserve by insurance companies for upcoming trials. However, while some defendants may in fact be uninsured, they have nonetheless caused the loss to the plaintiffs by their tortious conduct and owe compensation to their victims. Uniformly, the plaintiffs are the parties prejudiced by the long litigation process; whether the defendants are insured or uninsured does not lessen their loss. The only thing which reduces a plaintiff’s loss is an early settlement of his damages.

Thus, our Commonwealth’s substantive law, regulating citizens’ day-to-day conduct, has traditionally been determined through legislative lawmaking and common-law decision. The Legislature, with unique factfinding capacities designed not only to correct but also to anticipate social problems, both broadly declares public policies and minutely provides for the details of implementation. This Court regulates day-to-day conduct through judicial resolution of specific controversies, applying common-law techniques to develop an appropriate substantive rule.</p>

At common law, it was determined that the plaintiff “could have execution only for the amount of the judgment without interest. In order to recover that he must resort to a new action.” <em>Stewart v. Peterson’s Executors, </em><a href="/pa/63/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="63 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1018909" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0230-01">63 Pa. 230</a>, 232 (1869). By the Act of November 27, 1700, the Legislature modified this rule to provide that “[ljawful interest shall be allowed to the creditor for the sum or value he obtained judgment for, from the time the said judgment was obtained till the time of sale, or till <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>satisfaction be made.” 1 Sm.L. 7, § 2, formerly 12 P.S. § 782 (1953). The Act of April 6, 1859, P.L. 381, § 1, formerly 12 P.S. § 781 (1953), extended the availability of interest, making interest run as of the date of favorable verdict.

Rule 238 is as much a modification of the availability of interest as the Act of 1700 and the Act of 1859. Like both Acts, Rule 238 has made pre-verdict interest a “substantive part of the debt.” See also <em>Bullins v.

Interest is to be computed either from the date the complaint is filed, or from one year after accrual of the cause of action, whichever is the later date. Rule 238(a)(2). Where a plaintiff files a complaint immediately after the accrual of the cause of action, the defendant has time to evaluate the merits of the complaint and make a reasoned settlement offer. However, where the plaintiff files a complaint more than one year after accrual, the defendant is immediately subjected to the interest penalty, with no “free time” in which to make a reasoned evaluation of the merits.</p>

      <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>The unfairness of Rule 238 is further compounded by its imposition of duties and sanctions only upon defendants, and not upon plaintiffs. If the object of the Rule is to discourage delay, the Rule should not only require defendants to make reasonable settlement offers, but also should require plaintiffs to make reasonable demands. Failure of either party to make a reasonable effort to settle should result in the imposition of similar sanctions.</p>
