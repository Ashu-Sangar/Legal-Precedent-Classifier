In some cases, sales prices provide very good evidence of market values, and in other cases they provide only poor evidence.

    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[290,496,1159,770]]]'>By concluding that taxpayer’s method is “the one commonly utilized in Pennsylvania,” and that the court of common pleas erred in accepting remaining aspects of the Board expert’s method, the Commonwealth Court would require the trial court to terminate any further inquiry into the “representative” quality of sales data. However, the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion overlooks the danger that sales data may not provide a reasonably random sample of all properties in the taxing district. Particular sales data are permissibly employed because sales prices can provide a reasonable forecast of fair market values of properties in the taxing district. Without adjustments beyond the elimination of non-arm’s-length transactions, there is a serious risk that the calculations of common-level ratios will reflect not the taxing district, but only the sample of properties sold.</p>
    <p id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[292,1283,1157,410]]]'>This difficulty is best illustrated by what has become the classic, textbook case of unrandom sampling. In 1936, the now-defunct <em>Literary Digest </em>sought to predict the results of that year’s presidential election. Sample voters were selected from among owners of telephones and owners of automobiles. Based on its poll taken from the sample voters, the <em>Digest </em>predicted that Alfred Landon would defeat Franklin Roosevelt by a landslide. The opposite was true.</p>
    <p id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.6",224,[292,1709,1157,514]]]'>The <em>Digest </em>was the victim not of voters’ last-minute change of heart, but of its own unsound sampling technique. If only those who owned telephones and automobiles had been permitted to vote, the <em>Digest </em>might well have forecast the 1936 election correctly. However, many more than owners of telephones and automobiles comprised the electorate than were included in the <em>Digest’s </em>sample. Those excluded from the poll provided Roosevelt his greatest support. See Freund &amp; Williams’ Modern Business Statistics at 271 (Perles &amp; Sullivan rev. 1969).</p>

      <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>The evidence of the Board’s expert established that, like the ill-fated <em>Literary Digest </em>poll, taxpayer’s sales data were not properly adjusted to reflect the entire taxing district.

    <p id="b225-4" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[203,615,1152,579]]]'>Unlike the Commonwealth Court, we perceive no inconsistency between the Board expert’s stratification of sales data by use-type and <em>Deitch’s </em>prohibition against different ratios for different use-types. To the contrary, the Board expert’s stratification technique was specifically designed to avoid the computation of a common-level ratio which would unduly reflect the ratios of residential properties. If anything is “commonly utilized in Pennsylvania” it is stratification. See 61 Pa.Code § 603.21(1) (State Tax Equalization Board “analyz[es] and tabulates] taxable real property assessments by use of property”).</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[201,1213,1156,1128]]]'>We also are unpersuaded by taxpayer’s argument against the Board expert’s use of an “unweighted ratio.” Although a weighted ratio has been termed the “single most appropriate measure for estimating the full cash value of all real property in a particular use class or stratum of properties,” Improving Real Property Assessments, supra, at 127, it has also been said that “[t]he appropriateness of the weighting feature ... is a matter of opinion with respect to the measurement of assessment performance.” Id. As has already been seen, the Board expert’s use of an unweighted ratio was but an intermediate step in the calculation of the overall common-level ratios. The Board’s expert expressed the opinion that this intermediate step was a statistically sound means of achieving the critical end of adjusting for imperfections in the sales data. Thus taxpayer’s contention is merely a challenge to the trial court’s decision to accept as credible the Board expert’s view. Like other challenges to a fact-finder’s resolution of credibility supported by the evidence, this contention cannot prevail. See, e. g., <em>Tinicum Real Estate Holding Corp. v.
