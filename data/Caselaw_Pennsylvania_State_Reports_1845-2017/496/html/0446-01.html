    <p id="b521-10" data-blocks='[["BL_521.9",521,[192,1102,1153,635]]]'>Appellant Kenneth N. Nickol was convicted after a nonjury trial of murder of the second degree, robbery and carrying a firearm without a license. He was represented at trial by three members of the Luzerne County Public Defender’s Office. On direct appeal this Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. <em>Commonwealth v. Nickol, </em><a href="/pa/476/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="476 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1736841" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0075-01">476 Pa. 75</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="476 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1736841" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0075-01">381 A.2d 873</a> (1977). Nickol filed a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. 1580 (1965), 19 P.S. § 1180-1 et seq. (Supp.1981-82), assailing trial counsels’ representation as ineffective. After an evidentiary hearing, the PCHA court denied relief. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b521-11" data-blocks='[["BL_521.10",521,[191,1759,1153,584]],["BL_522.1",522,[269,313,1159,305]]]'>Nickol raises six theories to support his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel: counsel were ineffective for failing to move to suppress statements made by Nickol on the second day of questioning, although Nickol had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings on that date; counsel were ineffective for refusing to allow appellant to testify at the suppression hearing; counsel were ineffective for failing to offer expert testimony at the suppression hearing regarding Nickol’s intelligence and psychiatric background; counsel were ineffective for failing to review notes of the prosecuting officer; counsel were ineffective for advising Nickol to <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>waive trial by jury and counsel were ineffective for not insuring that a prior mistaken identification by a witness who testified at trial fully availed Nickol’s cause. After a careful review of the law and the record, unassisted by Commonwealth brief, we hold Nickol’s claims are without merit. The order of the lower court is affirmed.</p>
