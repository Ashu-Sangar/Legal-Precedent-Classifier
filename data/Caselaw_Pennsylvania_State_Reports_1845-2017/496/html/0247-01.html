Other respondents include 17 other successful nominees. Two state senators who voted to confirm respondents’ appointments and the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been granted leave to intervene. Invoking our original jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 721(3) (Purdon 1981), petitioners filed a Petition for Review in the Nature of Quo Warranto seeking to oust Respondent Daniels from her seat. Similar actions were filed against the other respondent nominees, and our decision in the initial action will be dispositive as to those as well. Having considered the matter presented in the petition, we uphold the validity of the challenged executive appointments and accordingly deny the relief requested by petitioners.</p>

Initially, the nomination was tabled, but it was reconsidered on January 27, 1981, when a vote was taken. The affirmative votes of a majority of the members elected to the Senate were required to confirm her appointment under 71 P.S. § 67.1(d)(4) (Purdon Supp. 1981). The nomination received 25 “yeas” and 22 “nays,” and the President of the Senate, finding that the requisite vote of a constitutional majority had been obtained, ruled the appointment confirmed.</p>

To make such a determination, a court must first of all construe the relevant constitutional text, and seek to identify the purposes the particular provision serves within the constitutional scheme as a whole.

But ultimately, the political question inquiry turns as much on the court’s conception of judicial competence as on the constitutional text. Thus the political question doctrine, like other justiciability doctrines, at bottom reflects the mixture of constitutional interpretation and judicial discretion which is an inevitable by-product of the efforts of federal courts to define their own limitations.”</blockquote>

Thus, if in the instant situation the two persons not in office at the time of the vote on Respondent Daniels’ nomination were instead merely absent, petitioners’ method of computing a majority would have been correct. To include among the number of individuals charged with the responsibility of reviewing the qualifications of the Governor’s nominees, senators-elect or former senators, neither entitled to vote in the Senate, would in no way enhance the ability of the Senate to advise and consent. What it would do, however, is cause Article IV, section 8(a) to require <em>greater than a majority vote </em>whenever there was a vacancy in the Senate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> This would place a proportionately greater burden on the executive branch when a vacancy or vacancies exist in the Senate, which could in turn encourage needless delay in filling appointive positions.</p>

Both petitioners and respondents posit “doomsday” hypotheticals in which 25 of 50 senators are killed in a disaster. While under respondents’ interpretation of the phrase in question, a lesser number of senators could override the Governor’s veto than were originally required to pass the vetoed bill, under the same circumstances, the Senate would be incapable of taking any action requiring the vote of a majority of all members if petitioners’ interpretation of Article IV, § 8(a) were followed. The latter consequence is by far the less desirable.</p>
