Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on which the convictions were based, as well as the legality of his arrest, a search of his residence, and a statement which he had given to police. We conclude that the evidence does not support the conviction of rape. However, we also conclude that the record is free of error in all other respects. Accordingly, the judgment of sentence is modified and, as modified, affirmed.</p>

The victim’s throat had been slashed, causing her death. There were also lacerations of the hands, face, and chest. The assailant had entered the victim’s apartment through a kitchen window and had ransacked a considerable portion of the apartment, including the bedroom, searching for valuables. Medical examination revealed the presence of sperm in the victim’s vagina.</p>
    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[217,898,1152,758]]]'>On December 13, three days after the victim’s body had been discovered, two acquaintances of appellant gave information to police concerning the crime. In sworn statements, both persons told police that appellant had admitted killing the victim. One of the persons, who saw appellant on the morning that the body had been discovered, stated that appellant had told him that he “used his big knife” to cut the throat of the “lady that lives near the playground,” and had taken some whiskey from her apartment. This person stated that he had observed a red substance on appellant’s shoes, which appellant had identified as blood. The other person supplied police with substantially the same information, and additionally told police that appellant had shown him a knife which appellant claimed to have used to kill the victim.</p>

As a result of a search of the premises, police recovered items of clothing, a knife with a blade of approximately eighteen inches, and two empty bottles of whiskey. Upon taking appellant into custody, police advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and transported him to police headquarters. There he was once again advised of his rights. After questioning, appellant supplied police with a statement, subsequently reduced to writing by police and signed by appellant, in which he admitted breaking into the victim’s apartment, killing the victim with his knife, and taking liquor. However, appellant also stated: “I didn’t mess with her or anything like that. I don’t remember messing with her like that; no, no. I didn’t have any sex with her.”</p>

The Court of Common Pleas of Berks County denied relief, but granted appellant’s application for a change of venue. The matter was then tried before a jury in York County. The Commonwealth presented ample evidence in support of its charges of murder of the first degree and burglary. As to the charge of rape, the Commonwealth established that the victim had no male acquaintances and that appellant was the only person who had entered the victim’s residence on the night of the killing. Through expert testimony, the Commonwealth also established the presence of sperm in the victim’s vagina. On cross-examination, the Commonwealth’s expert admitted that he could not tell how long the sperm had been there.</p>

In addition, sentences of ten to twenty years’ imprisonment were imposed on the burglary and rape convictions. These latter sentences were to run concurrent to each other, but consecutive to the sentence imposed on the murder conviction. This appeal followed.</p>
