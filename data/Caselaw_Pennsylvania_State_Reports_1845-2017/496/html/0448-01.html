Appellant was convicted for allegedly selling four packets of heroin to an undercover policeman. The Commonwealth’s evidence at trial consisted of testimony by the undercover policeman that appellant sold him the heroin for $40 and that the transaction was arranged by George Paine, an informant, who introduced appellant to the undercover officer. Appellant, the sole defense witness, denied selling heroin to the officer and alleged that Mr. Paine was an eyewitness to the entire course of events. Mr. Paine was not called to testify at trial, nor did trial counsel interview this prospective witness prior to deciding not to call him to testify at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[265,1418,1159,525]]]'>At the outset, we must emphasize the well-established standard “that our inquiry ceases and counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

    <blockquote id="AWr" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[262,759,1114,1220]]]'>However hostile these witnesses may have appeared to be, there is no basis for the decision neither to interview them nor to attempt to do so. While hostile witnesses at trial may have presented added difficulties to appellant’s case, the question here is the decision not to interview them, not the decision to refrain from calling them at trial. Accordingly, there was no danger of hostile witnesses inflaming a jury during an interview to determine what each saw and their degree of potential hostility. Rather, the value of the interview is to inform counsel of the facts of the case so that he may formulate strategy. Perhaps, after questioning these witnesses, counsel may have concluded that the best strategy was not to call them due to hostility and, as a matter of strategy, that decision on counsel’s part would not be subject to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth v. Owens, </em><a href="/pa/454/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="454 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="579888" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0268-01">454 Pa. 268</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=312%20A.2d%20378" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="312 A.2d 378">312 A.2d 378</a> (1973). <em>However, no such claim of strategy can be attached to a decision not to interview or make an attempt to interview eyewitnesses prior to trial. </em>Therefore, no reasonable basis designed to effectuate Mabie’s interest can be attributed to counsel’s failure to question these witnesses or at least make a reasonable attempt to do so.</blockquote>
