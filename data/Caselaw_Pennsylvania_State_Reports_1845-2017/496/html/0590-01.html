This practice, conducted under the supervision of the school’s football coaches, proceeded without the use of protective equipment in spite of the fact that certain aspects of the practice involved rough body contact. Appellant had played football on the school team during the prior two years and had been a starting member of the team. He had also played “jungle football” during previous football practice sessions and was generally familiar with the game. Appellant and other members of the team attended a preseason football meeting during which the football coach informed them of the existence of the pre-season practice sessions and caused them to believe that if they did not attend the pre-season practice and training sessions, they would be unlikely to make the team. The practice sessions included various physical activities, such as weight lifting, running, hitting the blocking sled, and jungle football. Team members were expected to participate in all aspects of the practice sessions. On the day of the injury, the coach directed the team to begin a game of jungle football after other aspects of that day’s practice had been concluded. Play in the jungle football exercise was rough, involving body blocks, tackling, and the participants played hard, hoping to impress the coaches. The coaches themselves played in the jungle football game, and during the game, therefore, were not in a position to supervise the play. Appellant testified that he did not anticipate the loss of an eye as an injury he was likely to suffer while playing football.</p>

Once again, taking evidence in the light most favorable to the appellant, a “touch” football game in which body blocking and tackling occurs, in which the coaches themselves participate instead of monitoring, may be said at least to present a jury question as to the negligence of the coaches in not providing protective equipment and in not monitoring the play.

The doctrine of assumption of risk, as cited by the trial court, is articulated in the Restatement of Torts 2d at § 496 A: “A plaintiff who assumes a risk of harm arising from the negligent or reckless conduct of the defendant cannot recover for such harm.” (Hereafter the Restatement of Torts 2d shall be cited merely as Restatement.) This statement of law, so far as it goes, is correct, but for the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court erred in barring the appellant’s action on the assumption of risk theory.</p>

Most importantly, section 496 C, comment “a” indicates that knowledge and voluntariness are elements of an implied assumption of risk, and that these elements are discussed at sections 496 D and E, respectively. The policy behind implied assumption of risk, indicated at § 496 C, comment “b”, is that “the law refuses to permit one who manifests willingness that another shall continue in a course of conduct to <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>complain of it later if he is hurt as a result of it.” The problems of knowledge and voluntariness will be discussed presently, but first we consider the import of this policy statement.</p>

There is at least a question for the jury, then, as to whether appellant was compelled to accept the risk of playing jungle football in order to exercise or protect his right or privilege to play football (§ 496 E, comment “c”). If he was so compelled, the acceptance of the risk was not voluntary, and thus he was not subject to the bar of the rule. Similarly, there is at least a question for the jury as to whether appellant had a reasonable alternative course of action (§ 496 E, comment “c”).

A second, and closely related, meaning is that the plaintiff has entered voluntarily into some relation with the defendant which he knows to involve the risk, and so is regarded as tacitly or impliedly agreeing to relieve the defendant of responsibility, and to take his own chances. Thus a spectator entering a baseball park may be regarded as consenting that the players may proceed with the game without taking precautions to protect him from being hit by the ball.

He may not be negligent in doing so, since his decision may be an entirely reasonable one, because the risk is relatively slight in comparison with the utility of his own conduct; and he may even act with unusual caution because he is aware of the danger. The same policy of the common law which denies recovery to one who expressly consents to accept a risk will, however, prevent his recovery in such a case.

      <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>At least two major problems arise when the doctrine is applied to this case. First, although it would seem that the “assumption of risk,” if there is one, would arise under type 2 because of an apparently voluntary relation between appellant and the school district, coaches and other players which is fraught with known risks. However, the case might fit under type 3 as well. It might be said that appellant voluntarily proceeded to encounter a known danger created by the appellee’s negligence. The confusion that results from this dual classification is that once the case is identified as belonging to type 2, there is a tendency not to question the voluntariness of the relationship, absent evidence of overt coercion, because the type 2 relationship itself is said to give rise to the assumption of risk.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On the surface, voluntariness seems to be assumed. Accordingly, once the case is categorized as a type 2 case, the analysis of voluntariness <em>seems </em>to be that if appellant voluntarily played football (i. e., if he voluntarily entered into a relationship with the school district), he voluntarily assumed the risk of injury due to playing football.</p>
    <p id="b683-4" data-blocks='[["BL_683.4",683,[193,1350,1152,150]],["BL_684.1",684,[258,294,1160,367]]]'>To show the fallacy of this view it is necessary to discuss a second major problem related to the practical application of the assumption of risk doctrine: the proper definition of <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>“risk”. What risk can appellant be said to have voluntarily-assumed? One possibility is that he assumed the risk of all injuries related to training for and playing football. A second possibility is that he assumed the risk of all injuries related to training for and playing football while under the direction of coaches who furnished watchful supervision and protective equipment when needed.</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[256,680,1160,1272]]]'>It is apparent that when the risk is defined more narrowly, as we think it should be, the analysis of voluntariness changes. In order to voluntarily engage in any activity, one must know what the activity is and then decide, as a matter of choice, to participate. Appellant was familiar with varsity football and he voluntarily participated in it, but it does not follow that he voluntarily participated in jungle football if such participation was required to make the varsity team. The fact that appellant voluntarily tried to make the football team, therefore, has nothing to do with whether he voluntarily played jungle football. Another way to put this is that the voluntariness of appellant’s act must be proximately related to the danger (or the risk) which caused the injury. Otherwise, the question of voluntariness, which is said to be at “the basis” of assumption of risk, Restatement § 496 E, comment a, would be avoided, for the only relevant voluntariness is voluntariness related to the risk. In this case, appellant’s voluntary act was that he associated himself with an athletic program which was presumed to be competently and safely administered. It is at least a jury question whether appellant’s voluntary association extended to the jungle football activity. And that question must be answered, for it was during the jungle football game that the injury occurred.</p>

The jury awarded a verdict for the plaintiff and the defendant argued on appeal that the trial court’s refusal to instruct on assumption of risk was error. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and awarded a new trial, holding that an instruction on assumption of risk should have been given. Judge Staley, in a strong dissent, argued that the trial court was not in error and that the majority’s statement of the nature of the risk assumed did not comport with the proof. Citing the Restatement 2d § 496D, Judge Staley noted that: “[A] plaintiff does not assume a risk of harm arising from the defendant’s conduct unless he knows of the existence of the risk and appreciates its unreasonable character.” He then stated that the majority’s definition of the risk assumed in this case as the danger that if one places one’s hand in the worm gear, it will be injured. Judge Staley would have defined the risk as the danger that if one places one’s hand in the funnel of the meat grinder, the hand will be drawn into the worm gear by the meat. He formulated the definition of risk this way because of plaintiff’s testimony that while he was aware of the danger of putting his hand into the worm gear, he was unaware of the danger that the meat, once inserted into the machine, would catch his hand and draw it into the worm gear.</p>

Assumption of risk, types 2, 3 and 4, therefore, which act as a complete bar to recovery, regardless of the reasonableness of plaintiffs behavior, are incompatible with our comparative negligence statute and should be abolished for this reason as well as for the other reasons given.</p>

Appellant had also played jungle football during those previous years.
