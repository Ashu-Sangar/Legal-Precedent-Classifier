Bortz initially declined the position because his status as an academic faculty member entitled him to benefits not available to administrative faculty members. After receiving express promises from the college president that the acceptance of the EDC position would not affect his entitlement to benefits as an academic faculty member, Bortz assumed the duties of the directorship.</p>

Unless we are to repudiate the standard of review we articulated in <em>Community College of Beaver County, </em>the award cannot be sustained. Not only do I perceive no reasons of policy to justify changing our present standard even though application of the rule works an apparent injustice here, but I perceive the possibility of substantial damage to the administration of collective bargaining agreements were the standard changed.</p>

    <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.8",320,[277,1481,1158,627]]]'>The majority expressly recognizes (1) that “the arbitrator held that . . . the written provisions of the collective bargaining agreement <em>precluded </em>Bortz from receiving overtime compensation,” (p. 988) (Emphasis supplied), and (2) that the arbitrator’s award was based solely on his finding of sufficient detrimental reliance upon a <em>subsequent promise </em>of the college administration to justify application of Section 90 of the Restatement of Contracts. (P. 988). I therefore must express my dissent to the majority’s obviously inconsistent conclusion that “the arbitrator’s award is derived from a reasonable interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.”</p>
