He argues that since Cusack had failed to identify him at a lineup conducted prior to the preliminary hearing, Cusack’s subsequent in-court identification of appellant was impermissibly tainted by his alleged observation of appellant at the hearing. Thus, appellant argues, his counsel was ineffective for failing to attempt to suppress Cusack’s testimony on this basis. This Court has already held, in response to appellant’s challenge on direct appeal, that Cusack’s inability to identify appellant at the lineup did not affect the admissibility of Cusack’s in-court identification testimony, but only its weight and credibility. <a href="/pa/466/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="466 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1714960" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0102-01">466 Pa. at 113</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="466 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1714960" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0102-01">351 A.2d at 64</a>. The independent basis of Cusack’s identification of appellant was elicited in detail by the Commonwealth and subjected to rigorous cross-examination at both of appellant’s trials. In <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>the face of this demonstrated independent basis, a motion to suppress the identification testimony of Cusack would have succeeded only upon a showing that the alleged sighting of appellant by Cusack “was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of misidentification.” <em>Simmons v. United States, </em><a href="/us/390/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="390 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="6170914" data-case-paths="/us/390/0377-01">390 U.S. 377</a>, 384, <a href="/us/390/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="390 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="6170914" data-case-paths="/us/390/0377-01">88 S.Ct. 967</a>, 971, <a href="/us/390/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="390 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="6170914" data-case-paths="/us/390/0377-01">19 L.Ed.2d 1247</a> (1968). Here, appellant’s unsupported allegation, even if true, does not seriously undermine the reliability of Cusack’s in-court identification. Because the trial court would have properly denied a motion to suppress Cusack’s testimony, see <em>Commonwealth v.

Only if it is shown that the interests of justice warrant recusal will a hearing be ordered before a different judge. <em>Commonwealth v.

The sole grounds upon which appellant argues that the post-conviction hearing judge should have recused himself are that the judge found no merit in any of appellant’s claims and that the judge often told appellant during the hearings to “hurry his case along and get to the point of his arguments.” Appellant’s first ground is, of course, not a basis for recusal. As to the second ground, the record reveals that the hearing judge was exceptionally fair and patient with appellant during the course of the seven evidentiary hearings conducted with regard to appellant’s petition. The judge acceded to appel<a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>lant’s insistence on presenting much of his own case and permitted appellant both to examine and cross-examine witnesses extensively and to argue his points at length, interceding only when appellant became unduly digressive or repetitive.

Appellant contends that because the transcript notes the hearing date as December 12,1978, instead of December 8,1978, when appellant alleges the hearing took place, the entire transcript should be regarded as suspect. The post-conviction hearing court addressed this contention and found the transcript to be accurate, regardless of the correct hearing date. Although appellant has presented numerous exhibits to show that the hearing in fact took place on December 8, he has presented no valid reasons why this Court should reject the finding of the post-conviction court, nor has he demonstrated that any prejudice resulted from the alleged discrepancies in the transcript.
