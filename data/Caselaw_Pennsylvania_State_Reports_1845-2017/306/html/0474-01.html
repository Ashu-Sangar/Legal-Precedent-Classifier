On the petition here present, by agreement of counsel, a commissioner was appointed to take testimony and report to the court below; and it was further agreed that testimony so taken should be regarded and have the same effect as though heard in open court or on depositions regularly taken. Exceptions to findings of the commissioner were considered and dismissed by the court in banc. The conclusion reached was that the evidence did not justify opening the judgment as to petitioner.</p>

C. Helzlsouer, of the equipment of the Union Hotel in Monessen, Westmoreland County (which hotel Golub leased from Helzlsouer), the total consideration for the fixtures, etc., being $12,000. Nicholas Yincetish signed the note as accommodation endorser; he was not intoxicated when he did so; and, moreover, he and Nick Golub discussed the signing of the note within a week after its delivery. The <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>consideration for the $6,000 note, on which there now remains an unpaid balance of $2,850, with interest from March 1, 1929, was not founded on an illegal consideration. The revival of the judgment was by an amicable sci. fa., November Term, 1928, of which Nicholas Vincetish accepted service and confessed judgment in the presence of witnesses, one of whom explained to him the significance of his signature and the obligation to which it bound him. All payments on account of the principal debt of the note in question were made by Nick Golub, and defendant Vineetish made three payments on account of interest, September 11, 1928, December 28,1928, and March 1, 1929. At the time the latter payments were made, defendant did so knowing he was under a financial obligation to the bank, made no protest or denial of the debt, and had sufficient knowledge of the English language and customs of business to know the importance of his financial obligations. No denial of the debt or its consideration was made by defendant at any time until the filing of the petition to open judgment. Petitioner had been a resident of the United States for about thirty-two years and a citizen since 1914, and at the time of thé hearing was engaged in the business of erecting small houses and other buildings, and has been for some time engaged in the contracting business.</p>

We are acquainted with all of the witnesses who testified for the defendant petitioner. Their testimony is conclusively against the opening of this judgment. Indeed [his] own testimony, standing alone, we are of the opinion, would not be sufficient to move a chancellor to strike down a solemn written instrument such as a judgment note <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>under seal...... The evidence submitted by the defendant petitioner is so vague, contradictory and unsupported that it is far from measuring up to the quality and standard of evidence the authorities consistently require” (citing Certelli v. Braum, <a href="/pa/294/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="294 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1113420" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0488-01">294 Pa. 488</a>, where this court said, “A defendant who seeks to strike down his written obligation must present evidence which is clear, precise and indubitable”). In addition, the chancellor found that petitioner’s “clear and regular signature” on the note led to the conclusion, confirmed by testimony, that he was sober when he affixed it. See Wertheimer’s Est., <a href="/pa/286/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="286 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1096505" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0155-01">286 Pa. 155</a>.</p>
