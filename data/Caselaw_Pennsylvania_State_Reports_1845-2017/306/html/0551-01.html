She could neither read nor write. The alleged execution of the will took place on June 2, 1928, while Mrs. Kelly was a patient in a hospital. Miss Wells, the superintendent of the hospital was one of the subscribing witnesses and identified her signature affixed as a subscribing witness. Miss Koch, the bookkeeper of the hospital, also subscribed her name as a witness to the will. Miss Koch did not see the name Bridget Kelley written to the will but testified that she saw Mrs. Kelly make her mark to the will. When the will was offered in evidence, the contestant objected to its admission on the ground that the will was not properly executed, because the subscribing witnesses who saw Mrs. Kelly affix her mark did not testify that they saw her name signed at the end thereof when she made her mark. The court sustained the objection.</p>

      <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>The subscribing witnesses were then recalled by the proponent. Miss Wells testified that though she saw the testatrix make the cross she didn’t see the name Bridget Kelly on the paper at that time, and that to the best of her recollection the name Bridget Kelly wasn’t there. Miss Koch testified that she saw Mrs. Kelly make the cross, that Attorney McGurl gave Mrs. Kelly a pen and he held her hand while she made the cross. She was asked what did McGurl say in her presence before she (Mrs. Kelly) put that cross on there, and she answered, “I don’t remember he said anything to her.” The witness also testified that so far as she remembered nothing was said before Mrs. Kelly affixed the cross. .</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[273,1051,1151,857]]]'>The proponent’s attorney then offered to prove by the testimony of the scrivener McGurl, that he affixed the name (Bridget Kelly) to the will after having read it to the testatrix, having prepared the will at her express directions and instructions; that she executed the same by the affixation of her cross in the presence of the two subscribing witnesses, Miss Wells and Miss Koch, after he had written her name at the end thereof at her express direction. The court then asked, Did he write the name in their presence? The attorney answered, “I wouldn’t be able to say that at this time.” Counsel for the contestant objected to the receipt of the will even though McGurl should testify according to the offer, contending that this would not meet the legal requirement of proof by two subscribing witnesses under the Wills Act. The objection was sustained.</p>
