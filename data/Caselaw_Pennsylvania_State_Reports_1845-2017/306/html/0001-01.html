It was in the usual form, conveying to the mortgagee, his heirs and assigns, the property described, together with “the reversions and remainders, reñía, issues and profits thereof.” After it became due and payable, plaintiff notified the tenants of the property, all of whose leases were subsequent in date to the execution of plaintiff’s mortgage, that he required them to pay the rent to him. Seven of them did so; nevertheless, on three different months, the owner distrained upon all of them, and, on each occasion, a writ of replevin was issued by each tenant to recover the goods distrained. With matters in this shape, plaintiff filed the present bilMjL.equity, praying a decree that an injunction be granted against the owner and his real estate agent who ordered and his constable who made the distraints, from further proceeding therewith; that the tenants be required to pay their rents to plaintiff; that the replevin suits be consolidated into this proceeding; and for other relevant relief. The owner and his agent and constable answered the bill, including therein new matter, in the nature of a cross bill, and prayed that the tenants be decreed to pay their rent to the owner; that plaintiff be required to account for the rents he had collected; that he be enjoined from collecting any further rents; and for other relevant relief. Pending the trial of the case, the property was sold by the sheriff, who conveyed it to the purchaser at the sale, and thereafter the suit was continued only with regard to the rents which had accrued and been paid to plaintiff or the owner, between the date of plaintiff’s notice to the tenants and the date of the deed from the sheriff.</p>

It appealed, and, in its statement of the question involved, only asks us to decide whether or not, under the foregoing facts, plaintiff’s notice to the tenants justified them in paying and plaintiff in receiving the rents which the tenants’ leases stipulated should be paid to the owner.</p>

Superior Ct. 168</a>, that tribunal has reviewed all the relevant authorities in this State touching the questions at issue here, and has so clearly and satisfactorily determined all the points involved, that we need only state them and refer interested parties to the report of that case. The relevant questions there decided are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b27-4" data-blocks='[["BL_27.5",27,[139,1309,1163,415]]]'>1. While ordinarily, as to third parties.. a .mortgage, may be only a security for the debt specified in the accompanying bond, it is, as to the mortgagor and mortgagee, and those claiming under and through them, a conveyance of the land, and may be enforced as such whenever the mortgagee deems it necessary so to do in order to enable him to speedily and effectively recover the amount then due on the bond.</p>
    <p id="b27-5" data-blocks='[["BL_27.6",27,[139,1745,1151,261]]]'>2. Whenever it is necessary for a mortgagee, or his assignee, to enter into possession of the mortgaged property, in order to secure effectively what is due to him under the bond, he may do so peaceably, if he can, or by ejectment, if this becomes necessary.</p>
    <p id="b27-6" data-blocks='[["BL_27.7",27,[139,2019,1151,370]],["BL_28.1",28,[268,332,1147,151]]]'>3. Whenever a mortgagor or one claiming title under him leases the mortgaged premises after the execution of the mortgage, his rights are necessarily subject to the prior rights of the mortgagee or his ássignee, unless there is an agreement otherwise. Hence, if, under such circumstances, upon notice to the tenant, the latter pays the rent to the mortgagee or his assignee, it is the equiva<a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>lent of an attornment, and the mortgagor and those claiming title under him, cannot justly complain of such payments.</p>
    <p id="b28-4" data-blocks='[["BL_28.4",28,[267,496,1151,469]]]'>4. If a mortgagor or one claiming title under him collects rent from the tenant after the mortgagee or his assignee has properly notified the tenant to pay the rent on account of the mortgage debt, such owner will be held liable to account to the mortgagee or his assignee for the rent thus received, less any payments made on account of the property, which inured to the benefit of the one who should ultimately be found entitled to the rent so collected.</p>
    <p id="b28-5" data-blocks='[["BL_28.5",28,[268,986,1149,261]]]'>5. If the mortgagee or his assignee collects rent from the tenant by virtue of the right so to do given by the mortgage, he must account therefor to the mortgagor, or those claiming title under him, and allow the net amount as a credit on the mortgage debt.</p>
    <p id="b28-6" data-blocks='[["BL_28.6",28,[267,1258,1149,749]]]'>6. Whenever, by the terms of a mortgage, the rents of the property are expressly conveyed to the mortgagee, the latter or his assignee may, if the owner is in default, enforce that provision according to its terms.
