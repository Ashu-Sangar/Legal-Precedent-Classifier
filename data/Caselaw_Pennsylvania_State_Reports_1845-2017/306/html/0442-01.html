The basis of the charge is that the purchasers paid for the property in their common stocks, which was not a fair con<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>sideration for the property transferred because the stock had no salable, realizable value. The worth of the property transferred is said to have been $193,149.19 and the consideration paid was $75,000 in stock of the purchasing corporations, the satisfaction of admitted bona fide preferred claims against the selling corporation held by individuals interested in the purchasing ones of $28,000 and $75,000 and the payment of $15,149.19 in cash.

The conveyance so far as creditors were concerned was, therefore, in violation of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act of May 21,1921, P. L. 1045, section 4, which requires “a fair consideration.” (2) The vendor company was insolvent at the time the transfers were made within the definition of insolvency laid down by the act in section 2: “A person is insolvent when the present, fair, salable value of his assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay his probable liability on his existing debts as they become absolute and matured.” The court found that the consideration was fair and that the purchasers had no knowledge that the company was not solvent. It determined that there was no intention in any of the parties to the transactions to defraud creditors of the selling company.</p>

The agreement also provided that the common stock rights to assets and dividends should be postponed to the two issues of preferred stock. There were certain options given relating to the purchase of stock by Turnbull, Henson, Nichols and Burton in the event of death or disagreements and it was provided that the stock could not be sold or transferred except subject to these limitations which were to be shown by endorsement on the face of the shares. It was stipulated that the agreement should not become operative unless Burton should be satisfied that the valuations placed on the property to be acquired by the new corpo<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>rations would be sufficient to pay Ms and Henson and Nicbols’ indebtedness and tbe Company’s subscription to tbe common stock. Tbe debts of tbe Company were not to be assumed by the transferee corporations. Notice was not to be given under tbe Bulk Sales Act. Turn-bull and tbe Company covenanted to indemnify tbe two new corporations against any claims of tbe Company’s creditors under that statute, and further agreed to deposit with them the Company’s holdings of capital stock to be held until tbe ninety days prescribed by tbe Bulk Sales Act should have expired. Tbe terms of tbe agreement were carried out and tbe total valuation of the property to be transferred by tbe old Company was, as before stated, fixed at $193,149.19. The new lumber was turned over at tbe current quoted price and tbe old lumber at a tentative value, which was subject to adjustment, depending upon what was realized from its sale. Tbe old Company received $75,000 in common stock of tbe new corporations, tbe satisfaction of its indebtedness to Henson and Nicbols, amounting to $28,000, of its indebtedness to Burton, amounting to $75,000, and in addition there was paid to it $15,149.19 in cash.

It bad a capital of but $25,000, but bis latest statement certified by tbe Company’s accountant showed a net worth of $97,025.22. He was of tbe opinion that its net worth was in excess of $100,000. After tbe transfer, tbe old Company was left with assets on its books, amounting to $362,696.44, and liabilities amounting to $315,722.61. Subsequently, it developed that tbe books did not reflect tbe correct financial condition of tbe old Company, so that in reality, instead of being solvent, as its books indicated, it was <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>insolvent. The chancellor found that the appellees had no idea of this until sometime after the transfer had been consummated.</p>

Other creditors were given notes of the old Company with his personal endorsement and stock in the new corporations as security.

Both of these propositions are somewhat hypothetical and speculative. It certainly is open to grave question whether the stock of lumber could have been sold at the time of the transfer for anything like the full figure named and the chancellor so concluded ; and it is equally true that it could not have been determined at that time that the stock which subsequently turned out to be worthless did not have a value which approximated the real value of the materials which were given in exchange for it. If we were dealing with a case in which there was bad faith shown by the parties to the transaction, then it might be that it could be held fraudulent, but the chancellor and the court in banc determined that there was no bad faith on the part of those who carried it on. Henson and Nichols each put $75,000 in cash in the new Company, and Burton a like amount by releasing his preferred claim, so that these three individuals contributed $225,000 to the new Company based on their faith in its ability to operate successfully. That they were mistaken in their optimism as to the future success of the enterprise could not put the badge of fraud on what they did in apparent <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>good faith. A purchaser who in good faith pays a fair consideration, acquires a good title regardless of the seller’s insolvency: Jarvis v.

It would not strain the bounds of credulity to conclude that the creditors of the old Company who received stock in the new corporations would have been glad to have had its assets put into new concerns with $225,000 of additional capital added to the business. It is set forth in the findings of the chancellor that there was no testimony on the subject of the value of the stock after the transfer was made, except that its book value was par, that market value was not shown; in its absence, the best evidence is the book value: Jarvis v. Bell, <a href="/pa/296/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="296 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1116667" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0568-01">supra.</a> The chancellor concluded, and we see nothing to impeach his finding, that the new Company was soundly capitalized, that there was no watering of its stock, that it was manned and officered by experienced lumbermen. He concluded that the stock was worth its face value on October 29,1926. That the stock may not have been immediately salable when the Company received it could not prevent its being fair consideration, if it was then worth its face value. In many close trading corporations their capital stock is not salable. Having heard the witnesses, the chancellor refused to credit testimony tending to show that Burton had promised to lend additional money if it were needed to pay the debts of the old Company and we are bound by his finding in this respect. Categorically, he found: “The Wallace Turnbull Corporation and the Lumber Terminals, Inc., paid a fair consideration for the property which they respectively purchased from the Wallace Turnbull Company. The transaction between the Wallace Turnbull Company and the Wallace Turnbull Corporation and Lumber Terminals, Inc., was entered into in good faith and not for the purpose or with the intent of securing payment of the claims of Henson and <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>Burton or of defrauding, hindering or delaying further creditors of Wallace Turnbull Company.” Furthermore, he found that all parties concerned thought the old Turnbull Company was not only solvent, but prosperous. He summed up his own conclusion in this respect with the statement: “We think the company was sound. The plaintiff so alleges in the fourth paragraph of the bill.” Nothing brought to our attention has shaken the findings of the chancellor to which we have referred, and, in view of them, by looking backward over the situation which developed after the new business failed of success, we could not conclude that the transaction was fraudulent.</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[300,1047,1150,792]]]'>The test would not be what the stock was worth after the new corporations ceased to profitably function, but what was the stock worth at the time the transfer was made. The stock in the new corporations was issued for money actually subscribed (the releasing of the preferred claims against the old Company was in effect the payment of money) and for property of the old Company. There was no stock not issued for value. In the treasury of the old Company after the transaction was completed was the stock of the new companies which had been issued for the property of the old. At that time it could not be possible that it did not have value; that it thereafter depreciated could not avoid the transaction which the chancellor characterized as “entirely honest and sensible.”</p>
