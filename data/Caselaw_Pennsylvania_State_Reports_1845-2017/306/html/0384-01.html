    <p id="b407-8" data-blocks='[["BL_407.10",407,[107,1147,1157,1024]]]'>On April 17,1924, plaintiffs’ decedent, Samuel Achenbach, bought from defendants, six $500 bonds of Kurtz Brothers. Pour days thereafter, Kurtz Brothers wrote Achenbach saying: “Referring to the six $500 bonds ......which you purchased April 17, will say that if at the end of one year you so desire, we will buy back these bonds for $2,850, the amount you paid for same. Should you however keep the above mentioned bonds two years we agree to give you the sum of three thousand dollars for same and should you keep them until we call for same in four or five years, we will pay $50.00 bonus for each $1,000 bond.” Achenbach died July, 1930, six years subsequent to his purchase, having the bonds still in his possession. Upon refusal of Kurtz Brothers to repurchase the obligations, his administrators sold them at public sale, and their claim is for the difference between the selling price and the amount at which they allege Kurtz Brothers.were obligated to repurchase by the terms of their letter above quoted.</p>
