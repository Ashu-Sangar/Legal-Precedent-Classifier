The garage is intended to accommodate one hundred and fifty automobiles, and defendants in their answer assert that the garage is to be used solely for the storage of automobiles owned or used by tenants of the aforesaid apartment <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>house. The learned chancellor who heard the case granted an injunction. Exceptions taken to this adjudication were sustained by the court in banc, and the bill accordingly dismissed “without prejudice to plaintiffs’ right to reopen the proceedings if the future operation of the garage becomes in fact a nuisance.”</p>

Consequently, he further held the operation of a garage for the accommodation of one hundred and fifty automobiles is a nuisance per se in a residential district of the second class, and as such is restrainable by injunction. The court in banc, after careful consideration of the testimony, and a view of the locality, decided the neighborhood was a residential district of the third class. Following Ladner v. Siegel, <a href="/pa/296/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="296 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1116661" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0579-01">296 Pa. 579</a>, 591, to the effect that “in third class residential districts, a garage properly built to, under or around an apartment house is not a nuisance per se,” the court below reversed the chancellor and dismissed the bill, with the qualifications already referred to.</p>

It is frequently difficult to determine the precise classification into which a particular locality falls and this is especially true in a period of transition. But mere classification is not always determinative of the legal remedies flowing therefrom. Each case must, in a measure, stand upon its own facts. We said in Burke v. Hollinger, cited above, page 517, that “a public garage is not a nuisance in itself, yet it becomes such when conducted in a residential neighborhood” and this doctrine has been affirmed and reiterated many times since that decision. In Ladner v. Siegal, supra, the strict rules referred to in the Hollinger Case were somewhat relaxed, and it was emphatically stated, page 588, that “our decisions were based on the effect the use had on adjoining owners in damage to property and injury to health.” See also Yeager v. Traylor, <a href="/pa/306/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="306 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="1136924" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0530-01">306 Pa. 530</a>. In the case before us, we cannot feel that a modern garage of fireproof construction, and as near soundproof as human ingenuity can make it, will work a substantial injury on adjacent property owners in this particular neighborhood, when the use and accommodations of the garage are restricted to the occupants and guests of the apartment building connected therewith.</p>
