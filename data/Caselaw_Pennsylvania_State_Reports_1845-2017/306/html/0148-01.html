She acted as executrix until February 7, 1921, on which date, on petition of all parties, Mary I. Hall and Theodore E. Nickles were appointed trustees of the estate, and from that date its entire management was left in Nickles’s hands. He was a vice-president and director of the Northern National Bank, and carried the Hall Estate account in that bank. He also carried therein two personal accounts, one in the name of “Theodore E. Nickles,” the other in the name of “Theodore E. Nickles, Special.” On September 24, 1924, the bank account standing in the name of “Theodore E. Nickles” was overdrawn to the amount of $2,754.11, and there was a credit balance in the “Theodore E. Nickles, Special” account of $3,628.56. On that day Nickles drew a check, which showed on its face that it was drawn on the Hall account, having printed on it “Estate of Charles F. Hall, Dec’d,” to his own order in the sum of $4,000. The next day he deposited this check in the “Theodore E. Nickles” account, thereby paying his personal debt to the bank. The defendant is, by merger, the successor of the Northern National Bank. Nickles’s fraudulent conduct was not discovered until after his death in 1930, and the appointment of the plaintiff company as trustee in his stead. Within two months after the appointment of the new trustee, this action of assumpsit was begun.</p>

This principle is covered by section 9 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act, supra. In the instant case no action by anyone was necessary to inform the bank, as it had knowledge of all the facts essential to show a breach of trust. When the check on the trust account was accepted by the bank, and it credited the amount on its books in payment of Nickles’s personal debt to the bank, it participated in a transaction which was a breach of trust; it could not properly honor the check — by crediting the amount to his account.</p>

The learned judge of the court below has answered this argument conclusively in his memorandum opinion; he says: “While the bank could, perhaps, have protected itself by setting off the amount of the overdraft against the credit balance in Nickles’s special account, it did not, in fact, do so, but accepted moneys which it was on notice from the face of the check were trust funds, and applied them to the discharge of the trustee’s personal debt to it.”</p>

Nor, in the case of an express trust, does the statute begin to run in favor of the trustee until he has repudiated his trust <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>and knowledge of this has been brought home to the cestui que trust: Bruner v. Finley, <a href="/pa/187/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="187 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="900244" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0389-01">187 Pa. 389</a>, 406; Morrison v. Blake, <a href="/pa-super/33/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="33 Pa. Super. 290" data-case-ids="868572" data-case-paths="/pa-super/33/0290-01">33 Pa. Superior Ct. 290</a>. The defendant, who assisted Nickles to embezzle trust funds, who knowingly received and retains the benefit of the breach of trust, can no more claim the benefit of the statute than could Nickles himself (Marshall’s Est., supra); all persons so offending are equally culpable, they are joint tort-feasors, there is no primary or secondary liability between them, they are equally amenable: Hall v. Windsor Savings Bank, supra; Duckett v. National Mechanics’ Bank, supra.</p>
    <p id="b177-3" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[120,1002,1154,972]]]'>The statute of limitations applies to all cases at law and in the orphans’ court, and to all cases in equity except those technical and continuing trusts over which equity has exclusive jurisdiction: Yorks’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>; Keyser’s App., <a href="/pa/124/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="124 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="563113" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0080-01">124 Pa. 80</a>; Hostetter v. Hollinger, <a href="/pa/117/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="117 Pa. 606" data-case-ids="555811" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0606-01">117 Pa. 606</a>. But the statute, however, does not begin to run in favor of a participant in a breach of trust until the discovery of the fraud, that is, until the cestui knows, or under the circumstances ought to know, of the facts that give rise to his cause of action. It does not begin to run in favor of an express trustee who has repudiated his trust until knowledge of the repudiation has been brought home to the cestui que trust. And in actions based upon fraud, where the fraud has been actively concealed, or where a relationship of trust and confidence exists, it does not begin to run until the discovery of the fraud: Sankey v. McElevey, <a href="/pa/104/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="104 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="452114" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0265-01">104 Pa. 265</a>; Smith v. Blachley, <a href="/pa/198/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="198 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="920254" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0173-01">198 Pa. 173</a>.</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[121,1982,1151,198]]]'>For these reasons it follows that the defendant is equally liable at law or in equity for the trust funds wrongfully taken. The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
