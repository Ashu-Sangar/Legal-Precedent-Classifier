In January, 1929, plaintiff charged defendant with a breach of the terms of the lease, declared it terminated, and entered judgment in ejectment by confession against lessee. The judgment was opened upon application and defendant let into a defense, the questions there involved brought to trial, and a verdict rendered in favor of defendant, who, pending determination of the case, vacated the apartment.</p>
