    <p id="b169-14" data-blocks='[["BL_169.17",169,[136,1790,1156,587]],["BL_170.1",170,[273,332,1152,419]]]'>At the conclusion of the testimony in the lower court, defendant’s point for binding instructions was affirmed, and a verdict directed in his favor. The opinion of the court in banc granting a new trial states: “After a careful consideration and review of the testimony in this case, we are of the opinion that the trial judge erred in affirming this point [for binding instructions] and should have submitted the case to the jury” to determine the question of defendant’s negligence and the contributory negligence of the minor plaintiff. A supplementary opinion quoting evidence of various witnesses <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>gives in more detail tlie court’s reasons for concluding that a retrial should be had. Following our invariable rule, under such circumstances, we will not disturb an order granting a new trial, “except in cases where the record shows an unmistakable abuse of discretion”: Lombardo v. Barilla, <a href="/pa/302/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="302 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1129046" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0460-01">302 Pa. 460</a>, and cases there cited. In the appeal now before us the record fails to show such abuse.</p>
