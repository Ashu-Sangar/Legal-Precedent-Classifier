The cause of action was a promissory note for $5,000 signed by Baine dated March 25, 1927, payable three months after date to the order of S. 5. Spruks at the Lincoln Trust Company. April 16, 1927, Spruks discounted at the Bank a collateral note made by him and payable six months after date, in renewal of a collateral note discounted by him on October 6, 1926, and as collateral for the renewal note he placed with the South Side Bank the promissory note of Charles Baine for $5,000 which is now being sued upon. Spruks did not pay his note for which the $5,000 note was collateral and on the day on which the Baine note was due, the Bank endorsed it for collection and it was duly presented at the Lincoln Trust Company for payment. The note was marked “Not provided for by maker” and was duly protested.</p>

    <p id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.4",586,[275,450,1154,1129]]]'>The substance, of defendant’s testimony was that the note sued upon was the third note of a series of three notes made by Baine. That the first and second of the series were notes made by him to the Burwood Projector Company, in which company Spruks was a director, and that these Burwood Projector notes had been delivered to Spruks with the latter’s full knowledge that an agreement existed between Baine and the Burwood Projector Company that these notes were not payable until stock .of that company had been delivered to Baine. No such stock was ever delivered and the company is now defunct. Baine testified that the cashier of the Bank also knew that the Burwood Projector notes were not absolute obligations to pay but were obligations conditional on the delivery of stock of the company to Baine. Baine admitted that the two notes he had discussed with the Bank were the two notes made payable to the Projector Company and that he never had a talk with the cashier of the Bank with reference to the note sued upon. This latter note was made out not to the Projector Company but to Spruks.</p>

The court further instructed the jury that if they believed certain testimony of Mr. Spruks, their verdict should be for $5,000 with interest from June 25, 1927.</p>
