The learned chancellor, who, specially presiding, heard and determined the case, reached the conclusion that there was no partnership so far as ownership of the lands is concerned, that they belonged to defendant individually, that the partnership which existed between plaintiff and defendant was limited to the developing and selling of the lands- which defendant owned.</p>

Our examination of the record leads us to the conclusion that he rightly found the facts and we are in accord with any inferences which he may have drawn from them or from circumstances brought to his attention.
