        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Drew,\nThis is an appeal from the action of the court below in making absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nThere are no disputed facts in the case. By the will of Charles F. Hall, who died on February 2, 1901, Mary I. Hall, one of the plaintiffs, was designated executrix of his estate, and she was given a life interest in the income therefrom. She acted as executrix until February 7, 1921, on which date, on petition of all parties, Mary I. Hall and Theodore E. Nickles were appointed trustees of the estate, and from that date its entire management was left in Nickles\u2019s hands. He was a vice-president and director of the Northern National Bank, and carried the Hall Estate account in that bank. He also carried therein two personal accounts, one in the name of \u201cTheodore E. Nickles,\u201d the other in the name of \u201cTheodore E. Nickles, Special.\u201d On September 24, 1924, the bank account standing in the name of \u201cTheodore E. Nickles\u201d was overdrawn to the amount of $2,754.11, and there was a credit balance in the \u201cTheodore E. Nickles, Special\u201d account of $3,628.56. On that day Nickles drew a check, which showed on its face that it was drawn on the Hall account, having printed on it \u201cEstate of Charles F. Hall, Dec\u2019d,\u201d to his own order in the sum of $4,000. The next day he deposited this check in the \u201cTheodore E. Nickles\u201d account, thereby paying his personal debt to the bank. The defendant is, by merger, the successor of the Northern National Bank. Nickles\u2019s fraudulent conduct was not discovered until after his death in 1930, and the appointment of the plaintiff company as trustee in his stead. Within two months after the appointment of the new trustee, this action of assumpsit was begun.\nAs the allowance of the overdraft was in the nature of a loan (Pittsburg v. First Nat. Bank, 230 Pa. 176, 183), the defendant bank was in a dual position; it was the repository of the trust funds, and a creditor of the trustee. It is well settled that one who accepts a check drawn on a trust account to the order of the trustee in payment of a personal debt of the trustee is liable to the beneficiary if the trustee has committed a breach of his obligation: Norristown-Penn Trust Co. v. Middleton, 300 Pa. 522; Schmitt v. Potter Title & Trust Co., 61 Pa. Superior Ct. 301. See also Fehr v. Campbell, 288 Pa. 549; Odd Fellows Home v. Velenchick Bros., 73 Pa. Superior Ct. 153. This principle was incorporated in the Uniform Fiduciaries Act \u2014 Act of May 31, 1923, P. L. 468, section 5 \u2014 which expresses the law as theretofore existing: Norristown-Penn Trust Co. v. Middleton, supra. In its capacity as depositary, the defendant bank would not be made liable merely by the act of the trustee in drawing out trust funds to pay his personal debt, in the absence of notice of the breach of trust: Pennsylvania Title & Trust Co. v. Meyer, 201 Pa. 299. But if the bank has knowledge of the facts, so that it knows that for it to honor a check drawn by the trustee will be to aid a breach of trust, the bank will be liable for the amount of any checks thus honored: Frazier v. Erie Bank, 8 W. & S. 18; Penn Bank v. Frankish, 91 Pa. 339; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Diamond Nat. Bank, 194 Pa. 334. This principle is covered by section 9 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act, supra. In the instant case no action by anyone was necessary to inform the bank, as it had knowledge of all the facts essential to show a breach of trust. When the check on the trust account was accepted by the bank, and it credited the amount on its books in payment of Nickles\u2019s personal debt to the bank, it participated in a transaction which was a breach of trust; it could not properly honor the check \u2014 by crediting the amount to his account.\nIn both capacities the defendant bank acted wrongfully, and must be held liable to the injured beneficiary of the trust; as a creditor, the bank received this check under circumstances giving notice that the trustee was committing a breach of trust, and as depositary of the trust funds, it paid the check, knowing that it was being used in a breach of trust.\nIt is contended that as there was a credit balance, taking Nickles\u2019s two personal accounts into consideration, he was not indebted to the bank, that therefore the bank was not in the position of a creditor, and that hence the notice imputed to one who accepts a check on a trust account in payment of a personal debt of the trustee cannot be imputed to the defendant bank. The learned judge of the court below has answered this argument conclusively in his memorandum opinion; he says: \u201cWhile the bank could, perhaps, have protected itself by setting off the amount of the overdraft against the credit balance in Nickles\u2019s special account, it did not, in fact, do so, but accepted moneys which it was on notice from the face of the check were trust funds, and applied them to the discharge of the trustee\u2019s personal debt to it.\u201d\nIt is further contended by the appellant that inasmuch as the transaction upon which this action of assumpsit is based took place six years and two months before the suit was begun, the statute of limitations has run, and the plaintiffs are barred from recovering upon their claim. The defendant having received trust property from a trustee with knowledge that he was acting wrongfully \u2014 was paying off his personal debt with trust funds \u2014 joined in the breach of the trust and thus became a trustee ex maleficio. As a participant in the breach of trust, it holds the property impressed with the same trust, and is subject to the same rules and remedies, and has no greater rights or-privileges, than the original trustee from whom it received the property: Harrisburg Bank v. Tyler, 3 W. & S. 373; Sadler\u2019s App., 87 Pa. 154; Marshall\u2019s Est., 138 Pa. 285; Jackson v. Thompson, 222 Pa. 232; Hall v. Windsor Savings Bank, 97 Vt. 125; Duckett v. Nat. Mechanics\u2019 Bank, 86 Md. 400. In Perry on Trusts, 7th edition, section 217, it is said: \u201cIt is a universal rule, that if a man purchases property of a trustee, with notice of the trust, he shall be charged with the same trust, in respect to the property, as the trustee from whom he purchased.\u201d An express trustee, as was Nickles, may not plead the statute of limitations: Fox v. Cash, 11 Pa. 207; Norris\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 106; Marshall\u2019s Est., supra; In re Passmore, 194 Pa. 632; Gruber v. Hays, 280 Pa. 489. Nor, in the case of an express trust, does the statute begin to run in favor of the trustee until he has repudiated his trust and knowledge of this has been brought home to the cestui que trust: Bruner v. Finley, 187 Pa. 389, 406; Morrison v. Blake, 33 Pa. Superior Ct. 290. The defendant, who assisted Nickles to embezzle trust funds, who knowingly received and retains the benefit of the breach of trust, can no more claim the benefit of the statute than could Nickles himself (Marshall\u2019s Est., supra); all persons so offending are equally culpable, they are joint tort-feasors, there is no primary or secondary liability between them, they are equally amenable: Hall v. Windsor Savings Bank, supra; Duckett v. National Mechanics\u2019 Bank, supra.\nThe statute of limitations applies to all cases at law and in the orphans\u2019 court, and to all cases in equity except those technical and continuing trusts over which equity has exclusive jurisdiction: Yorks\u2019s App., 110 Pa. 69; Keyser\u2019s App., 124 Pa. 80; Hostetter v. Hollinger, 117 Pa. 606. But the statute, however, does not begin to run in favor of a participant in a breach of trust until the discovery of the fraud, that is, until the cestui knows, or under the circumstances ought to know, of the facts that give rise to his cause of action. It does not begin to run in favor of an express trustee who has repudiated his trust until knowledge of the repudiation has been brought home to the cestui que trust. And in actions based upon fraud, where the fraud has been actively concealed, or where a relationship of trust and confidence exists, it does not begin to run until the discovery of the fraud: Sankey v. McElevey, 104 Pa. 265; Smith v. Blachley, 198 Pa. 173.\nFor these reasons it follows that the defendant is equally liable at law or in equity for the trust funds wrongfully taken. The judgment of the court below is affirmed.",

J., Walling, Simpson, Kephart, Schaerer, Maxey and Drew, JJ.\nD. Arthur Magaziner, with him Clinton O. Mayer, for appellant.\nSince the fiduciary deposited to his personal credit a check drawn by him upon an account in his own name as fiduciary, the bank was not required to make inquiry, and is not liable unless it had actual knowledge of the wrong, or acted in bad faith: Fehr v. Campbell, 288 Pa. 549, 563.\nIt would seem that when the checks drawn against the Hall Estate account were presented for payment, even though they were drawn to the order of Nickles and by him endorsed for deposit, defendant bank had no alternative but to honor the checks. There was nothing about the checks to indicate whether they were drawn for commissions due payee as trustee, or for moneys advanced by him for investment in the name of the estate.\nSince the fiduciary carried two personal bank accounts, showing a substantial balance when taken as one, he was not indebted to the bank; and his deposit in his overdrawn account of a check drawn against a fiduciary account did not make the bank liable.\nNegligence is not bad faith; knowledge and good faith are questions of fact for the jury: First Nat. Bank v. Trust Co., 297 Pa. 115; Buehler v. Fashion Plate Co., 269 Pa. 429; Snellenburg Clothing Co. v. Levitt, 282 Pa. 65.\nThe statute of limitations applies: Wiekersham v. Lee, 83 Pa. 422; Etter v.

Middleton, 300 Pa. 522.\nJanuary 5, 1932:\nAppellant cannot argue that the general rule is not applicable because there was a balance in the Nickles\u2019s special account on September 25, 1926, in excess of the overdraft.\nIn this case there is no question whether or not the bank was negligent in receiving the check, nor does it make any difference whether the bank knew or did not know that Nickles was engaged in a breach of trust: Norristown-Penn Trust Co. v. Middleton, 300 Pa. 522; Schmitt v. Title & Trust Co., 61 Pa. Superior Ct. 301.\nAppellant cannot argue that there was nothing about the check to indicate whether it was drawn for commissions to Nickles as trustee, or for moneys advanced by him for investment in the name of the estate: Schmitt v. Potter T. & T. Co., 61 Pa. Superior Ct. 301.\nThe check itself, drawn upon the trust account to the order of Nickles personally and endorsed by him to the bank, was seen by them; they, therefore, knew that the trustee was depositing trust funds to his personal account; they knew, because Nickles\u2019s personal account was overdrawn, that,trust funds were being used to pay his personal debt to the bank: Bedford Nat.
