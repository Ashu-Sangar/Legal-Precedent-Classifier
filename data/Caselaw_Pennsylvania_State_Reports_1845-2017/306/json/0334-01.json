Ballard, with him James Gay Gordon and Joseph Carson, for Emilie Bailey Collet, petitioner, appellant.\nThe facts which bring this case within the provisions of the act, have been found by the master and the finding of fact by a master have the effect of a verdict by a jury, and cannot be set aside except for clear error: Dale\u2019s Est., 8 Pa. Dist. R. 683; Whelen v. Harrison, 16 Phila. 143; Winton v. Mott, 2 Luzerne Law Times 57; Spohn v. Stein, 1 Schuylkill Leg. Rec. 229; Walton v. Whann, 8 Legal Gazette 82; Weller v. Wood, 6 Kulp 526; Kyte v. Kyte, 8 Kulp 1.\nAs any man may be mistaken in his estimate of the integrity and business capacity of another, when the latter becomes the former\u2019s trustee and his unfitness for the position appears to the court, there should be no hesitancy about his removal. If his management of the trust justly subjects him to criticism and to a lack of confidence by the cestui que trust, he should not be continued in control of the estate. The relation of trustee and cestui que trust is one of confidence, and when either abuses that confidence, he must assume the responsibility. Pleasant personal relations between parties interested in the trust is desirable and it is a duty incumbent upon each to aid in securing that object: Price\u2019s Est., 209 Pa. 210, 212; Martin\u2019s Est., 4 Pa. Dist. R. 219; Marsden\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 213; Kelly\u2019s Est., 28 Pa. Dist. R. 87; Bryson v. Wood, 187 Pa. 366; Neafie\u2019s Est., 199 Pa. 307; Hill v. Whiteside, 237 Pa. 340; Tiffany\u2019s Est., 5 Pa. D. & C. 727; Gilbert v. Johnson, 49 Pa. Superior Ct. 191.\nThe judgment of the court below is not a valid judgment: Hanover Twp. S. Dist., 290 Pa. 95; Ebling v. Boro., 244 Pa. 505; Gail v. Phila., 273 Pa. 275; Murray\u2019s Petition, 262 Pa. 188; Madlem\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 584; Summers v. Kramer, 271 Pa. 189; Stone v. B. & L. Assn., 293 Pa. 161; Carney v. Oil Co., 289 Pa. 588; Waugman v. Henry, 75 Pa. Superior Ct. 94; In re Surcharge of County Commissioners, 12 Pa. D. & C. 471; Sterrett v. MacLean, 293 Pa. 557.\nEven if the decree entered in the cause were a proper decree as to the merits of the cause, the costs should not have been put on the petitioner.\nFrancis Shunh Brown, with him Welsh & Brown for appellees, David E. Hilsee, William K. Haupt and Harvey Gourley, trustees. \u2014 The testator\u2019s choice of trustees should not be set aside by reason of the positions they hold with the Bailey, Banks & Biddle Co.: Rafferty\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 430.\nThe trustees in the case at bar are testamentary. A distinction is made between testamentary trustees and those appointed by decree on suggestion of proper parties : Bryson v. Wood, 187 Pa. 366, 369.\nThe fundamental right of property in a testator to name trustees for the care and preservation of his estate, who shall not be removed except for clear error, is a principal supported by the decisions of the Supreme Court: Stevenson\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 101; Neafie\u2019s Est., 199 Pa. 307; Brice\u2019s Est., 209 Pa. 210.\nFebruary 3, 1932:\nIn the last analysis in all cases, the court has in its discretion the question of the removal of trustees. The orphans\u2019 court has entered a decree dismissing the petition of appellant. It was not convinced that substantial ground for removal of the trustees exists: Marsden\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 213; Martin\u2019s Est., 4 Pa. Dist. R. 219; Kelly\u2019s Est., 28 Pa. Dist. R. 87; Hill v. Whiteside, 237 Pa. 340; Gilbert v. Johnson, 49 Pa. Superior Ct. 191.\nThe decree signed by Judge Gest is the decision of the orphans\u2019 court and was legally and regularly made: Madlem\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 485.\nE. C. Shapley Highley, for appellee, Otto Robert Heiligman, guardian ad litem of Charles Bailey Schaufele et al.\nIt is submitted, the testator did not intend to have the Lawyer account balanced as of the date of his death by using principal of the estate, but intended that the business, if continued, should work out its own salvation. Since the trustees crossed this evident intention of the testator, it was their duty to repay to the principal of the estate the $29,000 from the income as it accrued in the Lawyer account.\nWhere an estate is solvent, a testator may exempt the principal from liability for debts: Gilliford\u2019s Est., 281 Pa. 582.\nThe costs should have been borne by the petitioner: Tarr\u2019s Est., 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 554."
