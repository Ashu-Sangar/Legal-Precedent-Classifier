        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nThe Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company, one of the defendants, appeals from a judgment rightfully entered against it for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The essential facts are as follows:\nAn owner of realty, being desirous of erecting an apartment house thereon, but without sufficient means to enable him to do so, entered into a written agreement with a builder to do the work, reciting therein that plaintiff \u201cis about to make certain insurances of completion and against liens, and as a condition for so doing has required the execution of this present contract.\u201d The agreement refers also to the $20,000 mortgage, plaintiff\u2019s guarantee of which resulted in this suit, and specifically declares that the builder is to give \u201ca surety bond [executed by appellant eo nomine, \u2014 it being a corporation engaged in the business of issuing indemnity bonds for an agreed premium], guaranteeing completion ......in such form and manner as will be satisfactory to [plaintiff, which bond] shall be drawn directly to [plaintiff] as obligee.\u201d\nFor some unknown reason, the bond was originally drawn in favor of the owner and not of plaintiff; but it recites that plaintiff has \u201cagreed to insure the title to various......mortgagees......against loss or damages by reason of the failure of the [builder] to complete the erection of the said apartment according to certain plans and specifications\u201d on file with plaintiff, and states as its condition that if the builder \u201cshall and do well and truly and in all respects comply with the terms and conditions and covenants set forth in the above recited contract, then this obligation to be void; otherwise to remain in full force and effect.\u201d On the same day, the owner assigned the bond to plaintiff, and, in their written consent to the assignment, appellant and the builder \u201cexpressly agree that no defense which exists or which may hereafter exist between the parties to the contract in the said bond referred to, or any other person or persons, corporation or corporations, shall be urged, admitted or allowed in defense of any claim which may be made by [plaintiff] its successors and assigns upon said bond.\u201d\nAmong the insurance policies issued by plaintiff, on the faith of appellant\u2019s bond and the assignment thereof, was the $20,000 one already referred to, which was delivered to a mortgagee who advanced that sum for the purpose of enabling the apartment house to be built. This policy insured the mortgagee that the building would be constructed in accordance with the terms of the contract therefor. In point of fact, it never was built, the project being abandoned because the contemplated structure was forbidden by an applicable zoning ordinance, which was in existence before the owner decided to improve his property. Subsequently the realty was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale on an encumbrance prior in lien to the $20,000 mortgage, and the mortgagee received nothing. She thereupon sued plaintiff on the policy given by it to her; it notified appellant of the suit, and, by agreement between them, they cooperated in the defense thereto. The mortgagee obtained a verdict and judgment. At appellant\u2019s request no appeal was taken, and plaintiff paid the mortgagee the amount of her recovery. To recoup itself, plaintiff, in this action, sued appellant on its guarantee above quoted, and obtained the judgment from which the present appeal is taken.\nThe only objection we need consider is one which avers that, as the builder was prevented by an act of the law from erecting the apartment house, he was in no default for his failure so to do, and hence appellant could not be, since it only guaranteed that he would erect the building. We need not consider whether this would ordinarily be so, since appellant expressly agreed \u201cthat no defense which exists or which may hereafter exist between the parties to the contract in the said bond referred to......shall be urged, admitted or allowed in defense of any claim which may be made by [plaintiff] its successors and assigns upon the said bond.\u201d Upon the faith of this, plaintiff insured the mortgagee that the building would be constructed, thereby protecting her by a lien on an improved property, instead of upon an unimproved one, as resulted from the failure to build. Hence, the defense here attempted, being one alleged to exist \u201cbetween the parties to the contract,\u201d viz., the owner and the builder, could not be \u201curged, admitted or allowed\u201d in this suit on appellant\u2019s guarantee, especially as it was given in consideration of the payment of the premium agreed upon. For this reason, its liability was \u201cthat of an insurer......and [the guarantee] should be construed most strictly in favor of\u201d plaintiff: Young v. American Bonding Co., 228 Pa. 373, 380; South Phila. State Bank v. National Surety Co., 288 Pa. 300, 305. It follows that, since there is no dispute as to the propriety of the amount paid, appellant cannot successfully defend against plaintiff\u2019s claim to recover that amount.\nThe conclusion thus reached dispenses with the necessity of determining what effect should be given to the fact that the policy accompanying the $20,000 mortgage, upon which plaintiff was held liable on the trial defended by both plaintiff and appellant, expressly declares that the title thereby insured is \u201csubject to zoning ordinances,\u201d against the effect of which plaintiff does \u201cnot agree to insure.\u201d At that earlier trial, appellant either failed to present this as a defense, or it was held ineffective though presented, and in either event appellant can hardly be permitted to urge it now.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed.",

Ry., 247 Pa. 242.\nEarl C.

Accident & Indemnity Co., 269 Pa. 456.\nFebruary 3, 1932:\nThere is nothing to be found in the law which would preclude the enforcement of the bond against appellant, even though the contract between Pearce and the Lloyd Company could not have been enforced: Walton, Exr., v. Surety Co., 264 Pa. 272; Lincoln T. Co. v. Bldg. Corp., 229 N. Y. 313; Nierenberg v. Maxwell Co., 76 Pa.

Superior Ct. 389.\nWe do not agree that title companies are in the business of making searches for zoning ordinances. We submit that the zoning ordinance in this case did not constitute an exception, objection or encumbrance: Ritter v. Hill, 282 Pa. 115."
