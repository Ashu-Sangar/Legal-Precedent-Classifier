    <p id="b672-9" data-blocks='[["BL_672.14",672,[257,1317,1149,695]]]'>On the appeal of certain taxpayers of Hazle Township from the audit of the supervisors’ accounts for the year 1957, the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County entered judgment against the supervisors, in January, 1961. In February, the supervisors petitioned the court to open the judgment and permit them to enter into a defense to the merits, and, further, to stay all further proceedings. Following an argument on the court’s power to grant the rule which was held in March before the court en banc, an opinion was handed down denying the petition. The supervisors then filed exceptions which, after argument before the court were dismissed in July. This appeal followed.</p>

The prototype of the above provisions is found in the Act of 1901, May 11, P. L. 185, §1, 12 PS §1106 wherein is established the right and. procedure of appeal from auditor reports which has been incorporated into all county, borough and township laws. It is, therefore, well engrained in the law of this Com-' monwealth that the time for appealing from a judgment entered in a court of common pleas from the report of the auditors is identical with the time limitation applicable in appealing other cases from a court of common pleas — three calendar months — Act of 1927, May 11, P.
