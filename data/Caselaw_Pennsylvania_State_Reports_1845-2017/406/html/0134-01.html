The engineering, accounting and legal staffs of utilities are specially trained in <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>utility representation and thus, in many cases, have a decided advantage in contract negotiations with their counterparts in municipal government. For this reason, the legislature may have required the commission, which also possesses expertise in all phases of utility matters, to approve such contracts, thus safeguarding the municipality by providing a method for preventing overreaching on the part of the utility.</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[145,788,1152,1022]]]'>We see no reason why failure to conform with the statutory requirements of approval by the commission should be excepted from the general rule that no contractual liability is incurred by the municipality unless statutory requirements are complied with. The legislature in the Act of 1913 required the commission to approve such contracts between municipalities and utilities. Such approval was not obtained, hence no recovery may be had by the utility for work done while the contract was unapproved. Proper though this contract might be, and as favorable as its terms are to the County, the County is without authority to pay in this instance. Subsequent approval of the contract by the commission in 1959 did not validate the contract so as to legalize the payment. The approval by the commission of the contract specifically was not made nunc pro tunc; hence, it is not necessary to decide whether the contract would have been revitalized by a nunc pro tunc approval.</p>
