To effect a change of domicile there must be a concurrence of the following factors: (1) physical presence in the place where domicile is alleged to have been acquired, and (2) an intention to make it his home without any fixed or certain purpose to return to his former place of abode: Dorrance’s Estate, <a href="/pa/309/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="309 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="1141686" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0151-01">309 Pa. 151</a>, 163, A. 303”. While ordinarily the fact of physical presence in a particular place is prima facie evidence of domicile yet where such physical presence is occasioned by necessity, i.e., in a military camp, a hospital, a nursing home, etc., the rule is otherwise. The burden of proving a change of domicile rests upon the party asserting it <em>(Dorrance’s Estate, </em>supra), particularly under circumstances such as presented in the case at bar. The record fully justified the finding by the court below that Coulter, actually physically present in the Delaware rest home, had not abandoned his former domicile in Pennsylvania and changed his domicile to Delaware. There is nothing on this record to indicate that his physical presence in Delaware is one of choice but rather of the necessity created by his physical condition and advanced years.</p>

As far back as 1955 when Coulter executed the power of attorney he recognized his own inability to manage his own affairs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> As recently as April 19, 1961 in Coulter’s petition to the Delaware Court he averred that “because of advanced age [he] is unable to manage and care for his property” and requested the appointment of a guardian.

Under the situation in the case at bar, we see no merit in this complaint.

Upon completion of the direct examination, Mrs. Gray was then cross-examined by Coulter’s counsel.

Then Coulter’s counsel proceeded to cross-examine, not directly examine, Mrs. Gray and, upon objection, the court below ruled that Coulter’s counsel could not cross-examine Mrs. Gray since she then was his witness.

Petitioners’ counsel at the hearing, in answer to an inquiry of the court as to why Coulter was not present at the hearing, stated that, when he served him with the petition, Coulter stated that he would come to the hearing but that, when he asked him the day before the hearing, Coulter said he would not come. In the first place, appellant complains that this statement of counsel was unsworn testimony which the court should not have considered. Coulter, apparently, is unmindful of the fact that this was a statement called forth by the court and made to the court by an officer <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>of the court. Under such circumstances, the court had every reason to rely on the statement made, especially in view of the statement at that time to the court by Coulter’s counsel: “I am unable to say why he won’t be here, except the statement he doesn’t want to come”. Coulter’s complaint in this respect is entirely without merit. In the second place, Coulter urges that the court erred in permitting the hearing to be held in the absence of the alleged incompetent. The court below properly disposed of this contention in the following manner: “Mr. Coulter did not attend the hearing in person. Section 301(a) of the Incompetents’ Estates Act provides, inter alia, as follows: 'The alleged incompetent shall be present at the hearing unless (1) the court is satisfied, upon the presentation of positive testimony, that because of his physical or mental condition his welfare would not be promoted by his presence; or (2) it is impossible for him to be present because of his absence from the Commonwealth.’</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[147,1394,1151,645]]]'>“The respondent argues that although the evidence shows that Mr. Coulter was absent from the Commonwealth, it does not show that it was impossible for him to be present for that reason. The respondent argues that rather than impossibility as the reason for the absence of Mr. Coulter, the evidence affirmatively showed that he could have been present, but did not choose to come. The record shows that Mr. Coulter was served with a citation to appear for the hearing and that he stated at the time of service that he would be present in this court for the hearing. He did not appear in person but was represented by counsel.</p>

Section 301(a) (2) is directly applicable to the circumstances of this case. All available legal process has been utilized in seeking to have Mr. Coulter attend the hearing. However, the refusal of Mr. Coulter to cooperate by attending the hearing voluntarily has made it ‘impossible for him to be present because of his absence from the Commonwealth.’ It is legally impossible for this court to compel the attendance of Mr. Coulter so long as he remains outside the Commonwealth. Therefore, the court does have jurisdiction.”</p>

There is not a scintilla of evidence upon this record that the Bank is not fully and completely qualified to act as guardian; on the contrary, the record indicates that the Bank has had custody of Coulter’s securities, without objection, for almost five years. The only objection seems to stem from the fact that Attorney Grubb is one of the Bank’s counsel. That objection standing alone does not disqualify the Bank. The selection of a guardian for an incompetent lies within the sound discretion of the court to which the application for such appointment has been made and an appellate court will not reverse unless it is shown that the appointing court abused its discretion: <em>Arthur’s Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/136/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="136 Pa.

In a sense this case is unique. Both parties agree on the need for appointment of a guardian. Where the disagreement arises is whether the guardian is to be appointed under the laws of Pennsylvania or Delaware. Actually, the practical difference between the parties appears to be which counsel is going to act as counsel for the guardian.</p>
