In 1942, it was incorporated as a private business corporation. Mrs. Hare was its sole shareholder and president. In 1949, the school was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation. Mrs. Hare then transferred the assets of the business corporation to the nonprofit corporation in consideration for the promise that she would be paid the sum of $15,000 annually for life (she died in 1956), and also provided with a house fully furnished and maintained, plus food, and all conveniences necessary for a reasonably good standard of existence. The new corporation also assumed the obligation of payment of current liabilities of the business in the amount of $64,401.77, and a debt due Mrs. Hare in the amount of $168,509.66.</p>

II, §202 of the Act of May 21, 1943, P. L. 571, 72 PS §5453.202. It is a mixed question of law and fact.</p>

In fact, the net effect of the transaction, involving the transfer of the assets of the business corporation owned by Mrs. Hare to the new nonprofit corporation, was an outright gift in the sum of approximately $500,000. As of that time, the corporation had a net worth of $458,396.45 and its accumulated surplus amounted to $358,396.45.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The average tuition presently charged is $4,581.87 per individual. It is charged to all, regardless of the ability to pay. It is fixed to carry the operating costs for the entire institution, both school and center. Additional charges are made for psychological and physical therapy, special medicines, music lessons, etc. No student attends free of all charges. Partial scholarships in the form of deductions from the gross tuition are given. In the usual year, such scholarship deductions allowed by the school itself amount to 1.0% of the total tuition received and are distributed among 2% of those enrolled. Donations in relatively small amounts are allocated for scholarship purposes, but with these added to the allowances given by the school, the total amount given in partial scholarships is less than 2% of the total tuition income.</p>

    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[258,1005,1148,1131]]]'>Under the facts, we conclude that the <em>Ogontz School Tax Exemption Case, </em><a href="/pa/361/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="361 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="476402" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0284-01">361 Pa. 284</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20150" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="65 A.2d 150">65 A. 2d 150</a> (1949), is controlling. While it is true that this Court properly found therein that the institution concerned was not founded in charity and in reference to these facts, the case is distinguishable, it also clearly enunciated the principle that even an institution of learning must possess an eleemosynary characteristic if it is to be deemed benevolent and charitable for tax exemption purposes. As stated at page 292, “An institution whose free patrons number only about 10% of all its patrons cannot be classed as an institution of purely public charity.” Again, at page 295, the Court said, “With exceptions so negligible as not to be a controlling factor in our decision, what this School does for its students is not done free of charge or so nearly free of charge as to make those charges merely nominal. Certainly the students who pay $1,900 a year for the education and board and lodging they receive at this School cannot (and assuredly do not) regard themselves as objects of charity.”</p>

      <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>In short, <em>Ogontz </em>emphasized that a school to qualify as a “purely public charity” must donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its educational services. This same thinking was re-emphasized later in <em>Hill School Tax Exemption Case, </em><a href="/pa/370/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="370 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1234533" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0021-01">370 Pa. 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="87 A.2d 259">87 A. 2d 259</a> (1952).</p>

In fact, a portion of the charges exacted from the enrollees of the school are used for the operation and improvement of the center which is separate and apart. The fact that the school was chartered as a nonprofit corporation and no one receives profit from its operation does not in itself clothe the school with exemption from taxation, <em>Ogontz, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.6",617,[159,1183,1149,316]]]'>We further agree with the learned courts below that the <em>Hill </em>case does not overrule or modify <em>Ogontz. </em>In <em>Hill, </em>the school operated at a loss for 26 out of the 29 years of its existence. Forty-nine per cent of its students received tuition aid. The total operating revenues covered only 82% of the cost of operation.</p>

The tuition charged in that academy was much less than the tuition charged by comparable institutions. Eight per cent of the students paid one-half of the regular tuition and 9% paid no tuition at all. In other words, the institution utilized the excess income realized over operating costs in making its services available to as great a number of students as possible and particularly to a large number unable to pay their own way.</p>
