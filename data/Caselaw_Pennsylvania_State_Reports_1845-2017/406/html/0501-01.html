    <p id="b532-6" data-blocks='[["BL_532.10",532,[248,701,1149,691]]]'>In July, 1944, Louise Balkiewicz, the plaintiff in this case, and Adam Balkiewicz, both having been married previously, their respective spouses being deceased, married one another and maintained the marital status until December 18, 1960, when Adam died. Each spouse had brought to the marriage a brood of children and, as occasionally happens in such a relationship, the union of the individual parents did not bring about a harmonious amalgamation of the two sets of offsprings. Thus, on January 20, 1956, Adam, without the joinder of his wife, conveyed to his eight children of the former wife all the property that he had acquired prior to his marriage with Louise.</p>
    <p id="b532-7" data-blocks='[["BL_532.11",532,[246,1413,1148,260]]]'>Upon Adam’s death, Louise filed an action in ejectment in the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County against Adam’s children (there are eight) to recover possession of an undivided one-third interest in the property he had conveyed to them.</p>

The Intestate Act of 1947, P. L. 80, §5 (20 P.S. §1.5), provides: “The shares of the estate to which the widow is entitled shall be in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower at common law, so far as relates to real estate of which the husband dies seised; <em>and her share in real estate aliened by the husband in his </em>lifetime, <em>without her joining in the con</em>

      <em>veyance, shall be the same as her share in real estate pf which the husband dies </em>seised.” (Emphasis supplied) In this case, the widow’s interest is one-third because the deceased left more than one child to survive him: Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 80, §2, 20 P.S. §1.2(1).</p>
    <p id="b533-3" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[143,669,1149,696]]]'>The only question therefore, to be decided here is whether the plaintiff can obtain possession of her interest by an act of ejectment. As early as 1820, this Court stated in <em>Pringle v. </em>Gaw, 5 S. &amp; R. 536, that: “By the common law, it is well established, that if the widow’s claim be in the nature of dower, an ejectment will not lie before assignment. She is not seised of an undivided third part with the heirs. Hutton, 18 Hob. 181. Ejectment is a possessory action; and it is certain she cannot hold the possession against the heir. She is not seised until assignment, of an undivided third part. The widow and heir, or heirs, are neither tenants in common, joint-tenants, nor co-parceners.”</p>
    <p id="b533-4" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[142,1376,1151,695]]]'>And then, as recently as 1951, in <em>Smigell v.

A widow, however, has no right to the <em>exclusive </em>possession of her deceased intestate spouse’s lands and hence cannot support ejectment for her <em>interest </em>therein: Bratton v.

The plaintiff concedes that the rule at common law, as stated in <em>Pringle v, Gaw, </em>supra, declared that a widow is not a tenant in common with the grantees of property conveyed by her husband without her joinder. The plaintiff argues, however, that this common law rule was changed when the legislature, in the enactment of the 1917 and 1947 Intestate Acts, codified the widow’s interest in her husband’s property of which he died seised and provided that such interest was to be in lieu and in full satisfaction of her common law dower and provided also that her interest in real estate aliened by him during his lifetime without her joinder would be the same as her interest in the real estate of which he died seised.</p>
    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[264,1164,1144,468]]]'>The plaintiff seeks to support this argument by quoting from <em>Hanley v. Stewart, </em><a href="/pa-super/155/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="155 Pa. Super. 535" data-case-ids="1057014" data-case-paths="/pa-super/155/0535-01">155 Pa. Superior Ct. 535</a>, as follows: “Since the Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 429, the interest of a widow in the real estate of which her husband died the owner in fee, intestate, is not dower or a life estate. It is an absolute estate, of the same nature as that passing to his child or children, and is not conditioned on his being in actual possession of the real estate at the time of his death.”</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[258,1653,1148,694]],["BL_535.1",535,[151,353,1148,98]]]'>However, there is nothing in this quotation to oppose what we said in <em>Smigell v.

Groh, </em><a href="/pa/306/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="306 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1136917" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0566-01">306 Pa. 566</a>, as hereinafter quoted. The Superior Court’s statement refers only to the widow’s interest in land of which the decedent “died the owner in fee” and does not apply to the widow’s interest in property aliened by her husband during her lifetime. There are fundamental differences between these two situations: “A widow’s ‘dower’ rights may arise in two separate situations which are fundamentally different, both in law and in fact: (1) where the husband dies seized of the land; (2) where the husband has aliened the land during his lifetime, without his <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>wife joining in the conveyance.” <em>(Bridgeford v.

    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[148,463,1150,524]]]'>We pointed, out in the <em>Bridgeford </em>case that the word “estate” as used in section 3 of the 1917 Intestate Act (now incorporated in section 5 of the 1947 Intestate Act hereinbefore quoted) is “ <em>‘a </em>description having no application to property in which he (the decedent) divested himself of all estate prior to his death’: Borland v. Nichols, <a href="/pa/12/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="12 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="963799" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0038-01">12 Pa. 38</a>, 42 . . .” Hence, decisions dealing with a widow’s rights as to property of which her husband died seised do not necessarily govern here.</p>

L. 429, changed all the prior existing law on the matter before us and has made inapplicable all the earlier decisions. With this broad challenge we cannot agree. In Merrick v. DuPont, <a href="/pa/285/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="285 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1095099" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0368-01">285 Pa. 368</a>, we re-announced a principle operative throughout the whole course of our existence as a Commonwealth in which the foundations of jurisprudence are in the common law, that a statute should be so interpreted that it will accord, as nearly as may be, with the theretofore exist<a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>ing course of the common law. We were in that case applying the principle to the very act now before us. <em>It gives no evidence of any legislative intent to change the common law further than in the quantum of the interest given to the widow. </em>The applicable section of the act (section 3) reads: 'The shares of the estate directed by this act to be allotted to the widow shall be in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower at common law, so far as relates to land of which the husband died seized; and her share in lands aliened by the hnsband in his lifetime, without her joining in the conveyance, shall be the same as her share in lands of which the husband died seized.’ In the instant case this is a one-half interest in fee simple. All that section 3 provides is that her share shall be the same as her share in lands of which her husband died seized, and the purpose of the clause is to provide that, whereas before the act the widow would have been entitled only to a one-third life interest in land aliened by her hnsband in his lifetime, she is thenceforth to be entitled, where there is only one child, to a one-half interest in fee simple. As was said by the learned judge of the court below, there is nothing which indicates that the real estate aliened by her husband and in which her share is thus fixed shall be considered as of the same value, or as of the same physical condition, or subject to the same encumbrances as it might or would have been had the husband continued to own the property and been seized thereof at the time of his death. <em>It is not to be presumed that by this section of the act it was intended to sweep away all such limitations and qualifications of the widow’s claim under such circumstances, as limited her right under the common law. notwithstanding the many statutes which have been passed giving the widow a statutory right to a part of her husband’s real estate in lieu of common law </em>dower, <em>it has always been held that the new interest thus created is in itself </em>

This distinction is clearly set forth in 28 C.J.S., Dower, §110, pages 222-223 as follows: “The widow takes her estate from her husband and not from the heirs or from the person assigning, and her seizin is deemed a continuance of the seizin of her husband, relating back to the time of the marriage, if her husband was then seized, and if he was not then seized, it relates back to the time when he was seized, the seizin of the heir being defeated ab initio by the assignment of dower. . . .
