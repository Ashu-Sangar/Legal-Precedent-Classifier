On December 17, 1951, the claimant, in the course of her employment, slipped and fell, striking her right shoulder and knees upon the floor. Claimant suffered a subdeltoid bursitis with contusions of the right shoulder and knees but continued to work until February 9, 1952, at which time she left her employment. On February 29, 1952, the claimant and her employer entered into a written compensation agreement under which the claimant received $25 weekly from February 16, 1952 until March 18,1952 ($114.29) at which time she returned to work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The claimant continued to work at her regular employment from March 18, 1952 until September 9, 1952 when she left her employment to which she has not since returned.</p>

At this hearing, Hurley testified that a photostatic copy of the final receipt had been mailed to the Board on August 7, 1953, that the employer heard nothing further from the Bureau and that the claimant had returned to work in March 1952. On August 15, 1955 a third hearing was held before Referee Cartwright at which the only witness was the claimant. The claimant testified that, although she had been injured on December 17, 1951, she continued to work until February 9, 1952, she signed the compensation agreement, returned to work on March 18, 1952 and continued to work until September 9, 1952. <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>At the time of injury she was treated by Dr. Chaffee who continued to treat her until February 1954. Claimant admitted she signed the final receipt on March 28, 1952 and endorsed the accompanying check and described how she put the uncashed check and original receipt in a “bond box” in her home where they remained until produced at the hearing. Claimant’s testimony on the subject of her disability was as follows: “Q. Does the injury which you received still bother you to the extent that you receive treatment for it? A. Yes, I have always had to and it is dreadfully painful, right here in the shoulder where I hit. Q. Are you able to go back to work now? A. No. I am not. By the Referee: Q. Your arm still bothers you? A. Yes. Q. Can you do light work? A. Sometimes it is worse than others, it catches me quick. What I mean is it grabs me quick. Q. Can you do any work at all? A. I work around the house, but to keep at it I can’t. Q. Do you have a driver’s license? Can you drive a car? A. I could not swing the wheel.” Although treated by Dr. Chaffee and other doctors, the claimant presented no medical testimony as to her condition, past or present.</p>

In the second place, the Board took the position that compensation payments had been suspended while claimant was receiving wages until September 9, 1952, and, thereafter, while the claimant received payment of insurance benefits for twenty-six weeks and, therefore, the one year statute of limitations for the filing of a petition to review under Section 413 was inapplicable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> In the third place, even if the final receipt was valid, the Board found that such receipt would have to be set aside because of improper conduct on the part of employer.

In the first place, an <em>agreement </em>not being a <em>final receipt, </em>the construction of the words “agreements” or “supplemental agreements” to include final receipts does violence to such words linguistically as well as adds to Section 409 a subject which the legislature has not seen fit to add ;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> to include final receipts in Section 409 is not an act of judicial construction but of judicial legislation.

Provision <em>should </em>be made for filing final receipts with the department and the department <em>should </em>have the duty of approval or disapproval of such receipts but that is a matter for legislative, not judicial, action. As the law now stands by what standard or test can the validity of a final receipt be measured? There is none under the statute and neither the Board nor. this Court can supply such standard or test. Under Section 407 the legislature has provided that <em>all </em>receipts <em>executed </em>by an injured employee, regardless of age, or by any dependent over 16 years of age <em>shall he valid and binding </em>“unless modified or set aside as hereinafter provided”, i.e., under Section 434. The legislature did not say <em>“all </em>receipts <em>executed </em>and <em>duly filed </em>and <em>approved </em>by the department shall be valid and binding”: it simply said all receipts <em>executed </em>shall be valid and binding.

There is neither contention nor proof of any fraud or coercion or mistake of law or of fact. However, the Board has contended that this receipt was secured by some improper conduct on the part of the employer which would justify it being set aside. In its opinion, the Board stated that the record “clearly” ¡showed that claimant was forced to return to work by a defendant official, that claimant was given a final receipt to execute while still being treated for the injury by the defendant <em>“company </em>physician” (emphasis supplied) who treated her until February 1954, and that it was “of even more significance” that the employer misled Referee Smith who, in turn, advised claimant that her claim was barred. An examination of the record clearly reveals such statements by the Board were gratuitous and unsupported by any facts. There is absolutely no evidence that any official of the employer advised claimant to return to work, that Dr. Chaffee was connected in any manner with,the employer or that the employer in any manner misled the referee. When, therefore, the Board concluded that “[a]U these factors . . . render defendant’s conduct improper towards” the claimant, such a conclusion was completely unwarranted.</p>
