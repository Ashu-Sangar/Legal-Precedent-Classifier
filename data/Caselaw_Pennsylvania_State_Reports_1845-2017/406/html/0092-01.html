Roche, entered into an unusual written agreement to compromise and adjust certain differences existing between them. By the terms of the agreement, Roche was to be paid the sum of $5000 without interest, upon the date of Rankin’s death, or earlier during his lifetime if he- so preferred. Rankin further agreed to place in trust certain life insurance policies as security for the payment of the $5000, which policies were to be kept in force, unencumbered and with trust beneficiary unchanged. If the provisions of the agreement, in respect to the insurance policies, were not fulfilled, the $5000 would forthwith become due and payable. If Roche predeceased Rankin, all rights in favor of Roche would immediately terminate. In the event of any default by Rankin in the terms of the agreement, he therein authorized any attorney to appear for him and confess judgment against him “for the amount due” under the agreement.</p>

This sum included interest from January 1,1956. This, the prothonotary did, without any appearance entered on behalf of Rankin.</p>

If matters outside of the instrument itself necessarily had to be considered in order to determine the amount of the money due, then of course, the prothonotary would lack the legal power to enter the judgment under the Act of 1806. But this is not this case. A reading of the instrument clearly indicates that upon default, the fixed amount of $5000 immediately became due and payable. In such an event, nothing extrinsic to the writing was necessary to ascertain the amount of the indebtedness due. But it is argued, in order to ascertain that a default occurred, you must accept the evidence of the affidavit of default. This, of course, is correct, but is no different than the countless situations where a demand is required on a note before it is due. The demand is necessarily proven by an affidavit of default.

Moeschlin, Inc., </em>is akin to the present issue and is controlling on this point. Therein, judgment was entered by the prothonotary within the authority of the Act of 1806, on a bond accompanying an application for a Pennsylvania Alcohol Manufacturing Permit. The bond became forfeit, due and payable if the principal failed to comply with the terms of the permit, or the laws of the Commonwealth. In the event of the forfeiture of the bond, the obligors empowered an attorney “after default” to appear for them and confess judgment for the amount of the bond. With the application for judgment an affidavit was filed setting forth the facts upon which the forfeiture was predicated. This Court ruled the judgment to be valid and overruled the action of the lower court in striking it off. The Court further stated that the fact that the judgment was not entered by. the appearance and confession of judgment by an attorney for and in behalf <em>of the defendant </em>did not affect its validity. To the same, end see: <em>Kolf v. Lieberman, </em>supra.; <em>Marshall v. Jackson, </em>supra.</p>

It provided, inter alia, that in the event of default by Rankin that the sum payable thereunder would immediately become due and further authorized, in such event, the entry of judgment by confession for the sum due. On December 7, 1955, Rankin first reneged on his obligations under the agreement by encumbering the insurance policies with a loan. Again, on February 1, 1956, he defaulted in payment of a premium due on one policy, resulting in the lapse thereof.
