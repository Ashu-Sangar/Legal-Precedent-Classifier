On March 4, 1961; Walter P. Wells, [appellee],<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> as executor under the alleged will, offered for probate to the Begister of Wills of Potter County a four page instrument bearing date “this <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> day of October, 1958”, the backer of which instrument bore the names “Hornburg, Andrews &amp; Diggs”, and had thereon the date August 13, 1953. The signature indicated the will had been signed during decedent’s last illness. Under this will, inter alia, decedent’s two nephews are each given a pecuniary legacy of $10,000 and a trust of the entire residuary estate created whereunder the widow receives a life interest and, upon the widow’s death, the entire residuary estate is to be devoted to the erection and endowment of a memorial hospital.

Six weeks later, having been ruled to do so by appellee, appellant filed a complaint in equity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> To this complaint appellee filed preliminary objections raising the following questions: (1) that there is no possible action at law or equity which forms the basis for a complaint in the form filed so that the complaint does not conform to any law or rule of court; (2) that the complaint is so permeated with surplusage and scandalous and impertinent matter that such surplus-age and matter cannot be separated from the matter which is pertinent and relevant; (3) in the absence of an allegation of any cause of action in support of which discovery is sought, discovery will not lie; (4) in the absence of an allegation of any infringement of rights by appellee, discovery — a collateral right to assist in the determination of other rights, — will not lie. The court below entered a decree dismissing the complaint and from that decree this appeal has been taken. The rationale of the opinion of the court below is that appellant is trying to use discovery in the Common Pleas Court to garner information for a will contest and that appellant has “ample remedies in the Orphans’ Court should its jurisdiction be properly invoked”.</p>

By reason of that which took place at these interviews, together with appellee’s letter of May 22, 1961, appellant charges that appellee, who drew the will, withheld deliberately the fact that appellee had drawn the will and the fact that, during decedent’s last illness, appellee had drawn a power of attorney from decedent to decedent's wife, and that appellee had refused to permit an inspection of not only the power of attorney but also several of decedent’s insurance policies.
