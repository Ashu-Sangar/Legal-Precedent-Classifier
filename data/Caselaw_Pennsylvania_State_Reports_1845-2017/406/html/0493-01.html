    <p id="b524-8" data-blocks='[["BL_524.12",524,[266,1015,1150,966]]]'>The Avondale Cut Rate, Inc., plaintiff in this case, owns the Avondale Farmers’ Market in Londongrove Township, Chester County. Like every other business establishment possessing material wares subject to destruction by fire, it made arrangements to buy fire insurance to cover its property and, in doing so, dealt with the’ Associated Excess Underwriters, with offices in Philadelphia, which engages in placing fire insurance. After preliminary conversations, the Avondale Cut Rate, Inc. (hereinafter to be called Avondale), paid to Associated Excess Underwriters, Inc. (hereinafter to be called Associated), the sum of $390 as premium on a certain fire insurance policy. On November 25, 1959 it received from Associated its Cover Note which showed that Associated had effected insurance on the Avondale Farmers’ Market through the Indemnity Insurance Co., Ltd., for one year from November 6, 1959 in the maximum amount of $6500.</p>
    <p id="b524-9" data-blocks='[["BL_524.13",524,[264,1992,1147,371]],["BL_525.1",525,[180,386,1147,155]]]'>On April 26, 1960, the Avondale Farmers’ Market was consumed by flames, with losses amounting to $10,-755.65. Avondale immediately notified Associated and the Indemnity Insurance Company and filed the required proof of loss with both companies. Neither company made any offer of payment and, after waiting eight months for the offer which never arrived, Avon-<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>dale brought suit in assumpsit against both Associated and the Indemnity Insurance Company for the face value of the policy, $6500.</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[175,553,1152,1079]]]'>The Indemnity Insurance Company filed neither appearance nor answer, but Associated filed an answer in which it admitted issuing the Cover Note above indicated but, in spite of this, denied that it was an agent of Indemnity. On the contrary, it averred that in accordance with the customs of the trade it had requested the Eealdo Insurance Brokers, an insurance brokerage company with offices in Quebec, Canada, to obtain and provide coverage for Associated in accordance with its needs. Associated said further that Eealdo issued its Cover Note showing that it had obtained insurance coverage for Avondale through the International American Insurance Company, Ltd. A copy of the Eealdo Cover Note was attached to the answer and it showed that it was dated May 9, 1960, or thirteen days <em>after </em>the fire had occurred! Parenthetically it may be said that the Court will take judicial notice of the fact that no insurance company would knowingly issue a policy to cover losses on goods which were already in ashes before application for insurance was made.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[173,1645,1150,313]]]'>Avondale filed preliminary objections which were in the nature of a motion to strike, a demurrer,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and a motion for a more specific pleading. The objections in the nature of a motion to strike and for a more specific pleading were sustained, but the Court made no disposition as to the objection in the nature of a demurrer.</p>
    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.7",525,[172,1971,1148,89]],["BL_526.1",526,[258,374,1149,698]]]'>Associated now filed an amended answer averring facts in direct contradiction to most of what was said <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>in the original answer. It still admitted authenticity of its Cover Note showing that Indemnity had issued a policy of fire insurance on Avondale’s property but denied that by giving the Cover Note it insured the plaintiff against loss by fire. It also denied that it acted as the agent for Indemnity. Yet, in spite of these categorical denials it categorically declared: “Defendant further avers that acting in good faith and at the instance and request of plaintiff, the insurance as requested was placed and effected with the Indemnity Insurance Company, Ltd.; that at the time defendant issued its said Cover Note, insurance with Indemnity Insurance Company, Ltd. was in fact in effect.”</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[256,1084,1147,522]]]'>. Of course, this declaration was in absolute contradiction of the statement made in the original answer, namely, that it had requested insurance through Realdo Insurance Brokers which had issued defendant a Cover Note executed on May 9, 1960, showing insurance secured with the International American Insurance Company, Ltd. The defendant made no attempt to explain these glaringly patent and irreconcilable inconsistencies between the averments in the original answer and those in the amended answer.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[256,1624,1146,533]]]'>The plaintiff now moved for judgment on the pleadings. If law is the handmaiden of truth, it is difficult to see why the plaintiff should not prevail. In the original answer the defendant clearly showed that it had breached the duty it owed to the plaintiff to obtain the insurance specifically designated in its Cover Note. Instead of purchasing insurance with Indemnity, as it engaged to do, it flatly asserted that it had taken out the insurance with another company through Canadian brokers and <em>after </em>the fire losses had occurred.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.7",526,[254,2167,1147,206]],["BL_527.1",527,[159,357,1150,525]]]'>Because of the statements and exhibits contained in the complaint' and original answer, the defendant became liable for the losses sustained by Avondale as a result of Associated’s failure to perform the duty it <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>undertook to perforin for Avondale and as it represented to the plaintiff, it had performed. In <em>Luther v. Coal Operators Cas. Go., </em><a href="/pa/379/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="379 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1253638" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0113-01">379 Pa. 113</a>, we said: “. . . where an insurance agent or broker promises, or gives some affirmative assurance, that he will procure - or renew a policy of insurance under such circumstances as to lull the ‘insured’ into the belief that such insurance has been effected, the law will impose upon the broker or agent the obligation to perform the duty which he has thus assumed.”</p>
    <p id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[155,902,1153,634]]]'>In the <em>Luther </em>case the rule thus announced did not apply because it was proved that the defendant had not assumed any duty to act for the plaintiff and had made no representations of any action taken upon which the plaintiff could reasonably rely. But in the case at bar there is no question that the defendant did, as shown in its Cover Note to plaintiff, admit that it had obtained the insurance which the plaintiff had requested and which was specifically described in the Cover Note. Nowhere has the defendant denied the plaintiff’s allegation of the payment of the indicated premium for the insurance contracted for.</p>
    <p id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[152,1556,1152,803]],["BL_528.1",528,[261,359,1147,426]]]'>The liability of the defendant under the admissions and statements in the original answer is strikingly clear. The only issue before us is whether this liability became altered because of the amended answer in which the defendant no longer stated that the insurance was placed with another insurance company after the fire but that, as it had engaged to do, it did in effect place and effect with Indemnity the insurance requested by the plaintiff and that when the defendant issued its Cover Note to the plaintiff, the insurance with Indemnity was in fact, in effect. What the defendant attempted to say, by its amended answer, was that it actually performed the duties undertaken by it. The actions of the defendant in this respect would indicate that it is making ducks and drakes of the law because <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>it has utterly failed to give any explanation whatever for the inconsistent averments and exhibits in its original answer which unquestionably manifest a breach of the duty it owed the plaintiff. Not only did it fail to offer any explanation in the court below for its self-contradictory answer but it has not seen fit to offer any explanation in this Court, it having filed no brief and having made no appearance.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[252,798,1154,692]]]'>The Court below refused the plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, stating that once an amended pleading is filed, the plaintiff may not resort to averments in the original answer, relying, in this respect on the cases of <em>Skelton v. Lower Merion Township, </em><a href="/pa/318/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="318 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1159612" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0356-01">318 Pa. 356</a> and <em>Atherton v.

We are not satisfied that what was stated in those cases was intended to controvert the established rule that an amended answer which is irreconcilable and inconsistent with admissions in the original answer, without explanation for the inconsistencies, is insufficient to prevent the granting of judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
