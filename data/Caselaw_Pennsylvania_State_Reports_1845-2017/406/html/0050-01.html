This friend’s father informed appellant that, if he transferred the premises over to appellee placing title in her name, then, in the event that appellant missed a finance payment on the car, his creditors could not proceed against the real estate. Thereafter, on July 31, 1950, the parties executed a conveyance óf the premises to appellee alone. The parties stipulated, and the chancellor so found, that the purpose of this conveyance .was to .protect the real estate from any execution which might, result upon a default upon the financing of the purchase of the automobile, and that the conveyance was ma.de without consideration. The subsequent purchase and financing never materialized because the appellee refused “to sign for [the automobile]”. .</p>

It is also manifest that this conveyance was prompted by faulty advice in that, since appellee was evidently to join in the purchase, the premises would have been subject to execution for any default. We think it clear beyond doubt that this conveyance was not executed with any intent to divest appellant of his beneficial interest in the premises but only to place legal title in appellant’s name as a protective device securing both their interest. This may also be inferred from the fact that appellant contributed to the upkeep or maintenance of the premises from the time of the conveyance until his hospitalization in 1955. It is also noted that appellee has never asserted any absolute ownership in the premises! Indeed, she testified that she would have reconveyed the premises had appellant asked her shortly after the conveyance.
