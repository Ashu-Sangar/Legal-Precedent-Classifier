The precise issue is whether a school teacher who refuses to cooperate with the school superintendent in an inquiry on the matter of’loyalty to the United States may be dismissed on the ground of incompetency, which is one of the reasons assigned in the School Code for dismissal.</p>
    <p id="b260-13" data-blocks='[["BL_260.21",260,[241,2088,1145,97]]]'>The facts leading up to a determination of that issue may be summarized as follows:</p>

      <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>In 1934 Bernard August was engaged as a teacher in the Philadelphia public schools and assigned to the Gratz High School, teaching mathematics. In 1943 he was transferred to the Olney High School, continuing to teach the same subject. In that same year he joined the Communist Party, actively participating in its program. In time he became the financial secretary of the Northeast branch of the Communist Party, collecting dues from fellow-members and transmitting the money to Communist central headquarters.</p>
    <p id="b261-4" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[171,876,1149,589]]]'>On October 14, 1952, he was summoned to the office of the Superintendent of the Philadelphia Public Schools, Dr. Louis P. Hoyer, who informed him that he had some questions to put to him on the subject of loyalty. August replied that he would not answer questions and wanted to consult with his attorney. Eight days later, October 24, 1952, he called Dr. Hoyer by telephone and informed him that he had been advised by his attorney that he was not required to answer questions on the topic mentioned by Dr. Hoyer, namely, loyalty.</p>
    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[168,1477,1150,476]]]'>On November 20, 1953, Superintendent Hoyer gave August an unsatisfactory rating as school teacher, particularly marking him deficient under the headings of professional relationship, judgment, professional attitudes, civic responsibility and appreciation of ideals. Five days later the Board of Public Education suspended him as a teacher, preferring charges against him on the grounds of incompetency and persistent wilful violation of the school laws of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.7",261,[165,1965,1150,255]]]'>On February 17, 1954, he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee to testify regarding his Communist membership.

He appealed to the Court of Common Pleas No. 6 of Philadelphia County which reversed the decision of the Board and ordered his re-instatement. The Board appealed to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[249,674,1154,913]]]'>A decision filed during this session in the case of <em>Board of Public Education, School District of Philadelphia v.

This decision follows the ruling in the ease of <em>Board of Public Education v. Beilan, </em><a href="/pa/386/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="386 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1268299" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0082-01">386 Pa. 82</a>, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States (<a href="/us/357/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="357 U.S. 399" data-case-ids="6163316" data-case-paths="/us/357/0399-01">357 U. S. 399</a>). It was argued in the Court below in the <em>Soler </em>case, as well as in the case at bar, that the Beilan precedent had been overruled by the decisions of this Court in the cases of <em>Board of Public Education v.

If a school superintendent, while interviewing a school employee, ascertains that he is or was a member of the Communist Party, and the evidence warrants further action, the Superintendent then turns to the mechanism of the Pechan law.</p>
    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.6",263,[165,964,1149,413]]]'>Any initial interrogation on loyalty in no way conflicts with the purposes of the Pechan Act. A school superior certainly has the right to ask a teacher whether he has ever engaged, for instance, in the sale of narcotics. He possesses no less authority to inquire whether the teacher ever belonged to an organization committed to the overthrow of our government by force and violence.</p>

If the Superintendent asked a teacher whether he had committed arson and the teacher refused to answer, could it be maintained that the school authorities would not have the right, and the obligation, to dismiss the teacher on the basis of incompetence? Is burning .down a dwelling any less culpable and reprehensible a deed than taking an active role in an organization committed to putting fire to the house of democracy, designed by the architects of the Constitution and built by all Americans since 1776?</p>

The conference conducted by Dr. Hoyer was a private one, so that August was spared all embarrassment or public harassment. If, however, instead of this initial investigation, the Loyalty Act had publicly taken hold, and it had developed later that August was entirely innocent, he might still suffer from the effects of passing through the Pechan machinery, which, even with expert hands at the control, could well have left him with bruises and hurts.</p>

    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[243,1221,1150,1078]]]'>And then, aside from what the procedure, in either event, means to the employee, the proper administration of the schools demands a prompt personal inquiry into equivocal conduct on the part of an employee. In explaining why he called August for questioning, Dr. Hoyer said: “I considered it important, first of all, because I wanted to discover, if I could, by conference and by conversation with Mr. August, whether or not the facts indicated in the statements [regarding August’s membership in the Communist Party] were correct, and also whether the relationships indicated in the questions had persisted to the present time. I considered them important also, or considered my desire important, because <em>they had </em>bearing, <em>in my estimation, on the fitness of Mr. August to be a teacher in the Philadelphia Public School System </em>and it is my responsibility to make certain that the teachers who come into the Philadelphia school system or who remain in it <em>are fit persons to be there.” </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>

    <p id="b265-3" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[161,846,1151,590]]]'>In the <em>Soler </em>case the school teacher was dismissed because he failed to reply to questions advanced by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.

Chief Justice Bell disposed of the Soler contention Avith the statement that “appellee was not dismissed on the ground of disloyalty; he was dismissed on the ground of <em>ineompeiency </em>because of insubordination and lack of frankness, candor and intellectual honesty.”</p>
    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[158,1446,1152,585]]]'>Justice Franiceurter, in his concurring opinion in the <em>Beilan </em>case, supra, and the case of <em>Lerner v. </em>Casey, <a href="/us/357/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="357 U.S. 468" data-case-ids="6163761" data-case-paths="/us/357/0468-01">357 U.

They were discharged because governmental authorities, like other employers, sought to satisfy themselves of the dependability of employees in relation to their duties. Accordingly, they made inquiries that, it is not contradicted, could in and of themselves be made. These inquiries Avere balked. The services of the employees were therefore terminated.”</p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[157,2048,1148,315]]]'>It thus is settled law in this State that a school employee owes the duty of frankness to his administrative superior; and is obliged to cooperate.

In order to have such a ‘thorough and efficient system’ those who teach in the public schools must be persons not only of learning and ability, of character and integrity, but they must be devoted to our country, its institutions and the basic principles upon which it was founded and hopefully will ever rest ... it is essential, in order to protect our children from treacherous influences, that persons Avho advocate or participate in subversive doctrines should not be employed, or if employed should not be retained, as teachers in our public schools, and any teacher dismissed for such a reason cannot properly claim that any constitutional or legal right is thereby violated.”</p>

This conclusion on the part of the court, in the face of the record, suggests a complete blotting out of the vast forest of fact because of a few scraggly trees of sophistry. The court quoted from Dr. Hoyer’s tes<a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>timony and, from the indicated quotation, found that Dr. Hoyer did not ask August any questions at the first interview and that, therefore, August could not reply. It is true that, taken apart from everything else in the record, one could read from replies made by Dr. Hoyer, in one circumscribed part of the record, that August was not questioned. However, when one reads the entire record it becomes as plain as a pikestaff that August was under interrogation at that first interview. Otherwise, why did he tell Dr. Hoyer that he would speak to his counsel before he decided whether he would answer questions put by Dr. Hoyer? In fact, the school teacher himself, Bernard August, testified that Dr. Hoyer questioned him. Here is his testimony: “When I came into the room, Dr. Hoyer . . . said that he had received certain information which he felt it was his duty to <em>question me about . </em>. . He said, <em>I have certain questions that I want to ask you. </em>I said, What type of question? I would like to know what the questions are before I undertake to answer them . . . Mr. Soken [Counsel for Philadelphia School Board], who was present, interrupted to say that there was no reason why I had to know what the questions were before I agreed to answer or refused to answer. Dr. Hoyer, however, very politely said, I <em>see no harm in letting him hear one of the questions. </em>And the question was something to the effect, there is sworn testimony, or something like that, to the effect that you were a member of the North Philadelphia branch of the professional section of the Communist Party of Philadelphia. And I said, well, <em>I would not undertake to answer questions of that sort without first consulting an attorney.” </em>(Italics supplied).</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[161,2167,1147,150]]]'>Thus, Dr. Hoyer, did put at least one question, and it was only because of August’s refusal to answer, that more were not forthcoming at that time.</p>

      <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>The court misread the record in another connection. It said: “No second interview was ever arranged, neither at that time nor at any subsequent time.”</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[269,517,1147,317]]]'>Here is Dr. Hoyer’s testimony on that phase of the case: “Q. Doctor, why was there a second conference arranged for? A. <em>The second conference was arranged </em>because Mr. August had indicated his desire to consult counsel, and of course I agreed to his request.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[268,846,1147,312]]]'>Thus, a second conference <em>was </em>arranged. It did not blossom on the tree of reality because August killed the'roots of the tree with the frost of his defiance and hostility. He telephoned Dr. Hoyer and informed him that he would not answer the questions which Dr. Hoyer wished to address to him.</p>
    <p id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.7",268,[267,1169,1148,424]]]'>But the lower court argued: “the mere receipt of a telephone call which purports to set up a future course of conduct, which course of conduct was- never tested, cannot be sufficient cause for dismissal. Mr. August should have been afforded the opportunity to meet face to face with his superior and upon notice of the possible result of his persistent refusal, be given the opportunity to reach a decision.”</p>
    <p id="b268-7" data-blocks='[["BL_268.8",268,[265,1605,1148,577]]]'>This argument would suggest that Mr. August is a child. When he told Dr. Hoyer that he would not answer questions, after he had already had eight days to consider whether he would answer or not, certainly Dr. Hoyer could assume that August would not answer questions. It would have been an infantile performance to prepare the stage for another conference, in the face of August’s refusal to answer, and then on that stage of futility for Dr. Hoyer to attempt by cajolery, persuasion and implied threat to get August to answer.</p>

He knew English and he knew that Dr. <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>Hoyer knew English. Then when he, with the finality of an <em>ax </em>stroke, told Dr. Hoyer he would not answer questions, a “face to face” meeting on the same subject, as desired by the lower court, would not only be superfluous but inane and fatuous.</p>
    <p id="b269-4" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[181,619,1151,809]]]'>It is a strange argument which criticizes Dr. Hoyer for not giving to August what he spurned. August did not want another conference because he knew that Dr. Hoyer intended to talk to him, not on the state of the weather, but on the state of his attachment to Communist ideology. Reflecting on the possibility of such a “face to face” interview, he saved face, as he undoubtedly thought, by staying away. The record is clear that it was August who torpedoed the first conference and it was he who sank all possibility of a second conference by telling Dr. Hoyer that to all questions on the question of loyalty he would stand mute. Although he indicated to Dr. Hoyer he would be deaf to all questions, it was very clear that in his line of reasoning he was not dumb. The following episode will illustrate.</p>
    <p id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.6",269,[178,1438,1151,587]]]'>At the conference on October 14th Dr. Hoyer told August that he intended to read certain statements to him about his activities involving loyalty, and he would then ask August to confirm or refute those statements. August said he would not answer the questions and then added: “Why should I admit anything before I see whether you can corroborate it?” This is like a person charged with larceny, who, being asked whether he has the purse of the victim in his pocket replies: “I refuse to answer that question until I find out if you have any evidence I have the purse.”</p>

August’s wanting to know what evidence had been gathered on his Communist activities <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>so that he could avoid making damaging admissions on matters which could not be proved against him, was indeed a cunning piece of strategy, but a strategy which proved him to be more shrewd than faithful.</p>

When it was sent, August had already been suspended and charges of ineompetency had been filed. <em>Fourteen months </em>had expired since the date of his offense. In all this time he never attempted to supply Dr. Hoyer with the information which had been requested of him.</p>

One who truly sorrows for having burnt down his neighbor’s house does not wait until the neighbors have been made ill from exposure to rain, storm, snow and ice before he takes tools and timber to rebuild what he destroyed. Even so, August could not rebuild with a few drops of ink the house of character which he had himself brought down in ruins by turning his back on his administrative superior when that superior, with good intention and kind words, asked him to take the superior into his confidence.</p>

L. 30, §1122 et seq., as amended, 24 PS §11-1122 et seq., and that the only issue involved herein is whether appellee’s behavior fell within the judicial proscription. One need only glance at the lengthy opinion of the majority to realize that the real, indeed the sole, question in this <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>case concerns appellee’s loyalty. If the majority is concerned only with incompetency, there is no relevancy in the detailed history of the Communist conspiracy in this country and abroad. Similarly, if incompetency is the only question involved, the majority’s attack on the appellee for his affiliation with Communist organizations is unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b285-4" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[168,749,1148,593]]]'>It is ironic that August’s alleged incompetency does not arise out of his membership in Communist organizations. Indeed, he cannot be discharged for such membership under the Public School Code of 1949, but must be proceeded against in compliance with the Pennsylvania Loyalty (Pechan) Act of 1951, December 22, P. L. 1726, as amended, 65 PS §211 et seq. Notwithstanding, the majority holds, in defiance of logic, that appellee’s mere refusal to answer his superior’s questions concerning this membership, in and of itself, constitutes incompetency.</p>
    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.6",285,[166,1352,1149,1020]]]'>What, says the majority, is the difference between a refusal by a teacher to answer questions posed by an administrative superior concerning loyalty and questions concerning immoral or criminal behavior? Under the Pennsylvania statutes there is a very crucial distinction. Unquestionably, a teacher’s refusal to answer his superior regarding alleged immoral or criminal activities would constitute insubordination and fall within the definition of incompetency under the Public School Code of 1949, 24 PS §11-1122. I agree thoroughly that a school board is entitled to candid answers from its employees and that it can terminate the employee’s status on the ground of incompetency if such answers are not forthcoming. Since the Public School Code of 1949 does not provide a specific procedure to guide the administrative superior in questioning teachers regarding these matters, the professional interview is the proper — indeed, the only — place for the superior to obtain this information.</p>

      <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>Concerning loyalty, however, the Legislature has established a detailed statutory procedure to assist the administrative officer to obtain necessary information under conditions safeguarding the teacher’s interests. For this reason, questions regarding loyalty were excepted by the explicit provisions of the Pechan Act from the matters permitted to be raised in an incompetency interview. In this one area, therefore, the Public School Code of 1949 has been preempted by the Pechan Act.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[255,905,1146,363]]]'>The title of the Pechan Act states, “An act relating to the loyalty to the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of public officers and employes, including teachers and other employes of the public school system . . .; prohibiting appointment or employment and requiring discharges after hearing in certain cases . . . .”</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[253,1285,1147,317]]]'>Moreover, Section 15 of the Act provides: <em>“Effect and Applicability of Act </em>...

    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[248,1612,1149,643]]]'>The majority states that its interpretation of the Pechan Act will not render the law impotent and meaningless. It then attempts to justify August’s dismissal, patently based on the substantive grounds of disloyalty without the corresponding safeguards of the Pechan Act, on the basis that the sole question raised at the interview was that of incompetency and that, consequently, the statutory requirements for a loyalty inquest were unnecessary and inapplicable. Such a position misconstrues the basic meanings of <em>loyalty </em>and <em>incompetency </em>and constitutes an indiscriminate interchanging of these very distinct words.</p>

Consequently, to be discharged under the Act, a person must be determined to be a “subversive person” by a “fair preponderance of the evidence.” 65 P.S. §217. The difficulty which a School Board might have in meeting the rather rigorous burden imposed by the Act makes an incompetency interview a much more attractive forum in which to discuss the question of loyalty. This Court, in <em>Beilan, Soler </em>and the present case, approves this practice even though it is contrary to the provisions of the Pechan Act and though it destroys the distinctions between “loyalty” and “incompetency.”</p>
    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[147,1014,1158,1405]]]'>Here, however, the majority even goes beyond the interpretation of ineompetency given in <em>Soler. </em>In this case, we never reached the step where the teacher refused to answer questions posed by the administrative superior. Appellee ivas discharged without the superintendent having actually asked him questions at an interview. The record is clear that an initial hearing was held in October, 1952. At that time no questions were asked, and the superintendent gave appellee permission to refer the matter to counsel. Subsequently, August phoned the superintendent and informed him that under advice of counsel, he would act as had other teachers accused of disloyalty and would not answer questions concerning this subject. No questions were asked during the conversation. Dr. Hoyer, the superintendent, never fixed a time for a second interview at which he could propound the questions he wished to ask. Appellee was justified in expecting an interview before he was suspended. Without holding an interview at which he actually posed questions concerning loyalty, the superintendent had no way of knowing whether appellee would actually refuse to answer. Indeed, at the hearing before the School Board, the first opportunity he had to appear before an official body, August did answer questions concerning his association with Communist organizations.</p>

      <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>In effect, the majority is holding that an administrative superior can discharge a teacher on the grounds of incompetency if the superior has reason to believe that the teacher <em>will </em>refuse to answer questions in futuro. This is a most dangerous proposition. Although the present case concerns loyalty, the majority’s position is equally as applicable in a situation concerning immoral or criminal activity. Consequently, a teacher accused of improper activity would be fired if he expresses reluctance to discuss the matter with his superior, even though the latter may never have questioned him formally concerning it.</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[261,1013,1148,523]]]'>Mere suspicion of refusal is not sufficient; there must be <em>an actual refusal to answer </em>to constitute incompetency, even within the wide interpretation given to that word by this Court. Human beings change their minds. A teacher must be given the opportunity at a scheduled interview to refuse to answer, and must be on notice that his refusal will constitute incompetency. Any other position does violence to the Due Process clauses of both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[257,1557,1150,586]]]'>It is not difficult to lodge an emotional diatribe, as the majority opinion does, against the Communist organization and its recognized conspiracy to conquer the world. When, however, we approve procedures which violate fundamental due process, despite the fact that the Legislature has provided an effective, direct and constitutionally sound alternative method for ridding ourselves of these undesirables, we lose all sense of law and order, and, indeed, play into the hands of the Communist conspiracy. It is just such a course that the majority opinion invites.</p>

If the procedures provided by the Pechan Act are utilized, such employes would be eliminated from the scene. There is, however, a second result, much more inimical to organized society, which the majority opinion does not consider: when, as happened here, government <em>officers </em>close their eyes to positive statutory directives, and, without any evidence, impose sanctions, due process is denied and the very fibre .of our democratic government is weakened.</p>
