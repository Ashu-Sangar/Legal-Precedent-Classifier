If new facts appear that indicate that the City is not secondarily liable but is in pari delicto, i.e., a joint tortfeasor, the appellant can adequately preserve its rights by an action for contribution against the City. The distinctions between the right of indemnity existing between parties having differing degrees of liability, and the right of contribution existing between joint tortfeasors were succinctly set forth by former Chief Justice Horace Stern in <em>Builders Supply Company v. McCabe, </em><a href="/pa/366/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="366 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="8845540" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0322-01">366 Pa. 322</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="77 A.2d 368">77 A. 2d 368</a> (1951).

Tbe Company owned and maintained a 27" pipe across a portion of the intersection of Packer Avenue and Swanson Street (an unopened, unimproved roadway) in Philadelphia. No barriers or warning markers were maintained by the Company. Despite the existence of warning signs erected by the City to advise motorists of the termination of the roadway, plaintiff, Dentino, drove his car beyond the end of the roadway and collided with the pipe. Both Dentino and the plaintiff Jenkins, a passenger, were injured.</p>
