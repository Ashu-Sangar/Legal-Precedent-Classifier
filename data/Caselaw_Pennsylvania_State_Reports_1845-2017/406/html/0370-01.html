On March 2, his fellow-employees went on a sympathetic strike and the company instituted an action in equity and secured a preliminary injunction. At a hearing on the following day, the preliminary injunction was continued with the following order: “Further hearing to be held on April 3, 1961 in Room ‘A’, 10:00 A.M. Employee Washington to be continued on the payroll in interval and removed off the premises. Case referred back to arbitrator Israel Ben Scheiber no later than April 3, 1961.”</p>

      <em> </em>the arbitrators are the final judges of both law and fact and their award will not be disturbed for a mistake of either.” The lower court ruled that its order of March 3, 1961, was part of the submission and we agree. The written submission of the respective parties was not inconsistent with the court’s specific order that Washington was to be kept on the payroll. If it had been the intention of the appellee to agree to jeopardize the benefit it received from the chancellor’s order, it would have specifically so stated. “. . . [T]he power and authority of arbitrators are wholly dependent upon the terms of the agreement of submission, and they cannot exercise authority as to matters not included therein, or validly determine the dispute if they violate or act inconsistently with the terms of the submission. To put it another way, their powers, being derived from the submission, are measured by it.” 11 Stand. Pa. Prac., Arbitration and Award, §93 (1938).</p>

That court further stated, at 606: “The ratio decidendi of the cases was not based upon either a ‘liberal’ or a ‘strict’ construction of the arbitration agreements but rather upon a careful analysis of the wording of the referral clauses in the light of the surrounding circumstances in each case as indicative of the intent of the parties to the agreement.”</p>

Trader Horn Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/396/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="396 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1284852" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0203-01">396 Pa. 203</a>, 205, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="152 A.2d 257">152 A. 2d 257</a> (1959). When he ordered the parties to go to arbitration, the chancellor specifically stated that Washington was to remain on the payroll until April 3, 1961. This was a restriction on the submission and the arbitrator and respective counsel so realized it as is shown by the record when the arbitrator got permission to file his award on April 11, 1961, “with the understanding that the Grievant is not to be on the payroll from April 3, 1961.” There was nothing to prevent the arbitrator from imposing penalties after April 3,1961. But, it seems that the arbitrator felt that Washington should not collect pay merely for staying away from work in order to keep labor peace. This wasn’t his decision to make, it was the chancellor’s. The lower court didn’t change or vary the award of the arbitrator but merely struck from the award that part which exceeded his authority under the submission. “Where the award is severable and the residue, after rejection of the invalid portion, is final, certain, and in no way affected by the departure from the submission, [the] authorities hold that it may be sustained as to such part, although void to the extent that it exceeds the submission.” 3 Am. Jur., Arbitration and Award, §123.</p>
