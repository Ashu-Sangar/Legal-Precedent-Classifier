Alleging that his fall and the ensuing injuries <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>were caused by hills and ridges of ice which had been permitted to accumulate on the sidewalk through Le-vines’ negligence, Rinaldi instituted a trespass action against Levines in Court of Common Pleas No. 5 of Philadelphia. After a trial before Judge Joseph Sloans and a jury, Rinaldi obtained a verdict of $10,-000 against Levines. Levines’ motions for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial were denied and judgment was entered on the verdict. From the entry of that judgment, this appeal was taken.</p>
