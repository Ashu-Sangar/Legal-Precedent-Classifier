Appellee then asked Dr. Hoyer to give him a list or statement of the proposed questions since he desired to consult his attorney before deciding whether to answer them. Dr. Hoyer thereupon gave him a sample question to take back to his attorney. That question was whether ap<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>pellee had been an active Communist in January of 1952.</p>

The second issue, assuming that the first should be answered in the affirmative, is whether or not appellant [here appellee] can be properly held to have refused to answer questions relating to his loyalty propounded to him by the Superintendent of Schools.” The lower Court then went on to answer both issues in the negative.</p>

Under the Act of May 18, 1911, as amended by the Act of June 20, 1939, P. L. 482, the grounds for dismissal of a teacher were ‘immorality, incompetency, intemperance, cruelty, persistent negligence, mental derangement, and persistent and wilful violation of the school laws of this Commonwealth’. ... If the appellee had been charged with being a subversive it may be conceded that the Loyalty Act [often called the Pechan Act] should have been employed, but this was not the charge. <em>Appellee was charged %oith incompetency based on his refusal to respond to a pertinent inquiry as to his fitness to be a teacher. </em>The Loyalty Act preempted the field of dismissal for subversion as therein defined, but other causes of dismissal remained unaffected. Section 15 of the Loyalty Act expressly provides: ‘The provisions of this act shall not affect the right to discharge any person for any cause other than those provided for by this act or without cause under existing law. . . .’. Moreover the Loyalty Act provides neither the procedure nor the substantive law with respect to the duty of a teacher to answer proper questions. The provisions of the School Code do provide the basis for <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>dismissal of a teacher who refuses to answer such questions.</p>

Common and approved usage give a much wider meaning. For example, in 31 C.J., with reference to a number of supporting decisions, it is defined: “A relative term without technical meaning. It may be employed as meaning disqualification; inability; incapacity; lack of ability, legal qualifications, or fitness to discharge the required duty.” In Black’s Law Dictionary (3rd edition) page 945, and in Bouvier’s Law Dictionary (3rd revision), p. 1528, it is defined as “Lack of ability or fitness to discharge the required duty.” . . .’</p>

Frankness and cooperation with an administrative superior bear directly upon a teacher’s competency. They are as essential in one occupying a post of public trust and civic responsibility as academic qualifications. Can it be seriously argued that where the superintendent of schools has trustworthy information indicating that a teacher has an incurable communicable disease or that he is a peddler of narcotics or, as here, that he may entertain Communistic ideologies which could be transmitted to the youth in his care, that no inquiry can be made as to the fact and that the teacher is not required to respond?

The above mentioned crimes clearly and obviously relate to a teacher’s fitness and competency, yet the commission of any one of those crimes would injure only one or a very few persons.

Communism by its teachings and even more strikingly by its acts and deeds is the mortal enemy of our Country. Communism is not merely a political belief like the peaceful advocacy of socialism, or democracy, or republicanism, or any share-the-wealth plan, or the abolition of Congress and the substitution of an oligarchy or of a dictatorship.

He was here being questioned by his administrative superior in private. He has no right to be represented by counsel or to demand a list of questions to be asked, <em>when questioned by his employer to determine his competency. </em>To contend that a teacher can insist that a professional interview with his superior <em>shall be conducted only on the teacher’s terms </em>is unreasonable and ignores and <em>effectually negates </em>the relationship between teacher and superior. Soler’s refusal to answer his administrative superior was unjustified and is ground for a finding of incompetency.</p>

And, if the only material matter to which the question relates is possible disloyalty or subversion on the part of the employee, then any proceeding looking to his dismissal for refusal to answer questions relating to his possible disloyal or subversive activities or affiliations must be brought under the Pennsylvania Loyalty Act of December 22, 1951, P.

If the Board of Education is concerned with the question of an employee’s loyalty, let it invoke the proper administrative procedure provided by the Pechan Act, with its requirement that the appointing authority must establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the accused is subversive. Indeed, Section 13 of the Act of March 21, 1806, P. L. 558, 4 Sm. L. 326, 46 PS §156, provides that “. . . in all cases where a remedy is provided, or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by any act or acts of Assembly of this commonwealth, the directions of the said acts shall be strictly pursued, and no penalty shall be inflicted, or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law, in such cases, further than <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into effect.” This court has reiterated this provision on many occasions: see, e.g., <em>Jacobs v.

At trial, the superintendent of the public school system testified that the purpose of his interview with Soler was to ask him questions concerning certain information which had a bearing on appellee’s loyalty. Indeed, the sample question given to Soler was whether he had been an active Communist in 1952. In this regard, Justice (now Chief Justice) Bell’s dissenting opinion in <em>Beilan </em>is relevant. He stated: “We cannot shut our eyes to the inescapable fact which we are convinced — notwithstanding the earnest, able argument of counsel for the Board — is glaringly disclosed by this Record, that Beilan was fired because the Board believed that he was a Communist.” <a href="/pa/386/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="386 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1268299" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0082-01">386 Pa. at 110-111</a>.</p>
