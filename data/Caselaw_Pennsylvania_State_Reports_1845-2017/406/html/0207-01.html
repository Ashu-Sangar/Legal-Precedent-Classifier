It was prepared by a reputable attorney, Henry J. Rebinan, and he and Mary J. Tait were subscribing witnesses. Unfortunately, both predeceased testatrix. Testatrix bequeathed and devised to her long-time friend, Martha Elizabeth Guy, her residuary estate which amounted to approximately $50,000, but left her daughter a legacy of only $2,000 and her daughter’s son only $1,000.</p>

The Orphans’ Court, with Judge Bolger dissenting, entered a decree which affirmed the finding of the jury and set aside the probate of Mrs. Sommerville’s will, — not on the ground of general testamentary incapacity but on the ground of an insane delusion against her daughter. Martha Elizabeth Guy took this appeal.</p>

In 1890 she gave birth, out of wedlock, to the contestant, but two years later married the father of the child, now called Margaret Bussell. Sommerville left his wife a few months after their marriage and never contributed any support to his wife or child. Contestant never saw her father.</p>

She remained in the Orphanage until she was over 17, at which time she was bound out to a family as a child’s nurse for fifty cents a week until she reached the age of 18, when she received a lump sum payment of $50. <em>Testatrix’s only employment during her entire life was as a live-in laundress, </em>and it was conceded that she was an illiterate person with very little if any schooling. No reason is disclosed why contestant was placed in the Orphan Asylum, but it is obvious it must have been because her mother didn’t have a home or the money to support her.</p>

From the time contestant was placed in the Orphanage until, 1908, when she was nearly 18 years old, she saw her mother about 8 times. A few weeks before she was 18, <em>her. mother ashed her to pack her clothes and come home and live loith her; </em>she refused, and never told her mother the reason for her refusal. However, she testified that it was, because “the people of the home.....decided then, as my mother did not have a home to' care for me, that I would continue on the job until they could verify that my mother had a home for me.” It is.clear.that her mother was very upset and rankled by this refusal.</p>

During this period and after contestant had refused to go and live with, her mother, her mother did not wish to see contestant and. wrote how much the contestant upset her and how much she despised and hated her. Nevertheless, contestant succeeded in borrowing money from her mother, the amount and date of which are unknown. Moreover, contestant in some way obtained possession of the deed to her mother’s cemetery lot and despite several requests from her mother, refused to re<a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>turn it.

Testatrix, although only a laundress, saved enough money to purchase 9 properties prior to 1928. In 1928 she took these properties out of the hands of her real estate agent because she did not think she was getting a sufficient return. Thereupon, contestant filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas to have her .mother declared incompetent. A hearing was fixed for December 1, 1928, but no hearing was held. At that time contestant had obtained an eminent psychiatrist, Dr. Leopold, to testify in support of the .petition that her mother was incompetent and was likely to become the victim of designing persons and was incapable of managing her estate. Contestant testified that when the Judge came out of his chambers after a conference with the attorneys he said that her mother’s property should be taken care of by the Land Title Trust and Mortgage Company, and the case was withdrawn. The property was never taken out of her mother’s hands or placed with the Land Title. Testatrix wrote a letter to Dr. and Mrs. Tait (Dr. Tait was her cousin), explaining why. she changed her mind about appointing the Land Title as her real estate agent. In this letter she said, inter alia, that if she had been left alone by her daughter she would soon have had saved an additional $1,000 to buy. a new home in a better part of the City, and that her daughter had tried to have her “made simple-minded” when in less than 5 years she had paid off mortgages on her properties totaling $6,800, and during this time had also spent over $3,000 in repairs, and “My daughter knew what wages I got and was always after the money, and now they try to tell me I can’t have brains enough to look after my own properties.” Except for <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>the contestant’s motives — as to which testatrix may or may not have been mistaken — these are not figments of imagination, these are actual facts!</p>

Under these circumstances why should the law compel her to leave her estate to her daughter instead of to a woman who had befriended her for years?</p>

She had a delusional trend, not very strong, but present .... This delusional trend [was] very pronounced and chronic.” Just what that contradictory testimony meant was clear to the lower Court but not to us— certainly it was insufficient to prove, contrary to the lower Court’s conclusion, an insane delusion as that term is known to the law. It is both interesting and important to note in connection with the weight to be given to Dr. Leopold’s testimony — upon which the lower Court so strongly relied — (a) the remoteness of the time between 1928 and 1945 when testatrix executed her will, and (b) that from 1928 to 1945 Margaret Sommerville, who was only a laundress, increased her real estate holdings from 9 properties to 14 properties and continued to manage all of them until 1950, when she appointed Robert F. Lehman, Esq., attorney-in-fact, <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>and (c) that Margaret Sommerville executed her will on October 22, 1945, which was prepared by Henry J.

Lehman, another reputable member of the bar,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> testified that Margaret Sommerville in April, 1946, was an able, intelligent woman with a keen intellect and sound mind and that at that time was fully conversant with the extent of her property and the members of her family and the extent of her will, and (e) that she (a laundress) accumulated by her business ability so much money that after paying for all her expenses at nursing homes and hospital and doctors’ bills for the years 1950 until her death in 1958, she left an estate of approximately $50,000.</p>

No right of the citizen is more valued than the power to dispose of his property by will. No right is moré solemnly assured to him by the law. Nor does it depend in any sense upon the judicious exercise of it. It rarely happens that a man bequeaths his estate to the entire satisfaction of either his family or friends. In many instances testamentary dispositions of property seem harsh, if not unjust, the result, perhaps, of prejudice as to some of the testator’s kindred, or undue partiality as to others. But these are matters about which we have no concern. The law wisely secures equality of distribution where a man dies intestate. But the very object of a will is to produce inequality, and to provide for the wants of the testator’s family; to protect those who are helpless; to reward those who have been affectionate, and to punish those who have been disobedient. It is doubtless true that narrow prejudice sometimes interferes with the wisdom of such arrangements. This is due to the imperfections of our human nature. It must be remembered that in this country a man’s prejudices are a part of his liberty. He has a right to them; he may be unjust to his children or relatives; he is entitled to the control of his property while living, and by will to direct its use after his death, subject only to such restrictions as are imposed by law.”</p>
