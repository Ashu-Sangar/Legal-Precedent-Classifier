Ulansey, a Doctor of Osteopathy, and defendant, Juniata Park Medical Center, Inc., entered into an agreement whereby plaintiff was engaged as the director of defendant’s Department of Physical Medicine. Thereafter, a dispute arose between the parties as to the amount of money owed to plaintiff by defendant under the aforesaid agreement. The agreement contains a <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>provision<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> requiring submission of all disputes concerning tlie construction or performance of tbe agreement to arbitration.</p>
    <p id="b421-3" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[156,519,1152,960]]]'>Tlie dispute was referred to a panel of three arbitrators. After bearing evidence and arguments by both parties, tbe Board of Arbitration unanimously rendered a decision on July 20, 1961. It found defendant was indebted to plaintiff in tbe amount of $13,146.45 and directed defendant to make payment. Defendant refused to honor or abide by tbe award. Accordingly, plaintiff filed a Petition and Bule in tbe Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County to confirm tbe award and enter judgment pursuant to tbe provisions of §9 of tbe Act of April 25, 1927.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">**</a> Defendant filed an Answer and also a Motion to Modify, Correct or Resubmit tbe matter to the Board of Arbitrators. Defendant’s sole basis for refusing to honor the award was its contention that tbe Board had improperly excluded from evidence a letter dated May 26, 1960, and signed by its president, and that such exclusion constituted prejudicial error.</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[159,1500,1149,152]],["BL_422.1",422,[275,361,1144,204]]]'>Tbe ease was beard before Court of Common Pleas No. 4 which filed an Order directing resubmission of tbe matter to tbe Board of Arbitrators for tbe purpose <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>of hearing “legally competent evidence of the matters mentioned in the letter of May 26, 1960.” Following the refusal of plaintiff’s motion for reargument this appeal was taken.</p>

Such self-serving declarations would be inadmissible in a Court of law. In <em>Engemann v.

To allow the loser in an arbitration award to raise questions such as the one presented by the instant case would virtually nullify the salutary reasons for and the purpose of arbitration and would effectually destroy the desirability and the efficacy of arbitration.</p>
