The most significant provision in this lease provides: <em>“The right to mine to include all practical methods now in use, or which may hereafter he used, </em>and the use of improved machinery and fixtures or appliances for said purposes; and <em>the right to strip the surface for, </em>excavate, dig, bore, shaft, quarry and otherwise explore for and mine said minerals, with the right to remove all pillars and supports that may be left in the progress of said mining ; and the lessee is hereby released from all damages or liability that may be caused to, or result to the property from the mining and removal of said minerals, or from the exercise of any of the rights granted to the lessee, whether the said injuries shall be direct or consequential.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

Assuming, arguendo, that strip mining of fire clay was unknown in 1915, the grant to Harbison permitted it <em>expressly </em>to employ any type of mining which might “hereafter”— i.e., after 1915 — be employed or used.
