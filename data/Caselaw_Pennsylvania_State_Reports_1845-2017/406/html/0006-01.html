A dispute now arising :as to the identity of the owners, the Authority paid the money into the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, where it presently awaits authoritative distribution. The contenders for the amount in escrow are the County of Allegheny, the City of Pittsburgh, and the School District of the City of Pittsburgh on the one hand, and on the other, the heirs of Barbara Hahn, deceased, claiming title under her. will.</p>

Barbara Hahn died on November 2, 1928, testate, her will designating Hilda B. Wright as executrix of the estafe. Acting in that capacity, Hilda Wright foreclosed on a mortgage covering the property here in controversy, with the result that the legal title became vested, by a duly recorded Sheriff’s Deed, in “Hilda B.

For the years 1933 to 1942, inclusive, the City and the School District correctly filed liens in the name of “Hilda B. Wright, Executrix of the Estate of Barbara Hahn, deceased,” but for the years 1943 to 1946, inclusive, they incorrectly filed <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>their liens in the name of “Hilda B.

The Director of the Department of Lands and Buildings of the City of Pittsburgh took control of the properties as agent for the taxing bodies and leased it to various tenants during the period from November 13,1948 to October 31,1958.</p>

A dispute arose as to the identity of the beneficiary of the award. This Court said: “The question determinative of this case is: Who was the owner of that property at <em>the time of its </em>condemnation?

It does not require much exposition to put into clear focus the proposition that a registered owner of property who has not received notice of assessments and tax sale based thereon, as required by law, should not be penalized for failing to make timely objection to something of which he is factually and legally ignorant.</p>
