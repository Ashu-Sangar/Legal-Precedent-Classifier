The 60 new shares were carried at the same value as the 20 original shares. No evidence was offered to show whether any part of the new stock represented accumulated earnings.

Upon a corporate reorganization these shares were exchanged for 20 shares of Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company and two shares of South Jersey Gas Company. The latter two shares were sold in 1951 by the trustees. The Court below held that these shares represented an exchange as a result of a corporate reorganization and were not “stock dividends” or a “beneficial distribution” to the Estate.</p>
