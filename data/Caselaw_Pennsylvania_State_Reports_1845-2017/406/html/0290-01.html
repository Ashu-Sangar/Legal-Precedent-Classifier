      <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>Richardson Dilwortli was elected Mayor- of Philadelphia in. November, 1959, to serve a four year term from the first Monday of January, 1960 to the first Monday of January, 1964. Dilworth resigned as Mayor effective February 12, 1962. David Berger, City Solicitor of Philadelphia, informed and advised the City Commissioners acting as the County Board of Elections of Philadelphia that a successor to fill Dilworth’s unexpired term should be nominated at the primary election on May 15, 1962, and that they should take all proper and necessary measures for the holding of a primary election for nominations to fill the vacancy in the office of Mayor at the 1962 primary. Thereupon Mrs. Cali and Burns each brought a taxpayer’s Bill to enjoin the City of Philadelphia and various officials who were named as defendants from holding an election and from the expenditure of money for the printing of ballots and other necessary election requirements for the nomination of a Mayor at the primary election in 1962. The Court of Common Pleas No. 7 of Philadelphia County entered a final decree enjoining the election and granting the relief prayed for in the Bills in Equity against the individual defendants, but considered it unnecessary to enter an injunction specifically against the City. From this decree each of the defendants took an appeal. No factual issues are in dispute — the pleadings raise only questions of law.</p>

If the Charter is the sole controlling yardstick, there can be no doubt, we repeat, that the Mayorality vacancy must be filled by an election in 1962. Unfortunately, however, that is not the sole controlling yardstick — the Charter, as we shall see, is subordinate to and is restricted and limited even as to local affairs first by the pertinent provisions of the Constitution, and secondly, by the pertinent legislative Acts. The Charter owes its breath of life and its very existence first to the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and secondly, to the enabling Act which gave it its birth, its powers and its limitations, namely, the First Class City Home Rule Act of 1949, supra.</p>

For example, Section 626 of the Election Code provides that whenever a vacancy occurs in the office of United States Senator, “said vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term ... at a special election to be held at the time of the next general or municipal election . . . .” Section 627 of the Election Code provides that whenever a vacancy occurs in the office of a Eepresentative in Congress, “. . . the Governor shall issue ... a writ of election . . . for a special election to fill said vacancy. . . .

An injunction was granted by this Court to restrain an election to fill the vacancy at the general election in 1941. Article II, Section 4(a) of the 1919 legislatively-created Philadelphia Charter provided, relevantly, the same as the present City Home Buie Charter provides: “When a vacancy shall take place in the office of mayor, a successor shall be elected <em>for the unexpired term at the next election </em>occurring more than thirty days after the commencement of such vacancy . . . .” Section 602 of the Election Code was identical with the section as it now stands.

The Court further held, citing or quoting several constitutional provisions, as well as the pertinent provisions of the Election Code which have been hereinabove quoted, (2) (a) that a Mayor of Philadelphia could not be elected in an even-numbered year and hence could not be elected until the next municipal election after the 1941 municipal election, viz., in 1943, and (b) that there was no provision in the Election Code of 1937 for a special election for Mayor of Philadelphia.

If a President of the United States dies one day or one month or one year after his inauguration, the Vice President succeeds him and serves the balance of the four-year term, with no right in the people to vote for a successor. Exactly the same thing happens in Pennsylvania. If a Governor dies or resigns one day or one month or one year after his inauguration, the Lieutenant Governor succeeds him and serves out the balance of the four-year term, without an election. But even if appellants’ worst fears are realized, it is too often forgotten that under our basic form and system of Constitutional Government the power and duty of a Supreme Court is interpretative, not legislative. We are not a Supreme, or even a Superior Legislature, and we have no power to redraw the Constitution or to rewrite Legislative Acts or Charters, desirable as that sometimes would be.</p>

I would add merely the following observation. Section 3-500 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter states that “An election to fill a vacancy for an unexpired term in the office of Mayor shall be held at the next municipal or general election,” but it does not specify which it shall be — municipal <em>or </em>general. If I were on a strange road and came to a sign reading: New York or Miami, I would ignore it completely and ask the first farmer, traveler or idler who happened along for something more specific.</p>

The eminent and distinguished veteran at the bar, Wm. A. Schnader, president of the Pennsylvania Bar Association, and who was chairman of the drafting committee of the Charter, has stated that there is no explanation known to him for the inclusion of the words “general election.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

The provision would still be ineffective because, as devastatingly established by the opinion of Chief Justice Bell, this provision runs headlongingly into the stone wall of the Enabling Act, to say nothing of the macerating effects of the applicable machinery of the Constitution.</p>
