    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[170,488,1152,1241]]]'>In Article XI testator created two trusts alike in every respect, except the corporate trustees were to be different. Of the net income from the trusts, “one equal fifth part” was to be paid to each of his five named living children “for and during the natural life of each”. Testator then provided a scheme of distribution of one fifth of the principal of each fund upon the death of each one of his children and such distribution varied according to the descendants which said child dying should then leave: (1) if one child and no issue of a deceased child or children, the one child would take all; (2) if more than one child and no issue of a deceased child or children, then an equal division between such children; (3) if one child or more than one child and issue of a deceased child or children, then, the one fifth share would go to the child or children and the issue of a deceased child or children, the latter taking per stirpes. Up to this point in the will testator’s intent is clear; he directed a distribution along blood lines, required that the takers be alive when his sons or daughters died, provided equality of distribution and a per stirpital distribution for the issue of any deceased grandchild or grandchildren.</p>
    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.6",55,[168,1745,1150,645]],["BL_56.1",56,[245,361,1146,524]]]'>Next and most important are the provisions for the contingency which might arise if one of - testator’s children — before or after testator’s death — should die leaving no child nor issue of a deceased child. In such a contingency, the income from such deceased child’s share was to be paid “to his or her surviving brothers and sisters” for life. Testator then provided that “upon the death of any one of said surviving brothers and sisters, the share of the principal of the said trust funds oí* estates to be paid over to the children and issue of children of such deceased surviving brother or sister shall be proportionately increased . . . .” Desirous to <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>clarify this clause, testator then stated that in the event <em>any </em>son or daughter died without leaving a child or issue of a deceased child, the share of the income for each of his “surviving” sons and daughters shall be increased to one-fourth and the share of principal likewise increased to one-fourth “and so on”.

When these securities of <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>the trust were sold in October 1959 a gross long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes of $258,-217.91 was realized upon which a tax of $65,554.48 was paid.

Sarah predeceased Emeline, leaving Emeline and a brother as her only heirs at law. Emeline had one child who survived Sarah, but predeceased Emeline. The trustee petitioned under the Price Act to sell real estate. Emeline and her brother joined in the petition. The residuary heirs under testator’s will objected to the .sale on the ground that Sarah never took an interest in the real estate because she predeceased Emeline’s child and the remainder fell into the residuary estate. The Court held that Sarah’s remainder may have been technically contingent, but it was nevertheless transmissible and passed to her heirs at law — her sister, Emeline, and her brother. The lower court (affirmed per curiam by the Supreme Court) said at page 48: ‘But the distinction [between contingent and vested subject to being divested] is of little importance, since the chief difference between a vested remainder and one that is contingent is that the latter may be destroyed by determination of the particular estate before the happening of the contingency . . . while a vested remainder would simply be accelerated; and unless the contingency is one which affects the capacity to take, a contingent remainder or Other contingent interest is transmissible, even though not, in the technical sense, vested: Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 118; . . . Upon this subject the law is thus stated by Chancellor Kent: “It is well settled that all contingent interests of inheritance . . . where the person who is to take is certain, are transmissible by descent and are devisable and assignable.” ’</p>
