Each brought an action-at law under Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, approved June 5, 1920 (46 <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>U.S.C.A., §688). Moore was injured in Illinois while working on the M/V W. W. Mar ting on February 11, 1960. Belville was injured in Illinois while working on the M/V A. H. Crane on September <em>7, </em>1958. Each claims he was tossed overboard by the abrupt collision between improperly moored barges and those in tow and that his body was crushed by the barge. They each allege, among other things, that defendant was negligent in failing to provide a safe place to work, in failing to warn of the danger, in negligently tying up the barges, and in failing to provide proper mooring equipment.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[185,1007,1156,1079]]]'>It is conceded that defendant-appellant, a non-registered foreign business corporation was present and doing business in Pennsylvania and that it was properly served. Defendant does not deny that its principal place of business is in Pittsburgh. Its attack on jurisdiction is that at the time the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to venue (Pa. R.C.P. 2179) and service (Pa. R.C.P. 2180) were adopted in 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States had ruled there was a constitutional prohibition against states exercising personal jurisdiction over unregistered foreign corporations on transitory causes of action arising in other states. Defendant admits that the prohibition no longer exists. <em>Perkins v. Benquet Consol. Mining Co., </em><a href="/us/342/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="342 U.S. 437" data-case-ids="640833" data-case-paths="/us/342/0437-01">342 U.S. 437</a> (1952). However, it contends that since the Pennsylvania Rules originally could not have been construed to cover this case constitutionally, and since the rules remained unchanged in wording, they still must be construed to deny to Pennsylvania courts jurisdiction over such cases.</p>

The Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled that a state cannot exercise jurisdiction on a transitory cause of action arising elsewhere where the defendant is <em>physically </em>

      <em>present and personally served </em>in the forum state. The .eases cited by defendant fall into two categories, (1) where the defendant was found to be not present, or (2) where the defendant was or had been present and service was made on an authorized agent, such authorization for acceptance of service was found not to extend to causes of action arising outside of the state. In the case at bar it is undisputed that defendant was present, since its principal office is here, and that <em>personal </em>service was effected on it. As the Supreme Court said concerning the cases relied on by defendant here: “The necessary result was a finding of inadequate service in each case and a conclusion that the foreign corporation was not bound by it.” <em>Perkins, </em><a href="/us/342/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="342 U.S. 437" data-case-ids="640833" data-case-paths="/us/342/0437-01">supra,</a> at . 444.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[238,1161,1156,805]]]'>That the Court had never been faced with the situation of a non-registered corporation admittedly present and personally served on a cause of action arising elsewhere is seen in its language at 444: “Today if an authorized representative of a foreign corporation be physically present in the state of the forum and be there engaged in activities appropriate to accepting service or receiving notice on its behalf, we recognize that there is no unfairness in subjecting that corporation to the jurisdiction of the courts of that state through such service of process upon that representative. This has been squarely held to be so in a proceeding <em>in personam </em>against such a corporation, at least in relation to a cause of action arising out of the corporation’s activities within the state of the forum.</p>
    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.6",304,[237,1979,1150,365]],["BL_305.1",305,[171,340,1149,263]]]'>“The essence of the issue here, at the constitutional level, is a like one of general fairness to the corporation.” And at 446: “The instant case takes us one step further to a proceeding <em>in personam </em>to enforce a cause of - action not arising out of the corporation’s activities in the state of the forum. Using the tests mentioned above we find no requirement of federal <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>due process that either <em>prohibits </em>Ohio from opening its courts to the cause of action here presented or <em>compels </em>Ohio to do so. This conforms to the realistic reasoning in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra, (<a href="/us/326/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="326 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="6157001" data-case-paths="/us/326/0310-01">326 U.S. 310</a>) at 318-319:</p>

There is, therefore, jurisdiction in the court below, and hence no appeal can lie from these orders under the Act of March 5, 1925, P.L. 23, 12 P.S. §672. <em>Plum v.

Yet that case was remanded for the lower court to exercise its discretion, indicating that this Court deemed that matter a discretionary one.
