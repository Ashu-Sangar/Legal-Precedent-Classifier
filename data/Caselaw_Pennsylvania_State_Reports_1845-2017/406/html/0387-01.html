Plaintiff’s property, approximately 140' x 140', is in a Commercial Zone and the Zoning Ordinance of the Township permits the requested use when authorized by a special exception under certain safeguards set forth in the ordinance. The lower Court did not take any additioiial testimony and therefore the sole question properly before it was whether the Board of Adjustment had committed an error of law or a manifest abuse of its discretion: <em>Moyerman v.

The evidence was carefully analyzed in the able opinion of Judge Gkoshens. It will suffice to say that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the findings of the Board and we can find no abuse of discretion.</p>
