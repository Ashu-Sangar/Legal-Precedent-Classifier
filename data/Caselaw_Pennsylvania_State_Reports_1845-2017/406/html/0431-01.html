The decedent wanted to relieve the financial situation of his brother and wife and to that end purchased from the Bank their obligations. At the time of this purchase decedent intended at <em>some time </em>to forgive such obligations and make a gift thereof to Pichéis: in furtherance of said purpose he executed and acknowledged the power of attorney with the intent at <em>some time </em>to satisfy the mortgage of record and when he enclosed the instruments which evidenced such obligations in the envelope with the inscription on the outside thereof he intended to create a trust whereby Pichéis’ obligations now assigned to him would be forgiven and relinquished by way of a gift to the Pichéis.

L. 521, §1, 72 PS §2301), a tax is imposed upon the transfer of any property, real or personal, when the “transfer” is “intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after such death”.

The criterion is not whether the beneficiaries are to acquire actual possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the donor but whether the latter has irrevocably parted with all his interest, title, possession and enjoyment in his lifetime”.

      </a>
      <em> </em>at any time up until his death the decedent could have destroyed the envelope and the power of attorney and he could have insisted upon payment of Pichéis’ obligations even to the extent of proceeding upon the mortgage. That the decedent well recognized that there had been no inter vivos transfer to Pichéis of the obligations is best evidenced by the fact that he made explicit provision in his will for a release and relinquishment of Pichéis’ obligations. Had decedent intended to make an inter vivos transfer of these obligations the provision in the will would lack any meaning. An examination of the language employed by the decedent in Item Four which released and forgave Pichéis of “so much of said debts <em>as may remain owing to me at the time of my death </em>and all the interest thereon” clearly indicates that the transfer contemplated was to take place at the time of decedent’s death. If the transfer contemplated by decedent was an inter vivos transfer to have an immediate effect, how could there be any debts arising from the mortgage and notes when decedent died? Pichéis would not owe decedent anything at the time of his death if there had been an immediate transfer of the obligations either at the time of execution of the power of attorney or the creation of the trust by means of the inscription on the envelope.</p>
