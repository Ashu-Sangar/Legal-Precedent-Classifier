    <p id="b171-7" data-blocks='[["BL_171.10",171,[166,1287,1150,314]]]'>The lower court dismissed the complaint. Appellant appeals from this action of the lower court contending that the provisions of the Philadelphia Housing Code are incorporated in the landlord-lessee agreement as terms and conditions of the lease, giving rise to an action in assumpsit for breach of those provisions.</p>
    <p id="b171-8" data-blocks='[["BL_171.11",171,[165,1612,1148,358]]]'>While municipal ordinances imposing duties and standards of care are often properly admitted in evidence in a trespass action, there is no Pennsylvania authority holding that the failure to comply with a housing code imposing statutory duties upon the landlord constitutes a breach of the terms and conditions of the lease.</p>
    <p id="b171-9" data-blocks='[["BL_171.12",171,[164,1992,1149,368]]]'>Although not cited by appellant, the only state that recognizes the right to recover in assumpsit rather than in trespass for a breach of a lessor’s statutory responsibility to the leased premises is Louisiana, as contained in its Civil Code, Art. 2695 (1870).

      <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Traditionally, in those instances where Pennsylvania recognizes a right of action to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord’s failure to repair, the remedy has been in trespass based upon the landlord’s negligence. No reason has been advanced which would merit our departure from that rule; on the other hand, the loss of the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk would place undue burdens on the lessor.</p>
