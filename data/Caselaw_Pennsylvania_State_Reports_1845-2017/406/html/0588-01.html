An action for personal injuries and property damage resulted. A verdict in favor of all plaintiffs and against both defendants was returned by the jury. Motions for a new trial and judgment non obstante veredicto were refused by the court en banc. From the judgments entered upon the verdict, the defendants appealed.</p>

    <p id="b621-7" data-blocks='[["BL_621.10",621,[147,1593,1157,744]]]'>Read in this light, the record discloses the following: The Piwoz (plaintiffs’) automobile was proceeding east on Baltimore Avenue in the City of Philadelphia. This thoroughfare is a two-way street with a double set of streetcar tracks. It is intersected from the north by 44th Street, which does not continue to run through to the south, thus forming a T intersection. The intersection at the time of the accident was controlled by a traffic light, which was blinking yellow on Baltimore Avenue, calling for caution on the part of traffic proceeding on this thoroughfare; and blinking red on the 44th Street side, directing traffic on this street to stop before proceeding into the intersection.</p>

The defendant’s automobile proceeding south on 44th Street came into the intersection without stopping, made a careening wide turn, crossed over the center line of Baltimore Avenue, skidded and collided with the motionless automobile of the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[251,795,1148,480]]]'>The action against the defendant-owner, Iannacone, was based upon the premise that, at the time involved, Scott was his agent and was operating the automobile upon lannacone’s business. The appellants’ main thrust in support of the motion for judgment n.o.v. is that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support such a finding. That the evidence was not ample to support a finding that Scott’s negligence was the proximate cause of the accident is not asserted.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[248,1286,1152,524]]]'>On the question of agency, the following evidence was adduced: Iannacone operated an automobile repair shop. For approximately a three-year period previously, Scott was instrumental in bringing him automobiles for repair, on the average of four automobiles each week, sometimes seven to ten. He was paid by Iannacone a sum of money, usually by check, for each such job secured, and also enjoyed the privilege of expending sums of money for expenses for which he was reimbursed.</p>
    <p id="b622-7" data-blocks='[["BL_622.7",622,[248,1828,1148,531]],["BL_623.1",623,[143,344,1150,481]]]'>At the direction of Iannacone, Scott carried printed forms of power of attorney, to procure the signatures of the owners of the damaged automobiles, authorizing Iannacone to do the repair work. Scott was also authorized to hire towing trucks from independent firms in order to move the damaged automobiles to lannacone’s repair shop. Scott also carried a key to the shop and was authorized, regardless of the hour, to take the owner of a disabled car to the shop and lend him one of the automobiles, kept in the shop for such purposes, <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>to be used while his ear was being repaired. Scott was known by Iannacone to have at times a short-wave radio set in the car he operated in order to intercept police radio calls concerning automobile accidents so that he could drive quickly to the scene and solicit the necessary repair work for Iannacone. Scott was also told by Iannacone that he was interested in repairing late model automobiles which had not been damaged to such an extent that they were ready to be junked.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[142,836,1151,637]]]'>On the night of the collision involved in this case, both drivers were interviewed by the police shortly after the occurrence. One of the investigating officers tried to get inside the automobile operated by Scott but found its doors locked. Looking through the window, he saw therein a radio which differed substantially from the conventional model. He described it as one similar to those used on police motorcycles. It is a violation of the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and the pertinent ordinance of the City of Philadelphia for <em>auto repair men </em>to have shortwave radios in their automobiles.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.6",623,[140,1491,1151,862]]]'>Following the accident, which occurred about one o’clock in the morning, Scott took the plaintiff, Norman Piwoz, to Iannacone’s repair shop, opened it with his key, and secured a car from the shop for the plaintiff to use and drive home. Four or five days later, Iannacone phoned the plaintiffs’ home, and later came there to see if he could proceed with repairing Piwozs’ automobile. An argument took place as to who was going to repair the car and as to whether or not Iannacone had been authorized through Scott to do the job. In the course of the conversation, the following transpired : Iannacone — “You promised to let us fix it ... . You told <em>my man, Scott, </em>that you were going to let us fix it... . Well you told Scott and <em>Scott works for me and that’s like telling me. </em>Why do you think he lent you a car?”</p>

      <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>As part of plaintiffs’ case, the defendant Iannacone, was called as for cross-examination. He testified, inter alia, that the automobile operated by Scott on the night involved was Iannacone’s own personal car; that it had no short-wave radio as part of its equipment; that he loaned the car to Scott as a favor two days before the accident to go to Virginia on Scott’s own personal business; that he never requested Scott to secure damaged automobiles for his repair business and in securing them, Scott was an independent agent, and never worked for him; that on the night involved Scott was acting on his own and was not acting under his direction or engaged in any business for Iannacone. It is argued that this evidence was uncontradicted and unimpeached and that, therefore, the plaintiffs are bound thereby. It is further submitted that even if Scott were regularly employed by Iannacone, the evidence is insufficient to show that such employment existed on the occasion involved. With these contentions, we must strongly disagree.</p>

L. 158, §7, 28 PS §381, that the testimony thus obtained is conclusively taken to be true <em>if it is not rebutted by other </em>evidence: <em>Rogan Estate, </em><a href="/pa/404/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="404 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="1301477" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0205-01">404 Pa. 205</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.2d%20177" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="171 A.2d 177">171 A. 2d 177</a> (1961). It may always be contradicted by other testimony and if this is accomplished all of the testimony and the truth thereof is for the jury’s consideration. Under such circumstances, the testimony of the adversary given on cross-examination is not conclusive: <em>Morgan v. Phillips, </em><a href="/pa/385/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="385 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1267089" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0009-01">385 Pa. 9</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%2073" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="122 A.2d 73">122 A. 2d 73</a> (1956) ; <em>Smith v.

Again, this general rule that a party calling his opponent as for cross-examination is concluded by this testimony is subject to the exceptions that there may be such a degree of improbability in the statements themselves as to de<a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>prive them of credit, or that the circumstances themselves may constitute sufficient contradiction: <em>Matthews v.

In short, it is not necessary that the contradiction be in the form of direct testimony: <em>Burke v. Kennedy, </em><a href="/pa/286/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="286 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1096433" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0344-01">286 Pa. 344</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.%20508" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="133 A. 508">133 Atl. 508</a> (1926) ; <em>Bogdanoff v.

    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[146,730,1153,1187]]]'>In the present issue, the proven circumstances involving Iannacone and Scott’s relationship are more than sufficient to render the former’s testimony that Scott was not on his business at the time, or ever employed by him, so incredible as to constitute sufficient contradiction. Further, the proven circumstances are also ample to warrant a finding that the asserted agency existed on the occasion in question. An agent’s actual or apparent authority may be established by circumstantial evidence: <em>Rubin Bros. Waste Co. v. Standard Equipment Co., </em><a href="/pa/368/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="368 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1230367" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0061-01">368 Pa. 61</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20876" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="81 A.2d 876">81 A. 2d 876</a> (1951). The fact or character of an agency may always be established by evidence of the course of dealings between the principal and agent: <em>Culver v. Pocono Spring Water Ice Co., </em><a href="/pa/206/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="206 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="931914" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0481-01">206 Pa. 481</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.%2029" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="56 A. 29">56 Atl. 29</a> (1903) ; <em>Brientnall v.

Finally, the statements of Iannacone to the plaintiff, Norman Piwoz, a few days after the accident patently manifest that he himself recognized Scott as “his man,” and that on the occasion involved Scott was soliciting business for him. The motion for judgment non obstante veredicto was, therefore, correctly overruled.</p>
