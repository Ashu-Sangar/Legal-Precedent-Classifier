A gigantic fraud was perpetrated on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in connection with the construction of a part of the Northeastern Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, for which a number of peoplé were convicted and duly sentenced. Torrance, who was a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission at the time this fraud was committed by others, was convicted with three others for conspiracy.</p>
    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[251,850,1148,477]]]'>The crime of conspiracy for which these defendants were convicted arose principally out of a contract dated February 28, 1955, between the commission and ManuMine. The contract provided for surface support for the right-of-way of the Northeastern Extension of the Turnpike across the anthracite coal regions by the use of slushing material into mine voids underlying the roadway area, which land had been appropriated by the Commission for part of the Northeast Highway.</p>

The Superior Court, in an exhaustive opinion <em>(Commonwealth v. Evans, </em><a href="/pa-super/190/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="190 Pa.

Three of the seven members of the Superior Court strongly dissented. An allocatur was allowed to this Court. This Court in a three line Per Curiam Opinion (which represented the views of four members of this Court) affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, <a href="/pa/399/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="399 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1290542" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0387-01">399 Pa. 387</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20407" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="160 A.2d 407">160 A. 2d 407</a> (April 1960). The present Chief Justice wrote a lengthy dissenting opinion (which was joined in by Mr. Justice Jones), in which he carefully reviewed the evidence, and stated his conviction that <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>the evidence was not sufficient to prove that defendant was guilty of the crime charged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[180,469,1153,1066]]]'>Petitioner relies upon two decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States which were handed down after this Court’s decision in Torrance’s first appeal, namely: <em>Garner v. Louisiana, </em><a href="/citations/?q=30%20U.S.L.W.%204070" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="30 U.S.L.W. 4070">30 U.S.L.W. 4070</a> (Opinion filed on December 11, 1961) and <em>Thompson v. City of Louisville, </em><a href="/us/362/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="362 U.S. 199" data-case-ids="6162984" data-case-paths="/us/362/0199-01">362 U. S. 199</a> (1960). Torrance contends that these decisions demonstrate that he was deprived of due process which is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In our judgment neither of these cases is apposite or controlling. Both are concerned with the <em>complete absence </em>of any evidence to support a conviction. In the <em>Thompson </em>ease, supra, the Court said (page 199) : “The ultimate question presented to us is whether the charges against petitioner were <em>so totally </em>devoid<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">**</a> of evidentiary support as to render his conviction unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Decision of this question turns not on the sufficiency of the evidence, but on whether this conviction rests upon any evidence at all"</em>
