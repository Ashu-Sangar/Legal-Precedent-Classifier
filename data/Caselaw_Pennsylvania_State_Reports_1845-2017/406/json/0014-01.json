Vandergrift, a resident of Pittsburgh, died testate on December 26, 1899, survived by his second wife and five children.\n\u25a0\u25a0 V\u00e1ndergrift\u2019s will \u2014 obviously lawyer-drawn \u2014 provided, inter alia: (1) .the first seven articles dispose of \u2022specific pieces of property and set forth the treatment of claims and advancements which involved the testa\u25a0tor\u2019s relatives and friends; (2) the eighth article provided for legacies, including bequests, of $100,000 to each of testator\u2019s five living children and a large, bequest to testator\u2019s confidant, James I. Buchanan; (3) the ninth article gives \u201cthe rest and residue of [testator\u2019s] estate\u201d.to the executors, in trust,, to \u201ccarry out the provisions and directions\u201d of the will; (4).. the tenth article creates a trust for testator\u2019s only living grandchild whose father predeceased testator; (5) the eleventh article provides the manner of disposition of the residue of the estate; (6) the twelfth article contains administrative provisions; (7) the thirteenth article appoints the executors; (8) the fourteenth article requests testator\u2019s children to counsel with James I. Buchanan. \u25a0. .\n\" Disposition of most of the present appeals depends, i\u00fc large part, on the construction of Article XI which provides, inter alia: \u201cAkticle XI. I will and direct that all- the remainder of the rest and residue of my estate, real,' personal, and mixed, be divided \u25a0 into two parts or portions by my executors, leaving the character of- the property and the amount to be assigned to each portion to the discretion of my executors, and that one portion of such estate be given, transferred, and paid over to James I. Buchanan, my son Samuel H. Yandergrift, my son in law John A. Johnston: and a Trust Company located in the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to be selected by my executors, and that the other portion of said estate be given, transferred and paid over to the said James I. Buchanan, my son Samuel H. and my son in law John A. Johnston and another and different Trust Company located in the said City of Pittsburgh to be selected by my executors, each portion of the said estate to be held by the said James I. Buchanan, Samuel H. Vandergrift, John A. Johnston and the said Trust Company as trustees, in trust to manage and control the same, to invest and keep invested the same, to collect and receive the rents, issues profits and income thereof; and after deducting expenses and reasonable compensation to the said trustees to pay over the net income thereof, as nearly in quarterly payments as may be done, to the following persons for and during the natural life of each, in the proportions following :\n\u201cTo my son Samuel H. Vandergrift the one equal fifth part thereof.\n\u201cTo my son Joseph B. Vandergrift the one equal fifth part thereof.\n\u201cTo my daughter Kate V. Bingham, the one equal fifth part thereof.\n\u201cTo my daughter Henrietta V. Johnston the one equal fifth part thereof.\n\u201cTo my daughter Maggie F. Murphy the one equal fifth part thereof; and upon the death of each of my said sons and daughters, to pay, transfer, deliver and convey the one fifth of the principal of said trust funds or estates freed and discharged from this trust to the child or children of such deceased son or daughter, living at the time of the death of such son or daughter, and the issue, if any, of any deceased child or children. If any of my said sons or daughters shall die leaving but one child to survive him or her, and no issue, of a deceased child, then such child shall receive the whole one fifth of said two trust funds or estates; if any of my said sons or daughters, shall die leaving more than one child to survive him or her, but no issue of a deceased child, then, the said one fifth of said trust funds or estates, shall be divided equally between or among said surviving children share and share alike; if any of my said sons or daughters shall die leaving a child or children and the issue of a deceased child or children surviving him or her, then the said one fifth of said trust funds or estates shall be divided equally among such surviving child or children and the issue of a deceased child or children, the issue of a deceased child, counting as. one in said division and taking the share his, her or their parent would have taken if living.\n\u201cIf any of my said sons or daughters die either before or after my decease without leaving any child or any issue of a deceased child surviving him or her, then, the income from said share shall be paid to his or her surviving brothers and sisters for and during the natural life of each surviving brother and sister, and, upon the death of any one of said surviving brothers and sisters, the share of the principal of the said trust funds or estates to be paid over to the children and issue of children of such deceased surviving brother or sister shall be proportionately increased, that is to say, if any of my said sons or daughters shall so die without leaving any child, or any issue of a deceased child to survive him or her, then the share of the income to be paid to each of my surviving sons and daughters shall be increased to one fourth, and the said share of the principal of said trust funds or estates to be paid over upon the death of any one of such surviving sons, or daughters, to his or her children, and issue of deceased children shall be increased to one fourth and so on.\u201d\nCertain factual background is vital to an understanding of the instant controversy. Kate V. Bingham, a daughter of testator, died April 7, 1900 survived by Helen B. Mercer who is still living. Joseph B. Vandergrift, a son of testator, died May 23, 1915 survived by two sons, J. M. Yandergrift and J. Jay Vandergrift; the former died July 29, 1939 and the latter died October 15, l959. Samuel H. Vandergrift, a sou of testator, died September 21, 1926 survived by Alice V. Gordon.. who is still living. Henrietta V. Johnston, a daughter of testator, died March 28, 1930 survived-by a daughter, Virginia Summerlin Spencer; Virginia Summerlin had two children, George T. Summerlin, Jr., who died October 19, 1934 survived, by a daughter, Virginia S. Sullivan, and John V. Summerlin, who died January 21, 1943 survived by three children, Harriet S. Humphrey, John V. Summerlin, Jr., and Dolores S. Kelchner. Upon the-death of these four children of testator distributions of their respective shares of the principal of the trusts were made by the \u2022 court and the propriety of such distributions is not in question.\nThe last surviving child of Vandergrift, Margaret F. Murphy, died July 3, 1959 \u25a0without issue and her death gave rise to the instant controversy.\nThe Pittsburgh National Bank filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny - County its final account in the trusts set up under Article XI. for Margaret F. Murphy. At the audit three exceptions were filed.to the account) claims of the trustees in bankruptcy and former wife of J. Jay Vandergrift against Ms share, if any, in the estate were presented, and the manner of distribution of the principal of the trusts argued.\nThe auditing judge (Rahauser, J.) dismissed the exceptions filed to the account, determined that no intestacy arose under the trust provisions, sustained the claim of the trustee in bankruptcy to the J. Jay Van-, dergrift share in the estate, dismissed the claim to the J. Jay Vandergrift share in the estate by his former, wife and judgment creditor and directed the distribution of the principal of the trusts \u201cto the children, of the five deceased children of the testator mentioned in Paragraph XI of the Will and to the issue of deceased children of testator\u2019s children, per stirpes\u201d. The court en banc affirmed the conclusions of the auditing judge with one important exception: whereas the auditing judge found that the interests of testator\u2019s various grandchildren and great grandchildren vested on the date of death of Margaret F. Murphy, the court en banc found such interests vested on the date of death of the respective parents of the several grandchildren subject to being divested by the death of Margaret F. Murphy with issue surviving her.\nFrom the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County six appeals were taken.\nThe first and most important question is whether, upon the death of Mrs. Murphy, the remainder interest in this trust fund passed- by way of intestacy or under the terms of the will. Corollary to this question is the problem whether, in the event there is no intestacy, the remainder interest goes to those grandchildren and great grandchildren living when their respective parent or grandparent died or only to such as survived Mrs. Murphy. Solution of these problems depends upon the provisions of the will in its entirety, with particular emphasis upon the terms of Article XI.\nIn Article XI testator created two trusts alike in every respect, except the corporate trustees were to be different. Of the net income from the trusts, \u201cone equal fifth part\u201d was to be paid to each of his five named living children \u201cfor and during the natural life of each\u201d. Testator then provided a scheme of distribution of one fifth of the principal of each fund upon the death of each one of his children and such distribution varied according to the descendants which said child dying should then leave: (1) if one child and no issue of a deceased child or children, the one child would take all; (2) if more than one child and no issue of a deceased child or children, then an equal division between such children; (3) if one child or more than one child and issue of a deceased child or children, then, the one fifth share would go to the child or children and the issue of a deceased child or children, the latter taking per stirpes. Up to this point in the will testator\u2019s intent is clear; he directed a distribution along blood lines, required that the takers be alive when his sons or daughters died, provided equality of distribution and a per stirpital distribution for the issue of any deceased grandchild or grandchildren.\nNext and most important are the provisions for the contingency which might arise if one of - testator\u2019s children \u2014 before or after testator\u2019s death \u2014 should die leaving no child nor issue of a deceased child. In such a contingency, the income from such deceased child\u2019s share was to be paid \u201cto his or her surviving brothers and sisters\u201d for life. Testator then provided that \u201cupon the death of any one of said surviving brothers and sisters, the share of the principal of the said trust funds o\u00ed* estates to be paid over to the children and issue of children of such deceased surviving brother or sister shall be proportionately increased . . . .\u201d Desirous to clarify this clause, testator then stated that in the event any son or daughter died without leaving a child or issue of a deceased child, the share of the income for each of his \u201csurviving\u201d sons and daughters shall be increased to one-fourth and the share of principal likewise increased to one-fourth \u201cand so on\u201d. By the use of the words \u201cand so on\u201d it is clear testator intended to provide the same manner of distribution if more than one of his children died without children or issue of deceased children.\nTwo questions must be resolved: (1) upon the death of Mrs. Murphy, testator\u2019s last surviving child, did an intestacy occur as to the principal of her trust fund?; (2) if not, does the class of takers include only those who survived Mrs. Murphy?\nIn resolving these questions certain well established principles of law must be kept in mind: (1) the intent of the maker of this will must be ascertained by a consideration of the entire will, read in the light of the circumstances surrounding the maker when the will was made: Conlin Estate, 388 Pa. 483, 131 A. 2d 117; Beisgen Estate, 387 Pa. 425, 128 A. 2d 52; Weaver Estate, 390 Pa. 128, 134 A. 2d 675; (2) a will must be so construed, if possible, as to give effect to every word employed by the testator and a construction which renders any of the words nugatory and futile must be rejected: Siple v. Greumelli, 357 Pa. 237, 53 A. 2d 607; Carmany Estate, 357 Pa. 296, 53 A. 2d 731; Collins Estate, 393 Pa. 519, 143 A. 2d 45; Hollenbaugh Estate, 402 Pa. 256, 167 A. 2d 270; (3) there is a presumption that: \u201cOne who writes a will is presumed to intend to dispose of all his estate and not to die intestate as to any portion thereof [citing cases]. If possible to do so, a will must be construed to avoid an intestacy [citing cases]\u201d: Carmany Estate, supra, 357 Pa. 296, 299, 53 A. 2d 731. See also: Grier Estate, 403 Pa. 517, 170 A. 2d 545; Frambes Estate, 382 Pa. 398, 115 A. 2d 165; Lyle Estate, 874 Pa. 344, 97 A. 2d 830. However, in DeSilver\u2019s Estate, 142 Pa. 74, 21 A. 882, we approved the following language of Judge Penrose (pp. 75, 76) : \u201cThe rights conferred by the intestate laws are only taken away by a will which effectually disposes of the entire estate of the decedent; and, while a construction is not to be adopted, if it can be avoided, which will lead to an intestacy, interpretation is never to assume the proportions of reformation\u201d. (Emphasis supplied) Furthermore, as we said in Wainwright Estate, 376 Pa. 161, 165, 166, 101 A. 2d 724: \u201c \u2018. . . there is a presumption testator intends to dispose of his whole estate. Such presumption, however, is met by an equally potent presumption that an heir is not to be disinherited except by plain words or necessary implication. . . . Neither presumption, however, can be permitted to defeat the intention of the testator which is expressed in apt words or appears by clear implication.\u2019 \u201d With these principles in mind we endeavor to ascertain from the language employed in this will the intent of Jacob Vanderg'rift.\nOne thing is self-evident \u2014 testator fully recognized that a contingency might arise in which a son or a daughter might survive him leaving neither a child, children nor issue of a deceased child or children, just as Mrs. Murphy did. It so happened that this contingency arose on the death of the last of testator\u2019s children and at a time when all testator\u2019s other children had long since been dead. That testator contemplated that such a contingency might arise on the death of his last surviving child is evident for he stated \u201cIf any of my said sons and daughters\u201d, etc. He did not state if \u201cany but the last surviving child die\u201d, etc. \u2014 testator\u2019s use of the word \u201cany\u201d included the first to die as well as the last to die.\nWhen. Mrs. Murphy died she had no \u201csurviving\u201d brothers or sisters if the word \u201csurviving\u201d be interpreted as \u201cremaining alive\u201d. Can it then he said that this testator in this carefully drawn will omitted the contingency of the last living child dying without issue or child? We think not. Bearing in mind that by the employment of the word \u201cany\u201d testator clearly contemplated the last to die as well as the first to die, to find an intestacy we must reform the will and remove from the will the devise of the share of the last dying child to brothers and sisters and ascribe to testator the intent to have excluded this contingency if the contingency arose on the death of the last child. We would have to reform this paragraph of the will to read \u201c[i]f any of my said sons and daughters except the last to die\u201d. The only alternative to give effect to that which was clearly the testamentary intent is to read the word \u201csurviving\u201d as \u201cother\u201d and for such construction there is ample precedent.\nIn Lapsley v. Lapsley, 9 Pa. 130, testator devised certain land among his four sons equally, further providing \u201c \u2018if any of my sons should die without issue, their part or portion shall be divided between the surviving brothers ....\u2019\u201d This Court construed the word \u201csurviving\u201d to mean \u201cother\u201d. The Court quoted (p. 131) with approval the following language in 2 Pow. on Dev. 723: \u201cIf . . . property be given to several persons, with a proviso that, in case of the death of any without leaving children at their death, their shares shall go to the survivors, but in the case of the death of any leaving children, then their shares to belong to such children; if one of the devisees die leaving issue, and then another die not leaving children, the share of the latter will go as well'to the surviving objects as to the children of the deceased objects; and, by parity of reasoning, if all the legatees were then dead, leaving children, so that there were in fact no survivors, the children would take the whole\u201d; In Lewis\u2019 Appeal, 18 Pa. 318, testatrix devised certain real estate to a niece for life directing that, after the niece\u2019s death, the real estate should be sold and of the net proceeds she directed that they be divided in a specified manner to her niece\u2019s children. She then provided: \u201cIf one or more of the said children should happen to die before their mother, without leaving any children, the share of such child or children so dying, shall be equally distributed among the survivors of the said brothers and sisters; if, however, such child or children so dying shall leave a child or children, such child or children shall be entitled to their parent\u2019s share\u201d. When the life tenant died only one of her five children was living; two sons had died without issue, one son left two children and one daughter left three children. This Court awarded the shares of the sons who died without issue to the surviving daughter of the life tenant and the children of the deceased brother and sister, the latter taking per stirpes. See also: Bacon\u2019s Estate, 202 Pa. 535, 52 A. 135; Vance\u2019s Estate, 209 Pa. 561, 58 A. 1063.\nIn Fox\u2019s Estate, 222 Pa. 108, 70 A. 954, testator left his residuary estate in trust to pay one quarter of the income to each of his four daughters for life; upon the death of each daughter, one quarter of the principal was to be conveyed to her issue; and if any of his daughters died without leaving issue, the share of the daughter so dying was to be held for the use and benefit of \u201cher surviving sisters\u201d in the same manner as their original shares. Two daughters died with issue and the principal of each such daughter\u2019s original share was distributed to such issue. A third daughter died without issue. The Court held the share of the daughter so dying should be distributed in equal parts between the surviving daughter and the children, per stirpes, of the two daughters who died first. The Court said (p. 113), inter alia: \u201cThat the issue \u201cof a sister dying first should ... be cut off from participation in the share of a sister dying subsequently without issue, would be giving an accidental and irrelevant fact an effect contrary to the manifest general intent. ... As said by the auditing judge below: \u2018It is well settled, however, that the word survivor or surviving, will be understood as the equivalent of \u201cother\u201d, where in any other sense it would lead to an intestacy or to an inequality among those standing in the same degree of relationship to the testator, or to a distribution not in accordance with the general scheme of the will in its entirety he [the testator] did not mean to make shares of any group of his grandchildren dependent on the accident of their mother\u2019s survival of her childless sister. The word \u2018other\u2019 very clearly expresses his general intent and that is the sense in which he used the word \u2018survivors.\u2019 \u201d\nIn Galli\u2019s Estate, 340 Pa. 561, 17 A. 2d 899, parties interested in an estate entered into an agreement whereby the property was placed in trust to pay the income to named nephews and nieces of decedent in equal shares during their lives, with remainders to their children ; if any nephew or niece died without issue in trust \u201cfor the surviving nephews and nieces\u201d and their issue on the same terms. Two nephews died leaving children and then another nephew died without issue. Later the other two life tenants died leaving children. This Court held that the children of the two life tenants who predeceased the life tenant who died without issue were entitled to participate in distribution of the principal of the share of the childless life tenant. All of these authorities construed the word \u201csurviving\u201d as \u201cother\u201d in situations closely apposite to the case at bar.\nAn examination of this will reveals clearly that testator intended an equality of treatment of his children and their children; that the terms of Articles X and XI reveal an intent to restrict so far as possible the distribution of his estate along blood lines; that, by the use of the word \u201cany\u201d, testator intended to include the last child to die as well as the first to die; that testator by the language employed clearly intended a disposition of all his estate by the will; that the construction of \u201csurviving\u201d as \u201cother\u201d is the only manner in which testator\u2019s plan and scheme for the disposition of his property can be effected. Testator did not intend an intestacy to occur; in fact, none has occurred. The court below was correct in its ruling that, upon Mrs. Murphy\u2019s death, no intestacy as to her one fifth equal part of this trust occurred.\nOur next inquiry is whether the interests of the grandchildren and great grandchildren of testator in the principal of this trust vested upon the death of their respective parents \u2014 children of testator \u2014 subject to being divested only if Mrs. Murphy died with issue or whether such interests were contingent, the contingencies being the death of Mrs. Murphy without issue and the survival by the particular grandchild or great grandchildren at the time of Mrs. Murphy\u2019s death. The auditing judge was of the opinion that the class of takers was to be determined as of the date of Mrs. Murphy\u2019s death and that the interest of the takers vested as of that date. The court en banc was of the opinion, relying on Straus Estate, 351 Pa. 136, 40 A. 2d 402, that the interests of the various grandchildren vested on the date of death of the respective parent of the various grandchildren.\nIn Straus, supra, the testator provided for certain trusts for his children for life, the trusts to end upon the death of each life beneficiary and the principal to be distributed to the life beneficiaries\u2019 living' child or children or the issue of a deceased child. The will further provided that if a life beneficiary died without issue such share should become part of the same trust. This particular item of the will reads as follows: \u201c. . . In Trust, during the lifetime of my said children respectively, so that upon the death of each of my said children the principal of their several shares shall , pass undiminished to the living child or children and issue of children-deceased of my .said child sc dying (such issue taking, the share which their , parent would have taken if living) ; but if any of my said children should die without leaving child or children living at the time of their respective deaths, or issue then living of children deceased, then I Direct that the share of such my child so dying shall fall into, the residue of my estate, to be held by my said Executors or Trustees upon the same Trusts and for the same Purposes as I. have directed as to the said residue.\u201d One of testator\u2019s daughters, Sally, died survived by a son, Frederick, who later died leaving four children. Thereafter Laura, another,1 of testator\u2019s daughters died, without issue. The executor of Frederick\u2019s estate claimed a one-fourth portion of the corpus set aside for the life of Laura and .this claim was opposed by Frederick\u2019s four children.. The court held that Frederick\u2019s interest became vested when he survived his mother\u2019s death and therefore awarded the one-fourth portion of the corpus to the executor of Frederick\u2019s estate. Mr. Justice Stearns speaking for this Court stated (pp. 138-139) : \u201cFrederick\u2019s interest in the corpus of the share upon which his mother enjoyed a life estate was contingent.. In order to take, Frederick was required to be living at his mother\u2019s death: Frasier v. Scranton Gas & Water Co., 249, Pa. 570, 95 A. 256; Roop\u2019s Estate, 274 Pa. 117,. 117 A.. 787; Benedict\u2019s Estate, 70 Pa. Superior Ct. 51; When Frederick did survive his mother, his interest in that portion of the trust became vested: Hinkson v. Lees, 181 Pa; 225, 37 A. 338; McGlinn\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 389,. 182 A. 495. While conceding the correctness of these principles, appellants contend that the words of the will clearly indicate testator\u2019s, intent to affix the same contingency to .the accruing share as he. did. to the original one, to wit: the survival of Frederick ..at the death of Laura. We agree agree with Judge Sinkeee, the auditing judge, who said: \u2018Since the trusts for his children were the only trusts created, it is clear that the testator intended the additional share to be treated as though it had formed part of the original residuary estate. The use of the phrase \u201cthen I direct\u201d does not change a vested interest into a contingent interest. The word \u2018then\u2019 is used in this will as a conjunction meaning \u2018in that event\u2019, not as an adverb meaning \u2018at that time.\u2019 [Frederick] had a vested interest in the Laura Straus Hibbs share subject only to being divested by the birth of issue to her.\u2019 See Packer\u2019s Estate (No. 2), 246 Pa. 116, 92 A. 70; Neel\u2019s Estate, 252 Pa. 394, 97 A. 502; Wheaton Coal Co. v. Harris, 288 Pa. 294, 135 A. 637; McGlinn\u2019s Estate, supra.\u201d\nWe believe that Straus is most apposite to the present situation. From an examination of this will, particularly Article XI, we are of the opinion that those grandchildren and great grandchildren who were alive at the time of the death of their respective parents or grandparent received a vested interest in the one-fifth equal part of the trusts created for Margaret F. Murphy for life, subject to being divested however if at the time of Mrs. Murphy\u2019s death she died with issue. In summary, upon the death of Mrs. Murphy without issue an intestacy did not occur: on the contrary, when Mrs. Murphy\u2019s brothers and sisters died each of the descendants of such brothers and sisters alive at the time of such deaths received a vested interest subject to being divested only if Mrs. Murphy died with issue.\nThree of these appeals attack the reasonableness and propriety of the trustee\u2019s counsel fee and the trustee\u2019s commission allowed by the court below and seek to surcharge the trustee for $65,554.48, the amount of a capital gains tax which, it is alleged, the trustee needlessly incurred.\nThe attack on the $10,000 counsel fee is two-fold: (1) that it is excessive and (2) that counsel\u2019s services upon which the fee is based included not only settlement of the trust estate but also representation of the trustee in garnishment proceedings instituted by Marjorie Holmes Vandergrift.\nIn Good\u2019s Estate, 150 Pa. 307, 310, 24 A. 623, we stated: \u201cThe amount of fees to be allowed to counsel, always a subject of delicacy if not difficulty, is one peculiarly within the discretion of the court of first instance. Its opportunities of judging the exact amount of labor, skill and responsibility involved, as well as its knowledge of the rate of professional compensation usual at the time and place, are necessarily greater than ours, and its judgment should not be interfered with except for plain error.\u201d\nInitially, it is urged that this $10,000 fee exceeds the Allegheny County minimum fee bill in respect to services rendered by an attorney to a trustee; such fact, however, does not per se make excessive the present counsel fee for that fee bill sets the minimum, not the maximum, fee to be charged and the amount of counsel fees must be based, as always, on the character and extent of the services rendered as well as the responsibility involved. Furthermore, it is contended that some of the services for which counsel has charged were in connection with several proceedings wherein the trustee was named as garnishee and that such services should be charged only against the share of the distributee involved and not against the trust estate. With that contention we disagree. In Kutz v. Nolan, 224 Pa. 262, 265, 266, 73 A. 555, we said: \u201cA garnishee who is a trustee under a valid deed of trust is not a mere stakeholder, nor simply a debtor or one who has in his possession the property of the defendant. He has possession of the property by virtue of his legal title thereto. He is charged with active duties with regard to it and is responsible not only to the defendant, but to the other beneficiaries named in the deed of trust. It is, therefore, incumbent upon him to preserve and protect the property for all the beneficiaries, and to administer it strictly in compliance with the terms of the trust. Failing to perform this duty he is liable for any injury sustained by any person beneficially interested. (Emphasis supplied) .... A bona fide creditor of the cestui que trust, enforcing payment of a valid judgment, may subject the trust estate to the payment of his debt; but this he can only do by due process of law. If the trustee fail to compel the creditor to proceed in a regular and legal way to enforce his claim against the estate, he is liable to the interested parties who have been injured by his negligent conduct. The failure of the trustee in this respect subjects him to the same consequences as if he permit the estate to be dissipated or lost in any other illegal way or by any other illegal means . . . There are other interests than those of the cestui que trust in the fund attached which are affected by enforcement of the attachment execution, and it is the duty of the trustee to protect those interests and not permit them to suffer by reason of any action of the cestui que trust.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) See also: Musser's Estate, 341 Pa. 1, 7, 17 A. 2d 411. In the case at bar, it was the duty of the trustee to actively take part in the garnishment proceedings; in the performance of that duty, services rendered by the trustee\u2019s counsel enured to the benefit of all the beneficiaries of the trust fund and the trust should bear the cost of such services. We find in the approval of this $10,000 counsel fee by the court below neither an abuse of discretion nor an error of law.\nNext, the trustee\u2019s $35,000 commission is challenged on the ground that, since the trustee liquidated the trust assets and thereby incurred a capital gains tax of approximately $65,000 instead of distributing such assets in kind, the trustee should be penalized by depriving it of a commission, in whole or in part. For an understanding of the trustee\u2019s action certain factual data must be considered: (1) a letter dated July 10, 1959 to the trustee from New York counsel of Alice B. Gordon inquired whether a judicial accounting was necessary; (2) a letter dated August 18, 1959 to the trustee from New York counsel of Helen B. Mercer inquired when the trustee\u2019s account would be completed and available, whether the trustee contemplated a court accounting or an amicable accounting between the parties and \u201cwhether the trust assets are such that a portion of the corpus could be distributed in kind\u201d; (3) a letter dated October 1, 1959 to the trustee from counsel for Helen Mercer stated she \u201cwould prefer to have the bulk of her share distributed in kind, if this is feasible\u201d and requested a list of securities in the trust \u201cwith their Federal income tax costs\u201d. On September 16, 1959, counsel for the trustee submitted a written opinion in which he advised the trustee that, under the circumstances existing in connection with the termination of the trust, the trustee would \u201cmost properly discharge [its] responsibilities by converting the assets of the estate into cash\u201d. When these securities of the trust were sold in October 1959 a gross long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes of $258,-217.91 was realized upon which a tax of $65,554.48 was paid. It is now urged the securities should not have been sold but distributed in kind and that, had this been done, the tax would have been avoided.\nOrdinarily, the request of distributees to receive in kind the assets of a trust or an estate must be honored if the sale of such assets \u201cis not reasonably necessary to pay debts or to make distribution\u201d: Minichello Estate, 368 Pa. 639, 644, 84 A. 2d 511. However, such a rule must yield to the exigencies of the particular situation which exists in the trust or estate. In the instant trust, a very serious question was presented to the trustee in the construction of this will, particularly Article XI; until that question could be determined by the court neither the identity of nor the share of the ultimate distributees of the corpus of that trust should be known. In addition, part, if not all, of the share of one possible distributee might be subject to the claim of his creditors. Faced with this situation, the trustee sought the advice of its counsel. The record indicates that the trustee fully considered its counsel\u2019s advice and the possibility of a capital gains tax and then, after a thorough and independent study of all possible angles involved in this situation, concluded that the ultimate best interests of the possible trust beneficiaries required a liquidation and conversion into cash of the securities forming part of the corpus of the trust. Our review of the record supports the opinion of the court below that \u201cthe trustee followed the only prudent course\u201d and is not subject to surcharge. Jones Estate, 400 Pa. 545, 162 A. 2d 408, relied on by these appellants, is not presently apposite. The action of the court below in allowing a $35,000 commission to the trustee is affirmed.\nLastly, does the interest of J. Jay Vandergrift, vested on the death of Joseph B. Yandergrift, subject to being divested on Mrs. Murphy\u2019s death with issue surviving, go to his former wife, an attaching creditor, or to his trustee in bankruptcy?\nWe believe the auditing judge in his opinion correctly and adequately resolved this question: \u201cThe attachment execution creditor contends that her attachment has priority over the claim of the party in bankruptcy. She contends that her claim as an attachment execution creditor is based on an obligation that is not discharged under Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act. She contends in addition that the Bankruptcy Act did not contemplate that the proceeding would be open indefinitely and that the proceeding in bankruptcy could not be held open for 22 years, in order to collect, reduce to money, and distribute this estate. She contends also that the valuation of the debtor\u2019s property in the Bankruptcy Act means the amount of property that can be made available for payment of debt within a reasonable period of time from the inception of the bankruptcy proceeding, citing Syracuse Engineering Co. v. Haight, 110 F. 2d 468.\n\u201cThe Court is of the opinion the case last cited is not applicable here, and that whatever interest J. Jay Yandergrift had in this trust estate passed to his Trustee in Bankruptcy on April 20, 1938. The trustee of this trust estate was properly notified of the interest of the Trustee in Bankruptcy, November 22, 1938. This action was taken prior to any action that was commenced by the attachment execution creditor.\n\u201cJ. Jay Yandergrift had a transmissible interest in the Trust Estate created under Section XI of the Will of Jacob J. Vandergrift. The principle applicable here is set forth in Brooke\u2019s Estate, 214 Pa. 46.\n\u201cIn Brooke\u2019s Estate, 214 Pa. 46, 63 A. 411 (1906), the testator left his real estate in trust for his daughter, Emeline, for life with remainder to her surviving children and in default of such child or children then to testator\u2019s daughter, Sarah. Sarah predeceased Emeline, leaving Emeline and a brother as her only heirs at law. Emeline had one child who survived Sarah, but predeceased Emeline. The trustee petitioned under the Price Act to sell real estate. Emeline and her brother joined in the petition. The residuary heirs under testator\u2019s will objected to the .sale on the ground that Sarah never took an interest in the real estate because she predeceased Emeline\u2019s child and the remainder fell into the residuary estate. The Court held that Sarah\u2019s remainder may have been technically contingent, but it was nevertheless transmissible and passed to her heirs at law \u2014 her sister, Emeline, and her brother. The lower court (affirmed per curiam by the Supreme Court) said at page 48: \u2018But the distinction [between contingent and vested subject to being divested] is of little importance, since the chief difference between a vested remainder and one that is contingent is that the latter may be destroyed by determination of the particular estate before the happening of the contingency . . . while a vested remainder would simply be accelerated; and unless the contingency is one which affects the capacity to take, a contingent remainder or Other contingent interest is transmissible, even though not, in the technical sense, vested: Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 118; . . . Upon this subject the law is thus stated by Chancellor Kent: \u201cIt is well settled that all contingent interests of inheritance . . . where the person who is to take is certain, are transmissible by descent and are devisable and assignable.\u201d \u2019\n\u201cThe interest here of J. Jay Vandergrift being a transmissible interest passed to the Trustee in Bankruptey. Dickson Estate, 396 Pa. 371, is a case in which many of the facts were similar to those presently before the Court. The opinion of the Court is recited to show that there the Court had no hesitation in stating that the interest of the bankrupt passed to the Trustee in Bankruptcy.\n\u201cThe pertinent part of the opinion is stated on page 372 and page 373 as follows: \u2018The life tenant, Arthur G. Dickson, died on March 17, 1957. Samuel Dickson\u2019s testamentary trustees thereafter filed a final account, at the audit of which Arthur\u2019s executor claimed that his estate was entitled to part of the principal by virtue of an intestacy which occurred because five of the seven nieces of testator\u2019s wife who survived the testator predeceased Arthur. The Orphans\u2019 Court dismissed this claim, and correctly held (1) that all seven nieces of testator\u2019s wife who were living at the death of the testator were entitled to take under his will; (2) that there is no intestacy; and (3) that in any event Arthur\u2019s executor had no interest in the estate because of Arthur\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding in 1982.\u2019\n\u201cIn Dickson Estate, 378 Pa. 48, 105 A. 2d 156, Arthur G. Dickson claimed at the audit of the Fourth Account of the trustee under the will of Samuel Dickson, his father, that he was entitled to four-sevenths of the principal of the trust because an intestacy arose by virtue of a combination of two facts \u2014 (1) at 79 years of age and in his physical condition he was unable to have any children or issue, and four of the nieces of his father\u2019s wife who were living at the time of testator\u2019s death had since died. This Court dismissed these contentions and said, inter alia (pages 49, 51) : \u2018. . . Dickson no longer has a life estate ....\n\u201c \u2018Dickson went into bankruptcy in 1932. The trustee in bankruptcy sold at public auction all the right, title and interest of the bankrupt under the will of his father, Samuel Dickson, including his Ufe estate in the net income therefrom.\u2019\n:-.:\u201cThe-Banla\u2018uptcy Act of July 1, 1898, 30 State at-E: 54J,, in- effect :on-the. date.

Pour of these children predeceased him; of the four children, only one, Benjamin W. \u25a0 Vandergrift, left issue, a daughter \u2014 then not less than nine years old \u2014 named Henrietta Vandergrift, later Henrietta V. McKay. She was Vandergrift\u2019s only living grandchild when he made his will on December 1, 1898. Of his second marriage, no children were born.\nWhen John M. Vandergrift died he was survived by his second wife, Norma L. Vandergrift who later married one George Dixon. Norma later died and her husband, i.e., the husband of the second wife of J. M. Vandergrift, claims a part of this estate.\nIn 1928, J. J. Vandergrift and bis wife, Marjorie Holmes .Vandergrift, were divorced; the latter is a judgment creditor and lias issued two foreign' attachments and an attachment execution' upon these judgments totalling $184,584.60, naming as garnishees the trustee of the Jacob Vandergrift estate. -In 1938, j. J\u00e1y Vandergrift went into bankruptcy' and was later discharged. The. trustee in, bankruptcy claims the share of J. Jay Vandergrift, if any, in the Jacob Vandergrift estate.\nDolores S. Kelchner was an adopted child. The court below held she was not entitled to share in this estate; from that ruling no appeal was taken.\nThese exceptions filed on behalf of Alice V. Gordon and - Helen Mercer, only living grandchildren of testator, questioned the $10,000 fee of trustee\u2019s counsel, the $35,000' commission of the trustee- and sought to surcharge the trustee for $65,000, the- amount of a capital gains tax arising from the post-mortem sale by the trustee of the securities in the trust.\nFor the sake of convenience we summarize these appeals.\nAppeal 121 was taken by Marjorie Holmes Vandergrift; sbe \u2022takes the position that the interest in this trust fund of J. M. Vandergrift was contingent upon his survival of Mrs. Murphy and, since he predeceased her, no interest passed to his estate, but instead the entire one fourth interest went to J. Jay Vandergrift who survived Mrs. Murphy; moreover, since the interest of J. Jay Vandergrift during Mrs. Murphy\u2019s lifetime was contingent it never passed to the trustee in bankruptcy and is now subject to her attachments.\nAppeal 129 was taken by the executors of Henrietta V. McKay whose, father predeceased testator. They take the position that, as to the remainder interest in this trust fund,- testator died intestate and, therefore, this estate shares to -the extent of a one fifth interest in the fund.\nAppeal 133 was taken by the executrix of J. Jay Vandergrift. She takes the position that the remainder interest vested at the -time of Mrs. Murphy\u2019s death in the then living grandchildren and the then living issue of testator\u2019s deceased grandchildren and, therefore, in 1938 J. Jay Vandergrift did not have when he became bankrupt such an interest as would pass by operation of law to his trustee in bankruptcy.\nAppeal 184 was taken by the administrator of Prances G. Vandergrift, deceased second wife of testator. He takes the position that testator died intestate as to the remainder interest of this fund.\nAppeals 131, 138 and 139 were taken by Alice Gordon and Helen Mercer, testator\u2019s only living grandchildren, and Virginia S. Sullivan, a great, great grandchild. In addition to attacking the counsel fee and trustee\u2019s commission and seeking to surcharge the trustee, they take the position that there was no intestacy but that the court en banc erred in not ruling that only those descendants .of the children named in Article XI who were living when Mrs. Murphy died could take the remainder interest.\nIf -there was an intestacy, the share which would go to the estate of testator\u2019s second wife might have been forfeited -by the pre-marriage settlement referred to in Article III of the will or by the release signed by her on June -4, 1901. By- the same token, if there is an -intestacy, two great grandchildren of testator- \u2014 daughters of Henrietta McKay would take, whereas otherwise they would not.\nThe determination of this question \u25a0 is particularly important -to the.J. M. Vandergrift estate, the J. Jay Vandergrift-estate, Alice Gordon, Helen Mercer and Virginia Sullivan.\nSee also: Broum\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 19, 30, 21 A. 2d 898; Berkowitz\u2019s Estate (No. 2), 344 Pa. 485, 486, 26 A. 2d 295; Ward Estate, 350 Pa. 144, 38 A. 2d 50.\nSee also: Huffman Estate (No.3), 349 Pa. 59, 64, 36 A. 2d 640,\nTo this trustee replied that a judicial accounting was necessary.\nCounsel was notified by the trustee on October 7, 1959 that distribution of the trust assets would have to be made by the court, \u25a0that it was possible an intestacy might result, that the share of one of the probable distributees had been attached and that the trustee was proceeding' with the liquidation of the investments and preiraring to file an account.\nTo this the trustee replied that questions of distribution had arisen which must be submitted for court determination and that, under 'the circumstances, the trustee considered it necessary to liquidate the investments and that the trustee was \u201cnow proceeding with such liquidation.\u201d\nWhere a fiduciary acts upon the advice of counsel, such fact is \u201ca factor to be considered in determining good faith, but is not a blanket of immunity in all circumstances\u201d: Borden Trust, 358 Pa. 138, 143, 56 A. 2d 108; Corr Estate, 358 Pa. 591, 600, 58 A. 2d 847.

        "text": "Concurring-And Dissenting Opinion by\nMb.- Chief Just\u00edce Bell-:\nWe -have'-repeatedly- said-that' a Court has'no right to rewrite a^ testator\u2019s will. It is not what w\u00e9 think t\u00e9st\u00e1t'\u00f3\u00ed should' have said, dr\" whaf we think he would have-: said if h\u00e9 had foreseen the present situation, or even what the'Court thinks he meant to say \u2014 it is what iS the meaning of his words: Althouse Estate, 404 Pa. 412, 172 A. 2d 146; Cannistra Estate, 384 Pa. 605, 121 A. 2d 157; Sowers Estate, 383 Pa. 566, 119 A. 2d 60; Britt Estate, 369 Pa. 450, 87 A. 2d 243.\nBarely will one find a testamentary trust whose dispositive provisions are a:s minutely and aptly drawn. For example, in Article XI, which relevantly is the most important provision, testator gave the net income from one equal fifth part of his residuary trust estate to (each Of his five named children which included) Maggie for life and then specifically provided that upon her death the (l/5th of the) principal shall be paid to Maggie\u2019s child or children living at her death, and the issue, if any, Of any of her deceased child or children. He then clearly and specifically provided that (1) if any of his said sons or daughters, i.e., Maggie, shall die leaving but one child to survive her and no issue of a deceased child, then such child shall receive the whole one-fifth of the principal; (2) if Maggie shall die leaving more than one child to survive her, but no issue of a deceased child, then the said one-fifth shall be divided equally between said surviving children, share and share alike; (3) if* Maggie shall die leaving a child or children, and the issue of a deceased child or children surviving her, then the said One-fifth shall be divided equally among such surviving child or children and the issue of a deceased child or children, the issue of a deceased child counting as one in said division and taking the share his, her or their parent would have taken if living.\nJust try to substitute the word \u201cother\u201d for the word \u201csurviving\u201d, as the majority opinion advocates, and the result is a conglomeration of meaningless language.\nThen there follows the gift which gives rise to the present appeal. Testator provided: \u201cIf any of my said sons or daughters [Maggie] die either before or after my . decease without leaving any child or any issue of a deceased child surviving him or her [as occurred in this case], then, the income from said share shall be paid to his or her surviving brothers and sisters [there were none] for and during the natural life of each surviving brother and sister [there were hone] and, upon the death of any one of said surviving brothers and sisters [there were none], the share of the principal of the said trust funds or estates to be paid over to the children and issue of children of such deceased surviving brother or sister shall he proportionally increased, that is to say, if any of my said sons or daughters shall so die without leaving any child, or any issue of a deceased child to survive him of her, then the share of the income to he paid to each of my surviving sons and daughters shall he increased to one-fourth, and the said share of the principal of said trust funds or estates to be paid over upon the death of any one of such surviving sons, or daughters, to his or her children, and issue of deceased children shall be increased to one-fourth and so on.\u201d\nHow can we interpret the word \u201csurviving\u201d in this gift to mean \u201cother\u201d when in this and in every other part of his will testator clearly meant \u201csurviving\u201d when he said \u201csurviving\u201d, and \u201cthen living\u201d when he meant \u201cthen living\u201d, and \u201cto survive him or her\u201d when he meant \u201cto survive him or her.\u201d Testator used the word \u201csurvive\u201d several times, and he used the word \u201csurviving\u201d ten times, and in each instance he clearly and accurately demonstrated that he knew and meant what he said, viz: \u201csurvive\u201d meant \u201csurvive\u201d, and \u201csurviving\u201d meant \u201csurviving\u201d \u2014 it didn\u2019t mean \u201cother\u201d, or anything except \u201csurviving\u201d.\nThe one contingency which, testator did not foresee and provide for happened, namely, the death of his last surviving child, Maggie, without leaving a child or issue, or even a brother or sister surviving her. To interpret the word \u201csurviving\u201d as \u201cother\u201d is impose sible, unless we ignore of distort his clear language and rewrite his will.\nThe majority opinion, ignoring the clear and apt language of Vandergrift\u2019s will, gives this trust principal not to the--living'but to grandchildren'and great grandchildren.-who survive not Maggie, but testator\u2019s-sons, or;daughters-respectively even though--they are dead at;Maggie\u2019s,death.-,.The-Court--bases.-its interpre-. tation- andconclusion: on.-the scheme .of testator\u2019s- will.The-scheme-pf'-testatpr\u2019s-will-.does not rebut but on-the. contrary confirms his clear and- apt.language.- A care-, ful examination- of.- testator\u2019s minutely .drawn will quickly discloses--that..upon-the.-death of eaclmof his. Children, as well .as-upon tlie-happening of-a particular-event, he. gavehis income or principal (as the case may be)-not. to the; dead-.but to the- then living, i\n-The majority invoke the presumption- against' intestacy, but. there is another presumption of equal force and effect,namely; the presumption that an heir is not to be disinherited except- by:plain words or necessary-implication; \"and'When'both can apply they offset each other: Conlin Estate, 388 Pa. 48-3, 492, 131 A. 2d 117; Beisgen Estate, 387 Pa. 425, 128 A. 2d 52; Bigony Estate, 397 Pa. 102, 152 A. 2d 901: The truth of'the matter is, \u25a0 irrespective of the aforesaid presumptions,, that nearly everyone abhors an intestacy and conscious-' ly or unconsciously seeks to avoid'it, and this is espe-' dally true where'as here testator \u25a0 undoubtedly wished tb \u00bfdispose by'\u25a0 will of \u2018his -entire estate.' But' similar cases freq\u00fc\u00e9ntly arise where\" this Court has held that' an' intestacy exists' even though- testator -unquestionably intended to dispose by will'of his entire estate. Many examples ebuld-ber- given, but one or two simple ones will suffice.': A husband with no issue leaves- all-Ms-property- to-his wife, his wife'predeceases-.him; .a' widow leaves everything to her child-or children, they predecease her without leaving-issue ; or a testator-intending to bequeath and-devise his entire estate creates a residuary estate which violates the rule againstperpetuities,' .Or gives his residuary: estate to -charity within 39 days. of -his \u2022 death. We cannot, just in - order; ,to avoid an intestacy, ignore the clear apt language of Vandergrift\u2019s will and distort \u201csurviving\u201d to Me\u00e1n \u201cother5\u2019 when he many times'clearly showed'that-'-was not- his meaning or intent. This :i A especially so: when distorting his language would result in disinheriting some of his heirs.- ' \u2022 \u2022\n:.... Considering the plain and -unambiguous language of bis entire will, it is clear that in the situation which has arisen testator failed to dispose of this one-fifth \u25a0Share of' his residuary trust estate and consequently as to this share he died intestate and the principal, goes to his next of kin under the intestate law\u2019s.'\nWith respect to (a) the'counsel fee and (b) the trustee\u2019s .commission and (e)' the claim off the trustee in bankruptcy, I agree with the majority opinion.\nAny of Ms said sons or daughters, i.e.\nItalics throughout, ours.",
