        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThe narrow question this appeal presents is; Whether or not the lower court abused its legal discretion in refusing to remove a judgment of non pros? We conclude it did not.\nThe action involved sought recover^ of damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered by the plaintiff when struck by an automobile owned by the defendant, Jacqueline Deutsch, and operated by an employee of the defendant, Eglin\u2019s of Philadelphia, Inc. The accident occurred on May 23, 1958. Suit was instituted by the issuance of a summons on July 23, 1958. The defendant Eglin\u2019s ruled plaintiff to file a complaint on August 22, 1958. The plaintiff served interrogatories on defendant Deutsch, on September 17, 1958. Defendant Deutsch responded to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories by filing preliminary objections raising questions of jurisdiction, venue and service. No action on these objections followed until January 23, 1961. The plaintiff never filed his complaint, Defendant Eglin\u2019s entered a judgment of non pros on December 4, 1958.\nMore than two years later, on December 29, 1960, plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a petition to remove the non pros, alleging that because of incorrect notations inadvertently made in plaintiff-counsel\u2019s office control system, it was erroneously assumed that the complaint had been filed. The lower court refused the request. This appeal followed.\nThe relief sought of the court below was by way of grace and not of right. Its grant or refusal was within the discretion of that tribunal. On appeal, we may not reverse unless there was a clear abuse of discretion: Pinsky v. Master, 343 Pa. 451, 23 A. 2d 727 (1942).\nThe court below predicated its refusal to grant the relief requested on the ground that the application was not made with reasonable promptness and because of the absence of compelling equities. As pointed out in Baraonfski v. Malone, 371 Pa. 479, 91 A. 2d 908 (1952), although a court has the power to open a default judgment after the expiration of the term in which it was entered, the application for that purpose must be made without unreasonable delay or else the relief sought is barred by laches.\nThe matter presented was peculiarly for the lower court\u2019s decision and the record does not disclose an abuse of legal discretion.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.",
