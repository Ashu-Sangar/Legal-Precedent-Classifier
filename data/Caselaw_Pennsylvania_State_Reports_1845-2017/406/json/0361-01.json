Philips. For the years 1959, 1960 and 1961 the original trustee by resolution provided that the net income in each of those years should be equally divided between 2 and 3 and 4 respective recipients. The Orphans\u2019 Court agreed with the substituted trustees that a construction of decedent\u2019s will was a matter for the Court and that its construction would prevail over any construction by a trustee. The Court then correctly concluded that it was the testatrix\u2019s intention, as expressed in her will, that the annual scholarship award shall consist of the net income for that year and that amount should be paid to. the award recipient for that year.\nThe order is affirmed on the memorandum opinion of President Judge van Roden; each party to pay their respective costs.\nItalics ours.",
