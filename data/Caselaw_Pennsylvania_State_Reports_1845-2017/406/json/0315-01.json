        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nAt approximately 8:10 p.m. on October 30, 1948, Lester A. Gibson and Loretta A. Gibson, his wife, were travelling south in an automobile on Route 68 toward Butler, Pa. Proceeding north on the same highway toward Chicora, Pa. was a pick-up truck operated by Edward Bruner, aged 26 years. At a point on Route 68 approximately seven miles north of Butler the two motor vehicles met in a head-on collision in the southbound lane of traffic. As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, Mr. Gibson died on December 18, 1948 and Mrs. Gibson received serious and permanent injuries.\nAt the time of the accident Edward Bruner was visibly intoxicated. There is little, if any, doubt that he was responsible for this tragic occurrence.\nIn the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County, Mrs. Gibson, as administratrix of her deceased husband\u2019s estate, instituted a survival and wrongful death action and, in her own right, an action for her injuries. The defendants were Edward Bruner, driver of the truck; Hilliard Lumber Company (Company), the owner of the truck; Bernard Bruner, Edward Bruner\u2019s father and an employee of the Company into whose possession and control the Company had delivered the truck.\nAll actions came to trial before the Honorable Clyde Shumaker and a jury. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the court granted a compulsory nonsuit as to the Company. At the close of the trial the jury awarded three verdicts against both Edward Bruner and Bernard Bruner; a verdict in favor of Mrs. Gibson, in her own right, of $13,500, verdicts in favor of Mrs. Gibson, as administratrix, of $2500 in the survival action and $5000 in the wrongful death action. After motions for removal of the nonsuit, new trial and judgment n.o.v. by the respective parties, the court below refused to take off the compulsory nonsuit and entered judgment for the Company, entered judgment n.o.v. in favor of Bernard Bruner and judgment on the verdict against Edward Bruner.\nMrs. Gibson then filed one appeal (No. 65 March Term 1961) to this Court from the judgments entered. During oral argument, Mrs. Gibson\u2019s counsel was reminded that the single appeal was incapable of bringing up for review more than one judgment (Frailey Town ship School District v. Schuylkill Mining Company, 361 Pa. 557, 560, 64 A. 2d 788; Dommes v. Zuroski, 350 Pa. 206, 207, 38 A. 2d 73; Jordan v. Eisele, 273 Pa. 95, 98, 116 A. 675). Rather than quash the appeal, counsel was requested to choose which judgment he desired the Court to determine; he then chose the judgment for Bernard Bruner. Hence, we consider this appeal solely in connection with the entry of judgment n.o.v. in favor of Bernard Bruner and the judgment in favor of the Company remains undisturbed.\nIt is the position of Mrs. Gibson that there is sufficient evidence on this record from which the jury could find that Bernard Bruner was negligent in permitting his son, Edward Bruner, to use and operate the Company\u2019s truck, well knowing that he was intoxicated at the time. It is Bernard Bruner\u2019s contention that the record lacks any facts upon which liability on his part could be predicated. We must, therefore, examine the record to ascertain whether Bernard Bruner gave his adult son permission to take and operate the truck with knowledge that at the time Edward Bruner was intoxicated and not in condition to safely operate the truck.\nOn the afternoon of October 30, 1948, it was necessary that Bernard Bruner, in the course of his employment as the Company\u2019s sub-foreman, proceed to Butler to pick up in the Company\u2019s truck certain supplies needed at a construction project near Deshon, located outside Butler. Edward Bruner, who worked at the Butler Iron Company in Butler and was an across-the-road neighbor of his father, asked his father if he could accompany him to Butler to pick up his pay check to which request the father acceded. After picking up the supplies and pay check, both Bruners proceeded to the Deshon project. It was raining and, after unloading the supplies, Bernard Bruner volunteered to drive one Salwash and Kline, workmen at the project, to their respective homes. Enroute the foursome stopped at a tavern where, according to Bernard Brnner, he had two glasses of beer and his son one or two bottles of beer. Bernard Bruner then drove Salwash to his home and the remaining trio went to Kline\u2019s home. Enroute and at Kline\u2019s insistence, a stop was made at a beer distributors\u2019s place of business where Kline purchased a case of beer. They then proceeded to Kline\u2019s home which was approximately a mile from Bernard Bruner\u2019s home. Bernard Bruner parked the truck near Kline\u2019s home, leaving the keys in the ignition. The trio then entered Kline\u2019s home where they remained for some time.\nBernard Bruner testified that, while at Kline\u2019s home, he had one bottle of beer and his son, Edward Bruner, one, or, possibly two, bottles of beer. Edward Bruner stated they had a \u201ccouple of beers\u201d.\nAt approximately 5:30 p.m. Edward Bruner took the truck and proceeded to Chicora, via Butler. Edward Bruner stopped at two taverns in Butler, and, according to his testimony, had a bottle of beer in each tavern and purchased 12 bottles of beer which he put in the truck. Two hours and forty minutes after leaving Kline\u2019s home and 21 miles therefrom, this tragic accident occurred.\nAt trial, Corporal Poloskey, a state policeman, stated that Edward Bruner had told him that he had been given permission to use the truck. In the course of his investigation, this officer questioned Bernard Bruner and, according to the officer\u2019s testimony, Bernard Bruner said \u201cthat the boy took it without his permission. He told him to take it [the truck] home and leave it there\u201d. (Emphasis supplied)\nAt trial, both Bruners denied making these statements to the officer and both testified the truck was taken without the permission of Bernard Bruner. According to Bernard Bruner, he had no knowledge that the truck had been taken by his son until Kline, who had gone with Edward Bruner to an outside toilet, returned and told him the son had taken the truck. Bernard Bruner, surprised his son had taken the truck, testified he did nothing about it at the time assuming the son would drive it to his, Bernard Bruner\u2019s, home and leave it at that place. About 15 minutes after the truck was taken, Bernard Bruner went to his home and discovered the truck was not there. About 6:30 p.m. he reported to the state police that the truck was missing and, later in the evening, called his employer informing him what had taken place. Bernard Bruner was informed later that evening of the accident by Corporal Poloskey.\nIn passing upon this appeal, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to Mrs. Gibson. So viewing the evidence, we reject the version of taking possession of the truck as related by both Bruners and accept the version of Corporal Poloskey that Edward Bruner took the truck with the permission of Bernard Bruner. In so doing, Ave must also accept Corporal Poloskey\u2019s testimony that the permission was not general but expressly restricted, \u201ctake it home and leave it there\u201d. Granting full acceptance to such testimony, the undisputed fact is that Edward Bruner did not take the truck to his father\u2019s home but proceeded to Chicora and was 21 miles from his father\u2019s home when the accident occurred. Such conduct constituted a substantial deviation from the authorized and permitted use and the record is clear that Avhen the accident occurred EdAvard Bruner was clearly on a frolic of his OAvn. See: Exner v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, 402 Pa. 473, 167 A. 2d 703 and cases therein cited.\nUnder such uncontradicted facts Bernard Bruner would not be liable for Ms son\u2019s transgressions unless he knew when he permitted Edward Bruner to take the truck that, by reason of intoxication, he was unfit to drive the truck or, by reason of such condition, he would or might disregard the instructions to take the truck home and instead take the truck elsewhere and continue drinking. Unfortunately for Mrs. Gibson, the record does not indicate any such evidence. The only evidence upon which Mrs. Gibson can rely to supply this necessary proof is Bernard Bruner\u2019s testimony that he called the state police because \u201c. . . he [Edward Bruner] wasn\u2019t in condition\u201d. Standing alone, such testimony might support Mrs. Gibson\u2019s position. However, an examination of this statement indicates that it is taken out of context. Eight questions later Mrs. Gibson\u2019s counsel clarified the situation: \u201cQ. How much of your concern was due to the fact that you knew [Edward] had been drinMng? A. He wasn\u2019t drinMng that much as far as that\u2019s concerned when he left there, now, after that what happened, I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there\u201d. There is no evidence that when Edward Bruner left his father\u2019s presence in Kline\u2019s home he was intowicated or not in a condition to drive a motor vehicle.\nThe burden was upon Mrs. Gibson, seeking to impose liability on Bernard Bruner, to prove that when Edward Bruner left Kline\u2019s home he was not in a condition to operate a motor vehicle. This she failed to prove. Mrs. Gibson relied for such proof upon Bernard Bruner and his testimony falls far short of proving his son was intoxicated at the time permission to operate the truck was given. Had she sought such proof from Kline or the bartenders and patrons of the taverns in Butler she might have sustained her burden of proof.\nThere is not the slightest doubt that at 8:10 p.m.\u2014 two hours and forty minutes after he left his father\u2019s presence \u2014 Edward Bruner was visibly intoxicated, yet as the court below stated, . . there is not one scintilla of evidence that he was such when he left the presence of his father. Indeed, the positive evidence is to the contrary on this point.\u201d There was testimony that up until 5:30 p.m. when he left his father\u2019s presence he had four bottles of beer. Such testimony does not prove that at that time he was unfit to operate the truck. That Edward Bruner was visibly intoxicated two hours and forty minutes later \u2014 especially, in the face of uncontradicted evidence that he had visited two taverns in the meantime \u2014 does not justify a finding he was intoxicated when he left his father\u2019s presence. To permit a jury to infer that his intoxication at the scene of accident was indicative of a condition of intoxication when he left Kline\u2019s home is to permit conjecture and speculation which we cannot allow. Mrs. Gibson failed to sustain her burden of proof as to Bernard Bruner\u2019s vicarious liability.\nThe court beloiv, under this record, acted Avith propriety in entering judgment n.o.v. as to Bernard Bruner.\nJ udgment affirmed.\nThis testimony, admissible against Edward Brnner, was not admissible against Bernard Bruner.\nEdward Bruner at trial corroborated this version of taking; tbe truck.",
