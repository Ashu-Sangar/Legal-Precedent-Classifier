    <p id="b190-6" data-blocks='[["BL_190.6",190,[227,1123,1202,715]]]'>Briefly stated, the case presented for decision is as follows: The duplicate of road taxes has been placed in the hands of the regularly elected and duly qualified collector, who has given the notice required by the seventh section of the act of June 25, 1885, P. L. 187. The sixty days period has not yet expired, and the defendants are prepared and willing to pay the amount assessed against them, less five per centum. The question is, whether they are entitled to that reduction for prompt payment.. They clearly are so, unless road taxes are excepted out of the provisions of the above cited section. The second proviso to the fourth section of the act reads as follows: “ The limitations in this act as to time and the requirements hereof relating to keeping an alphabetical list of ■ persons charged with taxes, shall not apply to road taxes.”</p>

These terms are somewhat indefinite and have not, to our knowledge, received judicial interpretation. Neither do we know what construction has heretofore been placed upon them in the practical execution of the law by collectors and other township officers throughout the commonwealth. It is therefore with some hesitation that we express our opinion that the terms refer to: 1st, the provision of the fourth section requiring the duplicate to be issued before August first; 2d, the provision of the seventh section fixing the period of sixty days within which the tax payer may obtain a reduction of <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>five per centum by payment of Ms taxes; and, 3d, tbe provision of the same section fixing a time when five per centum may be added to the taxes. The last two of these provisions are as fairly entitled as the first to be called “limitations as to time; ” there are no other provisions in the act to which the terms can apply, and the plural is used, signifying that the legislature had more than one in contemplation. For these reasons we do not feel justified in singling out one of these provisions and holding that the proviso applies to that alone. Hence we conclude that the provision of the seventh section relating to the payment of taxes within sixty days does not apply to road taxes, and that the defendants are not entitled to the five per centum abatement.</p>

We submit that the application of the words “limitations as to time,” in this proviso, is confined to the fourth section, in which it occurs, and it was error to give the proviso effect other than to the preceding enacting clause.

The other “road taxes,” upon which they may exercise such discretion, are those levied under the act of February 28, 1835, P.

    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.6",193,[188,655,1183,396]]]'>This case involves the construction of the act of assembly, approved June 25, 1885, P. L. 187, entitled, “An act regulating the collection of taxes in the several boroughs and townships of this commonwealth,” as to the collection of road taxes. It must be conceded, that in respect of the road taxes the language of the act is much involved and obscure, but we think the conclusion to which the learned court below came in the construction is the correct one.</p>
    <p id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.7",193,[188,1067,1183,1340]],["BL_194.1",194,[218,343,1198,300]]]'>It seems reasonably clear, the legislature intended that road taxes might be collected by the collector of taxes. The first clause of the fourth section of the act provides, that all of the several county, borough, township, school, poor and other authorities, empowered to levy taxes, within the boroughs and townships of the commonwealth, shall on or before the first day of August, in each year, issue their duplicates of taxes to the collector, directing and authorizing him to collect the taxes, etc. It is plain that the road taxes are embraced within this provision of the act, subject of course, to the subsequent clauses and sections having special reference to this particular subject. It is provided, however, that “road taxes may be worked out as heretofore.” But if the duplicate of the road taxes should issue to the collector, on or before the first day of August in each year, the policy of the state heretofore pursued, with respect to the repair of the public roads, would be practically defeated. It is a fact known from common observation and experience, that the repair of the roads can be more conveniently and effectively made in the months of August, September, October, and November, than in any other portion of the year, and the great bulk of the work has heretofore been done during those months. To confine the supervisors and the tax-payers to the months prior to August, would operate as a practical denial of the privilege. The right to work out the road taxes is one which is exercised mainly by those engaged in farming, and as the spring and early summer months <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>must necessarily be given to tbe work of tbe farm, those engaged in such pursuits could not and would not neglect the cultivation and harvesting of their crops to work on the roads. ‘ It was doubtless deemed impracticable therefore, to limit the time for the issuing of the duplicate of road taxes to the first day of August.</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[223,651,1188,666]]]'>Moreover, as the work on the roads would probably in most places and under most circumstances, extend into the late fall, or early winter, in order to give all the tax-payers an opportunity to work out their taxes, the duplicates would not ordinarily reach the collector’s hands until it would be too late to comply with the provisions and limitations of the seventh section. The default in payment of the taxes within six months would, in many cases, perhaps, carry them over into the term of the incoming collector, and much confusion and embarrassment would certainly ensue in consequence. Such a result was not in the contemplation of the legislature. Hence it was provided, that the limitations of the act, “ as to time,” etc., should not apply to road taxes.</p>

L. 46; March 31, 1864, P. L. 162,. and April 20, 1874, P. L. 67, which it is also “lawful and necessary to collect in money;’’ and, therefore, in the fourth section of the act of 1885, it is provided as follows: “ That such special and other road taxes, as it may be lawful and necessary to collect in money, may, at the discretion of the supervisors or road commissioners, be placed in the hands of the collector of taxes, with their warrant for collection by him; for which he shall receive five per centum of the amount collected by him, or the same may be collected by the supervisors or road commissioners as heretofore.” By the “ special ” road taxes we are to understand, the taxes authorized to be levied under the several acts of assembly just referred to, and the “ other ” road taxes, such as have <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>not been worked out after full opportunity has been given. By this act of 1885, therefore, we have a special and exceptional, but uniform provision for the collection of road taxes; payable in money ; a provision which excludes the limitations of the act of 1885, as to time, etc., but affords a speedy and adequate means for its enforcement.</p>
