The lad was furnished with a mule by the driver-boss and put to work drawing loaded cars from a heading out over a side track upon the main track on which the loaded cars were run down to the foot of the slope, to be hoisted into the breaker. The mule was attached to the car by an extension of the trace chains to a crosspiece called a stretcher, or spreader, about two feet and a half behind which was a hook to connect with the car. As the loaded car on the side track approached the main track, it <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>would run slowly, of its own weight towards and upon the main track and thence down the main track to the loaded cars which had preceded it. The mule would be detached from the car at the junction or near it, turned off the track, and the car allowed to move on down.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[125,602,1185,873]]]'>The plaintiff testified, in substance, that when he had brought his last car out upon the main track, in the evening, he reached over to detach the mule by lifting the hook as the car was slowly moving of its own weight, when the mule suddenly started and tightened the stretcher so that it struck him on the breast and threw him beneath the car where four fingers were crushed from his left hand; he was alone at the moment the accident occurred, and was not acquainted with the mule’s propensities. The plaintiff’s counsel then offered to prove by a witness who had frequently driven the mule in the mine, that he was a mule that would jerk, kick, run away; that he was vicious, and had a bad reputation generally among the boys in the mine. This was objected to as being irrelevant, for the reason that it had not been established that the accident occurred through the viciousness or evil propensities of the mule, and the offer did not propose to show notice to the owners of the alleged character of the mule.</p>

Testimony was also introduced from which it was claimed that the plaintiff was improperly riding XTpon the bumper of the car, and fell therefrom when he was <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>injured, and that he had been warned against so riding as dangerous.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[254,550,1194,1178]]]'>Now, what is the negligence complained of ? We may remark before stating the answer to that question, that the cause of action here is not that the plaintiff was taken from the work in which he was engaged and put at more hazardous work; that is not the ground upon which the plaintiff claims to recover ; nor could he recover upon that ground, under the testimony in this case. So that this testimony with regard to what was said between the mother and Mr. Hennigan and Mr. Tench, a short time before the accident, and the testimony as to what was said to the boy at the time he went down into the mine, is not very material in the disposition of the question which has been raised. He alleges that being employed in the mine to drive the mule which was used for hauling coal out of the workings, the company was bound to furnish him with reasonably safe appliances and instrumentalities for that purpose, and that in this particular case the company was bound to furnish him with a reasonably safe mule. It is claimed that the company was negligent in not furnishing him with a proper and suitable animal for the purpose of the work in which he was engaged. That is the allegation of the plaintiff, and to that allegation the testimony has been directed; and to the consideration of the testimony as it bears upon that allegation you will direct your attention.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b452-7" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[251,1738,1187,662]],["BL_453.1",453,[127,320,1187,2059]],["BL_454.1",454,[255,320,1189,1900]]]'>We may say to you, in the first place, that the employer does not warrant the safety of his employees. The law does not impose such an obligation as that upon an employer. It would be impossible for an employer to warrant that his employees should be absolutely safe and free from danger. It does, however, impose upon the employer an obligation which has been thus stated, and an obligation which we think existed in this case. “ A master does not warrant his servant’s safety; he, however, is under an implied contract with those whom he employs, to adopt and maintain suitable instruments and means with which to carry on the business in which they are employed.” Now, that being the nature of the obligation of the defendant to the plaintiff, the question is, whether the de<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>fendant. failed in the performance of that duty. In determining whether or not the appliance or instrumentality or, in this case, the animal, is reasonably safe, you are to take into consideration the nature of the employment. You are also to take into consideration the nature of the appliance or instrumentality. In other words, the law does not say that the employer shall furnish to his employees a machine, an instrument, an appliance or an animal, in the use of which he shall be entirely free from danger. That would be impossible from the very nature of the case. For example: if a man is employed to run a locomotive engine, which is a dangerous agency, in undertaking that work he assumes the risks which are ordinarily incident to the use of such an agency. A man employed about a sawmill is employed about a dangerous agency; no human skill or care or diligence will make such a place absolutely safe. Bo in the use of the mules in the mines. We may say that they are notoriously used there for the purpose for which this mule was used. We think it entirely safe to say that they are necessary for the purpose of hauling out the coal from the workings to the shaft or slope; and in considering whether or not the employer has performed his duty towards his employee, it is not for the jury to say that some other animal might have been safer than the mule, and therefore that the employer was guilty of negligence in using the mule instead of using some more tractable animal. In determining whether or. not this was a reasonably safe instrumentality you are to take into consideration the nature of the work which was to be done and the nature of the instrument which is ordinarily employed for that purpose, and, hence, any peculiarities which are incident to the mule as distinguished from other animals. But it is claimed, further, upon the part of the plaintiff, that this mule was a vicious mule; and that it was by reason of his vicious nature that this accident occurred. Upon this question of fact there is a discrepancy, if not a conflict, in the evidence, which you must determine as best yon can, bearing in mind that in this case, as in all other civil cases between man and man, you are to decide in accordance with the credible testimony in the cause. Yon are to take into consideration what were the opportunities of these various witnesses for knowing what were the habits and character of this animal, <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>and what is the distinctness of their recollection. If any interest has been manifested in .their testimony or appeared in the other testimony in the case, which would cause them to vary from the truth, you are to take that into consideration, also, in weighing their testimony. But in case you should find as matter of fact that the mule was a vicious mule in certain particulars, you are to inquire further whether or not the accident was the consequence of the mule’s viciousness in any particular. Some of the witnesses on the part of the plaintiff have testified that the mule would bite, kick and run away. I think it entirely safe to say that the mule’s habits as to biting and kicking are not involved in this case ; because it is not alleged by any testimony that the injury came to the plaintiff by reason of the mule’s viciousness in these respects. It is claimed, however, that the mule was in the habit of running away. In case you should find that to be a fact, then you will inquire still further whether or not the accident was the result of that propensity or habit of the mule. It is proper at this point to call your attention to the question of the plaintiff’s contributing in any way to the accident complained of..... But in case you should find, under our instructions, that the plaintiff was not in any degree guilty of contributory negligence, then you will recur to the question which I stated a few moments ago, namely, was the accident the result of any vicious habit which it is shown’ the animal had at that time? If you find as a matter of fact that it was merely the result of a starting up which an ordinarily safe and tractable animal might make under the circumstances, then we think that the accident would not be traced to the vicious habits of the animal and therefore would not be imputable to any negligence upon the part of the company. If, however, you find from the testimony that it was the result of an attempt of the mule to run away, and that this was the habit and had been the habit of the mule for some time previous to that, then this was not such an animal as the defendants were bound to furnish to the plaintiff in and about his work, and they may be held liable for the consequences which resulted therefrom. . .</p>

    <p id="b458-7" data-blocks='[["BL_458.7",458,[262,1290,1187,1130]]]'>The plaintiff in this case, on the 27th of September, 1883, was, and for some time prior to that had been, an employee of the Pittston Coal Company. He was at that time a lad of twelve or thirteen years of age, and was employed to oil the machinery in the breaker. On the day mentioned, however, he was temporarily sent into the mines, to serve as a driver, in which capacity it was his duty to hitch a mule to loaded cars at the heading, and drive the mule on a side track a mile or more to the main or loaded track at the foot of the slope, where the mule was detached from the car and hitched to an empty one, which was hauled over the same route to the heading. The grade of the side track for fifteen or twenty yards from the place of its connection with the loaded track, as well as the grade of the loaded track, for some distance from the same point, was sufficient for the loaded cars to run slowly, by gravity, towards the foot of the slope. What is called a “stretcher” was used in hitching the mule to the car, and as the car came upon the loaded track, and approached the loaded cars standing thereon, it was the duty of the driver to stop the mule, detach the stretcher, and allow the animal to step off the track and out of the way of the moving car, in order that it might drop down the grade in the rear of the others.</p>
    <p id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.3",459,[150,352,1181,975]]]'>
      <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>The lad, McNulty, was delivering his sixth car on the loaded track; as he approached the point where he was to unhitch, he stopped the mule and attempted to detach the stretcher. But the mule “started out again,” the stretcher struck the boy on the breast, threw him on the track in front of the car and the front wheel severed four of the fingers from his left hand. The car stopped and the mule stood still, whilst the boy by the aid of others was extricated from this perilous place. This suit is brought against the company to recover damages for the injury thus received, upon the ground that the mule was unsafe and unsuitable for the purposes for which he was used; that he was a vicious and intractable animal, would bite, kick, and run away; that his vicious habits were well known to the company, and that the company was negligent in permitting him to be used in the mine. The plaintiff’s contention is, that the company was bound to furnish the boy with a mule that was reasonably safe; that the boy accepted only the ordinary risks of the business, and that he was wholly ignorant of the vicious character of the animal he had in charge.</p>
    <p id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[149,1334,1180,354]]]'>Assuming all this to be so, the difficulty in the plaintiff’s case is that the injury does not appear to have occurred from any vicious habit or conduct of the mule. From all that has been shown, it appears that when the boy reached down to detach the stretcher, the mule “ started out again,” and in consequence of this, and this only, the injury occurred. The occurrence is thus stated by the plaintiff himself:—</p>
    <p id="b459-6" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[144,1696,1185,549]]]'>Q. You were bringing out the sixth car you say? A. Yes, sir, coming out with the sixth car, the loaded track was full, and I hollered “ whoa ” to the mule when I thought it was fit to unhitch, to get her out of the road. Q. What do you mean by fit to unhitch? A. Why, to get the mule out of the road. Q. To get the mule out of the road before the mule ran against the last loaded car — is that it? A. Yes, sir; then he stopped and I bent over for the stretcher and he started out again, and the stretcher come up like that (illustrating) and catched me in the breast, knocked me across the stretcher and that is all I know about it.</p>
    <p id="b459-7" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[144,2265,1181,147]],["BL_460.1",460,[231,353,1189,974]]]'>There is no pretence that the mule attempted to bite, or to kick the boy, and there is no evidence that he tried to run away. The car was moving slowly down the grade by its own <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>gravity, and this alone may have caused the mule to “ start out again; ” almost any horse or mule, however gentle and well broken, might start unbidden under such circumstances. The mule had been trained promptly to step out from the front of the car at this point, and it is quite reasonable to suppose that in starting out, he did what he conceived to be his duty. The boy was but a novice in the business, and may not have been as prompt as one more accustomed to the work. That the mule was not guilty of any vicious act, is shown by the admitted facts in the case. When the lad fell in over the stretcher his light went out, he cried “ whoa ” and the mule stopped; he was lying partly on and partly under the stretcher in front of the car, on the track, with his hand under the wheel. He was certainly in a place of the greatest peril, for the mule might have kicked him, or, by moving a single step forward, might have dragged the car over him. But the mule did not kick him, nor did he stir from the spot, until a light was obtained, a lever applied to the wheel, and the boy rescued from danger.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[231,1336,1189,455]]]'>The action is by an employee against his employer; the gist of the action is negligence, and the burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff to prove that the negligence of the defendant was the proximate cause of the injury. Upon an examination of the whole case, we fail to find the slightest evidence that the injury complained of resulted from any vicious habit or conduct of this mule. We are not to assume that when he “ started out again,” he started to run away; the testimony is wholly to the contrary.</p>
