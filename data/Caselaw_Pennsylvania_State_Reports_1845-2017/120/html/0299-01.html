To this rule, however, there are certain exceptions, to which we call your attention. The first exception is this: That a father may manumit or release his son from the obligation to turn his earnings over to him, and may permit his child to keep the earnings of his labor. This, of course, implies a contract between the father and the child which is respected by the law. This fact, however, is not particularly important in the present case. The ease depends not on the general law on the ' subject of the relations of parent and child, but it is to be determined by a statute to which your attention has already been called by the counsel on either side, and to which now we call your attention also. This act of May 4, 1855, under the second section, provides that in certain cases where a wife has been abandoned by her husband she shall control all the property, real and personal, which she has acquired, without interference from her husband, and may make deeds without his joining, etc. This section of the statute has no particirlar bearing upon the present case ; the third section, however, reads as follows :.....</p>

The plaintiff in this case claims under the statute and by virtue of it. She testified that her husband left her some eight years since, went away from home and has never returned; that meanwhile he has contributed nothing whatever to her support or the support of her two children. Now, if there were nothing else in the case and this were the truth in regard to it, the mother undoubtedly would be entitled to the wages of her son, and any payment made to the son instead of to the mother would be no payment whatever; but you observe further, gentlemen, that the statute in question provides that the mother, to have the benefit of its provisions, shall afford to the children a good example and properly educate <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>and maintain them, according to her ability; and the plaintiff, the mother, who claims by virtue of this law to recover her son’s earnings, must show not only that he earned the money which has not been paid to her and for which she brings suit, but [she must also show to your satisfaction that she has afforded to her child a good example, and has properly educated and maintained him according to her ability; and this brings us to the question of character, an important question in this case, as you see, under this law. Has this plaintiff established to your satisfaction such a character as the law contemplates when it says that she shall receive the wages of her son ?] B The law of evidence permits a party who alleges bad character to call witnesses who have been acquainted with the person, who have lived in his or her neighborhood, and to ask them whether they know the general reputation of the parties ; if they say they do, the questioner has then the right to ask whether that reputation, according to the speech of the people, is good or bad — in this case — for virtue or chastity, ■ because that is the point upon which she has been assailed. Now, it will be for you to ascertain, gentlemen, under the evidence in this case, whether the testimony of the witnesses who have been called here, establishes the fact that by tbe general speech of the people in the neighborhood where this woman lives, her character for chastity is bad; and we say to you that if you find that to be the truth of the case, then she cannot recover her son’s wages under this statute. If, however, the proof does not satisfy you on that point, if you can account for these rumors on any reasonable hypothesis of good character, she is entitled to have at your hands a just, fair judgment, under all the circumstances.</p>

    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[246,454,1189,811]]]'>The second assignment goes to the question of the plaintiff’s character. She was asked the question whether she had a Mr. Coursen arrested for adultery with her, and she answered yes. There was considerable other evidence, not objected to or assigned for error, which tended to show that her general character was bad. The plaintiff contended that all this was irrelevant, and that her character was not in issue. We think it was, under the act of 1855. It is true the law presumes her character to be good, and she might not therefore be called upon affirmatively to establish it in order to entitle her to recover, yet when such presumption is destroyed or rebutted, and she is shown to be of unchaste character, she can no longer stand upon the legal presumption. It is only by the act of 1855 that she can recover, and that act does not help her if she is a woman of bad example, and of unsuitable character to be intrusted with the control of her children.</p>
