It is our duty to instruct you as to what these written papers mean, and the respective duties thereby imposed upon these parties. [We instruct you, as a matter of law, that these three papers which have been offered in evidence constitute a contract between these parties, and that they are bound by the terms thereof, and, in order to escape from liability and responsibility, they must show that some material part of the contract or agreement between the parties that had been entered into and not covered by this written contract, was omitted either by the fraud or misrepresentation of the one party, or by the mistake or accident of the scrivener who wrote it. If you find from the evidence that in the verbal arrangement or agreement a <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>material part of that was omitted from this paper, either through fraud or accident, or by mistake, and that is shown to your satisfaction by clear, precise and convincing proof — proof that leaves no doubt of that fact in your mind — then of course the part omitted constitutes a part of the agreement between the parties. If you are not satisfied by that kind of proof that we have mentioned, that a part of this verbal agreement referred to here was omitted in the manner which we have stated, and from the causes mentioned — fraud, accident, or mistake — then the parties must submit to what is herein contained.] 5</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[244,899,1188,921]]]'>Now, we instruct you that under this written contract, or under these papers which taken together we instruct you constitute a contract, it was the duty of the plaintiff to cut and deliver on the cars for $8 per thousand, the' kind of lumber herein' described as 2x6 in. and 2x8 in. of the different lengths herein mentioned, and if you are satisfied from the evidence that he has either complied with that contract, or that there is such a state of facts, as we shall refer to hereafter, as would excuse him from complying with that part of the contract, then you would have to find in favor of the plaintiff. There is no controversy in this case as to the other lumber. The defendant himself has stated that he released the plaintiff from the performance, or from the delivery of the balance of this lumber — some 400,000 feet, or near that — at the request of the plaintiff, so that that part of the contract is not in controversy in this case. The whole controversy here is about the lumber of the two sizes, 2x6 in. and 2x8 in., and of the various lengths.</p>

The contract itself does not say where the inspection shall be, in so many plain words ; but, as we instruct you that the place of delivery and the price for the lumber was determined upon its being put upon the cars at Sargeant station, that the legal inference from that is, that that would be the place of inspection, unless you are satisfied by clear, precise and convincing proof that the question of inspection, or place of inspection, was left out of these written papers through the fraud, accident, or mistake of the parties.]11</p>

Did he deliver the lumber ? It is not alleged by the plaintiff that he did deliver all of the lumber that he was required to deliver by the terms of these written papers. It is claimed and contended however, that he was excused from the delivery of all of it, because of the mode of inspection, and the place of inspection demanded by the defendant. It is alleged by the plaintiff that the inspection was contrary to the agreement. Now, as we said to you, that depends upon what you find the contract to be. We have instructed you that the papers require the inspection to be at the place where the lumber was to be delivered on the cars, unless, as we stated, you are satisfied that a material part of this contract in regard to the place of inspection was omitted from the papers in the mode we have already indicated. If you find that the place of inspection was to be at the point where the lumber was to be put on the cars for the $8 per thousand, then you must inquire whether or not the inspection at that point was an honest and fair inspection. It was to be “ good, sound hemlock lumber the contract requires that — and the inspection must be such as to all there was delivered at that point. If you find that he did not place “good, sound hemlock lumber” on the cars— for nothing else than that would fill the contract — or if that was the point of inspection, and there was hemlock put upon the cars that was not good, sound hemlock, the defendant was not bound to receive it nor pay for it. If, however, you determine, under the rule we have given you, that the point of inspection was at Girard Point, and that that was the place where the lumber was to be inspected, then the plaintiff would be required to perform this contract under that arrangement; and if the inspection there, as claimed by the defendant, Avas an honest and fair inspection, not unjust or unreasonable, then the plaintiff Avould be bound to comply with the contract, with that point as the point of inspection, and if he has not, then he must ansAver to the defendant, unless he Avas excused.</p>

So that if you determine that the point of inspection was at Girard Point, in the mode we have indicated, then in order to relieve the plaintiff, it must be clearly apparent to you that that inspection was manifestly unjust or Unfair. Even though it may have been severe, yet if it was not manifestly unjust or unfair, the plaintiff would not be relieved from the performance of his part of the contract to ship this lumber. [If you find that the plaintiff was excused from the performance of the contract because the inspection was not made at the point where the lumber was put on the cars, and where the price was fixed, which was the point of delivery, of course the question of damages does not arise, and he would be entitled to recover in this case for the amount of lumber thus delivered, that is, if he is excused. If the inspection there was an honest and fair inspection, and that was the point of inspection, he was not bound to submit or accept it at any other place; and if the defendant insisted upon an inspection anywhere else, the plaintiff was not bound to ship the lumber.]13 But if the point of inspection was at Girard Point, and that inspection was fair and honest, and the plaintiff has not complied with or shipped the amount of lumber necessary, then he must answer to the defendant for the damages which resulted to defendant by reason of his failure to comply with this contract. That, of course, is dependent upon the question that we have before stated, that in order to excuse him from the delivery of the lumber, under the inspection at Girard Point — if you find that to be the place of inspection — you must be already satisfied by the. proof in the cause that the inspection was so manifestly unjust or unfair that he was not called upon to submit to it.</p>

He would not be entitled to go into the market and buy at any price and come in and defalk the price. He could only buy at a fair market value for that kind of lumber, and at the market price at the point where the inspection was to be. So that if this inspection was to be made at Sargeant Station, and the plaintiff was not excused from the performance of this contract, the defendant would be entitled to go into the market there and buy the lumber at the market price, and if he had to pay more for it than he agreed to pay the plaintiff, he would be entitled to deduct the difference from the plaintiff’s bill in this case. In the same way if the plaintiff was to deliver this lumber and submit to an inspection at Girard Point, the defendant would have the right to go into the market there and buy lumber at the market value, and the difference between what he paid for it, and what the plaintiff was to receive from him could be defalked from plaintiff’s claim in this case.....</p>

[The parol or verbal agreement, which is claimed here by Mr. Holt, in order to be entitled to consideration at your hands, it must first appear to you, by convincing, clear and precise proof, to have been omitted, as we said before, by fraud, accident, or mistake; because the law is such, when parties reduce their agreements to writing, that <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>they shall be bound by the writing, unless it does appear to the jury that a material part was omitted in the mode, or in the way we have indicated.

But if that was not the point of inspection, and you so find, and are satisfied under the rules we have laid down, then you must determine whether or not Mr. Holt has suffered damage, and if so, how much ? When you come to that question of damage you must determine the amount of it in the way we have indicated. If he would have the right to go into the market and buy lumber at a fair market value, as we have already said, you will deduct the difference between what he was obliged to pay for it, and what he had agreed to pay Mr. Pie, from the plaintiff’s claim, and if that be more than the plaintiff’s claim in this case, of course it would wipe it out, and there could be no recovery at all.....</p>

If the same carloads of lumber were sent to Holt from <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>the yard of the lumber company, still we do not see how this account was admissible as an instrument of evidence. It might serve as a memorandum to aid the memory of the men who put the lumber upon the cars or shipped it to Holt, but as an account of the lumber company it was inadmissible in this action.</p>

    <blockquote id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.8",475,[1008,1389,315,34]]]'>“D. <em>W. </em>Holt.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b475-8" data-blocks='[["BL_475.9",475,[192,1440,1177,97]]]'>The second is also from Holt, dated July 16,1881, and modifies the sizes of a part of the bill.</p>
    <p id="b475-9" data-blocks='[["BL_475.10",475,[237,1544,917,40]]]'>The third bears the same date, and is as follows :</p>
    <blockquote id="b475-10" data-blocks='[["BL_475.11",475,[192,1596,1176,147]]]'>“ Dear Sir : In answer to yours of the 16th inst., I accept the modified bill of lumber, and I will go right ahead and cut said bill as fast as possible. Respectfully,</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b475-11" data-blocks='[["BL_475.12",475,[934,1751,388,33]]]'>“ Pie <em>&amp; </em>Gaunter.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b475-12" data-blocks='[["BL_475.13",475,[192,1804,1178,609]],["BL_476.1",476,[252,347,1185,664]]]'>So far as this order and acceptance express terms, they constitute the contract between the parties. They fix the amount of lumber to be furnished; the sizes into which it is to be cut; the kind of finish, and the price on the cars. But the order refers to a “ verbal agreement of some days ago,” and professes to be in confirmation of it. It does not profess to recite that agreement, or be a substitute for it, but to confirm, or conform to it. The offer to prove what that verbal contract was, as to any omitted terms or stipulations, was not, therefore, an effort to change the terms of a written agreement, but to show the whole agreement of which the letters were but part. This the court refused permission to do unless it was first <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>shown that the stipulations not found in the letters were omitted by fraud, accident, or mistake. But this was not alleged. The letters consist of Holt’s order, telling what lumber he wanted, and at what price, and of Pie’s acceptance of the order and promise to cut the lumber as soon as possible. So far the verbal agreement was reduced to writing, or “ confirmed ; ” but whatever else there was of the agreement the jury had a right to know.. The offer was not to alter the agreement contained in the letters, but to prove the actual contract in conformity with which the letters had been written, so that the jury might understand what it was as to such subjects as were not within the range or purview of the order and acceptance.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[249,1019,1185,765]]]'>The remaining assignments of error are to that portion of the charge which relates to the inspection of the lumber. The order was silent upon this subject, but it called for “ good, sound hemlock ” at a fixed price on the cars ; to be “ shipped when directed.” This clearly contemplated a shipment by Pie to such place and at such time as Holt should direct. If, when the lumber reached its destination, wherever that might be, it was not “ good, sound hemlock,” such as Holt ordered and Pie agreed to furnish, to that extent the performance of the contract was defective. Holt was not under obligation to accept any quality of lumber except that for which he had contracted, and he had a right to decline to pay for lower grades. It was error, therefore, to hold that the order or letter of July 6th and its acceptance provided for an inspection at the point of shipment.</p>
    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[247,1793,1183,247]]]'>The undertaking of Pie was to ship when directed good, sound hemlock. If he did not do this, Holt was at liberty to refuse to receive the lumber. He was bound to pay for what he ordered, but he was not bound to pay for any other quality or kind of lumber. For the reasons thus indicated,</p>
    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[509,2052,918,85]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
