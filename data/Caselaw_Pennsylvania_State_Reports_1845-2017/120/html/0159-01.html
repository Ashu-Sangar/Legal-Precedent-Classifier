L. 208, was passed, classifying pontested elections into four classes, the fourth class clearly embracing officers of a city such as members of select and common councils. Section 16, P. L. 212, provides that “ cases of the fourth class shall be tried and determined by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of the county in which the election contested shall be held.” The act of assembly requires that the petition for a contest shall set out “ wherein it is claimed the election is undue or illegal,” and that notice “shall be served upon the person whose right of office shall be contested.” It will be observed that the right of “ trial and determination is a constitutional right vested in the courts and that no act of assembly can therefore in any way impair or take it away.”</p>

We are of the opinion that the terms “ contested elections ” and “ undue and illegal elections,” are broad enough to include the present case, upon both reason and authority.

L. J. 201, Judge Ewing says: “ It was intended by this section of the constitution to make all contested elections judicial matters to be decided by the court.” In the contested election of McNeill, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20Pa.%20241" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="111 Pa. 241">111 Pa. 241</a>, Justice Mercub, said: “The earlier constitution authorized each house of the legislature to judge of the ‘ qualifications ’ of its members. The present constitution changes the language and authorizes each house to judge of the election and qualifications ’ of its members. While the addition of the word ‘election’ may not give to the house any power which it might not have exercised under authority to judge of the 4 qualifications ’ of its members, it clearly shows an intention not to restrict the legislative power.” These words indicate that, in his opinion, either of the terms convey the same idea and are tantamount to the same thing. We, therefore, feel warranted in saying that the inquiry into qualifications is not beyond our powers. Surely the election of an alien would be illegal. He does not possess the qualifications of citizenship. So, too, the election of a minor. He does not possess the qualifications of age. So, too, of a resident of Philadelphia. He does not possess the qualifications of residence. The election of one disqualified by law must, therefore, be held to be an undue, improper, illegal election.</p>

It would enable a citizen of Albany township, now in the Berks senatorial district, if otherwise qualified, to come into a ward of the city and be elected to councils, although he might not have lived more than a day in the ward to constitute him an inhabitant, and unable under the law, to cast his vote therein for any office, state, national, municipal or ward.

An interpretation that works this result ought not and cannot be correct.

      <em>Mr. Louis Richards </em>(with whom were <em>Mr. F. S. </em>Livingood, <em>Mr. S. Maltzberger </em>and <em>Mr. Qyrus Gr. JDerr), </em>for the plaintiff in error:</p>
    <p id="b204-10" data-blocks='[["BL_204.9",204,[234,1262,1187,764]]]'>1. Under the act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 208, relating to contested elections, the only matter for the inquiry and determination of the court is as to “ which of the candidates ballotted for received the highest number of legal votes and is entitled to the certificate of election.” Sections 4, 6, 8 and 14 prescribe this to be the very end and object of the investigation in determining all cases of elections contested under its provisions. In none of the reported cases have the courts ever before undertaken to pass upon the qualifications of one duly elected to a public office, and in no proper legal point of view, can the element of qualifications be deemed to enter into the subject matter of a contested election: Nineteenth Ward Election, 1 <em>W. </em>N. 114; Saterlee v. San Francisco, <a href="/cal/23/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="23 Cal. 314" data-case-ids="2262800" data-case-paths="/cal/23/0314-01">23 Cal. 314</a>; Dobyns v. Weardon, <a href="/ind/50/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="50 Ind. 298" data-case-ids="1415953" data-case-paths="/ind/50/0298-01">50 Ind. 298</a>; Ellingham v. Mount, 43 N. J. (L.) 470.</p>

L. 225, under which act this very election was held, prescribes, in respect of councils, that “ each branch shall judge of the qualifications of its members, and contested elections shall he determined by the courts of law, in such manner as shall be directed by law.” The line of jurisdiction is here clearly pointed out in the same sentence. Admittedly, councils can<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>not judge of the election of their members; and the courts cannot, as in this instance, prejudge the question of qualification. Any other construction of the act would render the express provision of § 4, article VIII., cited, entirely nugatory.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[170,543,1182,1223]]]'>3. The court below intimates the unconstitutionality of the act of 1887, in so far as it undertakes to eliminate from the subject matter of an election contest the question of the qualification of the officer elected. But, Commonwealth v. Leech, <a href="/pa/44/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="44 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="484290" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0332-01">44 Pa. 332</a>, cited to support this view, was decided before the constitution of 1874. Under the consolidation act of 1874, councils were invested with the right to try contested elections of their own members, and the decision was that the courts had no jurisdiction. Moreover, the ground of contest was fraud in the return. Ex parte Braun, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pitts%20L.J.%20201" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="22 Pitts L.J. 201">22 Pittsb. L. J. 201</a>, goes no further than to hold that the power of councils, before the constitution of 1874, to decide upon the “ election and qualifications ” of their members, is now so far taken away as to vest in the courts the determination of all cases of contested elections, which we do not deny. In McNeill’s case, <a href="/pa/111/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="111 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="545356" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0235-01">111 Pa. 235</a>, a principle clearly enunciated is, that the act of 1874 provides simply a method of determining which candidate received the greatest number of legal votes and is entitled to the certificate, a definition of much significance. Besides, as to a mere matter of qualification of a person regularly elected to office, no individual or number of individuals can have such an interest in the subject as will entitle them to wage a legal contest upon it: Commonwealth v. Cluley, <a href="/pa/56/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="56 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1009157" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0270-01">56 Pa. 270</a>.</p>

Assuming, however, that the court had jurisdiction to inquire into the qualifications of the respondent, he should have been held to be duly qualified under the act of 1887. He had been a citizen of the state for four years, and an inhabitant of the 11th senatorial district, to wit, the county of Berks, for one year next preceding his election. Possessing the qualifications of a senator, and being an inhabitant of the Second ward from which he was elected to councils, he was qualified to serve as a member of the select council from that ward. The act requires of members of select councils, as to residence within the ward, nothing beyond inhabitancy at the time of the election.</p>

    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.6",206,[241,598,1188,716]]]'>It is very clear that the Court of Quarter Sessions acted ultra vires in entering judgment of ouster against the respondent in this case. It had no jurisdiction to pronounce upon the qualification of Daniel Auchenbaeh as a councilman. The act of assembly vests that power not in the court, but in that branch of the municipal council to which the member may be elected. It is only in contested election cases that the court has jurisdiction, and as this jurisdiction is not one of common law it cannot be extended by implication beyond the prescriptions of the act in which it originates. Were the question before us, we might take issue with the court below on the fact of the respondent’s qualification, but, as what we have said fully disposes of the case in hand, we need not pass upon an issue which is foreign to the pending controversy.</p>
