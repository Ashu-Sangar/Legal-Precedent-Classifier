After September 6, 1862, when Mrs. Weatherby obtained her judgment in ejectment against Dennison, the possession of Dennison, theretofore under Mrs. Weatherby, was thus terminated by her own act and thereafter was adverse and hostile as though no relation of trust or confidence between them had ever existed: Pipher v. Lodge, 4 S. &amp; R. 569. If, after a contract for the sale of land, the vendor “ brings ejectment for the land, lie violates his own contract, unless the condition be broken by the vendee, and if it be, the vendor ought to show it: ” Marshall, C. J., in Blight v. Rochester, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wheat.%20548" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Wheat. 548">7 Wheat. 548</a>. It will be observed that in Pipher v. Lodge, supra, the statute was held to begin to run as against the vendee when the vendor leased the land to another and the lessee entered. The court say that this would be an actual disseisin. From this the principle would naturally be deduced, that, so far as the vendor is concerned, the running of the statute was started by his executing the lease; and the act of the lessee was only the notice to the vendee which fixed the date from which the 21 years was to run.</p>
    <p id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[139,1436,1181,911]]]'>2. If, then, the vendor, by leasing to a stranger, can so terminate the relation as to start the running of the statute, why is not the same result effected when the vendor obtains his judgment in ejectment against the vendee ? “ Whenever the legal title is in one and the real interest in another, these form but one title, and the statute does not run between them until the trustee disclaims and acts adversely to the cestui que trust: ” Rush v. Barr, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.%20120" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 W. 120">1 W. 120</a>; Price, Lim. &amp; Liens, 119. Ordinarily, the beginning of the running of the statute “ is when the adverse possession shall be taken or held against any one having a present right of possession: ” Price, Lim. &amp; Liens, c. VIII. When a vendor enters a judgment against the vendee in an ejectment begun by adversary process, it is as decisive a declaration terminating the trust as can readily be imagined. The vendor by her own declaration, makes her former vendee an adverse and hostile holder: Martin v. Jackson, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20510" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="27 Pa. 510">27 Pa. 510</a>; Pipher v. Lodge, supra; Scott v. Gallagher, 14 S. &amp; R. 333.</p>

Before the purchase by James Bennett from Dennison of the latter’s rights and possession under Mrs. Weatherby; she had recovered a judgment by default in an action of specific performance against Dennison. But we have the authority of Chief Justice Gibson for the proposition that “ nothing is clearer than that such a recovery is not equivalent to an entry, even to bar the statute of limitations, and therefore not equivalent to an actual possession: ” Dowell v.

An adverse character cannot be given to a possession which had originally been in subordination to the title of the true owner, except by some clear, positive and unequivocal act on the part of the party in possession, which challenges the title of such owner. And as such hostility must have its origin in the animus and purpose of the party in possession, the challenge must come from him, and not from the true owner, who is presumed to permit the continued possession upon the terms of the original contract. Where he who sets up the statute of limitations came in expressly or legally in subservience to the title of the owner, he cannot be permitted to set up his subsequent continued possession as adverse.

No subsequent proceedings were ever had upon this judgment; no habere was issued, nor was possession delivered to the plaintiff. Such a recovery is not equivalent to an entry, even to bar the statute of limitations, and <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>therefore not equivalent to actual possession : Powell v.

The vendor of land sold under articles of agreement must not only in some way repudiate the agreement, but must take actual possession of the premises either in person, by an agent, a tenant, or another vendee, in order to break the relation his vendee sustains to him under the agreement, before the statute will commence to run.</p>

But there is the testimony of the defendant himself, who swears that he paid Dennison $15 for the possession in 1868; that Dennison delivered up the key to him in pursuance thereof, and that he has been in adverse possession ever since; that he never paid any rent to his brother J ames; that he claimed to own the property and repudiated his brother’s claims as landlord; and also that he has paid the taxes thereon continuously since 1868. It is true all this is denied by the plaintiff, and it is quite possible the jury would find the truth on her side.
