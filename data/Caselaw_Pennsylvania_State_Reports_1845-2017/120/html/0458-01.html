Co., which runs east and west by the defendant firm’s place of business. A horse was attached by the plaintiff to the west end of the ear, while Mr. Bobb ascended to the roof and managed the brake. The car was thus moved westward to a certain point, when the brake was applied, the car stopped and the plaintiff directed to move the horse and attach him to the east end of the car, which was to be moved some distance eastward upon another track. The plaintiff loosed the horse and moved him by the south side of the car, to and upon the track at its east end, Mr. Bobb remaining at the brake at the west end. As the horse was about to be attached, Mr. Bobb loosed the brake and the car started eastward. The plaintiff, still trying to attach to the car, drove the horse eastward, trying with his right hand to attach the hook to the car-bumper, and holding the line with his left hand. Going in this manner for fifty or sixty feet, calling several times to Mr. Bobb to stop the car, his left foot became fastened between a guard-rail and the north rail of the track, and, the car continuing in motion, he tried to throw his body outside the track, but his foot remained fastened and his left leg was crushed between his ankle and knee. Railroad iron lay piled up at the side of the track at the place of the accident. On cross-examination of the plaintiff, in his ease in chief, it appeared that he had been helping in the shifting of the cars as long as he had worked around the warehouse, over twenty years, and knew it was dangerous to try to hook a car when it was moving.</p>

The fact that we may conceive that the plaintiff in the light of subsequent results might have acted in a manner by which this injury would have been avoided, does not alter the case.

It appears he was in the employ of the defendants, and being requested by one of them, followed him to the warehouse of the said railroad company and procured a car for the use of their firm; that while on the errand, and while an effort was being made to put a car on the siding, the accident happened which caused the harm to Mr. Shumpp. It passed over the lower part of his left leg, crushing it so that it had to be amputated, and the other one was so hurt that a considerable portion of the integument had to be removed from a portion of it near the foot. The plaintiff was confined to the house for tM’ee or four months, about two of them being spent in his bed, and his capacity to earn wages has been largely reduced. A wooden leg has been substituted for the lost one. He charges that the harm thus came to him was the result of negligence on the part of Captain Bobb, one of the defendants, tMs negligence consisting in the loosening of a brake before the horse was attached to the car, and in not heeding calls to stop it after plaintiff found that he was unable to fasten the hook to the car, and he seeks in this action to recover damages on account thereof.....</p>

You will most carefully keep in mind and review the testimony submitted to you in this case. Much of it is in direct conflict and utterly irreconcilable as to the causes which produced the accident and the conditions surrounding the occurrence.

The burden is upon him, therefore, to satisfy you by the weight of the evidence that he is so entitled, otherwise your verdict should be for the defendants.

If you should find that Mr. Bobb was negligent and loosened the brakes, and thus caused the car to start before the horse was attached, or negligently failed to hear the calls of the plaintiff to stop the car after it had started, as insisted upon by him, then inquire if the injury suffered was due to the negligence of Mr. Bobb alone, or was it the result, as well, of negligence on part of the plaintiff, because, if the latter contributed to it in any degree, however slight, the law will not permit Mm to recover damages on <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>account of the same.

The first and second points submitted by the defendants’ counsel were doubtless intended to raise <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>this question in the court below, and, as they were refused, we will consider the case as if the points were in this precise form. A brief reference to the facts is necessary to a complete understanding of the case. In the recital of the circumstances under which the injury was received, we, of course, assume the proof of the plaintiff’s testimony, as it is upon this theory of the case the defendants contend the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[242,704,1187,1179]]]'>Woodward, Graybill &amp; Co. were, in the year 1883, engaged in the coal, grain, and forwarding business in Carlisle. John G. Bobb was a member, and Felix Shumpp an employee of the company. On the 24th of August, of that year, Bobb called upon Shumpp to assist him in shifting a car from the side track to the main track of the Cumberland Yalley Railroad Company, for some purpose connected with the business of the defendants. Shumpp, by Bobb’s direction, hitched a horse to the west end of the car and hauled it up the grade to a point above the switch, where the brake was applied. The horse was then unhitched and driven to the east end of the car to pull it back on the main track. Whilst the horse was between the rails, and before Shumpp could attach the chain to the bull-nose of the car, Bobb loosened the brake, and the car, impelled by its own gravity, started slowly down the grade; Shumpp, holding the line in his left hand, attempted to attach the chain to the car with the <em>right; </em>the horse was a spirited animal and he did not succeed. He called repeatedly to Bobb to stop the car, but the brake was not applied, and after advancing fifty feet or more in the effort to hitch the horse, his left foot became fastened between the guard rail and the north rail of the track; the car came upon him, and cut and crushed his left leg so that amputation became necessary.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[239,1890,1186,507]],["BL_505.1",505,[185,350,1180,871]]]'>It is undoubtedly true, as a general proposition, that one who places himself on the track in front of a moving railroad car assumes a place of known danger, and will ordinarily be supposed to accept the peril and risk to which he thus recklessly subjects himself. It is equally true where he engages to perform a hazardous work he takes the risks incident thereto: Rummell v. Dilworth, <a href="/pa/111/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="111 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="545402" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0343-01">111 Pa. 343</a>; P. &amp; R. R. Co. v.

When Shumpp placed himself in front of this car he did so by the direction of Bobb, his employer, and had no reason to suppose that the brake would be lifted until he had completed the connection with the car. Before this could be done, however, the car was set in motion, and he was obliged to regulate the movements of his horse, observe the approach of the car, watch his opportunity to connect the hook with the car, and have regard for his own safety, all at one and the same time. He had committed himself and the horse to the space in front of the car on the track, whilst the brakes were on, and the car standing still; and it was the negligent act of Bobb which put the car in motion before Shumpp was prepared for it. There were piles of railroad iron and other obstructions at the side of the track, which prevented him from leaving it, and as the car advanced towards him he was obliged to keep out of its way, under all the embarrassments stated.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[186,1229,1181,819]]]'>If these facts are true, can it be pretended that the court would have been justified in saying, as matter of law, that Shumpp was guilty of negligence ? The rate of speed at which the ear was moving, the nature and extent of the obstructions at the side of the track, the spirit and conduct of the horse, and the manner in which the plaintiff conducted himself throughout the transaction were all matters to be considered in arriving at a conclusion on the question of contributory negligence. The plaintiff, as we said in Lee v. Woolsey, <a href="/pa/109/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="109 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="542304" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0124-01">109 Pa. 124</a>, must in all cases “show a case clear of his concurrent negligence, a case resulting exclusively from the negligence and wrong of the defendant; but when the measure of care which he ought to have exercised, shifts with the circumstances, or when the care which ought to be exacted from an employee has been varied by his employer, the jury alone can determine whether he negligently performed his duty.”</p>
