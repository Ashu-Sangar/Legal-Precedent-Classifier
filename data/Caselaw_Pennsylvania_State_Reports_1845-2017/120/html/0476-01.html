In that case the facts as recited in the opinion were as follows: The plaintiff below brought his suit against the First National Bank of Lock Haven to recover the amount of moneys he had deposited with the said bank. The defendants offered to prove that the money deposited in the name of James D. Mason, the plaintiff, was in fact the money of Thomas &amp; Mason, of which firm the plaintiff was clerk; that the plaintiff had admitted at the time tbe deposits were made that the money belonged to said firm, and were placed in his name as a matter of convenience in paying small bills ; and that the said Thomas &amp; Mason were indebted to the said bank in excess of the amount standing on its books to the credit of the plaintiff. The bank claimed to set off the indebtedness of Thomas &amp; Mason against the claim of the plaintiff in this suit. The evidence was rejected by the court below, and forms the subject of the first assignment of error.</p>

Some of the cases cited by this defendant in support of its position were referred to in the opinion in that case, in which Mr. Justice Paxson, after referring to them and showing that they referred to cases where the real owner of the money deposited, or his creditors, claimed it as against the person who deposited it, and in whose name the account stood on the books of the bank, said: “We have here a very different question. The bank, the depositary, sets up an adverse title, to defeat the suit of its own depositor. It is clearly against public policy to permit a bank that has received <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>money from a depositor, credited Mm therewith upon, its books, and thereby entered into an implied contract to honor his check, to allege that the money deposited belonged to some one else.

A departure from this rule might lead to novel results, and embarrass commercial transactions.” The judgment of the court below was affirmed.</p>

If this be true, and there happened to occur at any time a deficit in the account by an overdraft, should not a subsequent deposit to the credit of the fund make good that deficit ?

The two eases are parallel in fact and identical in principle. The controlling principle is expressly-recognized and followed in German Bank v.

The overdraft of McAuley, the county treasurer, was not the debt of Warren county, but the personal indebtedness of McAuley, practically a loan to him individually. The bank could not sue the county to recover this overdraft. The county treasurer has no power to bind or pledge the credit of the county for money borrowed. How, then, can the money admitted to be the property of Warren county be applied to the private debt which McAuley owed the bank? The fund must be preserved for its true owner: F. &amp; M. N. Bank v.

    <p id="b520-7" data-blocks='[["BL_520.7",520,[257,1377,1188,406]]]'>This case is ruled by Bank v. Mason, <a href="/pa/95/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="95 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="492920" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0113-01">95 Pa. 113</a>. It was there held that “it is clearly against public policy to permit a bank that has received money from a depositor, credited him therewith upon its books, and thereby entered into an implied contract to honor his cheeks, to allege that the money deposited belongs to some one else. This may be done by an attaching creditor, or by the true owner of the fund; but the bank is estopped by its own act.”</p>
    <p id="b520-8" data-blocks='[["BL_520.8",520,[255,1790,1187,612]],["BL_521.1",521,[162,345,1182,870]]]'>The learned judge below applied this principle to the facts of this case, and herein he committed no error. The bank had no standing to assert that the money deposited to the credit of W. J. Alexander, deputy treasurer, did not belong to him; much less had it the right to apply $1,942.52 of this money to an overdraft of C. H. McAuley, treasurer. Granted that the money deposited by Alexander belonged to the county as a matter of fact, yet as between the bank and its depositor it was the money of the latter. It was in no sense ear-marked as county money. The fact that it was deposited to the credit of W. J. Alexander, deputy treasurer, did not so ear-mark it. For aught that appeared upon the books of the bank it might <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>have been as deputy treasurer of a building association. The most effect that could be claimed for the words “ deputy treasurer ” was an acknowledgment by Alexander that he held the money for some one else, and the other person not being designated, as between the bank and Alexander the money belonged to Alexander. The bank could not refuse his check unless at the demand of an attaching creditor or the true owner of the fund. It is equally true that the bank could not have paid out a dollar of this fund upon the check of McAuley the treasurer. The very object of the arrangement with Alexander, assuming the money to belong to the county, was to place it beyond the control of McAuley. If the latter could not draw it upon his check how can the bank apply it to cover MeAuley’s overdraft? It was gross negligence in the bank to allow the overdraft, and it cannot protect itself in this summary manner and deny its depositor’s check. The case is too plain to require further discussion.</p>
