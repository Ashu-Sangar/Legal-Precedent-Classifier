By § 25 of the same act, “no modification or repeal of this act shall affect any franchise obtained under the provisions of the same.” Under said sections the corporation in question became possessed of extensive franchises. As to contracts it was authorized to make, its powers were practically unlimited, and none of these powers which had become vested rights could be modified without trenching upon its charter contract as protected by said act as well as by the constitution of the United States. “ The legal remedies for the enforcement of a contract which belong to it at the time and place where it is made, are a part of its obligation. A state may change them, provided the change involve no impairment of a substantial right. If ... . the legislative ' acts of a state fall within the category last mentioned they are to that extent utterly void. They are, for all the purposes of the contract which they impair, as if they had never existed:” Gunn v.

At the time of its incorporation in 1876, the plaintiff company had the undoubted right under its charter to make its contracts of insurance in any form and subject to any conditions it pleased. There were no restrictions, either as to the subject matter ind form of its contracts or the legal remedies <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>to enforce them. Now, the act of 1881 not only attempts to establish a rule of evidence applicable to the enforcement of insurance contracts, but practically destroys its contracts, by providing that if they are not proven in a certain way they shall not be proven at all. In other words, after the execution of a perfectly legal contract by persons and parties who are sui juris, the act undertakes to say that you shall not have thei fruits of that contract unless you have executed it in a prescribed form, and have attached to it certain papers which do not necessarily constitute a part of it, and upon which the rights of the parties may in no wise depend.</p>

Whenever such a result is produced by the act in question, to that extent it is void. The states are no more permitted to impair the efficacy of a contract in this way than to attack its vitality in any other manner. Against all assaults coming from that quarter, whatever guise they may assume, the contract • is shielded by the constitution. It must be left with the same force and effect including the substantial means of enforcement which existed when it was made. The guarantee of the constitution gives it protection to that extent:” Walker v.

It does not impair in any sense the obligation of the contract between the company and the assured. It does not even impair the remedy. It affects only the evidence necessary to entitle the plaintiff to recover, by requiring the company, in all cases where the policy contains a reference to the application, to attach a correct copy of such application as signed by the applicant, to the policy, and “ unless so attached and accompanying the policy, no such application .... shall be received in evidence, in any controversy between the parties to, or interested in, the said policy, nor shall such application be considered a part of the policy or contract between the parties.” This affects merely the formalities to be observed in making proof of the contract. It is difficult to distinguish the act of 1881 in principle from an act requiring deeds and other instruments to be stamped, and that contracts for the sale of land shall be in writing. The act of 1881 was but the exercise <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>of the clearly recognized power of the state to regulate the mode by which contracts shall be made and proved.
