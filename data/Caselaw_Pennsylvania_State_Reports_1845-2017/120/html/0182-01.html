J. &amp; P. D. Harley, in the partnership name of P. D. Harley, for three years. On the 13th of January, 1883, the policy was renewed for three years. On the 18th day of September, 1884, P. D. Harley assigned all his interest in the property and the policy of insurance to D. J. Harley. The loss by fire occurred on the 14th of June, 1885. It is averred, substantially, that the defendants insured the property of a firm in the -firm name.

Where the policy only is assigned, and the property remains in the person to whom the policy is issued, an action may be brought in the name of the insured to the use of the assignee. In the absence of prohibitory provisions upon the subject, the insurer can have no objections to the use party. If the insured has a legal claim it is of no consequence to the insurer that the legal plaintiff has directed that the sum due when so recovered should be paid to another. But when the property insured has been assigned no action can be maintained in the name of the assignor. He has sustained no loss. The loss is that of the purchaser and owner of the property, and to enable him to recover he must aver and prove a contract to that effect with the defendant. If authority be needed for so plain a proposition it will be found in Wood on Insurance, 572-3-4. The defect in bringing the action in the firm name to the use of D. J. Harley can be cured by amendment. But the want of an averment of contract between D. J. Harley and the defendant cannot be now supplied in that manner. We have examined the narr. carefully and do not find a contract of indemnity by the defendant to D. J. Harley averred or any facts set forth which would justify such an averment. Where the property and the policy have both been assigned the company may accept the assignee in the place of the assignor, but to do so requires action of some sort upon their part. We can find nothing in the narr., whether taken separately or altogether, which amounts to a recognition of liability to D. J. Harley upon the policy in suit.</p>

    <p class="author" id="AjL" data-blocks='[["BL_225.7",225,[437,1735,490,34]]]'>Mr. Justice Stebbett:</p>
    <p id="b225-8" data-blocks='[["BL_225.8",225,[189,1787,1179,506]]]'>All questions of fact properly presented by the pleadings and evidence were definitively settled by the verdict in favor of plaintiff, and he is entitled to judgment thereon for the amount found by the jury, unless the declaration is radically defective, not in form but in substance. Merely formal defects amendable in the court below, may be treated as amended here. Judgment was arrested on the sole ground that the declaration is insufficient to support the verdict, and that action of the court below is the subject of complaint in the several specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b225-9" data-blocks='[["BL_225.9",225,[191,2301,1175,96]],["BL_226.1",226,[243,337,1185,715]]]'>As correctly stated by the learned president of the Common Pleas, it is substantially averred in the declaration that de<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>fendant company insured the property of the firm composed of D. J. and P. D. Harley, in the firm-name of “ P. D. Harley;” that afterwards P. D. Harley, one of the firm, assigned all his interest therein, together with the policy of insurance, to his copartner, D. J. Harley, and thereafter the loss by fire occurred. That loss was D. J. Harley’s, and, if it is substantially averred that he, as such assignee, had a contract of indemnity with the company defendant, the declaration is sufficient. Profert of the policy was made, but oyer was not craved. We must therefore look to the narr. for the terms of the contract: Steph. Pleading, 68-9; Bender v. Fromberger, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dall.%20436" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="4 Dall. 436">4 Dall. 436</a>, 440 ; in which it was held that, “ oyer not having been prayed, no part of the deed appears to the court, but that which the plaintiff has declared on. ”</p>
    <p id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[244,1060,1184,768]]]'>In this case the contract as set forth in the declaration is in substance that upon a “ valuable consideration, ” the defendant “ company should be hable to pay or make good to the said assured, their and his executors, administrators and assigns, all such loss or damage, not exceeding the insurance, as should happen by fire to the property as above specified.” This is preceded by the averment of assignment, September 18,1884, by P. D. Harley to D. J. Harley of “all his right and interest of, in and to the said assured property.....and also all his title and interest in said policy of insurance, and all advantages to be derived therefrom,” and followed by the further averment “that from the said 18th day of September, 1884, up to and including the day the same was lost, injured, and destroyed by fire.....he was the sole and exclusive owner of the insured property,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b226-10" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[244,1834,1183,353]]]'>The contract thus averred in the narr. — and under the pleadings we have no right to go outside of it — is substantially a contract of indemnity with the assignee, and, in the absence of any qualifying provision, must be so held. It follows therefore that the declaration exhibits a good cause of action, quite sufficient to sustain the verdict and justify the defendant company in paying the amount thereof.</p>
    <p id="b226-11" data-blocks='[["BL_226.6",226,[505,2196,920,239]]]'>Judgment reversed; and judgment is now entered against defendant on the verdict for five hundred and thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents, with interest, from January 15, 1887, the date of said verdict.</p>
