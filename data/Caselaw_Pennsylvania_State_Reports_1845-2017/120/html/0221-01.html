Unlike the statute of limitations, which merely affects the remedy by providing that no action can be maintained after the lapse of a certain number of years, § 7, act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 369, goes further, and deprives the owner of the ground-rent of his estate and gives it to another. It has been declared that the legislature could not divest the grantor of his estate in an irredeemable ground-rent, with all its provisions for taking his property under the guise of public use with compensation: Palairet’s App., <a href="/pa/67/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="67 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1022600" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0479-01">67 Pa. 479</a>.

The act is a statute of limitation operating on the remedy and does not impair the obligation of the contract. It presumes an extinguishment of the rent when no payment, claim or demand has been made for or on account of the same for the statutory period. The proviso to § 7 gives to the plaintiff the “ previous warning of his danger so as to enable him to guard against it,” referred to by the court in St. Mary’s Church v. Miles, <a href="/whart/1/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="1 Whart. 229" data-case-ids="1829033" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0229-01">1 Wh. 229</a>.

It is argued by plaintiffs that this ground-rent could only be extinguished by deed, and that therefore there could be no legal presumption of payment. That this is fallacious is apparent from the language of the covenant, which provides that upon payment of the principal of the rent and arrearages to the time of payment “then the said yearly rent hereby reserved shall forever thereafter cease and be extinguished and the covenant for payment thereof shall become void.” The payment, therefore, would of itself extinguish the rent without any formal deed of extinguishment or release, and, as has often <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>happened in Philadelphia, ground-rents have been paid off in this way, and no deed of extinguishment executed.

We cannot give that case the full effect claimed for it. An examination of it shows that the only question there argued was, whether the section of the act <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>referred to has a retrospective as well as a prospective operation. with regard to ground-rents. This appears in the first sentence of the opinion óf Justice Read. He very properly held that as the seventh section did not go into effect for three years, and gave ample time to all owners of ground-rents to make claims and demands for the same, so as to prevent the bar of the statute, that this prospective commencement made the retrospective bar not only reasonable but constitutional. In. other Avords the act gave ample time to preserve all existing rights.</p>
    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[157,877,1180,1181]]]'>I shall not attempt to show that statutes of limitation, which affect the remedy merely, are constitutional. There are some few legal principles which may bo regarded as settled, and this is one of them. If, therefore, the act of 1855 merely operates to deprive the owner of a remedy for the collection of his ground-rent after the expiration of twenty-one years from any suit, claim, or demand for the same, we cannot see any sufficient reason for holding that the act is unconstitutional. The plaintiffs, however contend that the act goes further, and not only takes away their remedy, but destroys their estate, and refer us to that portion of the seventh section which declares that “ a release or extinguishment thereof shall be presumed (after twenty-one years without demand, etc.), and such ground-rent, annuity, or charge shall thereafter be irrecoverable.” The most that can be made of this language is that it makes the ground-rent irrecoverable after the statutory period. After the lapse of twenty years mortgages, bonds, judgments, arrears of ground-rents, in fact all specialties, are presumed to be paid. But this is .a presumption of fact and liable to be rebutted; not a legal presumption, as was erroneously stated in Korn v. Browne, <a href="/pa/64/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="64 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="1021294" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0055-01">supra.</a> The act of 1855, in its application to ground-rents, made this presumption a legal presumption after twenty-one years, which cannot be rebutted.</p>

The payment of a mortgage and the extinguishment of a grount-rent mean substantially the same thing. The act was not intended to destroy the ground-landlord’s ownership in the rent; it does not impair <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>his title thereto; nor can it be said to impair the contract by which the rent was reserved, but from well-grounded reasons of public policy it declares that when the owner of such rent makes no claim or demand therefor for twenty-one years, it presumes it has been extinguished, which means nothing more than that it has been paid. The language cited, as before observed, affects only the remedy; if it meant more, it would be void for the excess.</p>
