It provides that no liquor can be sold, nor can any license be granted for its sale for drinking purposes within two miles of the State Normal School. The defendant is indicted for a violation of this act by selling within a radius of two miles of <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>this school. ■ Two questions are raised. One is perhaps a question of fact for the jury; and that is, whether wine has been sold, about which, however, the evidence is not conflicting. The evidence on the part of the commonwealth, and the testimony of the defendant, concur in the statement that he sold 'as wine a fermented liquor, containing at least two or three per centum of alcohol. The drink was made by taking three pounds of grapes or other fruit, and three pounds of sugar and a gallon of water, putting them together and allowing them to ferment. Defendant says the elements of the wine put together in August would be ready for sale in February. They would have gone through the necessary process of fermentation and settling. [Now, gentlemen, we are going to relieve you from any trouble about the question of fact in this case, and say to you that the object of this law was to prevent the sale of alcoholic drinks, and whether they had two per centum or ten or twenty is not the question upon which the guilt or innocence of the defendant depends.]4 [The object of this law was to protect the young men that are gathered at this institution, and to. prevent the formation of the drinking habit. We are going to instruct you that if you find this drink to have been alcoholic, whether it had two or ten per centum is a question with which you need not trouble yourselves. We instruct you that the sale of any alcoholic drink is a violation of this law.]3 This disposes fully of the first point submitted to us by defendant’s counsel.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[255,1681,1187,663]]]'>It is unnecessary for us to give the reason for our holding. It is however very easy for the jury to see that at one per centum at a time, the strength of this drink might be increased and the protective value of this statute might be utterly destroyed, if we were to hold any other rule than that we have held. The prohibition of this act is directed against the sale of alcoholic drinks and [whether one who has drank a quart of this wine has felt himself intoxicated by reason of it or not, it is unnecessary for us to inquire.]6 If this alcoholic drink or wine, made by the process of fermentation, resulted in the production of a certain amount of alcohol in the drink offered for sale as wine, we instruct you to regard it as within the provisions of this act of assembly.</p>

We have, <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>as has been well said by one of the counsel for the defendant, an almost incomprehensible system of license laws. It has been the result of legislative piece work, little at a time. Sometimes the legislature has gone forward and sometimes backward. It is very difficult to get at its true meaning under the present disconnected and inharmonious legislation; it is not such a complete and consistent system as a lawyer would like to find and we would be very glad to conform to. There are three kinds of persons who are permitted to handle intoxicating drinks. There is first the person who makes the drink. He is looked upon by the law simply as the manufacturer, and his right to sell is not obtained from the courts but by payment to the county treasurer. He sells to those who sell again. Then next after the manufacturer comes the seller by the quantity, properly called the retail dealer, more frequently spoken of as the wholesaler. He sells by the quart or gallon, or in any quantity above a quart, if the liquor be brewed or malt. This class -of dealers are forbidden to sell it to be used upon the premises. They sell and handle the article as dealers, and are supposed at least, not to come in contact with the consumer. Then comes the class of persons who actually consume or drink it. These may be either the hotel keeper, the restaurant or saloon keeper or the druggist. The hotel keeper may sell to persons who are his guests, persons who come to his bar; he may sell by the drink or pint. The druggist singularly enough, though forbidden by law, is rapidly becoming the great dealer in intoxicating drinks in the commonwealth, and 1 think as a rule we may say, without going at all beyond the bounds of what all men know to be true, utterly disregards and daily and habitually violates the law.</p>

The seller whether in hotel or restaurant, and the bottler, go to, the court for their licenses. We hear the application, and hear the objections to <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>it if there are any made, and their rights are settled by the several acts of the assembly! We are asked to say to you that the defendant in this case is a manufacturer, and we are inclined to think that is his actual position. He is not a keeper of a hotel, or restaurant, or a druggist. He is engaged in none of the kinds of business that would bring him under the class we have spoken of. If this question were raised outside of the two miles radius of the State Normal School we should affirm the second point; we should' say that the defendant as a manufacturer had the right to sell within the limits allowed by law to persons who bought and took away the unbroken packages, providing himself with no place where they could be drank, and being himself, as in this case, no way connected with the entertainment of the public. But we have to look at the purpose of this law, and the present inclination of our mind is to hold that the purpose of its framing was to prohibit the selling by anybody, manufacturer, distiller, or bottler, of intoxicating drinks in any form within two miles of the Normal School. While we regard the position taken by defendant’s counsel tenable under ordinary circumstances, as applicable to any other district in the county except this little circle, we are inclined to hold it is not applicable to that. And if we were otherwise to hold we should practically strike down all the protection which the legislature intended for that school. This is a question that is purely one of law. It is one that we can review. But for the present purposes of this trial we instruct you that the defendant had no right to sell within two miles of the State Normal School any form of alcoholic drink, whether he was hotel keeper, druggist or manufacturer; that the purpose of the act of 1867 was to protect absolutely the territory in the circle drawn, from the sale of intoxicating drinks for drinking purposes. If therefore, you believe the defendant sold wine to be drank anywhere within the two miles radius, your verdict ought to be, guilty in the manner and form as he stands indicted.</p>

L. 865, producers of cider and domestic wines, who are not otherwise engaged in the liquor traffic, are permitted to sell by the bottle without license, “ provided that such liquor is not drank upon the premises where sold, nor at any place provided by the seller for that purpose.”</p>

But the general law would not reach the case of this defendant, and perhaps others, who, as before observed, were protected by the act of 1858. It is manifest, <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>we think, that the purpose of the act of 1867 was to prohibit the sale of vinous liquors by this class of persons.

It contains two distinct subjects, and only one of them is referred to in the title. A saloon keeper in Mansfield, upon looking at the title, might fairly infer that the act would contain a section punishing him for selling after his license had expired. He would know in any event that he could be punished under the general law for selling without license. But how could this defendant, or a farmer, living within the radius, know, or what was there in the title to put him upon inquiry, that he could no longer sell the cider made from his own apples, or the wine from his own grapes, as he had been accustomed to do in the past ? What was the question of license or no license to him? He had never been required to take out a license to sell his own cider or wine by the bottle, and certainly he had no reason to suppose that an act, the title to which referred only to the prohibition of license, would in any way affect him.</p>

The first section is not open to this objection, so that the prohibition as to granting licenses within two miles of the Normal School remains in force ; and, while we sincerely regret, for the good of the children at the school, that the second section of the act of 1867 cannot be sustained, a partial remedy may perhaps be found in the present license law which prohibits the sale of vinous liquors to minors. I do not think that the eighth section of the act of April 20, 1858, was intended to authorize the sale of “ cider and domestic wines ” to children, by any one.</p>
