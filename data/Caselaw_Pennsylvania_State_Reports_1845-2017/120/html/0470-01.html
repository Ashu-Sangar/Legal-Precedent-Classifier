It seems that Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis, of Kendall borough, were the owners or had possession of a lot of land upon which they built an oil refinery. It is undisputed that they purchased lumber of Miller and Kennedy, under the firm name of Miller &amp; Company, for the use of this refinery, to be used in the construction of the refinery.</p>

It is not shown in evidence, but that is unquestionably the case, that Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis became embarrassed and there became judgment creditors, and among them was this defendant. An assignment was made by Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis, for the benefit of their creditors, to Alfred Short. The property was sold by the assignee under an order of court and converted into money, and the money was brought into court for distribution. An auditor was appointed by court to distribute this money to the lien creditors, whether by mechanics’ lien or judgment lien creditors, as they should be entitled to receive it under the law. This controversy here .now originated before the auditor.</p>

The auditor made a report to the court upon the subject, stating in effect that these two parties were claiming this money, and an issue was framed under the rules of practice of the court by which the matters involved were to go to the jury for determination, and that is really the question that you are here to try.</p>

The evidence discloses the fact that Mr. Kennedy was a silent partner, and Mr. Miller the recognized head, with absolute control of the business. Mr. Miller had previously shown that the agreement for the purchase of the lumber had been made with him, and Mr. Kennedy had also previously testified that he had not seen Childs or Loomis about the transaction, never had said a word to them about it, nor they to him.

They say, tank- and boiler-houses, pump- and tool-houses, barn, etc. The mechanics’ lien -law is purely a creature of statute, and cannot be extended beyond the limits prescribed. Individual cases of hardship occur. Sometimes the mechanic or the material man suffers; sometimes it is the owner of the fee. The statute leans toward neither: Reid v. Kenney, 4 W. N. 452; Tilford v.
