L. 547, entitled “ An act relating to the support and employment of the poor,” to procure the warrant of said justices authorizing the said directors to take and seize so much of the goods and chattels and receive so much of the rents, issues and profits of the real estate of Paul O. Decker, as in the judgment of the said justices should be sufficient to provide for his wife, Florence Decker, and to maintain and bring up his child, Pauline Decker. The justices made a finding, from the proofs submitted to them, that said Florence Decker was the lawful wife of said Paul O. Decker and the said Pauline Decker, his lawful child, the latter being twelve years of age; that in <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>November, 1875, said Paul O. Decker separated bimself from; his said wife without reasonable cause and deserted his said child, had ever since persisted in said separation and desertion, was not a resident of the commonwealth, and his said wife and child were in destitute circumstances and a charge upon the said county of Huntingdon. They further found that the said Paul O. Decker was the owner of a certain lot of ground in the borough of Huntingdon having thereon erected a large frame hotel building known as the “Washington House.” They therefore adjudged and decreed that the goods and chattels of said Paul O. Decker, and the rents, issues and profits of his-real estate, to an extent sufficient to provide for his said wife and to maintain and bring up his said child, were liable to be taken and seized by the said directors for that purpose and of right ought to be so applied. They therefore authorized the said directors to. take and seize so much of the goods and chattels and to receive so much of the rents, issues and profits of the real estate of the said Paul O. Decker as should amount to the sum of three hundred dollars each year, to be computed from October <em>22, </em>1887, and to continue during said separation and desertion, that being the sum which in the judgment of the said justices was requisite and sufficient to, etc. On the same day the said justices issued their warrant accordingly to the said directors, and on the same day the warrant was returned under oath that by virtue thereof the directors had seized and attached the rents, issues and profits of the real estate referred to, in the hands of the tenants, etc., and that said Paul O. ' Decker was not in the county and had no goods or chattels in said county.</p>

Conprobst, trustee, was filed, by the direction of the court, with copies of the will of Nicholas Decker, deceased, praying, for reasons <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>sufficiently appearing in the opinion of the court below, that said proceedings be dismissed, annulled, and set aside, etc.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[263,511,1186,97]]]'>On February 17, 1888, the court, Fürst, P. J., after argument, filed the following opinion and decree:</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[261,614,1186,196]]]'>There is nothing in the will of N. C. Decker exhibited to the court which would prevent the seizure of the rent of the real estate devised to the trustee of Paul O. Decker, arising out of the clause, that it shall not be liable for his debts.</p>
    <p id="b310-7" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[258,822,1189,714]]]'>If the claim of the directors was strictly a “ debt,” it is a very serious question whether the will of N. C. Decker was intended to cover subsequent debts. This claim is subsequent to the death of said N. C. Decker, and there is no expression in the will which expressly refers to future debts which Paul O. Decker might contract. But this claim is not in the nature of a debt. It is intended to apply the estate of Paul O. Decker to the support of his family, his wife and young child. The legal unity existing between husband and wife makes them one so far as support is concerned, and the parental relation is such that the offspring is considered his own household, and part and parcel of his own support. His estate, under the will of his father, was intended to be applied to their personal support, which embraces his wife and minor child.</p>
    <p id="b310-8" data-blocks='[["BL_310.7",310,[255,1543,1187,869]],["BL_311.1",311,[132,352,1180,252]]]'>The fourth item in the will provides that Thomas M. Conprobst, the trustee, shall every six months pay over to Paul O. Decker, or to the person he may designate, all the rents and profits of every kind, etc., of the lot designated as No. 215, in the borough of <em>Huntingdon; </em>and the trustee, with the written consent of said Paul O. Decker, shall have power to sell the said property, and invest the proceeds for the sole benefit of Paul O. Decker, or turn over the proceeds to Paul O. Decker, if he so demand, and this shall terminate the trust, etc.' This, in our opinion, gives Paul O. Decker such absolute or beneficial ownership of the property devised to him, and of the rents and profits thereof, that will warrant the seizing of the rents for the support of his family. When a husband and father is so devoid of a sense of his duty and the obligations resting upon him, by virtue of the marital relation, to support his wife and infant child, he cannot with any reason ask the court to assist him in avoiding this duty. If a father, pos<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>sessed of as much estate as this defendant seems to have, will permit his infant child to be cast upon the charities of the poor-house, and abandon and desert his wife without cause, he cannot be heard to complain against the law, which appropriates a part of his estate for their support.</p>

The will, besides, in apt language', creates for the sole use and maintenance of Paul O. Decker a “spendthrift trust.” Can there be any doubt upon this question? The fourth and sixth items of the will conclusively rebut any argument to the contrary. His honor, Judge Furst, by his decree, if affirmed by this court, would unsettle a rule of property in Pennsylvania, so firmly established that it could only be changed by legislation.

If the cestui que trust (so called for convenience, but not admitting that he is such), could receive any rents under this will, then, because of the legal unity of him and his wife and child, the wife and child are to receive said rents first, under § 29, act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 547. The regularity of the proceeding is unquestioned: Sterling v.

In all those cases the cestui que trust received the income, but the corpus of the estate descended to others. Under the will in this case the devise gives to Paul O. Decker, the rents to be collected for an indefinite period by a so-called trustee, but the trust to be terminated at the demand of the cestui que trust. A general devise with power to dispose of the corpus carries a fee: Second Ref. P. Church v.
