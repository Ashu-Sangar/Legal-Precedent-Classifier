    <p class="summary" id="b295-7" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[123,709,1182,818]]]'>We have said to you that a policy of life insurance is, in the eye of the law, a contract. We may say further, and more specifically, that a contract of life insurance is an agreement to pay a certain sum of money on the death of a person, in consideration of the duo payment of an annuity as provided in the policy, during his life. In all contracts of insurance, certain statements are made, stipulations entered into, certain provisos, conditions and by-laws introduced or referred to, and when made part of the policy, they become what is called and are so denominated in the law of insurance, warranties. By a warranty, the insured stipulates for the absolute truth of the statement or statements made, upon penalty of forfeiture of his own right and that of those coming after him, to recover in case of loss, should the statements prove untrue; in other words, the truth is a condition precedent to the right to recover the amount of a life insurance policy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b295-8" data-blocks='[["BL_295.7",295,[123,1537,1181,405]]]'>What is called the application for a life insurance-policy, is generally made a part of the policy, and enters into the contract, and therefore must be referred to. In the present case an application for insurance, or as it is called in this particular instance, for membership, in the U. B. Mutual Aid Society of Pennsylvania, was regularly made by Bernard O’Hara. In that application there are certain questions to which are appended his answers. The law applicable to such a case is this:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b295-9" data-blocks='[["BL_295.8",295,[123,1950,1181,456]],["BL_296.1",296,[287,349,1191,923]]]'>If the applicant makes a false answer as to having had any one of several diseases specially mentioned, although he does so innocently and from ignorance, he forfeits his right to recover the insurance which has been granted to him upon the faith of such answers, which become warranties, and the falsity of which vitiates the contract contained in the policy. Question It in the application in the present case is this: “ Have you ever been afflicted with or had any symptoms of the following diseases; ” mentioning a number of diseases to which <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>it' is not necessary to call your attention, but including the two that have become important in the present controversy, namely, dropsy and asthma; and to that question the applicant answered as appears from the application, “No.” No. 12 of the questions is this: “ Have you ever been afflicted with any other disease or complaint not above mentioned? If you have, state the nature and character of the disease or complaint.” To this also the answer is “ No.” The law applicable to question 12 is this: If there is no wilful misrepresentation in regard to other diseases, the policy is not vitiated, necessarily. There is a distinction in the law between the answer made to a question referring specifically to certain diseases, and to the case of a question referring in general terms to other diseases. In the first case, an inaccurate or false answer is fatal to the policy, although innocently made and in ignorance of the truth. In the second case, there must be shown, in order to vitiate the policy, a wilful misrepresentation. That, as we understand it, is the law in regard to that distinction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[281,1279,1189,923]]]'>[Question 13 is this: “Are your habits of life temperate? If so, have they always been so?” And the reply is “Yes.” Considerable evidence has been introduced on the part of the defendant, and also in rebuttal on the part of the plaintiffs, relative to this question. It is our duty to charge you upon this subject, to define the meaning of this question. The question is not, “Do you drink liquor?” Or, “Are you a total abstainer from the use of intoxicating drink ? ” But is it the custom and habit of your life to refrain from intemperance and intoxication? It is doubtful whether there would be much life insurance business carried on successfully, on any contract more stringent than the one which we interpret this to be. A man who works in the mines day after day, promptly and regularly, who supports his family comfortably, and lives an orderly and respectable life in all regards, is not to be pronounced an intemperate man or a man of intemperate habits, upon evidence that he occasionally has indulged in the use of intoxicating drink.] 4</p>

You observe that the question is a duplex one. “Have you had any medical attendance within the last year, prior to this date? If so, for what disease?” This clearly imports that the attendance of a medical man referred to must have reference to some disease, which means some serious illness of any description you choose; something requiring attention from a medical man, a disease. To illustrate what I mean I will refer to a case in which the question was as to whether a party applying for insurance had ever had a hemorrhage, and he answered “No.” The defence was made to the policy, that he had had nose bleed, which in a strict interpretation is a hemorrhage. But the court said that such an interpretation of that clause in the contract would be absurd and ridiculous, and refused to entertain it as a defence.]1.....</p>

    <p id="b300-7" data-blocks='[["BL_300.7",300,[234,1080,1181,146]]]'>These cases were tried together in the court below, were argued together here, and may be disposed of in one opinion. The questions are alike in each.</p>
    <p id="b300-8" data-blocks='[["BL_300.8",300,[230,1234,1184,715]]]'>The actions were debt on policies of insurance. The defence was that the assured had made false answers to certain interrogatories contained in the application. In the policy or certificate of membership, it was expressly stipulated that if any answers or representations made by O’Hara, the assured, in his application, should be found in any respect untrue, then the certificate should be null and void. It was alleged by the defendant company that in his application O’Hara stated that his habits of life were temperate, and that he had never been afflicted with asthma, or dropsy, or any other disease, and that he had not had any medical attendance during the year prior to his application, and that he had no family physician. The company alleged that these representations were untrue, and took upon itself the burden of establishing their untruth.</p>
    <p id="b300-9" data-blocks='[["BL_300.9",300,[229,1957,1183,456]],["BL_301.1",301,[144,347,1187,1697]]]'>In the third and tenth assignments complaint is made that the court below excluded certain evidence offered to prove that the assured was a man of intemperate habits. Referring'to the tenth assignment, the witness upon the stand was asked the question: Did you ever see Mr. O’Hara under the influence of liquor ? This was objected to, and was ruled out by the court for the reason that “ the habit of life means something more than one drink.” The remark of the learned judge was entirely accurate, but it was not a sufficient reason <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>for excluding tlie evidence. It was a link in the chain which might or might not have been followed up by sufficient other evidence to establish a habit of intemperance. The defendant was entitled to make a beginning in its proofs, and when its evidence was all in it would be for the jury, under proper instructions from the court, to say whether it was sufficient to establish a habit. The further question was then asked of the witness whether he ever saw O’Hara drink more than once. This was objected to by plaintiffs’ counsel for the reason that the question should be put in the language of the application, and the objection was sustained by the court. If the witness had stated, in the language of the application, that O’Hara was a man of intemperate habits, it would have been at best a mere opinion of no possible value unless the jury had the facts before them of which it was predicated. Men may differ widely as to what constitutes intemperate habits. Some persons of extreme views may regard the slightest indulgence as intemperance ; others, perhaps, would regard a man as sober as long as he can walk. The provision in the policy has no reference to extreme views on either side. It seeks to ascertain whether the habits of the assured are so far intemperate as to increase the risk. Hence if it be shown as was attempted (see third assignment) that the assured was in the habit of getting intoxicated for three or four days after each pay day; that upon such occasions “ he came home and behaved uproariously, just as an uproarious drunken man does, and abused his family,” it is certainly a link in the chain of evidence tending to show habits of intemperance. When it is alleged that a man is drunk his behavior becomes material, even to the abuse of his family, as it is his conduct from which the jury must, to a considerable extent, draw their conclusions in regard to his condition. We think it was error to exclude the evidence referred to in these assignments.</p>
    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[150,2052,1180,347]],["BL_302.1",302,[260,344,1179,201]]]'>Another branch of the defence was that the assured was afflicted with asthma. It was not error to refuse to allow the company to prove this by an inexpert witness. (See fifth assignment.) But when the same witness was asked whether O’Hara was afflicted with shortness of breath, the question should have been allowed. It referred to a matter of fact. The witness had worked with O’Hara; he could tell whether <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>he had ever observed his shortness of breath without any medical knowledge. The question did not refer to the assured’s disease (asthma), but to one of its symptoms which is visible to the inexpert eye.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[257,552,1185,972]]]'>We regard the answer to the defendant’s sixth point as misleading. The point was: “ If the jury find that Bernard O’Hara had had any medical attendance within the year prior to his making said application, then the plaintiff cannot recover.” The learned judge affirmed this point as qualified in his general charge. An examination of the general charge does not furnish an adequate answer to the point. The eighth interrogatory in the application is : “ Have you had any medical attendance within the last year prior to this date ? If so, for what disease ? Give name and address of the doctor in full.” The object of this interrogatory is manifest. If the assured had no medical attendance within the time prescribed, and so answers, that is the end of it. But1 if he had such attendance, then the company is entitled to know for what cause he had medical advice or aid, and the name and address of the doctor, in order that they may ascertain the particulars from him. And if the assured falsely answer that he had no medical attendance, he is not entitled to recover. It follows that the point in question should have been affirmed.</p>
