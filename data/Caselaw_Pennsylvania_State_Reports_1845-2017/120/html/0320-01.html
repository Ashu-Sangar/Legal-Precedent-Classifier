It came to the relief of the husband and gave him a remedy which he did not have before, and which the wife did have as against him. The words “ indignities to the person ” of the act of 1815, 6 Sm. L. 286, are in the alternative or in grammatical apposition to the words “ cruel and barbarous treatment; ” and the <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>latter are equally effective, provided they are sufficient to “ render condition intolerable and life burdensome.” Hence they should be considered as substantially synonymous. “ Indignities to the person ” furnish the actual definition of “ cruel and barbarous treatment,” and “ cruel and barbarous treatment ” is an “ indignity to the person,” or is a series of such indignities as meet the end sought after, provided they both or either render “ condition intolerable and life burdensome.”</p>

Gordon v.

The criticism, or rather the construction, given to the act of 1854 by the learned justice, who wrote the opinion of the court, was not necessary to the judgment of the court and may therefore be considered an obiter dictum. In J ones v. J ones, supra, the syllabus simply says-: “ The act of 1854 does not require that the treatment to be a ground for a divorce should include indignities to the person,” and “ the treatment to the husband as a ground of divorce is that which renders his condition intolerable and life burdensome, which includes those acts that endanger life.”</p>

The evidence brought up will hear us out in the position that this cause was heard and argued, in the court below, on the merits, and as if the libel had originally charged cruel and barbarous treatment such as to endanger the libellant’s life and render his condition intolerable and life burdensome. In such a case, this court even after error brought will allow the proper amendment: Waite v.

It is unnecessary to add that there is no provision any<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>where made for an appeal from the amount of alimony fixed by the court. The amount to be fixed is like the assessment of unliquidated damages for a tort, or for the breach of a contract by a jury. It is final. There must be a decree for alimony for some amount, because the law says so; but the amount is left to the discretion of the judge, and from this there is no appeal: Breinig <em>v. </em>Breinig, <a href="/pa/26/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="26 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="977362" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0161-01">26 Pa. 161</a>. In the case before us this discretion was exercised in the only way worthy, for the evidence showed that the libellant was practically insolvent and his financial condition has been growing worse and worse yearly.</p>

    <p id="b363-6" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[153,1025,1179,397]]]'>This decree must be reversed. The libellant alleges as his grounds for divorce <em>(a) </em>desertion, and (5) indignities to his person, etc. It is sufficient to say, briefly, that the desertion was not proved; nor was there even an attempt to prove it. The respondent did not leave her home ; on the contrary, she has continued to reside in it with her children down to the present time. If there was any desertion, it was on the part of the libellant.</p>
    <p id="b363-7" data-blocks='[["BL_363.7",363,[151,1440,1181,250]]]'>The other ground for divorce is, that the wife offered such indignities to the person of the husband as to render his condition intolerable and life burdensome. The act of assembly does not authorize a divorce for this cause at the suit of the husband. It must be on the application of the injured wife.</p>
    <p id="b363-8" data-blocks='[["BL_363.8",363,[146,1699,1182,508]]]'>A motion was made at bar for leave to amend the libel by inserting an averment of cruel and barbarous treatment by the wife. We declined to allow the amendment for the reason that it made a change in the cause of action, requiring for its support a different line of proof. The libellant could have amended below, when, if the respondent was of opinion that additional evidence was required to meet the new charge, she would have had an opportunity to introduce it. It would be unjust to allow the amendment at this stage of the proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b363-9" data-blocks='[["BL_363.9",363,[146,2215,1181,249]]]'>The most remarkable feature of the case was the refusal of the court below to allow the respondent either alimony pendente lite, or counsel fees and expenses. The rule of May 25, 1887, for counsel fees and temporary alimony was discharged. The permanent alimony was fixed at one dollar per annum.</p>

He is the owner of lands, farms, mills, and houses, and is engaged in business. He forced this litigation upon his wife, and she is compelled to employ counsel and incur large expenses in defending herself. The printing of her paper-book alone cost $129.75. To deny her the means to défend herself is to deny her justice. The refusal of the court below to make any allowance for her counsel fees and expenses, was such a palpable abuse of discretion that we will correct it here.</p>

It will be the duty of the court below to enforce this decree.</p>
