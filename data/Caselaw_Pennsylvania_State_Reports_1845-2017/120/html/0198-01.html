    <p id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[259,461,1186,870]]]'>The city of Reading was incorporated previous to the passage of the new constitution. In conformity with § 57 of the act of May 28, 1874, P. L., 269, it accepted the provisions of said act, August 4,1874. On January 25,1886, a municipal lien, for an assessment laid for grading a street, was filed against real estate owned by the defendant, and on September 18, 1886, a scire facias was issued for its collection. The said act of 1874 provides that “the corporate powers and the number, character, powers and duties of the officers of cities of the first and second classes and those of the third class, now in existence by virtue of the laws of this commonwealth, shall be and remain as now provided by law, except where otherwise provided by this act.” It is admitted, however, that previous to this act there was no authority for such an assessment and lien. The constitutionality of said § 57 of the act is assailed by defendant, who asks that the lien be stricken from the record and the proceedings thereunder quashed.</p>
    <p id="b238-6" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[259,1338,1186,1074]],["BL_239.1",239,[165,347,1193,1070]]]'>Whatever doubts may have been entertained upon this subject, we feel constrained to say, are settled by the Appeal of Scranton School District, <a href="/pa/113/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="113 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="457569" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0176-01">113 Pa. 176</a>, and we hold that the 57th section co7nes within the constitutional prohibition of special legislation “regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs or school districts.” We see no difference in principle between this and the section of the act of March 18, 1875, P. L. 15, declared unconstitutional in the above cited case. Whether the law shall apply is optional in both cases, and the prohibition and restriction of its provisions equally strong in both, without proper acceptance by councils. The criterion as to constitutionality seems clear and plain. The classification of cities under the act of 1874 was held constitutional because of its generality. The rule laid down applied to every case. There were no exceptions. Wherever the provisions of an act are compulsorily binding upon- every city of the particular classification, the legislation is general and constitutional. Wherever the provisions are binding at the option of the local authorities, the legislation is special, local and unconstitutional. It is the compulsorily binding character of the law upon all alike in the classification, that <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>gives it constitutional life. As was said in Scranton Sell. Dist.’s Appeal: “Whether the methods prescribed by the act shall be the law will depend, not upon the terms of the legislation, but upon the will of others who are not lawmakers at all, and what may be the law in one city of the third class may not be the law in another city of the same class. The practical result is the same. The law will be limited to the one or more cities that do accept, and that makes it local. If. local results either are or may be produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against the provisions of the constitution and is ■void.” With this section held unconstitutional the councils of the city acquired none of the powers conferred by § 20 of the act, clause 32, or § 37. For, power and authority to grade, assess and lien are given only to “the said cities of the third class coming under the provisions of this act.” Everywhere it is apparent that only the city thus coming under the act by acceptance under § 57, or by special charter under §§ 14-18, are contemplated by the act. This legislative intention is expressly shown by a reading of §§ 35, 39, 40, 56, 58 and 59 of the act, wherein reference is made to such acceptance or charter.</p>
    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[167,1436,1182,972]],["BL_240.1",240,[228,354,1185,660]]]'>But it is contended that the lien, assessment and scire facias are made valid by § 2, article XXIII., act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 261, dividing cities into seven classes. This section reads: “ All taxes levied or assessments made in any of said cities of the fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh classes, within five years next preceding the date of the approval of this act, are hereby made valid, and said cities are hereby authorized and empowered to collect the same in the manner provided by this act for the collection of taxes and assessments.” Whilst true it is that, as early as Hepburn v. Curts, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%20300" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 W. 300">7 W. 300</a>, and Schenley v. Allegheny, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Pa.%2057" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="36 Pa. 57">36 Pa. 57</a>, it has been held “ the legislature may pass retrospective laws such as in their operation may affect suits pending, and give a party a remedy he did not possess, modify an existing remedy, or remove an impediment in the way of legal proceedings,” the important qualification was nevertheless attached that such laws must not violate any constitutional prohibition. The general assembly cannot by an enabling act indirectly make that constitutional which directly is prohibited as unconstitutional. Such legislation is <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>just as obnoxious as tbe original act. This very point has also been decided in other states. In Iowa it was held that the legislature cannot validate void special legislation: Stange v. Dubuque, <a href="/iowa/62/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="62 Iowa 303" data-case-ids="8664851" data-case-paths="/iowa/62/0303-01">62 Ia. </a><em><a href="/iowa/62/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="62 Iowa 303" data-case-ids="8664851" data-case-paths="/iowa/62/0303-01">303</a>; </em>and in Wisconsin it was held that a legislature cannot give validity, by ratification or curative law, to past defective proceedings by officers or municipalities. If it has not the power to authorize such proceedings directly, its power to ratify is subject to whatever limits describe its power to grant authority, and, therefore, after a constitutional amendment has forbidden it to pass a special law for the collection of taxes, it cannot cure defective proceedings under a previous special law: Kimball v. Rosendale, <a href="/wis/42/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="42 Wis. 407" data-case-ids="11284774" data-case-paths="/wis/42/0407-01">42 Wis. 407</a>. To the same effect is Cain v.

This decision, to some extent we take it, overrules Scranton Sch.

But let us suppose that § 57, of the act of 1874, offends .against the constitution, would not the special tax or assessment levied in this case be validated by § 2, article XXIII., act of May 24, 1887, P.

The legislature, when it inserted said section in the act of 1887, was exercising simply a legislative function, and courts cannot interfere therewith or revise such exercise except when clearly warranted by the constitution.

No rule of law, outside of this section, can be alleged that would give the assessments made under § 20 of the act the force of liens upon the real estate, as well as of charges against the individual owning the same.

But it is urged that the option clause of § 57, may be unconstitutional and yet the act itself be sustained; indeed, that, if that clause is of no effect, the act must then be construed a general law, universally obligatory from its date.

The plain language of the section referred to certainly does not go beyond the assessment.
