L. 580, that a writ of foreign attachment will not lie if the defendant be within the county when the writ is issued, applies only to a case where there is but one defendant. The language is, “ if any person,” etc. Moreover, it has been decided by this court, in construing this act, that such writ does not issue against co-partners when one is out of the jurisdiction and one within it, but applies only to a case where they are jointly liable but not <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>severally: White’s Case, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.%20217" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 W. 217">10 W. 217</a>. And further: we contend that the phraseology of the act under which the writ in this case issued, “ not being within the county in which such writ shall issue at the time of issuing thereof,” applies to a case where a defendant has no known residence in the county, because otherwise no writ could safely go out without the plaintiff first ascertaining that the defendant was not in the jurisdiction. It has been decided that though defendants were non-residents but had a place of business here and a clerk upon whom .process could be served, foreign attachment was the proper remedy: Chase v. Ninth N. Bank, <a href="/pa/56/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="56 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1009179" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0355-01">56 Pa. 355</a>. Besides : it is admitted that two members of the firm were nonresidents and out of the jurisdiction; the attachment binds the firm assets as well as the interests of these two members ; consequently, before this rule can be made absolute, the defendants must show that all three defendants were within the jurisdiction when the writ issued.</p>

Depositions cannot be read in support of a rule to quash. A rule to quash is not a matter of discretion. It is a finality. It forcibly puts the plaintiffs out of court and ends their proceedings for matter appearing of record, thus differing from a rule to dissolve for cause shown dehors the record, which latter proceeding is a matter of discretion: Steel v.

The defendants deny that any agreement was made by wlfich the plaintiffs were to have a preference. Thus the question was one of fact, passed upon by the court below.

One of the defendants was within the county when the writ issued. If this were so, and the wiit was improvidently issued, how is the doctrine of estoppel applicable to the statutory remedy? Moreover, it does not appear that it is essential to the quashing of the writ-that the defendants should actually be in court. The stat<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>ute makes no provision which obliges the defendants to enter an appearance: Burns v. Bowers, 3 W.

    <p id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[264,758,1185,872]]]'>The record brought up by the writ of certiorari in this case is brief and simple. It shows that a writ of foreign attachment was regularly issued at the suit of the plaintiffs in error against the defendants in error, and the sheriff’s return thereon. It also shows a motion to quash, and the order of the court below quashing the writ. Beyond this we have nothing on the record. The assignments of error relate to the action of the court in mailing the order quashing the attachment, and allege that the evidence before the court was insufficient to justify the order. But the evidence is not before us. It is true that it is printed in the paper-book of the plaintiffs in error, but as it is no part of the record, we cannot look into it: Brown v. Ridgway, <a href="/pa/10/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="10 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="962777" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0042-01">10 Pa. 42</a>; Bain v. Funk, <a href="/pa/61/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="61 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="428670" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0185-01">61 Pa. 185</a>. It was taken not to be submitted to a jury, but simply for the information of the court upon a motion for summary relief addressed to the discretion of the court. No bill of exceptions can be taken to its admission in such a ease: Bain v. Funk, supra.</p>

We cannot review the ordinary exercise of discretionary powers by the court. If we should attempt that, there would be no discretionary power left to the lower courts. In disposing of exceptions to the service of a writ of summons or attachment, in the continuance of causes, and in many other things, this power of the court is indispensable to the proper conduct of the business before it. As was said by Gibson, J., in the Union Canal Co. v. Keiser, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Pa.%20137" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="19 Pa. 137">19 Pa. 137</a>, motions addressed “ to the discretion of a judge are determinable by him exclusively, for we would be incompetent to judge how far he ought to have believed the witnesses.” But the precise point raised by the plaintiffs in error has been distinctly ruled against <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>them by this court, and it has been held that the action of the court below on a motion to quash a writ of foreign attachment is not the subject of review: Lindsley v. Malone, <a href="/pa/23/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="23 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="974093" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0024-01">23 Pa. 24</a>; Brown v.
