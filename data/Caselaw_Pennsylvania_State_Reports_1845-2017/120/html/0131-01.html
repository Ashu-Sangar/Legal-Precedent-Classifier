It is the duty of the buyer to look at the records before he bids, or he will be affected by all defects in the right of action and the conduct of it, of which inquiry and inspection would have informed him. If the plaintiff had examined the registry of real estate as returned to the survey department, he would have discovered that the title to the property in dispute was in the grantor of the defendant; that the property had been sold two years and a half previously, at a sheriff’s sale, for a sum which apparently discharged the tax claim; and if he had gone to the sheriff’s docket or inquired of the sheriff, he would <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>have learned that the claim was discharged as to three fourths of it, and that, notwithstanding all this, the property was to be sold on a judgment four years old, which was entered prior to the former sheriff’s sale, without giving credit for the amount realized at the former sale, and without notice or warning to the registered owner.</p>

This we think is too strict a construction of the act of 1865. The words are, “ no property so returned shall be subject to sale for taxes thereafter to accrue as a lien of record thereon, except in the name of the owner as returned,” etc. If we dwell upon the words “ subject to sale ” they would seem to indicate that the owner at the time of the sale should be warned. Perhaps this would be too liberal a construction in all cases, but in turning away from it we should not run into the other extreme and give the words “ thereafter to accrue as a lien of record thereon ” too narrow a construction in cases in which the property had been previously sold by the sheriff, and the deed to the vendee was registered at the time of the second sale, although it was not registered on the day the scire facias was issued on the claim. On the contrary we should give them, such a construction as will protect sheriff’s vendees who have complied with the registration act before the second sale, when the registered owner is not served with process to execute it, by holding purchasers subject to such defences as notice, if given, would have called forth or concluded. Notice in this case would have shown that after the entry of the judgment for taxes there had been a sheriff’s sale of the property which prima facie discharged the whole of the tax claim, and legally discharged there fourths of it; that four years had elapsed since the judgment was entered, and that, notwithstanding the defences thus shown, the property was about to be sold for the whole of the tax claim without reduction and without notice to the registered owner. Under these circumstances, we think the purchaser at the first sale might safely rest upon the prima facie discharge of the tax claim, and that before execution was issued the registered owner should have been warned to show <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>cause why the property should not be taken in execution on the tax claim, and made “ subject to sale,” a second time, and that the failure to warn him is fatal to the title of the plaintiff.</p>

This would undoubtedly be correct if the taxes for which the land was sold accrued “ as a lien of record thereon,” after the date of said registration in 1867; but such was not the fact. The taxes were assessed in 1860, filed against Ryan and Walton, owners, etc., in 1865, and judgment regularly entered therefor on the scire facias in February, 1866, nearly a year before Rhoads purchased and registered his deed. In no sense, therefore, did the taxes accrue thereafter as a lien of record. On the contrary, they became a lien and were in judgment before the sheriff’s sale at which Rhoads purchased. Indeed, after payment of costs out of the proceeds of sale, the residue, §33.25, was applied to the tax lien, leaving about §12.40 thereof still unpaid, and, of course, the lien thereof undisturbed. Rhoads and those who succeeded to his title are presumed to have known that the tax lien was still in force as to that unpaid balance, and that the premises were liable to bo sold therefor at any time. It was therefore their <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>duty to have paid the same without further notice. In Simons v. Kern, <a href="/pa/92/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="92 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="490979" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0455-01">92 Pa. 455</a>, it was said it is the duty of a purchaser at sheriff’s sale to see that the authority to sell exists. The' record in this case shows the sale at which plaintiffs purchased was authorized; and there appears to be no escape from the conclusion that the title under which defendants claim was divested by that sale.</p>
    <p id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[498,713,922,198]]]'>Judgment reversed; and judgment is now entered on the case stated in favor of the plaintiffs for the premises described therein, with six cents damages and costs.</p>
