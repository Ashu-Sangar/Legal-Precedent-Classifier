Hunsicker, to whom Holloway had sold it, whereupon Hunsicker inspected it, found it spoiled and refused to receive it. The corn in the middle of the car and the top of the load, from four to six inches in depth, was good, and the remainder, being about one third of the whole, was heated and spoiled to such an extent that it <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>stuck together in lumps.

Jacoby accepted the offer “for one car of corn,” simply, and at once shipped it and drew on Holloway <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>for the price, and Holloway accepted and paid the draft and received and disposed of the corn without any notice to Jacoby of its defective condition. This ended it; the contract was executed. The corn being spoiled and not, therefore, good salable corn, Holloway might have refused to receive it, and had he done so and promptly notified Jacoby of its rejection, he would have had his action to recover back the amount of the draft paid; for, having bought it upon condition that it was good salable corn, he was not bound to take corn of an inferior quality. Yet, as he not only received and disposed of it, but never gave any notice to Jacoby of its defective quality until two months after its delivery, he must be taken to have waived the condition upon which he bought.</p>

The finding to the effect that the corn was so arranged that at the door in the middle of the car and over the top where it could be seen, it was good, and the covered parts that could not be seen, were almost rotten and worthless, was a finding of knowledge on the part of the defendant; for this arrangement could by no possibility have been the result of accident. It is an unmistakable finding of design; and, if the defendant know the corn when shipped was bad, and the arrangement of it in the car was designed by him, then the plaintiff was entitled to recover: Ryan v. Ulmer, <a href="/pa/108/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="108 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="539234" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0332-01">108 Pa. 332</a>. Moreover, the facts found by the referee, if not a finding of knowledge of the quality of the corn on defendant’s part, was virtually a finding of <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>such gross negligence as is the equivalent of fraud, abundantly-sufficient to supply the place of knowledge.</p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.4",624,[273,442,1187,911]]]'>2. Was there, then, a warranty in the acceptance of the plaintiff’s order by the defendant ? If so, it was not necessary for the plaintiff to re-deliver or tender the corn to the defendant before bringing suit: Borrekins v. Bevan, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20R.%2023" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 R. 23">3 R. 23</a>. It is conceded that the mere fact of sale implies no warranty of quality, but only of title.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a> The offer comes from the defendant, and the plaintiff writes that he wifi give 53 cents per bushel, provided it is good salable corn. The defendant answers, “I will accept <em>your </em>offer for one car of corn,” and immediately ships it. The order was in clear, unmistakable terms, and by its acceptance the defendant warranted the corn to be in accordance with the order. Furthermore the vendee, relied entirely on the judgment and good faith of the vender; there was no opportunity for inspection; the draft was paid immediately for the accommodation of the vender. In such a case, if the terms of the contract fall short of an express warranty, the doctrine of implied warranty should be carried to its utmost limit.</p>

The word “ warrant ” is not so technical that it may not be supplied by others. A contract to deliver goods of a defined quality is as capable of enforcement as any other contract: Mining Co. v. Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Pa.%2065" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="108 Pa. 65">108 Pa. 65</a>; Benj. on Sales, 4th Am. ed., 613 n.; Warren v. Phila.

If the referee has intelligently and fairly passed upon the evidence, why shall his findings be disturbed? The defective condition of the corn at the time of delivery, if any existed, was not discoverable even upon inspection by the defendant or those who handled it. The defect was latent, and this was the finding of the referee. The appearance and condition of the corn, in the car at Collegeville, can no more impute a guilty knowledge to the defendant than it can set aside the positive testimony of those who handled it at Kerrsville. The apparent <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>inconsistency is reconciled, not maintained, by the referee. Every fact and inference, therefore, negatives the idea of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation on the part of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[167,504,1181,357]]]'>2. There was no express warranty and none can arise by implication under the facts found. The sale at most was conditional. If, then, the corn was not as contracted for, it was the plain duty of the plaintiff to reject it and notify the defendant. The law as ruled in Wetherill v. Neilson, <a href="/pa/20/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="20 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="972336" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0448-01">20 Pa. 448</a>, and Ryan v.

If you accept, consign to Collegeville, Pa.,” etc. The defendant replied: “ Will accept your offer for one car load of corn,” etc. The acceptance of plaintiff’s offer was an agreement to send him a car load of good salable corn, and not a car load of corn generally, without any regard to quality, as was assumed by the referee. The fact was found that a large portion of the corn was spoiled when delivered. It had heated during transportation or prior thereto. It is difficult to see how this could have occurred during the six days required for the transportation, as it was shipped in March; but with this we have nothing to do, and upon this point we accept the finding of the referee. We are of opinion that there was an implied warranty that the corn was good, salable corn. It was this the plaintiff bought, and the corn delivered was not of this description. Much of it was so badty damaged as to be almost worthless. The plaintiff sold it as best he could and brought this action to recover the amount of his loss. We are of opinion he is entitled to recover. In the case of a warranty, a re-delivery is not necessary: Borrekins v.
