A few days after, on the afternoon of May 6,1882, two of these patrolmen, Hutchinson and Koochogey, went with a one-horse wagon to bring the tarpaulins away. They folded them up into bundles in the fourth story. Instead of putting them on a hoist, which ran up and down a large hatchway immediately alongside, and which was worked easily by the ropes, they determined to pitch them out of the window upon the pavement. Koochogey was stationed on the pavement to give notice to passers-by, so that they might not be struck by the tarpaulins; Hutchinson remained in the fourth story to throw them out.

The law says that, in such a case, the employer is responsible for the wrongful and tortious acts of the servant, and it is grounded upon that principle that this action is sought to be maintained; a principle well established in our law, and one that must be accepted by the jury as governing and controlling the right of the plaintiffs to bring this suit, and the right of the plaintiffs to recover, if they have shown to you by the evidence in the cause that the injury which was inflicted upon Mr. Boyd and resulted in his death, was the result of the careless and negligent conduct of the servants and employees of the defendant while they were acting and serving in the course of their business as the employees of the defendant.</p>

That is, one person, sued with others or another one or with two or more others, has a judgment entered against him; the allegation upon the part of the defendant is, that this judgment is conclusive as to the right to recover against the co-defendants. I think it is sufficient to say as to that proposition, which is embodied in quite a number of the points of the defendant which I have before me, that the Supreme Court have had that question before them, and they have sent it down to be tried again as against this very defendant, the Insurance Patrol of the city of Philadelphia. Independent of all other considerations, the fact that when this.case went to the Supreme Court they affirmed the judgment that was entered as against one of <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>the defendants, sustained the action of the court in entering a nonsuit as to one other of the defendants, and sent the case down for trial again as to the defendant the Insurance Patrol with instructions that additional evidence should be given besides that which was given in the trial of the cause when it went up to the Supreme Court, in order to determine the character of this corporation — not only that which appeared upon the face of the charter and was disclosed by the charter, but by other evidence to show what was the true working and the real purpose and true object for which this corporation was chartered, so that the Supreme Court might pass upon the question which was raised before them, as to whether this was in truth and in fact, as it was contended, and as the court below thought, under the case as it then stood, a charily, holding that the property of a charity company could not be taken in execution to satisfy a judgment obtained against the employees of that charity — it is not necessary for us to go further upon this point of the case than to say that we are acting in obedience to and under the direction of the Supreme Court to try this case as against this Insurance Patrol, and we are doing nothing but obeying the proper order of that court, and could do nothing else; it would be an improper thing not to go on and try the case against this defendant.</p>

But we have a very different case before us now. We have not only the charter, but we have the evidence which has been presented to the jury showing how this organization called the Insurance Patrol of Philadelphia came into existence in the first place. It was as a voluntary association together by the representatives of the fire insurance companies of the city of Philadelphia. The object being, as they said, to preserve and protect life when in danger by fire, and also to protect property when in danger by conflagration. [That corporation was afterward incorporated, and the evidence upon which the plaintiffs rely now as having established clearly that this is in the eye of the law not a charity, at least not such a charity as will protect it from responsibility for the acts of its agents, has been given to the jury with very considerable detail. The result of that testimony, it may be briefly stated, has been to show that the main object for which this association was originally formed, the main object for which it was afterwards incorporated, the main object it has in view in continuing its existence from year to year, is to benefit in a pecuniary point of view the insurance companies who contribute and thereby become members of the corporation, who contribute to the support of this Insurance Patrol.</p>

They send out their agents, who go to fires and who protect property as far as they are able to protect it. They are entitled to do just what they undertake to do. That is, to protect or to save life and to protect property; but they are in subordination, so far as their own actions at fires are concerned, to the Fire Department of the city of Philadelphia. It does not alter the case that this Insurance Patrol and the Fire Department of the city of Philadelphia, as a rule, have worked in harmony, and perhaps have always done so, in the extinguishment of fires. The fact remains that by the charter itself this organization or this corporation is put aside when the authorities of the Fire Department of the city undertake to exercise au<a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>thority. Then it is the duty of tins corporation to stand aside. They cannot in any way interfere with the orders or with the directions of the chief engineer or fire marshal of the city of Philadelphia. So that it does not at all alter the character' of this corporation, that their object is to save property and to save life. I mean so far as this case is concerned. I take it that there can be no charity such as would exempt it from liability to answer for the wrongful acts of its servants, except that which is a pure and simple charity. Nor do I think that it makes any difference whether this pecuniary benefit received by the parties who claim to be protected under this principle of law is a direct or indirect benefit.] <em>a</em>

There are no profits and no dividends distributed among the corporators of this Insurance Patrol; but according to the testimony of several of the witnesses, the great and principal object for which it exists is, that it may benefit pecuniarily the insurance companies who, by their contributions, support it and keep it in existence. It seems to me that whenever a corporation, claiming to be a charity, puts itself in the position before the law of saying that, however commendatory the saving of life and property may be, yet that great object of its existence is to make money for some persons, and that they are to receive a profit and benefit growing out of the operations of that corporation, whether it be directly or indirectly, that moment all claim to its right to be a charity, such as the law may possibly protect, passes out of the case.</p>

I think, when it is shown that this organization is an organization really to bring pecuniary benefit into the pockets of any person at all, that being one of the objects according to the testimony of several of the witnesses, and the principal object for which it exists, that that moment its entire right to claim to stand as a charity is at an end.</p>

The funds for the support of all public charities are derived from the donors for the specific purpose of carrying out the objects of the charity, and all donations are clothed with a trust for these purposes which could be asserted at the suit either of the donors themselves, or of the attorney-general. It is obvious that an unincorporated association of people, using money contributed to them for a specific charity, could not, if a tort was committed by one of their agents, appropriate the trust funds in ease of a judgment obtained against them, or any of them, by reason of the tort.

But it is objected that the defendant is not a public charitable corporation, because the leading motive for its maintenance, as it is alleged, is the pecuniary benefit derived by the insurance companies from its existence. The question then resolves itself into this: Does the motive that induces a donation to a public charity alter the legal effect of a charitable use ? Sir John Leach in British Museum v. White, 2 Sim. &amp; St. 596, defined a charitable gift to be “ every gift for a public purpose, whether local or general, although not a charitable use within the common and narrow sense of these words.” A more practical definition is that of Lord Camden, in Jones v.

The court below gives a clear and accurate history of the corporation and its workings : Charge of Court below in [ <em>].a </em>The testimony [reviewed at length] establishes beyond doubt that the Fire Insurance Patrol (not Fire Patrol) is now, just what it was before its charter was obtained, not an agent of the commonwealth, or of the city municipality, or of the public, but a mere agent of the fire insurance companies, endowed by them with its plant, and maintained by them, not as the public’s agent to save life or to save property for the public generally, or to carry oil a great charity, but simply an agency to make gain and profit to its members. The penny saved is a penny made.</p>
    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[164,1162,1178,557]]]'>2. It is needless to review in detail the cases cited by the defendant upon this subject. All of them are cases where the public, either as a government or a municipality, through public officers, is performing public duties for the public generally, and with no gain or profit. In all such cases, actions in the premises are open to the inspection and control of the public; the public has nothing to do with this corporation. As said before by this court in this case : “ A private corporation, exercising a public function, or engaged in charitable work for private gain, can certainly in no sense be characterized, either as a public agent or as a public charitable institution.”</p>
    <p id="b675-6" data-blocks='[["BL_675.6",675,[166,1728,1175,198]]]'>III. Whether the defendant is a public charitable corporation, was the great question raised in this court upon the first trial on the charter alone, and on the second trial attempted to be answered by the proofs.</p>
    <p id="b675-7" data-blocks='[["BL_675.7",675,[164,1934,1176,457]],["BL_676.1",676,[262,335,1197,1369]]]'>1. “ But, that which is the purpose of a public charity may be the distinctive purpose of a trading corporation, out of which it is proposed to realize profits. It is not the object alone of a corporation which makes it charitable within the meaning of the law; it is the mode in which that object is sought to be attained, as well as the purpose for which it is pursued: ” Clakk, J., in Boyd v. Insurance Patrol, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20Pa.%20280" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="113 Pa. 280">113 Pa. 280</a>. Of course, the defendant company differs from this opinion : “ The transfer to a charitable use need not be for the love of God and your <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>neighbor.” That this corporation, however, has the power given it to establish a business to accomplish a good and proper object, is not enough. It must go further and show, either that its charter compels it to seek the saving of human life and property of all alike, irrespective of whose is the life, or whose, is the property, from purely charitable or public motives, and not for profit or gain, or, that in fact the business is so carried on. The moment the “ stain or taint of gain ” enters into the act done, it ceases to be a charity: Opinion of Mitchell, J., affirmed in Donohugh’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20308" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="86 Pa. 308">86 Pa. 308</a>. The question is not as to the mere motive for which this corporation was created, equipped and is now administered, but the purpose and real object sought to be attained. The defendant is a close private corporation, sustained solely by the subscribers as a “ business operation,” as avowed in the testimony by the men who created it and have managed it. The main purpose for which it was organized was “ to prevent damage to goods insured ” “ in a dollars and cents view.” “ The controlling purpose and object of the contributors is their own benefit.” “ A good financial business operation.” “ It makes money for our stockholders.” It is idle to say, in the face of the testimony of the witnesses, that this defendant is to stand by the side of our old volunteer fire companies, or the fire department of the city, or our hospitals, asylums, schools, homes for the poor, etc. The case of Glavin v. Rhode Island Hospital, <a href="/ri/12/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="12 R.I. 411" data-case-ids="11269135" data-case-paths="/ri/12/0415-01">12 R.

Suppose some benevolent individual founds a hospital and his ambulance driver carelessly runs over and maims a person. The founder, being a volunteer in what he did, would certainly not be protected from the consequences of his employee’s misfeasance. In no sense is he performing a public duty and protected by the principle of the class of cases where a public duty is performed by a municipality, or the government, through its officers or agents, as in Freeman v. Philadelphia, 7 W. N. 45; Knight v. Philadelphia, 15 W. N. 307, and other cases cited. But it is believed that no case can be found anywhere, in which the principle upon which these cases were based, was extended to any one who was a mere volunteer, or where the duty was not <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>performed by tbe public itself, in or through a municipality, or an officer selected by the people or the government, and gratuitously and for the benefit of the whole community.</p>
    <p id="b677-4" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[149,502,1185,1485]]]'>3. It is the doctrine of trusts, and this alone, which appears to give any support to the novel position upon which the defendant relies. The argument is more specious than sound. It would relieve trust estates or properties from all liability for unwise, or imprudent, or carelessly made contracts. The officers and agents of such a corporation may make contracts, in the line of the trust, for supplies or the like necessary to carry out the propose for which the trust was created. But it would be no answer to the party with whom the contract was made, that as a result of enforcing it, the trust funds would be lost thereby. The trust must respond. Does it make any difference to the person injured by the negligence or carelessness of the officers or their employees, that, in one case, the injury results from what the law calls a breach of contract, and the other from what it calls a tort ? The only authorities cited to sustain this novel doctrine are two: (1) Feoffees of Heriot’s Hospital v. Hoss, 12 Cl. &amp; F. 507, which ease was well decided, but upon wrong grounds, and these grounds were virtually overruled by tbe subsequently well-considered eases of Gibbs v. Mersey Docks, L. R. 1 H. of L. 93, and Parnaby v. Lancaster Canal Co., 11 Ad. &amp; E. 223. (2) McDonald v. Mass. Gen. Hospital, <a href="/mass/120/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="120 Mass. 432" data-case-ids="738974" data-case-paths="/mass/120/0432-01">120 Mass. 432</a>, is tbe only other ease cited, and it distinctly recognizes the doctrine that the corporation might be liable if a proper ease of neglige tice or tort bad been made out. Glavin v. Rhode Island Hospital, <a href="/ri/12/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="12 R.I. 411" data-case-ids="11269135" data-case-paths="/ri/12/0415-01">12 R.

    <p id="b678-7" data-blocks='[["BL_678.6",678,[251,1380,1190,768]]]'>Passing by for the present the question of a public charity, it seems plain that this corporation might well have been created by the state in aid of the municipal government of the city of Philadelphia. It is one of the recognized functions of municipal government, <em>to </em>suppress and extinguish fires. For this purpose the city has a paid fire department, which has taken the place of the volunteer fire department formerly in existence. It is as much the province or duty of the city to save life and property at fires as to extinguish such fires, and the Fire Insurance Patrol might well have been organized as an auxiliary to the city government and placed under its direct control. That it aids the city as a volunteer does not alter the fact that it is still an auxiliary of the municipal government, performing functions which that government might properly perform, just as did the old volunteer fire department.</p>

The learned court below held that it was not, upon the ground that the main object of the institution was to benefit the insurance companies, who were the chief contributors to its funds. In other words, the learned judge tested the nature and character <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>of the institution by the motives of its contributors. We might be driven to the same conclusion were we to adopt Mr. Biimey’s definition as found in his argument in the Girard Will Case, as the test of a public charity, where he said: “ It is whatever is given for the love of God, or for the love of your neighbor, in tbe catholic and universal sense; given from these motives, and to those ends, free from the stain or taint of every consideration that is personal, private or selfish.” This is undoubtedly charity in its highest and noblest sense. The Recording Angel might well point to it with satisfaction; and it may he the test in the Great Hereafter, but were we to apply it to the transactions of this wicked world, I fear it would lead to serious embarrassment. In the first place, it is utterly impracticable, for it is God only who can look into the heart and judge of motives. In tbe second place, if we bad tbe power of omniscience and were to apply it, what would be tbe result ? How many of our noblest and most useful public charities would stand such a test? How many donations to public charities are made out of pure love to God and love to man, free from tbe stain or taint of every consideration that is personal, private or selfish ? Who can say that the millionaire who founds a hospital or endows a college, and carves his name thereon in imperishable marble, does so from love to God and love to his fellow, free from the stain of selfishness ? Yet, is the hospital or the college any the less a public charity because the primary object of the founder or donor may have been to gratify his vanity, and hand down to posterity a name which otherwise would have perished with his millions ? There is ostentation in giving, as well as in the other transaction of life. Iir some instances donations to public charities may be in part due to this cause; in others, there may be the expectation of indirect pecuniary gain or return. The professional man who gives freely to his church may not be insensible to the fact that liberality makes friends and sometimes increases clientage. Coiled up within many a gift to a public charity, there is a secret motive, known only to the searcher of all hearts. It may be to benefit the donor in this world or to save his soul in the next. It would he as vain as it would be unprofitable for a human tribunal to speculate upon the motives of men in such cases. Nor is it necessary for any legal purpose. The money which <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>is selfishly given to public charity does as much good as that which is contributed from a higher motive, and in a legal sense the donor must have equal credit therefor. We must look elsewhere for a definition of a legal public charity.</p>

Bishop of Durham, 9 Ves. 405, it was said by Sir William Grant that those purposes are considered charitable which are enumerated in the statute of 43d Elizabeth, or which by analogy are deemed within its spirit and intendment. It is true that this statute of Elizabeth is not in force in Pennsylvania, but its principles are a part of the common law: Cresson’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Pa.%20450" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="30 Pa. 450">30 Pa. 450</a>. In British Museum v.

Williams, supra, said: “In order to ascertain what are charitable uses, the English courts have generally resorted to the preamble of the act of parliament, 43 Elizabeth. That enumerates twenty-one, and among them are found the following: Repairs of bridges; repairs of ports and havens; repairs of causeways <em>; </em>repairs of sea-banks ; repairs of highways ; fitting out soldiers ; other taxes. And beyond the enumeration contained in that act, many other gifts have been recognized as common law gifts to charitable uses, for example: for cleansing the streets, maintenance of houses of correction; for the true labor and exercise of husbandry, for public benefit. These cases and many others are collected in Magill v. Brown, Brightly 347. It is true the statute of Elizabeth is not in force as a statute in Pennsylvania, but, as before stated, its principles are part of our common law. The case of Magill v. Brown was a Pennsylvania case, and there it was held that a bequest for a fire engine and hose was a <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>gift for a charitable use.” In Jackson v. Phillips, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Allen%20556" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="14 Allen 556">14 Allen 556</a>, a charity was defined by Justice Gray as follows: “ A charity, in legal sense, may be more fully defined as a gift to be applied consistently with existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, either by bringing their minds or hearts under the influence of education or religion, by relieving their bodies from disease, suffering or constraint, by assisting them to establish themselves in life, or by erecting or maintaining public buildings or works, or otherwise lessening the burdens of government.” This definition has been cited approvingly, not only by text writers but by other courts. In Miller v. Porter, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20Pa.%20292" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="58 Pa. 292">58 Pa. 292</a>, there was a bequest by Porter to a university which was to bear his name, and this court said: “You say it (The Porter University) was not founded to promote religion or religious education, but to immortalize the founder, and therefore it was not a charity. If the premises be granted, the conclusion does not follow, because though it has no stamp of religion, and the selfishness of motive may take away from it the high and abstract quality of a Christian charity, yet it was to be a seat of learning — a university — a centre from which the rays of educated intelligence were to radiate in all directions ; and, if to found a school house at the cross-roads of a township be a legal charity though the selfish motive be apparent, much more to found such a university is a legal charity; and, if a charity within the legal sense of that word, then it is as much within the purview of the statute as a bequest to the West Town School, and Price v. Maxwell rules the case.” Following in this line of thought is Manners v. The Library Co., <a href="/pa/93/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="93 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="442101" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0165-01">93 Pa. 165</a>, where it was held in the case of a public charity that the intent of the testator will not be defeated because a secondary intent may be illegal, for if it be unlawful it will be disregarded. In the appeal of The Humane Fire Company, <a href="/pa/88/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="88 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1061197" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0389-01">88 Pa. 389</a>, it was distinctly ruled by this court that the association was a public charity. That company was one of the members of the old volunteer fire department of the city of Philadelphia; was organized for the purpose of extinguishing fires, and was supported just as the Fire Insurance Patrol is supported, by voluntary contributions. It is true many of its contributions came from private citizens, but I am unable to see any distinction between contributions to a fire company or insurance patrol, <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>made by individuals and those made by corporations. In both ■cases a corresponding benefit is expected. It would be idle to say that the insurance companies do not expect to diminish their losses by their support of the Insurance Patrol. But has the private citizen who contributes to a fire company any higher motive? Does he pay his money out of love to God and love to man, or does he pay it to protect his property?</p>

On the contrary this court held in Martin v. McCord, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%20493" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="5 W. 493">5 W. 493</a>, that the accession to a charity need not be by gift, but may be by contract; and that the accession to the charitable use from one who gave ground for a school house, if the neighbors would go on and build a decent house on it for the benefit of the neighborhood, and for the benefit of his grandson John, whom he wished to send to school, was good; and Sergeant, J., said “not as a gift, but as a purchase for a valuable consideration,” and the neighbors were the trustees for a charitable use. And in Miller v. Porter, supra, we have already seen that this court ■expressly repudiated the idea that the selfish motive affected the legal nature of the gift or use, and held that the object of ■the bequest only, and not the motive, governed its legal effect.

It-remains to inquire whether the doctrine of respondeat superior applies to it. Upon this point we are free from doubt. It has been held in this state that the duty of extinguishing fires and saving property therefrom is a public duty, and the agent to whom such authority is delegated is a public agent and not liable for the negligence of its employees.

The members of the fire department are not such servants of the municipal corporation as to make it liable for their acts or negligence. Their duties are of a public character, and for a high order of public benefit. The fact that this act of assembly did not make it obligatory on the city to organize a fire department, does not change the legal liability of the municipality for the conduct of the members of the organization. The same reason which exempts the city from liability for the acts of its policemen, applies with equal force to the acts of the firemen.” And it would seem from this and other cases to make no difference as respects the legal liability, whether the organization performing such public service is a volunteer or not: Jewett v.

It would be carrying the doctrine of respondeat superior to an unreasonable and dangerous length. That doctrine is at best — as I once before observed — a hard rule.

I think it may be safely assumed that private trustees, having the control of money contributed for a specific charity, could not in case of a tort committed by one of their members, apply the funds in their hands to the payment of a judgment recovered therefor. A public charity, whether incorporated or not, is but a trustee, and is bound to apply its funds in furtherance of the charity and not otherwise. This doctrine is hoary with antiquity and prevails alike in this country and in Eng<a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>land, -where it originated as early as the reign of Edward V., and it was announced in the Year Boole of that period. In the Feoffees of Heriot’s Hospital v. Ross, 12 C. &amp; F. 506, a person eligible for admission to the hospital brought an action for damages against the trustees for the wrongful refusal on their part to admit him. The case was appealed to the House of Lords when it was unanimously held that it could not be maintained. Lord Cottenham said: “It is obvious that it would be a direct violation, in all cases, of the purpose of a trust if this could be done; for there is not any person who ever created a trust that provided for payment out of it of damages to be recovered from those who had the management of the fund. No such provision has been made here. There is a trust, and there are persons intended to manage it for the benefit of those who are to be the objects of the charity. To give damages out of a trust fund would not be to apply it to those objects which the author of the fund had in view, but would be to divert it to a completely different purpose.” Lord Brougham said: “The charge is that the governors of the hospital have illegally and improperly done the act in question, and therefore, because the trustees have violated the statute, therefore — what? Not that they shall themselves pay the damages, but that the trust fund which they administer shall be made answerable for their misconduct. The finding on this point is wrong, and the decree of the court below must be reversed.” Lord Campbell : “It seems to have been thought that if charity trustees have been guilty of a breach of trust, the persons damnified thereby have a right to be indemnified out of the trust funds. That is contrary to all reason, justice and common Sense. Such a perversion of the intention of the donor would lead to most inconvenient consequences. The trustees would in that case be indemnified against the consequences of their own misconduct, and the real object of the charity would be defeated. Damages are to be paid from the pocket of the wrongdoer, not from a trust fund. A doctrine so strange, as the court below has laid down in the present case, ought to have been supported by the highest authority. There is not any authority, not a single shred here to support it. No foreign or constitutional writer can be referred to for such a purpose.” I have quoted at some length from the opinions of these great <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>jurists because they express in vigorous and clear language the law upon this subject.

    <p id="b685-4" data-blocks='[["BL_685.4",685,[149,964,1187,1177]]]'>I am glad to be able to say that no state in this country, or in the world, has upheld the sacredness of trusts with a firmer hand than the state of Pennsylvania. Not only is a trustee for a public or private use not permitted to misapply the trust funds committed to Ms care, but if he convert them to his own use the law punishes him as a thief. How much better than a thief would be the law itself, were it to apply the trust’s funds contributed for a chaiitable object, to pay for injuries resulting from the torts or negligence of the trustee ? The latter is legally responsible for his own wrongful acts. I understand a judgment has been recovered against the individual whose negligence occasioned the injury in this case. If we apply the money of the Insurance Patrol to the payment of this judgment, or of the same cause of action, what is it but a misapplication of the trust fund; as much so as if the trustees had used it in payment of their personal liabilities ? It would be an anomaly to send a trustee to the penitentiary for squandering trust funds in private speculations, and yet permit him to do practically the same thing by making it liable for his torts. If the principle contended for here were to receive any countenance at the hands of this court, it would be the most damaging blow at the integrity of trusts which has been delivered in Pennsylvania. We are not prepared to take this step.</p>

The <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>two corporations last named were evidently trading corporations and in no proper sense public charities. In regard to the docks, it was said by Blackburn, J., at page 465: “ There are several cases relating to charities which were mentioned at your Lordship’s Bar, but were not much pressed, nor, as it seems to us, need they be considered now; for whatever may be the law as to the exemption of property occupied for charitable purposes, it is clear that the docks in question can come within no such exemption.”</p>

It is at least doubtful, whether under its facts the case applies, and if it does, we would not be disposed to follow it in the face of the overwhelming weight of authority the other way, and of the sound reasoning by which it is supported.</p>
