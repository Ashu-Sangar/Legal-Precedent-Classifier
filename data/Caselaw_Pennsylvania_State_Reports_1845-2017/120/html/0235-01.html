    <p class="summary" id="b273-7" data-blocks='[["BL_273.6",273,[127,1115,1178,509]]]'>The objection presented at the audit, against the exercise of the power of appointment by Charles Pepper, the son, was twofold: that it violated the rule against perpetuities, and that it transcended the limits of the power. There seems to be no ground for the first position; the power was bound to be executed within lives in being at the death of the testator, and twenty-one years after the expiration of those lives, and the appointment was to persons, all of whom must be ascertained within that period. But the second point cannot be so easily dismissed.</p>

Savage, <a href="/pa/58/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="58 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1013200" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0365-01">58 Pa. 365</a>, took only under the will of the donor; he could take nothing under the will of the donee, because the latter had nothing to give; he was simply an agent to distribute. Looking, then, to the will of the donor, it is clear that an absolute estate was given among the children and issue of the donee. The utmost discretion of the donee of the power was to select from among that class. But this power of selection, and therefore of appointment, was gone, when, as was the fact, there was but one person in the class, and that person, as its representative, of necessity took the whole estate. Concede, for the purposes of argument, that under the authority to limit “in such shares and for such estates” as he might choose, the donee could fetter the gift to the grandson with a trust, provided the trust was so guarded as to be with<a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>in the limits of the rule prohibiting perpetuities. But plainly the donee has done more than this. He has imposed conditions' which imply a possible forfeiture of the estate, and, upon their breach, he has appointed in favor of a class which was not contemplated by the donor. It will not be contended that the issue of a living child, who are the subjects of this limitation over, can be included among the “children and issue ” to whom the donor restricted the exercise of the power. The point, at all events, was decided in Wickersham v. Savage, just cited, and in Horwitz v. Norris, <a href="/pa/49/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="998551" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0213-01">49 Pa. 213</a>. If we concede further that the appointment is void only as to the excess, we decide the question. We have, then, a gift to the son of the donee, coupled with a condition that during a certain period, he shall not incumber nor alien the estate, with a limitation over on breach of that condition. But the limitation over is void; and the son, by virtue of the gift to him by the donor of the power, in default of appointment will take the estate, absolved from the condition. He certainly cannot continue to hold the absolute estate, and be restrained from alienation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[263,1392,1187,1022]],["BL_275.1",275,[127,346,1182,1389]]]'>The only answer to this would seem to be, that the restraining clause in the appointment to the grandson, was in the nature of a spendthrift trust, which would be upheld by the legal estate outstanding in the executors as trustees under the donor’s will. Assuming that there was a trust, the query is, whether it was within the purview of the power. Undoubtedly very strong expressions, against the right of the donee of a power to fetter the interest of an appointee, where the gift by the donor of the power is absolute, may be found in the cases. It is true that in Horwitz v. Norris, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20Pa.%20220" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="49 Pa. 220">49 Pa. 220</a>, it was intimated, and the suggestion was acted upon in Boyles’s Estate, 5 W. N. 363, that “perhaps in equity.....an appointment to trustees in trust for the particular object designated by the donor of the power, might be sustained.” In the case last named, the power was to the widow, to appoint “ in such way or manner and in such proportions and for such estates ” among the children, as she should direct, and it was exercised by a trust to pay the income during minority, for the support of a child, and the principal at the majority of the beneficiary. Here the entire estate was given to a member of <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>the proper class, with a provision for minority which the law itself would have made in the absence of a trust. In Fidelity Co.’s Appeal, 4. W. N. 266, the Supreme Court say: “ The testator having vested an absolute and unqualified interest in the children, in the several proportions distributed or divided to them, it is clear the widow could not, by any power of appointment, or by any directions or orders, limit to them a less estate, or so fetter it that it could not be fully, used by each.” In Wiekershain v. Savage, <a href="/pa/58/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="58 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1013200" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0365-01">58 Pa. 365</a>, where the power was to the donee, to appoint to his children “ in such shares and proportions and for such estates,” as he should, by will, direct, Thompson, C. J., said: “ He,” the donee, “ could only distribute the estate already vested in the defined class.” And he adds, what seems to bo fully applicable here: “ The appointee is one person; he takes the entire estate in remainder, as the representative of a class. Of course, in that case, no appointment could vary his interest.” The same point was decided in Roe v. Dunt, 2 Wils. 336, where the gift was “ in such proportions and for such estates,” as should be limited. Yet in all of these cases, except Boyle’s Estate, and perhaps Fidelity Co.’s Appeal, the appointment was void, because it embraced parties who were not rightly objects of the power; and the decision went upon that ground alone. On the other hand, a trust for the separate use of the appointee, who was a married woman, was permitted, in Alexander v. Alexander, 2 Ves. Sr. 642. And see Willis v. Kymer, L. R. 7 Ch. Div. 181, and Boyle’s Estate, supra.</p>

The power was to limit for “ such estates; ” and that phrase would embrace equitable interests. That such a trust may attend an estate, otherwise absolute, was decided in Ward’s Estate, 13 W. N. 282, and the decision was sustained by the Supreme Court in Kyle’s Appeal. But in the case in hand, the restrictive clause which has been alluded to, does not constitute a trust, and was not intended as a trust by the donee of the power. In terms as clear as well could be invented, ho appointed an absolute estate directly to the grandson, and clogged the gift <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>with a void condition.

N. 326, it must bo conceded, so far as this court is concerned, that a power to appoint among a given class, in such shares and proportions as the donee may deem proper, is non-exclusive — that is, gives no right to altogether exclude any member of the class; though <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>in the recent case of McGibbon v. Abbott, L. R. 10 App. Cas. 653, it was held by the Privy Council, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Lower Canada, that, as in that province (as in Pennsylvania), the doctrine of illusory appointments had never existed, there was no reason to suppose the equally absurd doctrine of non-exclusiveness, in powers thus expressed, had been adopted; both having been regarded in England as so contrary to common sense that, after vexing the profession for many years, they were abolished, though at considerable intervals, by acts of parliament. But in the present case, the power is to appoint, not “ to and among the children and issue ” of the son, but to “ such of ” them and “ in such shares and for such estates ” as he shall determine; and this, under all the authorities, gives the right of selection — that is, is an exclusive power: Farwell on Pow., 294; Chance on Pow., § 1061.</p>
    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[242,1164,1187,606]]]'>The manifest purpose of the donee of the power was to protect the estate for the benefit of the son, during a time when, by reason of youth or inexperience, he might be incapable of taking care of it himself; leaving it at the expiration of the prescribed period, if there should be no breach of condition in the meantime, to pass under the provisions of the will of the donor. That the purpose thus disclosed is one which in Pennsylvania is looked upon with favor, is too well settled to require a citation of authority; though, of course, had anything more than a life estate been given to the son, a condition in restraint of alienation or affecting the rights of creditors would have been void, and the estate absolute.</p>

Litt., 223, b; 2 Cruise’s Dig., page 8, sec. 34, etc. Here — the legal estate, perhaps, continuing, under the will of the donor, in the trustees for the protection of the conditional limitations (though whether it does so or not is wholly immaterial to the present inquiry) — the use is limited to the son for a fixed term, viz.: until the expiration of twenty-one years from the death of the survivor of persons in being in the lifetime of the donor of the power ; and, but for the condition to which it is made subject and the limitation over in case of <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>breach, the use so given would merge into the absolute estate in remainder belonging to the son under the original will. But merger never takes place unless the power of alienation extends to both estates : 4 Kent, page 101. If the estate does not continue in the original trustees, as the appointment to the son, during the existence of the term, is subject to conditions, he would have to enter security under the aet of assembly in order to obtain possession, and there would thus be no danger of prejudice to creditors. Of course, if within the designated time no person should come into being capable of taking advantage of the breach, the condition becomes nugatory and the son’s estate absolute ; and this brings ns to the only question remaining for consideration, viz.: the validity of the limitation by way of springing use to the children of the son, in the event of a breach of condition.</p>

Moreover, the power in Wickersham v. Savage, according to the decision in Neilson’s Estate, supra, was a non-exclusive power, while in the will now under consideration it is exclusive. The objects of the power are the children and issue of the son; the power is to appoint to “ such ” of them as he may select, and “ in such shares and for such estates.” Shares are one thing, estates quite another.</p>

Now where do you find in the will any expression showing an intention on the part of the testatrix that the objects of the power were to bo limited to those living at the death of the appointor ? I find the word ‘issue,’ simply, moaning issue forever. The testatrix fixed no limit. Therefore, as the words stand, the donee of the power must appoint to issue forever, that is, to the descendants of every generation. Upon the actual words of the will you have no right to limit the power, but you have a right to limit it to a class to whom a valid appointment can be made under the law against perpetuities.” The power there was held to be exclusive, as a matter of construction, and to avoid the absurd results which would have followed if it had been non-exclusive.

The opinion, to which this is in the shape of a reply, treats the power as exclusive, and covering, as the classes from which the selection may be made, not only the children of the donee, but their issue in a lineal descent, which is bounded only by the rule against perpetuities.</p>

Div. 61, to give a power of selection among both classes. But they are immediately followed, in default of appointment, by a gift over to the children and issue of deceased children, living at the donee’s death; and, if the reasoning of Thompson, C. J., in Wickersham v. Savage, <a href="/pa/58/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="58 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1013200" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0365-01">58 Pa. 365</a>, is valid, they show that the original testator meant by “issue,” not what the word technically means, but living issue of children who should be alive at the death of the donee. Of course, the power was exclusive as to living children and such issue as have been described, hut as there was <em>only one </em>child and no issue, the donee was restricted to that child, and his power of appointment ended with his power of selection. In Veale’s Trusts, the power was to appoint to children or issue, and in default the estate was to pass into the residue. Sir George Jessel said the word “ issue ” meant issue forever, because the testator had fixed no limit. The reverse seems to be true here.</p>

Savage has nothing to do with this case, and that this power embraces children and issue in an unbroken line, the question is, can its exercise be sustained ? And first, the power has been imperfectly executed. With an absolute estate to dispose of, the donee has directly appointed only a term for years. Beyond the gift of an estate for twenty-one years after the death of a certain survivor, he has given nothing. But he has appointed indirectly an estate, which amounts to an absolute interest, and has clogged it with conditions, which he could not do by any direct gift whatever. He gives and bequeaths to his son “ until the expiration of twenty-one years after the death of the survivor” of six cestuis que vient, upon condition that he shall not convey or assign, etc., in the meanwhile. It will not he pretended that if the appointee shall survive this period and commit no act of forfeiture, he will not take the entire estate. It is true that his death within the designated time, leaving issue, is provided for. But that will not cut down the estate, previously given, to a life estate ; he will still take an absolute interest, subject to divestiture. The estate is neither an estate <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>at will, nor for life, nor for years, and the appointee cannot be compelled to give security. It is not an estate at will, nor for life, because it is given only for years; and it has no effect as an estate for years, because the appointee is already in of an absolute estate under the will of the donor. This is recognized by the donee, who therefore makes no provision in case the appointee shall die without issue.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[230,716,1196,1488]]]'>In whatever light it is viewed, the intent to vest the donee with an absolute estate, and at the same time take from him all power to alienate it, is more than apparent. He is now forty years old, and if both of the two survivors shall die immediately, he will still be debarred from controlling his property until he shall have reached the age of sixty-one, a period during which, by the accompanying opinion, he will be presumably liable to the follies of youth and inexperience. To outlive the survivor he may be compelled to last a century. During that time, although he will have all the insignia of ownership, with the corresponding ability to mislead creditors, he will have no power of self-protection; he may not sell to reap the benefit of an exceptional offer, nor to save himself from a falling market. It is said that the trustees, under the will of the donor, will hold the legal title. But the gift was not to them, it was directly to the appointee ; and it is doubtful whether the power authorized the creation of a trust. See, as to this point, Fidelity Co.’s Appeal, 4 W. N. 266. The question then recurs to the condition imposed by the donee. The text law is thus stated by Mr. Sugden : “ He (the donee) cannot annex any condition for his own benefit; nor can the property appointed be exempted by the donee of the power from the debts of the appointee, but it must be left to take the fate of being his property, and subject to be come at, as his creditors shall see fit. <em>* </em>Sugd. on Powers, 1st Am. ed., 547.

If the will of George Pepper be interpreted by the aid of common sense, untrammeled by authority, we will find difficulty in arriving at any other conclusion than that he meant his son Charles to have the power of selecting his beneficiaries amongst any of his issue, subject, of course, to the restraint imposed by the law that such issue must be born within the time fixed by the law against perpetuities. There is no decided case which obliges us to interpret the testator’s words otherwise than in accordance with the suggestions of common sense. On the contrary, the authorities, notably Veale’s Trusts, L. R. 4 Ch. D. 61, and 5 Ch. D. 622, sustain and enforce such interpretation.</p>

With an absolute estate to dispose of, the donee has directly appointed only a term of years.” This objection is well taken only if it were necessary to the validity of the son’s exercise of the power that he should dispose of the whole fee. Was there such a necessity? The greater includes the less. A power to sell was held in Lancaster v. Dolan, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20R.%20231" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 R. 231">1 R. 231</a>, and repeatedly since, to include a power to mortgage. The exercise of powers has often been set aside because of excess, but memory fails to recall an instance of such exercise being held bad because the power had been only partially executed. The power discussed did not require the whole “ rem ” to go to one person. The testator permitted it to be carved up into different estates, and permitted each estate to go to one, or to more. The bequest and devise to Charles R. was not bad because he took only an estate for years; and the bequest and devise of a remainder to his issue was not bad <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>because contingent. The lack of provision for the contingency of the possible death of Charles R. within the prescribed period, did not avoid the provisions in case of other contingencies which might happen. To the extent that within its limits the power to split up estates was executed, it was good, —none the less because the estate, under certain contingencies, might go to those who-were to take in default of its exercise: Sadler v. Pratt, 6 Sim. 632; Farncombe’s Trusts, L. R. 9 Ch. D. 652; 2 Sugden, Powers, § 249.</p>

Would this appointment in remainder be avoided even if the testator had sought to impose, upon another limitation, an illegal condition against alienation ? There is a recognized distinction between an appointment, bad because to persons not properly beneficiaries or of an estate larger than can be given, and one where the donees are within the class and the estate given is not too large, but there is an illegal condition superadded. In the latter case the appointment is allowed to stand and the condition is disregarded: Webb v. Sadler, L. R. 14 Eq. 533; 8 Ch. D. 419; Meredith’s Trusts, L. R. 3 Ch. D. 757.</p>

And it is said that during the prescribed period “ although he will have all insignia of ownership, with the corresponding ability to mislead creditors, he will have no power of self-protection ; he may not sell to reap the benefit of an exceptional offer, nor to save himself from a falling market.” How will Charles R. be invested with the insignia of ownership ? The title to the real estate will mislead no one; it will be traced through the wills of his father and his grandfather. The personal estate will be vested in the trustee. If it be not, the assignment, if Charles gives the requisite security, will state the limitations of his estate upon its face.</p>

The testator devised the share of his son Charles to trustees in trust for his use for life, “ And from and after his death, then to the use of such of his children and issue, and in such shares and for such estates as he shall by last will appoint, and in default of such appointment, then to the use of all his children that may be living at his death, and the issue of any deceased child or children, their heirs, executors, or administrators, as tenants in common, in equal shares; the issue of any deceased child to stand in the place of their parent, and to take only the share their parent would have taken if living; and in default of such issue, then as to the one equal fourth part of the share appertaining to my son, to the use of such person or persons, and for such estates and in such proportions as he shall in any way appoint; and as to the remaining three fourths parts, and also as to the said one fourth <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>part, so far as the same shall not have been appointed otherwise by my said son, to the use of my then surviving children, and the issue of any of my children, then deceased, in the shares and proportions, and for the estates which they would have taken under the intestate law of Pennsylvania, if my said son had died seized in fee simple of such estate, without any wife surviving him.”</p>
    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[122,690,1180,410]]]'>Charles Pepper left surviving him one child, Charles Rock-land Pepper, and no other issue. His said son was born after the death of George Pepper. He is now about forty years of age, and has never been married. It is very clear that under the will of George Pepper his son Charles took an estate for life, with remainder in fee to his son, Charles Rockland Pepper. This estate is indefeasible, unless it has been abridged by the donee of the power in the valid execution thereof.</p>
    <p id="b289-6" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[125,1104,1186,1336]]]'>It is well to bear in mind that whatever Charles Rockland Pepper takes, he takes it under the will of his grandfather. The donee of the power, Charles Pepper, had no estate to give him. Nor can ne take anything from him. The estate was limited by the will of George Pepper to a class to which Charles Rockland Popper belongs, and he is moreover the only member of that class. Had there been other children, brothers and sisters of Charles Rockland Pepper, the donee of the power could have appointed the estate among them in such shares as he might have seen proper. He might, perhaps, have excluded this one child from all participation in his grandfather’s estate. As the case stands the donee of the power can neither exclude him nor diminish his interest or estate, because, as was before observed, the estate was given by George Pepper to a class of which Charles Rockland Pepper is the only representative or member. Charles Pepper cannot give it to any one else because it is not his to give; he is the mere donee of a power; that power has its source in the will of George Pepper; it is a special limited power, and it can only carry the estate to such persons as George Pepper directed it to go. The object of conferring this power was to enable Charles Pepper to distribute the estate to and among a certain class, or to such members of the class as he might think best for their interests. With but one member of the class in existence there can be but one distribution, and. under such circumstances it is difficult to see the utility of any appointment whatever.</p>

      <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>Charles Pepper, however, attempted to exercise the power of appointment given by the will of George Pepper. That the paper was carefully drawn is shown by the skill with which a perpetuity is avoided while approaching dangerously near the border. The material part of .the execution of the power by Charles Pepper is in the following words: — ■</p>
    <blockquote id="b290-5" data-blocks='[["BL_290.4",290,[248,637,1187,1176]]]'>“ Until the expiration of twenty-one years after the death of the survivor of my brothers, George S., Edward, Lawrence S., and Fredrick Pepper, of my sister, Mrs. Catharine Gardette, and of myself, all of whom were living at the death of my said father I devise, bequeath and appoint my said share in my father’s estate to my said son Charles Rockland Pepper, upon the express condition, that he shall not in any manner convey, assign or transfer the same or the rents, issues and profits thereof to any person whomsoever, or do or suffer any act, matter or thing whereby the same shall be attached, seized or taken in execution or be made subject to or be affected by the insolvent or bankrupt laws of the United States, or of any other state thereof, or of any foreign country, and in case any of these events shall happen contrary to the true intent and meaning of the foregoing condition within the said term of twenty-one years after the death of the survivor of my said brothers, sister and myself, and also in case my said son shall die before the expiration of the said term of twenty-one years leaving issue, then, and in any such case, I devise, bequeath and appoint my said share in my father’s estate to such issue, their heirs, executors and administrators, and if more than one, in such shares and proportions as if my said son had died seized and possessed thereof intestate.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b290-6" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[246,1822,1185,559]],["BL_291.1",291,[124,334,1181,1179]]]'>It is not easy to describe the estate which the donee of this power has given to the appointee. It is perhaps a conditional fee, subject to forfeiture for breach of the condition against alienation. The thought naturally suggests itself, where did Charles Pepper get the power to annex a forfeiture to the estate he was attempting to appoint ? It was not inherent in him by virtue of his dominion over the estate, for, as before observed, it was not his estate. It was urged, however, that it created a spendthrift trust and as such may be sustained under the authorities in this state. But the appointment contains no trust of any kind, and to sustain this assumption we <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>would have to write a spendthrift trust into the will of George Pepper. This cannot be done either by the donee of the power, or by this court. We look in vain through the will of George Pepper for one word which authorizes the donee of the power to appoint a forfeitable estate to Charles Rockland Pepper, or create a spendthrift trust. It is true it authorizes the donee to appoint the share referred to “in such shares and for such estates ” as he shall deem proper. But the testator, when he used this language was contemplating the distribution of the share among a class consisting of several persons, certainly of more than one. And had there been several of the class the donee of the power could have appointed an estate for years to one, an estate for life to another, with remainders to the third in fee, or he could have made any other division which would have given the whole share to some one or more of the class. This is what the testator evidently meant when he used the words “for such estates.” They have no meaning as applied to Charles Rockland Pepper as the only member of bis class, unless we hold that they were intended to authorize the donee of the power to cut down the estate which he took under his grandfather’s will, from an estate in fee to an estate upon condition and forfeitable for alienation. This wo are not prepared to do.</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[127,1519,1182,872]],["BL_292.1",292,[267,332,1183,498]]]'>A careful reading of the will of George Pepper leaves us in no doubt as to the testator’s meaning. The share of his son Charles was to go in the line of inheritance. In default of appointment by the latter, the share is limited to the class who would take by descent from Charles, and we are of opinion that that class was to be determined upon the death of Charles. When George Pepper died, Charles had no children. He could not possibly know how many children Charles would leave. He therefore gave his share “ to the use of such of his (Charles’s) children and issue .... as he shall by last will appoint,” and upon failure to appoint, “then to the use of all his (Charles’s) children that may be living at his (Charles’s) death.” We think it is plain that the testator intended the share of Charles to go to such of the children of Charles as might be living at the death of the latter, and to the issue of any deceased child. This was the class who were to take, and the power was given merely to enable Charles to make distinc<a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>tions between the different members of the class, in case some should prove more worthy or more needy than others, or possibly to exclude some altogether. We see nothing to justify the donee of the power in giving to Charles Rockland Pepper a forfeitable estate, with remainder to another class not contemplated by the testator, which was not then, is not now, and may never come into existence. <em>We </em>think the foregoing vietvs are fully sustained by Wickersham v. Savage, <a href="/pa/58/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="58 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1013200" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0365-01">58 Pa. 365</a>; Horwitz v.
