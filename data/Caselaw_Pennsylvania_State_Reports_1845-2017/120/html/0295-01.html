On a rule to take depositions ex parte defendant, service of which was accepted without prejudice, the defendant testified : “ My name is Thomas Cawley ; am 57 years of age; I live in Pittston township and have lived there for the last twenty-four years; I am the defendant in this suit; I know Paul Bohan; I never signed a judgment note in favor of Paul Bohan ; I do not owe him any money; I think he owes me; I saw the judgment note in this case that Frank Bohan, his son, had before Justice Gowan, of Yatesville; I never signed that note; it was not my signature on the note ; I said so at the time of-the trial. When I saw this note at Yatesville in the office of Esquire Gowan, it appeared to me in the handwriting of three different persons, and written at three different times. I never knew such a note was in existence until the suit. Mr. Bohan never has asked me for money during the past eight years nor claimed to me that I owed him one cent.” •</p>

When the opportunity to sustain his assertion was afforded he declined it, or at least neglected it. He does not account in any manner for his conduct in tins respect. In a legal sense it cannot be said that there was a disputed question of fact about the signature. If such disputed fact had been fairly raised, we would have had a different question before us. As it stands, it looks like a device to gain time, and an appeal, to which the defendant was not entitled.</p>
