With profound respect for the decisions of this court, we refer to one or two matters in the opinion in that case, that impress us that it was somewhat hastily considered. “ If the act passed April 12, 1872, makes absolutely void such notes in which the words ‘ given for a patent right ’ are not prominently and legibly written or printed on the face of such note above the signature thereto, there would be great reason for the contention that the act is unconstitutional and void. No state can so interfere with the right of a patentee, secured to him by the acts of congress, to sell and assign his patent.” Does not the act, in effect, make such note void, as between the original parties thereto ? The second section makes the taking of such note a misdemeanor. Courts would not permit a recovery upon an instrument which the law declares it a criminal offence to take: Bowen v. Kemerer, 2 Pears. 250.</p>
