The Smiths lived, at that time, at New Milford, Susquehanna county. Mr. Boone notified Mr. Carle, who resided in Kingston and acted as an agent for Mrs. Smith, of this action of the borough council, and the latter replied that if Mr. Boone were to send <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>a written notice by mail to Mrs. Smith, she would probably direct him to proceed to make the necessary repairs. On the following day Mr. Boone mailed, as requested, a notice to Mrs. Mary Smith, New Milford, Susquehanna county, Penn’a, using an envelope upon which was printed a request that the letter if not delivered within ten days should be returned to him. The letter was not returned to Mr. Boone, nor did he, receive any reply from Mrs. Smith.</p>

He admits that this was done by him after complaints by some one, though he fails to recall the conversation referred to by Mr. Boone. He states that he put down some new planks ; possibly seven or eight pieces. He states further that Mrs. Smith told him just “ to fix it up a little until next season, and then she would put a stone flagging there.”</p>

In May, 1885, Philip Edgar, then the burgess of the borough, wrote Mrs. Smith in his official capacity, directing his letter, as Mr. Boone had done, to New Milford, Susquehanna county, Penn’a, her place of residence, that if he did not hear from her in twenty days he would lay the walk. Receiving no reply to liis communication, and being authorized, as he states, by the street commissioner, he proceeded in June, 1885, to tear up the old and lay a new walk of planks, in width, etc., in conformity with the ordinance hereinbefore referred to. The cost of this new walk is shown to have been, for materials and labor, $40.14, as small an amount as it was possible to have the work done for.</p>

The principal issue of fact raised by the defence before the referee is, that the re-laying of the side-walk is unnecessary; that the existing walk was not in an unsafe condition, but that with slight repairs it would have been in a condition in substantial conformity with the ordinance. This question of fact has already been discussed by the referee in his findings, and it is his conclusion that the walk was decayed and beyond repair, and that the only thing to do under the existing condition of things was to lay an entirely new walk.</p>

[Sic.] It is insisted further that this rule, applicable by these cases to the paving of streets generally, is, in Hammett v.

      <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>It is undoubtedly true that municipal liens rest upon the law-alone. It is equally true that the legislature may grant to municipalities the power of local taxation, for local benefits, upon properties benefited. The legislators alone are the judges of the expediency of such assessments, though none can be laid for purely public or general purposes. And, while this species of legislation is not limited in the constitution, such laws must provide for a just and equal assessment of the tax in accordance with the benefits, and must not impose unequal burdens. The benefit the object of the tax confers upon the owner of the property is the foundation of the power of special taxation, and it must be impartially and justly applied. It is a local taxation for a local benefit. These propositions are all stated and affirmed in: Philadelphia v.

That case decided that an act of the legislature which enabled the city of Pittsburgh to impose upon the inhabitants of certain districts within it the cost of re-paving certain streets, which had been found by viewers to be in whole, or in part, for a local benefit, was unconstitutional. The basis of this decision was that local assessments were about to be made for what were necessarily public improvements. To estimate how foreign its principles are from the case before us, it will only be necessary to quote from the decision of the court. Gordon, J., says (p. 144): “We admit that the legislature has the right to confer upon municipalities the power to assess the cost of local improvements upon the properties benefited thereby. We can readily understand why the cost of constructing and maintaining a sewer, which is designed for the drainage of a particular street or locality, and which is essentially necessary for the health, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants dwelling along such street, or in such locality, should be assessed upon the property of the district thus benefited, for the improvement as well as the use is local, and the benefit to the public is but secondary. So with a side-walk without which a house in a town or city cannot be said to be finished; and though the public has the right of way over it, the greater benefit results to the property itself.” The opinion of the court proceeds further to point out the dis<a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>tinction between the cart-way, as purely a public, and general improvement, and such improvements as must be regarded as local. In the opinion of the court in this case it is apparent that a side-walk is regarded as a local improvement; such an improvement as is properly maintainable at the expense of the abutting lot owner.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-5" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[259,628,1192,1641]]]'>Wistar v.

Neither of these, however, it seems to the referee, can rule this case. On the contrary, upon a careful analysis, they seem to negative instead of aid the defendant’s argument. Wistar, the plaintiff, was the owner of lands on Broad street, in the city of Philadelphia. He had been, under the city ordinances, required to place a curb between the side-walk and the cart-way opposite his property. Some years after, the cart-way was narrowed, and an effort was made to force him (Wistar) to set a new curb. The right of the city to have this done at Wistar’s expense was denied by the court; but simply on the ground that he had recently placed a curb in position, which was still in good condition. It seems to be taken for granted that if the side-walk or curb were out of repair or worn out, there would have been no question about his liability to the expense of a new one. Indeed the court (Justice Agnew), goes so far as to say: “It maybe conceded also that a general power to pave implies a power to repair and re-pave when the condition of the cart-way or foot-way requires it; and of this, prima facie, the city officers may judge.” This case was simply one of whether the city authorities, whenever possessed with the desire or whim to do so, could alter the grade or alignment of a curb or foot way. It will be noticed also that the act under which the city proposed to force Wistar to pay for this improvement, does not differ materially from the act of 1851. Neither allude to a re-pavement; and yet under this act the court conceded that a land owner could be forced to re-pave. The case of Wistar v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/111/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="111 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="545333" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0604-01">111 Pa. 604</a>, is in all respects similar to the last referred to. Here again it is intimated that if this were a side-walk, or something incident to a side-walk, out of repair or worn out, the lot owner could be made to repair or restore it.</p>

Corp., 2d ed., 721, we conceive to be plainly irreconcilable with the above decisions, and to be due to a failure to distinguish between those powers which are implied because necessarily incident to a duty, and those powers which rest upon no duty whatever. The municipal authorities are charged with the care of the streets; it is their duty to keep the streets in good condition. Hence the power to pave or otherwise care for streets, at the general expense, necessarily implies the power to re-pave, etc., at the general expense. This, we believe, is as far as Judge Dillon’s rule above mentioned can go, and is a very different thing from the proposition that the power to pave at local expense implies the power to re-pave at local expense. Judge Dillon applies his conclusions to cart-ways as well as foot-walks, while this <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>court, in numerous decisions, has recently not only denied the implied power to re-pave cart-ways at local expense, but has held unconstitutional all acts attempting to convey in express words such power.

Even if the power to assess locally the cost of paving did imply the power to assess the cost of re-paving, the defendant, or her predecessors having made a side-walk conforming to all the requirements of the ordinance, the ordinance was functus officio.

A distinction appears to be made between repairing a worn-out curb or pavement and replacing one in good repair with a better kind.
