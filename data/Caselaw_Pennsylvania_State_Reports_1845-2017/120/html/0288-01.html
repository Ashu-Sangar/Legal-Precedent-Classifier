On May 26th, another petition of such citizens and taxpayers was presented, setting out as an additional reason for the granting of the prayer, that the township supervisors were about to build a bridge over the same creek.

L. 1199, cannot be inquired into, or impeached, collaterally. But in the present case, independently of the affidavits and depositions submitted, it appears from the records of the court that Milton F. Williams, who was the foreman of the grand jury at the November Session of 1881, which recommended the building of the bridge in question, was also one of the original petitioners for the bridge. This, in our judgment, is fatal to the report.</p>

The township did not and could not have an opportunity to challenge the array of grand jurors, and yet the township is the party interested, inasmuch as upon it falls the expense of building the abutments and piers, and of the filling in and about the abutments.

It now appears however, that the original petition for the bridge had at one time been deposited at a store in which Mr. Williams was employed, for the purpose of obtaining signatures, and also that he took an active part in fixing the amount of the ap<a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>propriation to be made by the county, when that question came before the grand jury.

L. 1199, when the report of the grand jury was approved by the court and entered upon the records, the bridge became a county bridge, and every question as to its necessity and usefulness, etc., became res adjudicata. No power of reviewing the action of the grand jury was vested in the court, its power being limited to a simple approval or disapproval. Moreover, by the general laws, especially referred to in said special act, the duties concerning said bridge were laid upon the county commissioners, and in all proceedings relative to the same, the commissioners alone are the representatives of the county. The petitioners, therefore, had no standing in court: Broomall’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="75 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1036622" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0173-01">75 Pa. 173</a>.</p>

The summary striking off the judgment was an assumption of power not vested in the court, not only for the reasons above presented, but because the court has no power to strike off or vacate a judgment which is regular on its face: Breden v.

Bridges are of course determined upon by mutual concession and arrangements among the grand jurors brought together from all parts of the county. If after their report is finally approved, any set of citizens may come in and on this ground have the approval of a bridge stricken off at any length of time before the bridge is built, the procedure will simply be a fruitful source of litigation and uncertainty.</p>

Is a judgment regular, where a man acts as judge in his own case, — as petitioner for the bridge and as foreman of the grand jury in one and the same person ?

Striking off the approval of the court, is not striking off the judgment ; it is merely the opening of it. And after the approval had been lifted, the applicants still had another chance before the grand jury, but they did not avail themselves of it.

    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[140,558,1184,1118]]]'>There is but a single question raised on this record. The report of the grand jury locating a county bridge in Nescopeck and appropriating 11,500 to its construction, was presented in court on November 19, 1881, and on the same day, without notice to the county or township authorities, was approved by the court. On May 14, 1884, the bridge not having been built by the county, on the petition of citizens and tax-payers of Luzerne county a rule to show cause why the approval of the court should not be struck off was granted, and notice directed to the county commissioners and the supervisors of Nescopeck. This rule was made absolute on October 27, 1884, for the reason that the foreman of the grand jury which made the report was a petitioner for the bridge, and took part in the deliberations of that body upon the propriety of granting his own petition. A motion to reinstate the rule was refused on November 16, 1885. The contention of the plaintiff in error is that the court had no power to make the order vacating or striking off the approval of the report. He argues that the indorsement of the approval of the court was a judgment rendered by the Quarter Sessions, and that the power of the court over it ended with the term in which it was entered.</p>
    <p id="b329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_329.7",329,[140,1695,1180,717]],["BL_330.1",330,[260,354,1183,87]]]'>In support of this proposition, King v. Brooks, <a href="/pa/72/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="72 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="434695" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0363-01">72 Pa. 363</a>, is cited by the plaintiff in error. But the question under consideration in that case related to a common law judgment entered upon a verdict. In the opinion delivered by Sharswoor», J., it is stated that judgments appearing to be regular on the record should not be struck off after the close of the term, but that judgments entered by virtue of a warrant of attorney or by default may be opened or vacated for cause, without limit as to time. The rule to be gathered from the cases seems to be, that for reasons appearing upon the face of the record, a judgment by default or upon warrant of attorney may be struck off, whenever the defect in the record is brought to the attention of the court, without regard to the term in which it was entered. So, for reasons appearing dehors the <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>record, such judgment may be opened to let in a defence without limit as to time. &lt;</p>
    <p id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[256,458,1187,1689]]]'>If we concede to the entry of approval upon the return of the grand jury the effect of a judgment by default, as is contended for by the plaintiff in error, yet the reason for the action of the court was upon the face of the record. The foreman of the grand jury was a petitioner for the bridge. This made him a party to the proceeding. As a grand juror he was to act upon his own petition. While representing the public and inquiring into the necessity for the expenditui’e of $1,500 on the part of the county, in the erecting of this bridge, as a party he was asking that the expenditure should be made, and representing the bridge to be necessary. These positions were clearly incompatible. The public had the right to an impartial and disinterested grand jury, so that the questions of the necessity and cost of the bridge might be passed upon without bias. But the record showed that a petitioner was foreman of the grand jury that granted the petition. This was a sufficient reason for setting the report aside, and if the attention of the court had been called to it when the report was presented it would have been done promptly. It has been held repeatedly that a report of viewers should be set aside when a petitioner is one of the viewers: May Town Road, <a href="/yeates/4/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Yeates 479" data-case-ids="6775815" data-case-paths="/yeates/4/0479-01">4 Y. 479</a>; Radnor Road, <a href="/binn/5/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Binn. 612" data-case-ids="1793638" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0612-01">5 Binn. 612</a>. If such a defect in a report of viewers should escape notice when the report came up regularly for confirmation, the court would, whenever its attention was called to it, set aside the order of confirmation, unless the road had been actually opened and expenditures made in good faith in pursuance of it. So, in the case under consideration, the defect escaped the attention of the court when the report of the grand jury came up for confirmation, but it was discovered and attention called to it before the erection of the bridge, and the court was clearly within the rule when the order was made striking off the approval of the court.</p>
