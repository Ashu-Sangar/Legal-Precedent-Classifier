It was between six <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>and seven o’clock in the morning, and very dark. The two tracks of the defendant company’s road cross East street, at Sixth street, nearly at a right angle. On East street, on both sides of the street and across the railroad tracks, the sidewalks, for a distance of sixty feet, were constructed and maintained by the defendant company and were in good condition at the time referred to. In the roadway of East street, at the railroad crossing, planking was put down on the outside and on the inside of the rails so that vehicles could cross the tracks easily. The planking Avas about twenty-two feet in length along the tracks, and at either end of the planking the rails were exposed above the ties, AA'ith the ballast nearly even with the upper surface of the ties.</p>

At the time stated, the plaintiff came up the west side of East street to a certain, point, where he left the sidewalk and without a light started diagonally across the street in the direction of the shops. In crossing the railroad tracks near the middle of the street his foot was caught on one of the rails, when he fell and broke his leg above the knee.

Of course, whenever a railroad crosses a street in a town like this, naturally and necessarily there is more or less danger, at the point where it crosses the road, to persons who may be traveling on the highway; and this fact would impose upon persons traveling on the highway the duty to exercise a greater degree of care when traveling across the tracks than would be required if no railroad were there.</p>

He says that he struck, or “ stubbed ” his foot against a rail, fell and broke his leg; and he claims now to recover damages for the injury that is done him, alleging that the injury to him was in consequence of the negligence of the railroad company in not putting and keeping this crossing in proper repair. Your first inquiry, therefore, in the natural order, will be whether this railroad company was negligent in the making and maintaining of this crossing; and then, if so, whether the negligence of the company was the proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff. What is meant by “ proximate cause ” is that the injury must be the natural and probable consequence of the negligence, such a conseqxxence as, under all the circumstances of the case, might and oxxght to have been foreseen by the wrong-doer, the railroad company in this instance, as likely to flow from his act.</p>

In other words, was it negligence in them to construct their road at that point in the xnanner in which they did construct it? I cannot say to you, as matter of law, that the omission of the railroad company to plank that road the whole distance across the street was negligence ; it is a question that you must determine, under all the evidence in this cause. The railroad company was bound to so construct their road at that point that people passing along that road or street could do so with safety to themselves and to their teams and carriages, they using <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>reasonable and ordinary care and caution while crossing the tracks. Persons traveling on foot would have a right to travel on that street, would have a right to cross it at any point at which they chose to cross it: if they were traveling along a highway in which a railroad runs parallel with the line of the street, then to cross would be to take great risks upon themselves. While a pedestrian has the right to use the public highway, he must exercise such care and caution while on a part of the street devoted to or used for the purpose of traveling with teams, carriages and on horseback, must use such care, and caution as the circumstances at the time require, what is called ordinary caution.

Where there are paved sidewalks in a town like this, they are intended for footmen; and the streets are intended primarily for the passage of carriages, horses, persons using teams or riding on horseback; yet, as I have already said,, a footman may leave the sidewalk and cross the street at other points than at regular paved crossings, but in doing so, he must exercise due care and caution, such care, of course, being graded or gauged according to the immediate, surrounding circumstances.</p>

However much the railroad company may be in fault, if this plaintiff himself was guilty of negligence in crossing that road, or crossing at that point at the time and under the circumstances he did, and if his negligence contributed in any degree to the injury which he suffered, the law holds that he cannot recover any dama<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>ges. The defendant company claims that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in crossing at the point where he did cross on that morning, and that his negligence and carelessness in so doing did contribute to his injury. Negligence is the omission of something that the exigency of circumstances requires. Was this defendant negligent? Was he careless, in attempting to cross the street at the point where this railroad intersects it? He was employed in a shop somewhere near this crossing, and had been employed there for several years, and for nearly ten months had been in the habit of crossing these railroad tracks at this point from three to four times daily, having moved on the first of April, 1883, into the house where he resided when this accident occurred. He tells us that his usual route was to pass along the west side of East street on the sidewalk, crossing over the railroad track until he came into the vicinity of Gigger’s hotel, and then to cross over the street directly to the shop. He does not remember that he ever crossed the street at the point of intersection with the railroad, 'though he says he may have done so a few times. It is argued by defendant’s counsel that the plaintiff must necessarily have known the condition of this railroad, and that, if it was dangerous, he must have known, or might have known, that fact; and that, knowing that fact, his attempt to cross over the railroad there, in order to save a short distance in his walk or travel, precludes his recovery in this suit. We instruct you that if this crossing was dangerous, and if this plaintiff knew that fact when he attempted to cross upon it, he cannot recover in this suit; for the evidence is clear and uncontradicted that there was a safe way for him to travel, by crossing the railway track on the sidewalk, as he usually had done. Did he know that this crossing was dangerous? He swears that he did not know of its condition, that he had never noticed whether it was planked all the way across the street or not.</p>

The law makes this plaintiff a competent witness; and you are to determine from all the evidence in the case whether he did have knowledge of the dangerous condition of the crossing. If you find that the plaintiff had knowledge of <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>the condition, the dangerous condition, of this road, if it was in a dangerous condition, then the next question for you to determine is was he guilty of negligence, actual negligence, in attempting to cross over the street at that point under the circumstances then present to him? I have already stated to you — what has been very prominent in the case, and you of course will recollect — where the plaintiff worked, his usual route in going to his work; and he tells us that that morning was dark and cold, that he was in a hurry, and that, when he got to this point marked on the map A, he struck diagonally across the railroad track, in order to save time. I have said to you already that he had a right to cross the street at any point at which he chose to cross it; I have said to you that it was the duty of the railroad company to put the crossing in such reasonable and safe condition that persons traveling over it would do so with safety to themselves. Now, bearing in mind the right of the plaintiff to cross the street there, and bearing in mind the duty of the railroad company, was this plaintiff, in attempting to cross at that time in the morning, it being dark, as he says — so dark that he could not see where he was going, is my recollection of the substance of what he said upon that point — -bearing in mind the fact that the street lamp was not lit, and bearing any fact in mind about his physical condition —because he was lame or stiff in one leg — I say, taking all this into consideration, did he act as an ordinarily prudent and cautious man would have acted under the same set of circumstances ? If he did, then, if he received an injury in consequence of the neglect of the defendant company to put that crossing in proper repair, he would be entitled to recover; if he did not act with that ordinary care and caution with which an ordinarily, reasonably prudent and cautious man would have acted under the same set of circumstances, and if his negligence or carelessness contributed to his injury,'then he cannot recover.</p>
