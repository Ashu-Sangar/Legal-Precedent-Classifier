The defendant appealed from the judgment of the aider-man within twenty days, paid the costs accrued, filed the affidavit and gave the bail required by the act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 43. On the argument, the defendant offered to file an amended affidavit to correspond with the requirements of § 1, act of February 28, 1870, P.

L. 43, is class legislation, and applies only to suits “ for wages for manual labor.” The suit was brought in this case for “work and labor done,” which might be work other than manual labor. As the plaintiffs are claiming a right not common to citizens generally, every requisite to bring the case within the act should appear upon the record clearly and not argumentatively: Womelsdorf v. Heifner, <a href="/pa/104/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="104 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="452214" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0001-01">104 Pa. 1</a>; Del. &amp; H. Canal Co. v.

L. 269, was a special local act, providing only for appeals in suits for wages for work done in Luzerne county. Being class legislation, this act must be construed strictly. It is not set forth in the record of the justice that the work and labor for which the plaintiffs claimed was done in Luzerne county; wherefore, the act is not applicable. Even if it were applicable, it is repealed by § 6, act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 47.</p>

(2) Nor that the defendant is an owner, lessee, contractor, or <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>under-owner “of any works, mines, manufactory or other business where clerks, miners or mechanics are employed.” (8) The act of April 20, 1876, P.

L. 47, as amended by §§ 1, 2, act of June 13, 1883, P. L. 116. The appeal could not be taken under the act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 43, because the plaintiffs’ claim was for “ work and labor done,” and the provisions of that act have reference to wages for “manual labor:” Womelsdorf v.

L. 47, is not applicable to this case. By the first section, it is provided that moneys due for labor and services rendered by any miner, mechanic, laborer, or clerk, and many others, “from any person or persons or chartered company employing clerks, miners, mechanics, or laborers, either as owners, lessees, contractors, or under-owners, of any works, mines, manufactory, or other business where clerks, miners, or mechanics are employed,” shall be a lien, etc. Section 5 provides that, “ In all cases of appeal from the judgments of justices of the peace for wages or moneys mentioned in the first section of this act,” <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>a certain oath or affirmation shall be made and certain bail shall be required.</p>

The wages must be due to one of the class named, and from one of the enumerated classes of debtors mentioned in the act, and this must be made affirmatively to appear in the claim for a lien, otherwise the claimant is not entitled to a lien. In regulating appeals from justices in the fifth section, the particular formalities required to be observed are obligatory only in case of suits for wages or moneys mentioned in the first section.</p>
    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[239,1066,1189,818]]]'>In the present case the only knowledge we can have on this subject, is that which is derived from an inspection of the justice’s transcript. Upon referring to the transcript we find nothing to individuate the claim of the plaintiffs, except that it is for work and labor done by their son for the defendant. It is therefore not a claim by the laborer himself for his own wages, but by his parents for wages which they claim a right to have for services rendered by him. It is needless to say that the act of 1872 gives no preference to any such claims as this. But again, neither is the kind of .labor indicated, nor is there the slightest allegation on this record that the person who owes the wages is one of the enumerated classes of debtors against whom the preferences of the act are given. In either point of view there is an entire absence of the statutory requirements which are necessary to appear in order to bring this case within the purview of the act.</p>
    <p id="b572-6" data-blocks='[["BL_572.6",572,[237,1892,1187,403]]]'>As the act of 1872 is inapplicable, it is only necessary to say that we are not referred to any other law which establishes the invalidity of the recognizance and affidavit for appeal entered and made when this appeal was taken. They are quite in conformity to the requirements of § 1 of the act of April 20,1876, P. L. 43, which seems to be applicable; but, whether it is or not, we are not shown any law or decision which invalidates the appeal.</p>
