Susquehanna avenue runs east and west, and Eleventh street north and south. The team was passing from south to north; Mrs. McGill was walking from east to west on the north foot-way of Susquehanna avenue. She testified: “ I had been to the meat store at Ninth and Susquehanna avenue. It was Tuesday morning, May 27,1884. I started to go home and was walking along Susquehanna avenue. I was coming to the corner of Eleventh street, and I knew that the cars came down Eleventh street. I looked about and saw that the road was clear. I turned my head around a little to see whether cars or anything was coming. In an instant I was knocked down. The pole struck me on the leg. I was picked up. Mr. Dougherty stood me up. My leg went under, and I said: ‘ Oh, my leg is broke! ’ Dougherty hallooed to his barkeeper or somebody for a chair, and put me on it. I was then carried home. I laid down on the lounge down-stairs, until the doctor came. He said he would have to get another doctor, my leg was broke. He came back about five o’clock with the other doctor to set my leg. My suffering commenced then. I had to put my leg in a sand-box. I had the box on nine weeks. Then I was put in a hammock for three days, but that didn’t do well and I had to go back to bed and put the box- on again another week. After that I got up and put my clothes on. Gradually I got on crutches.”</p>

It came down over my face and was tied pretty tight......I passed Dougherty on his own corner. I did not see the wagon then. Did not see the wagon at all. Did not hear it coming. I looked ahead and saw the road clear before me and then I looked up for the car. I looked straight across Eleventh street. Did not look up or down Eleventh street. I did not hear the wagon.

I felt the pole strike me. As far as I can say it was the pole that struck me. I felt it. Something struck me. I could not say for sure that I was struck. Can’t say whether I fell on a cobble-stone. I know the pole struck me. I did not stumble and fall as I know of.”</p>

I ran to pick her up. She said, ‘ Oh, my leg is broke! ’ My wife or niece came out and brought a chair and I put Mrs. McGill on it. She said she was Mrs. McGill. I then took her home. Wagon came at a right fast trot for a beer wagon. Driver did not slacken speed when he came to crossing.” Other eye-witnesses described the occurrence, and it was shown that the injuries received caused great pain and suffering and resulted in a permanent shortening of the plaintiff’s right leg about one and three-fourths inches.

I got to Susquehanna avenue before she got to curbstone. She saw the horses when they were about two feet away from her, jumped back and fell towards the right. She fell on the crossing-stone.

    <p id="b445-10" data-blocks='[["BL_445.9",445,[125,1105,1183,976]]]'>1. The refusal by the court to instruct the jury as requested by the defendant, amounted to a denial of the right of the defendant to the use of the highway, and to make him responsible for an injury while traveling in an ordinary manner. The driver was passing on that part of the street set apart for wagons, and where he had a right to be. He saw the plaintiff on the pavement approaching the crossing. He had a right to presume she saw him, and that his direction was across her path. She was still on the pavement when he got into Susquehanna avenue. Upon the plaintiff the law imposed the duty to look and notice whether any vehicle was coming along the highway, which had a right to be there, and if, when she reached the curb, she found she had not time enough to cross over in safety, it was negligence on her part to try to cross in front of the horses. Had she looked, she could have seen what must have been right before her eyes; if she did not look, she was negligent, and if she did, she was negligent in attempting to cross in front of the horses which she could plainly see: Sykes v. Packer, <a href="/pa/99/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="99 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="446055" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0465-01">99 Pa. 465</a>.</p>

When the plaintiff attempted to cross, the horses were in the middle of the avenue, and had the driver been going at three miles an hour, the accident would still have happened; the plaintiff had only to make five steps to place herself in front of the horses, if it was true she was between the tracks when she <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>was struck. “ The rate of speed would be immaterial, for, upon such a sudden appearance of the child on the track, no rate of speed, no matter how slow, could have saved it: ” P. &amp; R.

While the court said, “ If both parties are at fault the verdict must be for the defendant,” yet the refusal of the point left the jury without any direction as to what would constitute negligence on part of the plaintiff. When the exercise of ordinary prudence and care on the part- of the plaintiff would have prevented the accident, plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence if she did not take all the care that prudence would suggest to avoid the injury: Lehigh V. R. Co. v. Greiner, <a href="/pa/113/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="113 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="457587" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0600-01">113 Pa. 600</a>; Goshorn v.

The failure of the plaintiff to look whether defendant’s wagon was about to cross Susquehanna avenue, and the testimony of the driver that the pole of the wagon did not strike the plaintiff, but that the fracture was caused by a fall, were not referred to by the court.

Moreover, drivers of beer wagons cannot justify the reckless running down of citizens, by satisfying the jury that the average care of their class was very low and they had not fallen below it.

    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[245,403,1188,612]]]'>We have before us two assignments of error for our consideration : the first to the court’s answer to one of the defendant’s points, and the other to the charge. The defendant requested the court to rule that “ if the jury believe that at the time of the alleged accident, the defendant’s driver was traveling in an ordinary manner, the defendant is not liable for an injury resulting from the use of the public street.” This request was refused. It is also alleged that the charge of the court was inadequate in this, that it did not refer to the facts proved at the trial, and did not properly direct the attention of the jury to the evidence tending to establish contributory negligence on part of the plaintiff below.</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[245,1022,1186,861]]]'>We are of the opinion that neither of these assignments can be sustained. The first, because it assumes the very point in controversy. The question was, Was the driver of the beer wagon traveling over the public crossing in an ordinary manner ? — that is, with the ordinary care which was requisite when passing a point such as that where the accident happened. Common sense will teach any person of ordinary mental calibre, that what is ordinary care must depend largely upon circumstances. Trotting a team of horses at a “fast rate for a beer wagon,” may be well enough along the open street, whilst on the other hand, it may be gross carelessness when passing a crossing where foot passengers are constantly to be expected, and among them many old people and children. As the learned judge, before whom this case was tried, well said, under such circumstances both parties are held to ordinary care, and the careless party must suffer the consequences resulting from his own carelessness.</p>
    <p id="b448-7" data-blocks='[["BL_448.7",448,[246,1900,1185,509]],["BL_449.1",449,[139,348,1181,1231]]]'>Here was a place where both parties must be on the lookout ; the one for passing teams, and the other for foot passengers. Both have the, right of way, and both must be equally cautious. How then, is it possible to apply the doctrine found in Waters v. Wing, <a href="/pa/59/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="59 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="426996" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0211-01">59 Pa. 211</a>, to the contention in hand? The accident in that case did not occur- at a crossing, but on the open road. The plaintiff’s son, on horseback, was approaching the defendant, who was driving his buggy along the highway, which was abundantly wide for the safe passage of both, and the former ran his horse so hard against one of <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>the shafts of the buggy as to instantly kill it. Thus, whilst the rule cited was altogether proper for the case to which it was applied, it would be altogether improper for the case in hand. Nor are the cases of Goshorn v. Smith, <a href="/pa/92/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="92 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="491011" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0435-01">92 Pa. 435</a>, and Baker v. Fehr, <a href="/pa/97/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="97 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="444789" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0070-01">97 Pa. 70</a>, more in point than the one cited, for in neither did the accident happen through the negligence of the defendant. In the one, the plaintiff, unexpectedly to the driver of the wagon, by which he was injured, moved suddenly in the way of the coming team, and in such a manner that the defendant could neither anticipate nor guard against the accident. In the other, Fehr, the deceased, was struck and killed by a passing ice wagon. He had just got off the front platform of a street car, whilst the wagon was passing; several persons endeavored to warn him of his danger, and the driver did what he could to stop his mules, but Fehr either did not hear, or did not heed the warnings, and backed or walked directly against one of the mules, and was killed. To discover the analogy between these cases, and the case under discussion, is beyond our power; hence we conclude that it does not exist. Here is an accident at a public crossing, where both team and foot passenger had the right of way, and where both were required to use care. Who, then, was negligent, if either? was the natural and material question, and the solution thereof was clearly for the jury, not for the court.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[137,1588,1183,712]]]'>Nor can we discover any defect such as that complained of in the learned judge’s charge. It is true, he does not comment specially on the evidence, and calls attention oidy to such of it as indicates the position of the wagon when the witnesses first saw it. But the testimony was neither complex nor voluminous; therefore, particular reference to it was unnecessary. The attention, however, of the jury was very clearly called to the law governing the case. The plaintiff must establish the fact of negligence on part of the defendant’s driver; if both parties were in fault, the verdict must be for the defendant ; they must be satisfied that there was negligence by the one party alone. This was surely so plain that the ordinary juryman could not fail to understand it, or if he did so fail, it was not the fault of the court.</p>
    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[788,2312,485,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
