The sale was under the order of court in (apparently) an adverse proceeding with permission to the executors to bid, and with a subsequent confirmation by the court: such a purchase, under the doctrine recognized in Pennsylvania, in Fisk v. Sarber, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2027" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 27">6 W. &amp; S. 27</a>; Chorpenning’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/32/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="32 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="986767" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0315-01">32 Pa. 315</a>, must be conceded to be valid, especially as against persons participating in their own right, by themselves or their creditors, in a subsequent distribution of the proceeds. A purchase by a trustee is voidable, not void: and a receipt by the beneficiary, under no disability, and with full knowledge of all the facts, of his share of the purchase money, may operate as a ratification, and estop him from questioning its validity. Such estoppel, however, could not arise in the case of Mrs. Deal, or of the other persons whose participation in the proceeds of the sale was only through the executors themselves in their capacity as trustees.</p>

When their functions as executors ceased, their duties as trustees for the shares which were directed to be held in trust began, and this relation created a new disability in the way of their becoming purchasers. The principles with regard to trustees are familiar and perfectly well settled. The law exacts the most unswerving fidelity to the cestuis que trustent, and without regard to honesty of motive, will not permit the trustee to derive in any manner a profit or personal advantage from the trust property, and this even though the advantage would be lost if not taken by him; as in the case of a renewal of a lease which the lessor had refused to the cestui que trust: Featherstonhaugh v. Fenwick, 17 Vesey 298; Perry on Trusts, § 196; Johnson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/115/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="115 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="551644" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0129-01">115 Pa. 129</a>. Whatever can be gained by the personal effort of the trustee belongs to the cestui que trust. “ The trustee cannot use the trust property, <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>nor his relation to it, for his own personal advantage. All power and influence which the possession of the trust fund gives, must be used for the advantage and profit of the beneficial owners, and not for personal gain or emolument of the trustee. No other rule would be safe; nor would it be possible for the courts to apply any other rule as between trustee and cestui que trust:” Perry on Trusts, § 427, citing many authorities.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[143,761,1184,1648]],["BL_76.1",76,[252,345,1188,355]]]'>In the present case, the necessity for the sale arose solely from the attachment of the shares of two out of eight distributees. The value of the entire property being fixed by the sale for $13,900, $3,475, or two eighths, was the utmost that was required for the preservation of the estate to the remaining six owners; and before the sale took place the accountants had ascertained, as the evidence shows, that they could raise $4,500 by mortgage of the property. There can be no doubt, if application had been made to the court, that specific authority to the trustees to unite with the other owners in thus raising the money and taking the property at the amount of the bid would have been given, if indeed it was not already conferred by the permission in the decree ordering the sale “ to all persons in interest ” to become bidders; the trustees were certainly included in the language thus used. If there was any doubt upon this subject, it was not too late after the property had been struck down to the accountants and Mrs. Castor, to make an application on behalf of the cestuis que trustent to the court. The price was a low one; somewhat larger, it is true, than the assessed value ($11,200), but $1,100 less than the amount to which the purchasers had agreed to go; far less than the price at which the adjoining property had sold the year before, and less than one half of what this very property has since, within two years of the sale, been disposed of for. Can it be possible, under these circumstances, that trustees without making an effort to secure the interests of their cestuis que trustent, may avail themselves of opportunities furnished by the property itself to become the purchasers, and hold for their own exclusive benefit ? There was evidence that Charles C. Baker made efforts to deter bidders at the sale, by representing that he intended to buy in for thejlamily. It is true this is positively denied by him, but one thing is certain: The <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>decree gave leave to the “ executors ” to purchase; Mr. Stover was known to be counsel for the executors; and the bidding was by. him. Persons attending the sale, therefore, would naturally assume that he was acting for the executors as the representatives of the family, and would as a consequence, refrain from bidding against him. Thus an additional advantage would be gained to the prejudice of the cestuis que trustent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.4",76,[247,707,1190,1746]]]'>But there was much more than this. Though the amount of the bid, $13,900, was debited in the account of April, 1885, as received March 14, -1885, the only money actually paid by the purchasers was the $500 required by the conditions of sale to be paid to the auctioneer, and the $4,500 which, at some time subsequent to the deed to them, were raised on mortgage in pursuance of the understanding, already referred to, made with the mortgagee prior to the sale. The purpose of this mortgage, as testified by Mrs. Haman and the husband and agent of Mrs. Castor, was merely to raise money to pay the creditors attaching the shares of George W. Baker and Abram Baker. Not a dollar was paid for the trusts for Mrs. Deal, Johu R. Rausch or Harry C. Baker. Even after the adjudication of July 3,1885, had specifically awarded payment, no money was paid for these trusts. During all this time, if judgments had been obtained against the purchasers, if their ownership was to the exclusion of the cestuis que trustent; the property might have been swept away and the cestuis que trustent cut out altogether. It was not until November, 1886, after Mrs. Deal had taken steps to assert her rights, that a second mortgage for $5,000 was created, and the amount awarded for her trust deposited to the credit of Charles C. Baker as trustee. From the date of the sale up to this time, no interest whatever was paid or offered to be paid to Mrs. Deal, though the will provided that her share of the estate should be placed on interest “ on good real estate or other sufficient security.....and interest, income and profits arising therefrom from time to time when and as often as the same has been gotten in and received,” paid to her. There was affirmative evidence, which was not contradicted, that Charles C. Baker, at various times when the subject of interest was spoken of, by or on behalf of Mrs. Deal, had declared that her money remained in the property and that she would participate in the profits arising from a re-sale.</p>

      <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>Apart from this evidence, however, it is apparent from what has been said, that the money belonging to the trust for Mrs. Deal remained in the property, and that the accountants availed themselves of their position as trustees to enable them to become purchasers without the payment of anything from their own pockets. The effect, therefore, in law, is precisely the same as if having the actual custody of trust funds they had used them in making the purchase.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b77-5" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[183,755,1181,401]]]'>It was testified by Mr. Castor, that the only money which his wife was called upon to contribute toward the purchase was one third of the $500, paid to the auctioneer. This is true also as to Mrs. Haman and Charles C. Baker, with the important difference, that they each held, not for the cestuis que trustent but for themselves, the trust moneys awarded by the adjudication of 1884, amounting in all to more than the whole $500.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b77-6" data-blocks='[["BL_77.5",77,[180,1169,1184,1126]]]'>It was contended by Mr. Stover that as Charles C. Baker claimed that the shares of George W. Baker and Abram had been assigned to him prior to the attachments, it was supposed that no part of the purchase money would have to be paid to the attaching creditors; and that, therefore, the hand-money and moneys raised by mortgage were sufficient to pay the shares held in trust. The assertion is in conflict with the testimony of Mrs. Haman and Mr. Foster and with the decision of the court. Mrs. .Haman said: “ Mrs. Castor, Charles and myself joined in. There was $500 paid by the three of us. Wo had to borrow the money to pay the boys’ creditors.” And how, it may be asked, would it have been possible to pay three shares, amounting in all to $5,228.99, with $5,000, even had the latter sum not been reduced by the expenses of sale and other payments credited in the final account? But as already stated, in point of fact the money was not so applied. The trust shares remained in the property, and their retention there made the purchase possible without the expenditure of a dollar of the individual means of the nominal purchasers, who now, after having so had the benefit of this use, seek to retain for themselves a profit exceeding the sum at which the property was struck down to them.</p>

If the shares of George <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>W. Baker and Abram Baker had been assigned to Charles C. Baker before the attachments, why was the sale permitted at all ? Why, after the demurrer was overruled and leave given to answer, did the executors instruct their counsel to say to the court, as set forth in the decree, “that he has no further answer to make to said petition?” If in point of fact there had been the assignment, it would have been a complete defence ; and in this view of the case, the sale, which might have been prevented, may be said to have been procured by the executors, and the purchase by them or any of them would not be protected by the doctrine of Fisk v.

The first impression of the auditing judge was that it was one eighth, but subsequent reflection has led him to a different conclusion. The interests of George W. Baker and Abram Baker were wiped out by the executors’ sale and the award to their creditors of their shares of the proceeds. The purchase by Mrs. Hamah, Mrs. Castor ' and Charles C. Baker, without the payment of any of their own moneys except, perhaps, the insignificant sum deposited with the auctioneer, having been accomplished by the retention of the shares' belonging to the several trusts, the proportions belonging to the latter are to be measured by the number of persons acquiring an interest by reason of such purchase. This will give to each one sixth. It is clear, however, so far as Mrs. Castor is concerned, that her liability cannot be enforced in the Orphans’ Court. She was not an executor or trustee; and while it was held in Guillou v. Peterson, <a href="/pa/89/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="89 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1063276" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0163-01">89 Pa. 163</a>, that a partner of an executor having knowledge of the use of trust property for the benefit of the firm was liable to the cestui que trust, the question as to her can only be considered in the Court of Common Pleas.

Disston &amp; Co., for $28,000, out of which they paid their agent for effecting the sale $500, thus leaving a profit of $13,600. If when they purchased the land at the sale ordered by the court they had actually paid in cash the proportion due their cestuis que trustent and upon the settlement of their account, set apart and invested the awards to them as trustees, they then would have shown their good faith in the purchase, which by the decree of the court they were authorized to make. They were not bound to pay into their hands as executors the amount of their own distributive shares, unless needed for payment of debts or incumbrances upon the land, but it was their duty as purchasers, to pay and be prepared to account for, the remainder of the purchase money in cash. And having neglected this a duty even up to the date of the final confirmation of their account, and the decree of distribution, and retained the amount in the land they purchased, by their subsequent sale to Messrs. Disston &amp; Co. at a large profit, we have clearly and undeniably a case of trustees speculating with money of their cestuis que trustent. And when they account to their cestuis que trustent they conceal their profitable speculation, and say that all they have in their custody and trust for her, is her share of the original sum of $13,900, which they professed to have received in March, 1885, but which they never did actually pay to themselves as trustees.</p>

They both cover the ground fully, and the only reason we add one word thereto is to emphasize the principle upon which their decree rests, that a trustee will not, under any circumstances, be allowed to make a profit out of the trust funds. Whatever profit arises therefrom in any way belongs to the owner of the fund, and not to its custodian. As was said in Norris’s Appeal, 71 Pa., at page 125: “It is a well-settled rule that where a trustee speculates with the trust funds he may be held to profits or interest at the option of the cestui que trust. Profits, if the investment has been successful, and interest, if it has been disastrous. In no event will the trustee be allowed to make a profit out of the trust fund. The law holds out no inducements to trustees to so misapply the estate. He may lose, but he cannot make by so doing. It is equally clear that when the trust funds can be fairly traced into the purchase of any particular stock, the latter shall be held to belong to the estate, if the cestui que trust so elect. The cases upon this point are numerous and strong.” In addition to the authorities there cited we may add Seguin’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/103/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="103 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="449089" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0139-01">103 Pa. 139</a>; McLaughlin v.

The auditing judge, and the court below, have distinctly found that they did not do this. On the contrary, the money of their cestuis que trustent was practically used in this purchase, and when they sold the property, subsequently, to the Disstons at a profit of $13,600, they were selling property which <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>the money of the eestuis que trustent had in part at least paid for.
