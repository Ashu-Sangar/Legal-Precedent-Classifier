Verrier, the cestui que trust under his will. This money amounted to between $52,000 and $53,000, of which the testator held no evidence whatever and no security. The amount-appeared upon the books of Mr. Rene Guillou, who at that time was a large owner of real estate, which, however, was all or nearly all incumbered with mortgages. About this time, September, 1873, the great financial panic caused by the Jay Cooke failure occurred, and all values were very much depreciated, particularly real estate; and beyond doubt had the real estate <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>bf Rene Guillou been forced to a sale, then or at any time since, tbe estate of Mr. Verrier would not have realized anything. Mr. Victor Guillou, tbe executor, with tbe assistance of Mr. Samuel Dickson, bis counsel, investigated tbe affairs of bis uncle Rene Guillou, and tbe result of this investigation was that Mr. Rene Guillou was allowed to manage his real estate according to his best judgment for the interests of all concerned, but not to dispose of any of it without notice and consultation. This arrangement was approved of by Mrs. Verrier. The auditor states that it is not necessary for him to recite in detail the particulars of Mr. Rene Guillou’s dealings with his properties under this arrangement, but the auditor h^s no reason to doubt that he acted in the utmost good faith in carrying out the arrangement he made with his nephew, the executor, and his niece, the life tenant, Mrs. Verrier. He made some payments on account of principal, and he continued to pay to her the interest on the debt due her husband, down to the fall of 1878, when, because the taxes, repairs, interest on incumbrances, etc., ate up the income, he has been unable to do so ever since.</p>

Percy Keating represented this attaching creditor, and after investigation they became convinced that to push their claim to execution would result in their not realizing anything for their client. They accordingly, in July, 1881, settled by accepting mortgages from Mr. Rene Guillou for their claim, and a small sum in cash, as will be referred to hereafter.</p>

This property was incumbered with mortgages amounting to $151,000. On August 26,1879, Rene Guillou executed to Victor Guillou, executor of Florencio J. Verrier, a bond and mortgage on the-whole of this property for $47,300, being the balance then due Verrier’s estate, payable in one year. This mortgage was <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>of course subject to the prior incumbrances.

This arrangement is still in force, but the net income has amounted as yet to enough to pay the interest upon the first mortgages only. Mr. llene Guillou was examined fully as to all these matters and the books of account of rents were open, and there was no allegation or evidence made or offered to show that liis statements were incorrect or that the facts were otherwise than as set forth by him.</p>

He had also assigned to him another mortgage for $5,000 on the Fourth and Cherry streets property. Both of these mortgages were assigned to J. Percy Keating, Esq., as collateral security under the agreement hereinafter recited. The auditing judge finds that about this date, July 1, 1881, the status of the Verrier estate with relation to this property at Fourth and Cherry streets appears to have been about as follows: First mortgages for $151,000 covering the whole property; the mortgage to Victor Guillou, executor of Florencio J. Verrier, for $47,300, with another mortgage on the same property for $5,000, and one upon the Atlantic City property for $5,000 as collateral security; Edward V. Verrier held a judgment against the Verrier estate for $10,358.02, and Mde. Des Chappelles had an attachment upon the Verrier estate on her judgment against Edward V. Verrier for $4,223.63; so that if either the judgment creditor, or attaching creditor of the judg<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>ment creditor, were to push their claims, both being against the estate of Florencio J. Verrier, the result must be the sale of the property by the sheriff, subject to the $151,000 of mortgages. If this had been done it is very doubtful if one dollar would have been realized for either of them. Verrier’s estate and the creditors of Verrier’s estate would both alike have been sacrificed.</p>

He has rented the same, paid the taxes, water-rent, interest on incumbrances, and exercised every other act of ownership. The only evidence offered to show that Mr. Victor Guillou was in possession as mortgagee, was the clause of the foregoing agreement which recites that Mr. Rene Guillou covenants to assign to Victor Guillou, executor, all leases made and to be made for any part or portion of the said premises. With reference to this clause, Mr. Guillou testified that the leases were only assigned to him as an additional security for his claim and that of the other two creditors, and to protect them all against the attaching creditors of Rene Guillou, who had judgment, creditors who were attaching the rent in his hands of the tenants of the build<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>ing and thus making trouble.

Each of them recognized the fact that, with prior mortgages amounting to $151,000, to push his particular claim meant perhaps the entire loss of it; and, as the accountant in this case was behind them all in the mortgage of this estate, a much greater reason existed in his case for endeavoring to preserve the property than in the case of any of the others; for, while in the case of a <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>sheriff’s sale they might possibly get something, his prospects of doing so were so very contingent and remote as to amount to no prospect whatever. Therefore it was, that in the agreement above recited the main consideration of all appeared to be to keep down the taxes and interest on the prior incumbrances, in the hope that, if they could carry the property along, the time might arrive when the value of real estate would so much improve that a sale might be made of this particular property at a figure that would leave them all out of it without a loss. There is no doubt that this was the effort of the accountant as well as the others interested, and in that effort Rene Guillou, while he was the owner of the premises, appears to have been acting as the agent for them all. His interests were tied up with theirs. If the property could be saved from a sheriff’s sale and sold privately, there might be something for him, but if it went to a sheriff’s sale all was gone. In the report of the auditor on the first account he speaks of Mr. Rene Guillou as the agent of the accountant to manage this property, but from all that the auditing judge can see in the evidence in this case the foregoing is the extent of his agency. He represented all interests, his own included, in the effort to save a very valuable property from the hammer of the sheriff.</p>

The facts may be summarized as follows: When the testator died it Avas found that the only estate left by him consisted of about $52,000, which was in the hands of Rene Guillou, and unsecured. Mr. Guillou was the uncle of the accountant, and of the appellant, Mrs. Dabney. He was at that time the owner of a large amount of real estate, all heavily incumbered. <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>The Verrier estate was in debt to Edward V. Verrier to the extent of $10,358.02. If Rene Guillou had been pressed for the money at that time, it is clear that the Verrier estate would not have realized a dollar, either to pay its creditors or the appellants, who are respectively the widow and child of the testator. Under such circumstances the course pursued was the only one that could have been taken with any show of good sense or business sagacity. Rene Guillou executed to the accountant, as executor of Florencio J. Verrier, a mortgage in the sum of $47,300, upon a valuable property at Fourth and Cherry, subject however to prior mortgages amounting to $151,000. He also gave accountant another mortgage on the same property for $5,000, and a mortgage for $5,000 on Atlantic city property. Edward V. Verrier had a judgment against the estate for his $10,358.02, and Mde. Des Chappelles had an attachment against the same estate on a judgment against Edward V. Verrier, and had obtained judgment against the accountant as garnishee in the sum of $4,223.63. As adverse proceedings on either of these judgments would have been ruin to all parties in interest, and could have benefited no one, an agreement in writing was entered into on July 1, 1881, by all the parties in interest, the accountant representing the estate of his testator, the most important feature of which was that Rene Guillou was to assign to the accountant all the leases on the Fourth street property, and to faithfully account for all the rentals of the said premises. It is not needed for the purposes of this case to specify the purposes for which such rents were to be applied. It is sufficient to say that the accountant received only $800, which amount appears in his account and is not the subject of controversy. The contention is, that Rene Guillou applied certain sums of money received for rents to other purposes, which he ought to have paid over to the accountant. It is only just to say that no actual fraud is charged in this matter, but it is contended the accountant should be surcharged with them because Rene Guillou was his agent.</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[245,2159,1187,251]],["BL_391.1",391,[151,380,1184,602]]]'>In considering this question we are bound by the findings of the facts by the auditing judge. There is not a single assignment of error to such findings. The first assignment was perhaps intended to cover this branch of the case, but it is not in conformity to the rules of court, and will not therefore <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>be considered. We have, tben, tbe facts distinctly found that Rene Guillou remained in possession of the premises, collected, the rents, paid the taxes, interest on prior liens, etc.; that the accountant never was in possession as mortgagee; that the leases were assigned to him merely as an additional security to the mortgage held by the. estate and that of the other two creditors, parties to the agreement, and to protect them all against the attaching creditors of Rene Guillou; that the latter was the agent of all parties in interest, and not of the accountant merely; that he represented all interests, his own included, in the effort to save a very valuable property from the hammer of the sheriff.</p>
    <p id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[156,1001,1182,459]]]'>Under such circumstances we need not discuss the several items with which it was attempted to surcharge the accountant. It would be hard and inequitable to hold him for the acts and omissions of Rene Guillou, acting as he was as the agent of all parties in a family affair, and where the accountant himself had no personal interest in it whatever. The accountant appears to have acted in entire good faith in an attempt to save a valuable property from destruction, which effort has been in part successful, and may eventually prove entirely so.</p>

He was not in possession of the property, did not collect the rents, and was not entitled to do so. The leases were merely assigned as collateral and to prevent attachments which, if laid, would sweep away the rents and as a necessary result prevent their application to the interest and taxes, to be followed by foreclosures and sale of the property. The agreement left the possession in Rene Guillou, with a covenant to account for the rents over and above taxes, interest, and repairs. It was no part of the duty of the executor to collect the rents and take charge of the property, and even had he volunteered to do so, he would have been entitled to employ an agent for that purpose. If he selected such agent with ordinary prudence and care he would not have been liable for his default. There is much force in the remarks of the auditing judge upon this point. He says: “ Suppose we regard Mr. Rene Guillou as the regularly employed agent of the ac<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>countant, and that, while acting in that capacity, he collected the rents of the premises and misappropriated them: Would there be any liability on the part of the accountant? Upon a question of this sort the test is: Has the accountant acted in good faith, as a prudent man would act in the management of his own affairs? There can be no.question about this. Mr. Rene G-uillou, while he was the uncle of the accountant as well as of the cestui que trust in this case, is a gentleman in whom all the other parties interested in this building appear to have had confidence. He has been unfortunate, but there was no allegation against his integrity. The rest of the creditors trusted him — why should not the accountant? He is a gentleman who is in the real estate business. He has charge of other estates for other people. On account of his personal interest in this property, he was particularly adapted for its management. It was no part of the accountant’s duty, even if he had the right, to collect the rents of this building. He would have had to employ some one as his agent. Who could be better employed than the man whose interests were identified with his own, and whose character for honesty, integrity, and fair-dealing has never been questioned? All that is required of a -trustee is common skill, prudence, and caution. An executor is not liable beyond what he receives unless in case of gross negligence. When he acts as others do with their own goods, and in good faith, he is not liable.”</p>

The first, as before observed, is not in conformity with the rules of court, and the others merely allege error in confirming the account and the adjudication of the auditing judge. No error in the account or in the adjudication is pointed out, and the decree might well have been affirmed for this reason alone.</p>
