When he (Kinports), assigned this purchase money to John W. Williams, it drew with it all the security that the legal title gave to G. R. Kinports, just as the assignment of a paper secured by a mortgage carries with it the mortgage, although it is not marked assigned at all. So that when this assignment was made to Mr. Williams, whether it was made absolute or made to secure him and indemnify him against the payment of those notes, there remained no interest in G. R. Kinports on which this judgment of Porter Kinports could attach, except the naked legal title, with the possibility that when these notes were paid, the assignment would revert to G. R. Kinports, and in such an event, his (Porter Kinports’) judgment would attach to that interest thus re-vested in him. It depended upon the happening of a contingency which did not happen; therefore, Porter Kinports had no lien upon anything except the naked legal title which remained in G. R. Kinports. He might have had a right to pay these notes, or tender payment of them, and demand a conveyance to him, and thereby have secured something upon his judgment to which his lien would attach, but it is not shown or claimed that anything of the kind was done.] 3</p>

It is so for certain purposes, but beyond that it is regarded and treated, under the law in Pennsylvania, as personal estate. While the vendor retains the legal title as security for his purchase money, the two together are considered as real estate, so far as respects the lien of judgments that may be then entered against him, and the collection and distribution of the money upon those judgments. But beyond this and for other purposes, the interest of the vendor is treated as personal estate, the right to the land as real estate being vested in the vendee: Leiper’s App., <a href="/pa/35/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="35 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="990458" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0420-01">35 Pa. 420</a>; Longwell v.

Kinports, defendant. This judgment was entered of record August 11,1876. On November 17, 1885, a judgment for want of an affidavit of defence was entered against the said defendant and Jonathan Boynton, as terre tenant, in the scire facias. Subsequently an application was made to the court below by Boynton to strike off the judgment as to him upon the ground that he was not a terre tenant, and that the judgment had never been a lien upon the particular real estate in controversy. We need not refer to these proceedings in detail; they are not very clearly stated, but appear to have resulted in an issue to try this question, and a verdict in favor of the terre tenant in conformity to a binding instruction of the court.</p>

It is undisputed that Gideon R. Kinports was the owner of this land in 1874, and that on October 8th of that year he entered into a written contract with Thomas Tozier by which he agreed to sell the said tract of land to the said Tozier for the consideration of $22,500 payable by instalments; that of these instalments, $6,000 only was paid; that on May 29, 1875, Gideon R. Kinports, by a writing duly executed, assigned the purchase money due him from Tozier, as well as his legal title to the said real estate, to John W. Williams, and that the said Williams on October 14, <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>1876, assigned the same to Jonathan Boynton. Each of these assignments upon its face shows that it was as collateral security merely, and that the sum intended to be secured was several thousand dollars less than the purchase money remaining unpaid. Neither assignment was recorded. We may further state as a part of the history of the transaction, that on March 9,1875, G. R. Kinports brought an action of ejectment against Thomas Tozier, upon the legal title, to enforce the payment of the balance of the purchase money, to which action the name of Jonathan Boynton was subsequently added as a plaintiff. This action was so proceeded with that a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff to be released upon the payment of $15,510. A judgment was entered upon this conditional verdict, which subsequently became final, and a writ of habere facias possessionem was issued April 18, 1878, and the writ executed by delivering the premises to Jonathan Boynton.</p>

Kin-ports and Thomas Tozier, of October 8,1874, was to place the equitable title in Tozier, wlfile the legal title remained in Kin-ports as security for the unpaid purchase money. A judgment in this state binds the equitable as well as the legal title, hence it needs neither argument nor the citation of authority to show that the interest of Kinports or Tozier, in the premises in question, would be bound by the lien of a judgment so long as the contract remained unexecuted, and to the extent that it was unexecuted.</p>

Kinports had parted with his entire interest in the property, there would have been nothing to which the judgment could have attached as a lien. The assignment to Williams, however, was not an absolute conveyance of either the legal title or of the unpaid purchase money. It was, as before stated, merely an assignment as collateral to secure a debt less than the purchase money remaining unpaid, while the assignment from Williams to Boynton was of the same character. This left a resulting interest in Kinports which was subject to the lien of a judgment. A judgment obtained against the vendor of land, after the execution of an article of agreement, but before the execution of a deed, binds the legal estate of the vendor; and on a sale <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>under such judgment the sheriff’s vendee stands precisely in the situation of the original vendor, and is entitled to the unpaid purchase money, payment of which he may enforce by ejectment against the terre tenant: McMullen v.

Kinports had in the real estate after the assignment to Williams, was the right to a reconveyance of the property after the payment of the debt which the assignment was intended to secure. It appears that the debt has not been paid, and the learned judge below was of the opinion, that because it has not been paid, G. R. Kinports had a mere possibility -which has never happened, and therefore he had no interest when the judgment was entered against him. But he had a right to pay the money and thus redeem the pledge, and when so redeemed, to a reconveyance or return of the property pledged. His judgment creditor would have the right to sell the property subject to the pledge, and the purchaser at such sale would be entitled to stand in Kinports’ shoes, and redeem. Whether such right would be of any value is not to the purpose. There was an interest, valuable or otherwise, to which the lien of the judgment attached, and we are of opinion it was error to instruct the jury to find for the defendant.</p>

It was an assignment of the purchase money of the real estate therein described and mentioned, “ together with all my interest and legal estate in the land,” etc., as collateral security merely. . This interest was of such a character as before remarked, as to be liable to the lien of a judgment. It was equally capable of being conveyed or mortgaged. It was assigned to Williams as a mere pledge.
