[The damage resulted from the taking away of coal which the defendants had a right to take away, ] 8 and, if the evidence is believed, from not providing sufficient supports to support the surface.

There are two places where the land has been injured, one of which contains 40 rods, or one fourth of an acre, and the other 30 rods.

      <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>Where one grants the surface of land and reserves the coal and other minerals, as in the case on hand — a part of this was probably sold in that way, but in one deed at least the surface was bought and not the coal, but the principle is the same — in such a case an implied right of support to the surface passes with the grant to the grantee ; neither the grantor nor his lessee may mine or remove the coal or other minerals without leaving actual, absolute support to the surface, unless, by some • apt words in the deed, the implied right to support is excepted from the grant. In that way the man owning this coal land could have sold it and granted the right to take the coal all out, so that the party to whom he sold the surface would not have received any compensation at all for the subsidence of the surface ; but that would depend on the manner in which the deed is drawn. In this case, as the deed is drawn, that rule does not apply. In the case on trial there is no such exception in the deed, and the right to surface support passed with the deed to Mr. Hay; and the owner of the coal, or any one holding under him, must, therefore, in mining, leave sufficient support to sustain the surface. The surface belongs to the plaintiff, Hay; the coal belongs to the defendants or those under whom they are mining. They may take all the coal, if they can do so without causing a subsidence of the surface; but they must support the surface by actual, absolute support by leaving a sufficiency of ribs and pillars to hold it up, or by the coal <em>itself; </em>and if they take it all out, they must provide actual and absolute support in some other way. The failure to sufficiently support the surface is negligence and renders the owners and workers of the mine liable for damages to the extent of the injuries sustained by the owner of the surface. The owner of a mine has a right to mine his coal in any ordinary manner, so long as he does no injury more than the injury which necessarily arises from the mere removal of the coal, independent of the caving in of the surface; but in this case the skilfulness of the mining is not involved. The case turns upon the question whether the surface was sufficiently supported by actual support which holds up the surface and keeps it from subsiding. If the jury, from the evidence, find that the surface has not been kept up by actual and sufficient support, then damages follow. It is your business then to ascertain from this evidence <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>what is reasonably and properly the amount of damages for the injury sustained.1</p>

The declaration in the former action to No. 47 August Term 1883, was for mining and removing coal under a portion of the 42 acre tract, with a description so vague that the portion alleged to have been injured can be located anywhere within the lines of the tract. The description in the second declaration is equally deficient.

It is contended that, inasmuch as the defendant was neither the owner nor the lessee of the coal under the larger tract, the damage done to the superincumbent surface by his removal of the coal, could only be recovered in an action of trespass. This we think is not the law. That would be the remedy of the owner or lessee of the coal against him, for the force is direct and immediate to the coal, but not so as to the surface; to the surface the injury is consequential: 2 T. &amp; H.

But an absolute right to surface support is not to be taken away by a mere implication from language which does not necessarily import such a result. The owner of the coal had certain surface rights which were indispensable to the carrying on of his mining operations, such as the right to go upon the surface to make explorations for the minerals beneath, and bore holes, sink shafts, drifts, etc., and the right to make roads and erect structures for taking out the coal. Hence it is a fair construction of the deed to say that in doing these things as little damage was to be done to the surface as possible. The provision referred to covers these matters, and as we have a subject to which it directly applies, it would be a strained interpretation of the deed to hold that it was intended to take away the right of surface support.</p>
