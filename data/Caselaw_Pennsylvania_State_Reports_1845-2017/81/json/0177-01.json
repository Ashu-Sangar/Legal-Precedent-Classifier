        "text": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court,\nPer Curiam.\n\u2014 The -question at issue in the trial below was fraud in the conveyance of the premises from Robert Stewart to the plaintiff. The range of evidence was- necessarily wide. For this reason it was competent to show the debts owing by Robert Stewart as a motive to the conveyance to his sister, and his declarations as to his intent to avoid payment of Fenner\u2019s debt, which arose in 1866, two years before the conveyance, but not prosecuted to sale until 1871.\nBut for the same reasons it seems to us it was error to exclude the evidence of the improvement of the property by Catharine Stewart after purchase. It was a circumstance, though slight, to show bona fides in the purchase. People do not often improve when they have no confidence in their title. The motive of improving was' a question for the jury, and not for the court. Catharine Stewart had sworn to the possession of sufficient money to make the purchase, and was corroborated by others. Whether this statement was credible was for the jury; and her conduct in regard to the property had some bearing on her credibility. An honest attempt to improve and to pay for the same is not without force in inducing the belief that the prior purchase was bond fide. Her evidence ought to have gone to the. jury for what it was worth.\nJudgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.",

    "head_matter": "Stewart versus Fenner et al.\n1. Where the question is fraud, the range of the evidence is necessarily wide.\n2. Land was conveyed by a brother to his sister; a creditor afterwards purchased the brother\u2019s interest in the land at sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment in his favor against the brother, recovered after the conveyance, for a debt owing before, but not due till afterwards. In ejectment for the land the purchaser alleged that the original conveyance was fraudulent. Held, that evidence of debts of the brother at the time of the conveyance, with declarations of his intent to avoid the payment of the purchaser\u2019s debt, was admissible on the question of fraud.\n3. Evidence by the sister that after the purchase she put improvements ou the property was admissible to show that the purchase was bond fide.\n4. The sister having testified that she owned enough money to buy the property ; the fact that she had improved the property was- for the jury on the question of her credibility.\nFebruary 21st 1876.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nError to the District Court of Philadelphia: Of July Term 3874, No. 69.\nThis was an action of ejectment, brought July 18th 1872, by Catharine Stewart against Philip Bomgardner and Lawrence Denning for two lots of ground on Fifty-fifth street, in the Twenty-fourth Ward, Philadelphia; George Fenner was afterwards admitted as a defendant.\nOn the 16th of September 1868, Bobert .Stewart, a brother of plaintiff, conveyed the premises to her; On the 2d of December 1870, Fenner recovered a judgment at December Term 1870, for $779.34, against Robert Stewart in an action brought on note from him to Fenner, dated November 5th 1866, and payable in two years and eight months after date for $500, and consequently falling due July 5th 1869. Under this judment Fenner bought the premises at sheriff's sale; the sheriff\u2019s deed to, him was acknowledged April 15th 1871.\nAfter the sheriff\u2019s sale Fenner brought ejectment against Catharine Stewart and recovered possession under a verdict in his favor. This suit was then brought by the plaintiff; the defence was that the conveyance to her was fraudulent. \u25a0\nThe case was tried before Hare, P. J., April 20th 1874.\nThe plaintiff gave in evidence'the deed to herself and that from its delivery she had collected the rents.\nThe defendants gave in evidence the sale to Fenner under his judgment against Robert Stewart.\nThey offered in evidence a judgment against him, entered November 12th 1867, for $2000; another entered November 2d 1868, for $2000, to Matilda Paskit, a sister of plaintiff and of \u25a0 Robert Stewart; this judgment is marked on the record \u201csatisfied May 15th 1872;\u201d a mechanic\u2019s lien against \u201cCatharine Stewart owner and Robert Stewart contractor,\u201d entered September 2'4th 1870 for $685.72; another judgment entered June 25th 1870, for $176.72 ; another judgment November 12th 1870, for $500.\nThe plaintiff objected to the offer, because the property was not claimed as a gift, and the judgments, &c., were a lien on it and did affect the plaintiff\u2019s title.\nThe evidence was admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.\nThe plaintiff testified: .\u201cI gave $2100 for one part and $475 for the other; I gave it all to my brother; Robert Stewart has no interest in it in any way; I worked as a laundress in Rockland street, during eighteen or nineteen years; had been living in Mr. Carver\u2019s family; my sister and a young girl were present; I kept the money in a large trunk in a segar box \u2014 I cannot say how long; part of the money had been there many years in a house we lived in for seven or eight years ; had $4000 when I moved there; I had got it by hard work; I had done washing and chores for fourteen years; am forty-nine or fifty; my sister received some arising from property sold in Ireland \u2014 $500 or $600 \u2014 nine or ten years ago, from real estafe; my sister gave me part, and I paid her back part; * * * the money was in large and small notes; a good many $100 bills; also $5\u2019s, $10\u2019s, and $l\u2019s; \u00a380 received from Ireland.\u201d\nRobert Stewart testified: \u201c In September 1868, I received from Catharine Stewart $2100 for this property; Mary E. Hunter was there and counted the money; * * * judgment of November 2d 1868, I paid out of,this money $2000 with the balance of this note December Term 1870; I had paid some of this judgment before the last trial, and some of it since; I borrowed $2000 from my other sister and gave her the note; this was after I gave the deed.\u201d\nThe plaintiff offered to show by a witness that Catharine Stewart employed him to put up buildings, and paid him subsequently to the deed from her brother.\nThe defendants objected to the offer, it was rejected and a bill of exceptions sealed.\nThere was other evidence of the actual payment by the plaintiff to her brother at the delivery of the deed, of $2575, the amount claimed by her to be the purchase-money of the real estate in question; also evidence to show that she had the money to purchase the property.\nUnder objection and exception a witness testified for defendants that \u201cRobert Stewart said that Fenner was sharp, but he would fix him; he would not pay Fenner; he would convey the property to his sisters for his board, and when he got married he would buy it back; this was in 1867.\u201d\nThe verdict was for the defendants.\nThe plaintiff took a writ of error, and assigned for error the admission in evidence of the judgments against Robert Stewart, and rejecting evidence of improvements made on the premises by the plaintiff. ,\nL. Sirst, for plaintiff in error.\n\u2014 The purchaser took title to land subject to existing subsisting liens, and therefore Catharine Stewart took no more than she bought, which rvas such interest as the grantor had. The only interest that Fenner took under the sheriffs deed was what Robert Stewart had in the land at the time of the recovery of his judgment: Nippes\u2019s Appeal, 25 P. F.

Thompson, for defendants in error.\n\u2014 Evidence of the judgments was admissible to impeach- the deed by showing that the grantor was indebted when it was made: Hinde v. Longworth, 11 Wheaton 199. The extent and effect of the evidence wasffor the jury: Kimmel v. McRight, 2 Barr 38; Caldwell v. Boyd, 7 P. F. Smith 321.
