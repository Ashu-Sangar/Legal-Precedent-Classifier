    "head_matter": "Shallcross versus Smith.\n1. A married woman and her husband executed & joint bond with warrant; judgment was entered on it against both: Held, that as to the wife the bond and warrant were a nullity and the judgment against her could be stricken off.\n2. The bond and warrant being a nullity as to the wife, itwas the husband\u2019s bond singly and it was not error to refuse to strike off the judgment as to him.\nFebruary 16th 1875.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia: Of July Term 1875, No. 28.\nOn the 11th of September 1871, Samuel S. Shallcross and Lamira A. Shallcross his wife, entered into a joint bond for $7400, conditioned for the payment of $3700. The bond was secured by a mortgage of the same parties on the real estate of the wife. She \u2022died May 8th 1873. The real estate was sold under the mortgage, November 8th 1873, for $3188.54. On the 31st of March 1874, judgment was entered on the bond and warrant against Samuel S. Shallcross and Lamira A. Shallcross. Under a fieri facias issued February 20th 1875, on this judgment, the interest of Samuel S. Shallcross in certain real estate was levied on and condemned, and a vend. ex. issued, which was stayed. A rule was taken to strike off the judgment.\nThe court (Allison P. J.) discharged the rule, on the ground that the bond, though joint, was operative against the party competent to contract.\nShallcross took a writ of error, and assigned for error the decree discharging his rule.\nP. Wilson (with whom was H. Gf. Ward), for plaintiff in error.\u2014\nJudgment on a joint warrant of attorney can be entered only against all the makers: Dalrymple v. Fraser, 15 Law Jour., N. S. 193; Gee v. Lane, 15 East 592 ; Raw v. Alderson, 7 Taunt. 453; Hunt v. Chamberlain, 3 Halst. 336; Harris v. Wade, 1 Chit. 322; Wood v. Heath, Id. 708, note.\nW. 0. ITannis, for defendant in error. \u2014\nA bond and warrant of a married woman being absolutely void (Keiper v. Helfricker, 6 Wright 325; Steinman v. Ewing, 7 Id. 63; Glidden v. Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith 400), they are to be treated as if executed by the husband alone. A contract signed by an infant or feme covert and one sui juris, is binding on the one sui juris: Addison on Contracts 970; 2 Hilliard on Contracts 132; Swanzey v. Parker, 14 Wright 452; Motteux v. St. Aubin, 2 W. Black. 1133.\nMarch 6th 1876,"
