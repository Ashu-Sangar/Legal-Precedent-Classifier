        "text": "Mr. Justice Sharswood\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nThis was an action instituted in the court below by the defendants in error to recover from the plaintiff in error, who was formerl^recorder of deeds for the county of Philadelphia, damages for a false certificate of search issued by him, or by his authority. That such a certificate was issued false in fact ; that it was ordered and paid for by the defendants, and that in consequence they suffered damages, were points not in dispute. That the recorder is prim\u00e1, facie liable to respond in damages for such false search, has been settled in McCaraher v. Commonwealth, 5 W. & S. 21, and is no longer an open question.\nIt was decided by the present Chief Justice at Nisi Prius, in Commonwealth v. Kellogg, 6 Phila. R. 90, that this liability is to the party who asks and pays for the search, and does not extend to his assigns or alienee.\nThe contention here all grows out of the fact that the search in this case, by the request of the 'conveyancer of the defendants, was ordered and paid for by the owner of the premises, in order that he might obtain a loan of money on mortgage from the defendants, and the certificate wTas so used, and the money so obtained.\nIt is urged, that by the employment of the owner as the agent for this purpose, the defendants are affected with this knowledge of the existence of the mortgage, which was omitted in the certificate. This is a very familiar principle and well settled. But it is equally well settled that the principal is only to be affected by knowledge acquired in the course of the business in which the agent was employed. This limitation of the rule is perfectly well established by our own cases, and it is not necessary to look further: Hood v. Fahnestock, 8 Watts 489; Bracken v. Miller, 4 W. & S. 110 ; Martin v. Jackson, 3 Casey 508. It is a mistake to suppose that it depends upon the reason that no man can be supposed to always carry in his mind a recollection of former occurrences, and that if it be proved that he actually had it in his mind at-the time, the rule is different. It may support the reasonableness of the rule to consider that the memory of men is fallible in the very best, and varies in different men. But the true rea.son of the limitation is a technical one, that it is only during the agency that the agent represents, and stands in the shoes of his principal. Notice >to him is then notice to his principal. Notice to him twenty-four hours before the relation commenced is no more notice than twenty-four hours after it had ceased would be. Knowledge can be no better than direct actual notice. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to show that the knowledge of the agent, to use the accurate language of one of our cases, \u201c was gained in the transaction in which he was employed.\u201d There was not only no evidence of this offer by the plaintiff, but it was plain that it had been gained before, and in an entirely different transaction. It is not necessary to consider in this view of the matter whether the alleged agent was really such, or only the servant or clerk of the conveyancer.\nIt is urged that the conveyancer of the defendants, in the employment of the owner, who was the applicant for the loan, and interested, therefore, to obtain clear searches, was guilty of negligence, which is imputable to his constituents, and will, therefore, bar their recovery. But this is to maintain that a man is to presume fraud or forgery in one, whose character is good, and that if he does not he is prim\u00e1 facie negligent. When the scrivener received a clear certificate under the undoubted official seal of the recorder, he surely was not bound, to presume that a fraud had been committed on the recorder or his clerk, nor was there any evidence from which such fraud could be inferred. If there was no such presumption, neither would there arise any presumption beforehand, that the owner would succeed in corrupting or deceiving the clerk or servant of the plaintiff. Without some such presumption, how can it be said that it was prim\u00e1. facie evidence of negligence ? that the owner was employed in the mere ministerial service of ordinary paying for and procuring the certificate ?\nWe are of opinion that the learned judge was right in directing a verdict for the plaintiffs below.\nJudgment affirmed. \u2022",

The liability of the recorder is to the party who asks and pays for the certificate, not to his assigns or alienee.\n3. Leslie, desiring a loan from plaintiffs, to be secured by mortgage on his property, plaintiffs\u2019 conveyancer ordered searches for liens; through Leslie he procured a certificate from the recorder that there were no mortgages on the property, on this the loan vras made. There being prior mortgages given by Leslie not certified, on the sale of Leslie\u2019s property by the sheriff the proceeds did not reach to pay the loan: Held, that the recorder was liable to plaintiffs for the loss.\n4. The employing Leslie to procure the certificate did not affect the plaintiffs with his knowledge.\n5. A principal is affected only by such knowledge of his agent as the agent acquired in the business in which he is employed.\n6. It is only during the agency that the agent represents and stands in the shoes of the principal; notice to him then is notice to the principal.\n7. The employment of Leslie to procure the certificate, was not negligence on the part of the conveyancer imputable to the plaintiffs.\n8. Bracken v. Miller, 4 W. & S. 110; Commonwealth v.

Houseman.\nThe declaration set out, in one count, that the plaintiffs, being about to lend to one Charles M. S. Leslie the sum of $2000, on a first mortgage, requested the defendant, then being recorder of deeds of Philadelphia, \u201cto certify every unsatisfied mortgage of a messuage and lot, or piece of ground situate on the north side of St. Albans Place, 207 feet 6 inches west of Twenty-third street, in the Twenty-sixth Ward of the said city of Philadelphia, containing in front on the said St. Albans Place 16 feet, and extending in depth northward 62 feet to a twelve-feet-wide alley; given by the said Charles M. S. Leslie since October 1st 1868 ; that the defendant, on the 21st of August 1871, negligently and falsely certified that there was no prior unsatisfied mortgage of the premises given by Leslie since the time mentioned, except one to Elizabeth C. Erwin, from the lien of which the premises mentioned had been released; that, relying on the truth of said certificate, the plaintiffs lent to Leslie the sum of $2000 on the security of his mortgage of the premises to the plaintiffs. The declaration averred that there was, at the time of giving the certificate, remaining of record in the recorder\u2019s office, a mortgage of the premises from Leslie to Alexander Smith, dated August 11th 1870, for $8000, and thereby the mortgage from Leslie to plaintiffs was worthless, and the $2000 lent to Leslie was lost.\nAnother count was that, on the 20th of December 1871, the plaintiffs, being about to lend to Leslie a further sum of $1600 on a mortgage to be given by him on a messuage and lot or piece of ground situate on the south side of St. Albans Place, 335 feet 6 inches west of Twenty-third street, in the Twenty-sixth Ward of the said city of Philadelphia, containing in front on the said St. Albans Place 16 feet, and extending in depth southward 62 feet to a twelve-feet-wide alley, and requested the defendant as recorder to certify every unsatisfied mortgage on said premises given by Leslie since October 1st 1868; that the defendant certified that there was no unsatisfied mortgage but that before mentioned to Elizabeth C. Erwin; that the plaintiffs, relying on the certificate, lent to Leslie the $1600, and took a mortgage from him dated December 19th 1871, on the last-mentioned premises. The declaration averred that there was at the time remaining on record in the recorder\u2019s office an unsatisfied mortgage on these premises from Leslie to Smith, dated October 27th 1870, for $2500: that thereby the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage was worthless, and the $1600 were wholly lost.\nThe case was tried October 28th 1874, before Lynd, J.\nThe plaintiffs gave in evidence the following papers :\u2014\nNo. 1.\n\u201cNo. 2327 St. Albans Place.\n\u201cPlease certify every unsatisfied mortgage of messuage and lot or piece of ground situate on the north side of St. Albans Place, 207 feet 6 inches west of Twenty-third street, in the Twenty-sixth Ward of the city of Philadelphia, containing in front, on the said St. Albans Place, 16 feet, and extending in depth northward 62 feet, to a twelve-feet-wide alley, given by Charles M.

Leslie, from October 1st 1868, to December 20th 1871, except two, one of them to Alexander Smith, dated October 27th 1870, for two thousand five hundred dollars, and the other one of them to the Girard Mutual Building & Loan Association-, dated December 19th 1871, for sixteen hundred dollars.\n\u201c Witness my hand and seal of office this seventh day of August, A. D. 1873.\n[seal.] Jas. W. Allen, pro Recorder.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs called Albanus ITolby, who testified : \u201c I was conveyancer for the building association in 1871; I passed the title; I drew the mortgage and examined rhe title; I ordered searches; this is the mortgage search on which the $2000 were loaned ; the $2000 were paid to C. M. S. Leslie ; this is the mortgage search (December 20th 1871) I ordered ; the $1600 were paid Leslie.\u201d\nBeing cross-examined, witness said: \u201c Leslie applied in writing for the loans ; I searched for the writing ; I know the contents ; it was for a loan of $2000 on the St. Albans Place property ; it said subject to a ground-rent of $2500 only, and no mortgage ; I did not take this search to the office myself; the order is in Leslie's clerk\u2019s handwriting; I first saw this after it was signed by the recorder with the seal of his office attached; Leslie was in great haste; I said I could not get it through in a certain time; he offered to help ; I told him he might order the search for me ; he did so ; I first saw search No. 2 after the certificate- on it; it is not usual for me to let the borrower get out the search for me; Leslie could get the search out of the recorder\u2019s office more quickly than I; he had more facilities.\u201d\nBeing re-examined, he said : \u201c Leslie was a conveyancer ; age about 48 years ; was a conveyancer about twenty-five years ; in August 1871 he was considered A No. 1; the searches disclose the building association mortgage; we generally record first, and take out the searches so as to show the mortgage; I examined the searches before the money was paid; Leslie got out .all the searches; I ordered them through him ; I saw none of the certificates till I got them from him ; we foreclosed our mortgage when Leslie was three months in arrear; he paid his dues for a time ; I think in the summer of 1873 we became alarmed ; Leslie had not left then.\u201d\nIt was admitted that at the date of the certificates the two mortgages of $3000 and $2500 respectively, from Leslie to Smith, were on record in the recorder\u2019s office, as set out in the declaration.\nThe mortgages were afterwards sued out, and the premises which they bound sold by the sheriff. In consequence of the prior mortgages, which were not certified, the plaintiffs realized much less than the amount due them.\nThe defendant offered no evidence.\nThey asked the court to charge :\u2014\n\u201c1. If the jury believe that the plaintiffs, through their conveyancer, relied uppn C. M. S. Leslie to procure the certificates of search, and Leslie, so acting for himself, did procure the' certificates, there can be no recovery in this case.\n\u201c2. If C. M. S. Leslie was employed by the plaintiffs to procure certificates of search, and did so procure them for the plaintiffs, then the knowledge of Leslie of the existence of the uncertified mortgages was imputed to the plaintiffs and is their knowledge.\u201d\nJudge Lynd refused both points, and told the jury that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence disclosed negligence in law, and the measure of damages was the amount loaned with interest, less whatever had been paid on account.\nHe reserved these points, viz.:\u2014\n\u201c1. Is there any evidence of negligence?\n\u201c 2. Leslie having been the agent to procure the searches, does the knowledge by him of the fact of the prior mortgages estop the plaintiffs from alleging that the defendant was negligent, or that he made a false certificate ?\u201d\nVerdict was for the plaintiffs for $4339.90, subject to the opinion of the court on the reserved points.\nThe court in banc afterwards entered judgment for the plaintiffs on the verdict on the reserved points.\nThe defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error,\n1. Withdrawing from the jury all questions of fact, except the amount of damages alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiffs.\n2. Ruling that there was nothing in the cause but a question of lawq to be determined by the court.\n3. Withdrawing from the jury,-under the testimony presented, the question of whether Charles M. S. Leslie was the agent of plaintiffs in procuring the certificates of search from the recorder of\u2019 deeds, or whether said Leslie was not acting in the matter the himself and in his own behalf.\n4. Not instructing the jury that if C. M. S. Leslie was the agent of the plaintiffs in the matter of the searches, said Leslie\u2019s knowledge of the existence of the prior uncertified mortgages was the knowledge of the plaintiffs and imputable to them.\n5. Instructing the jury that the testimony disclosed such negligence in law as to entitle the plaintiffs to recover.\n6. 7. Refusing defendant\u2019s points.\n8. Entering judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the points reserved.\nCr. W. Biddle (with whom were I. N. Brown and A. S. Biddle), for plaintiff in error.\n\u2014 The duty of the recorder is only to the person who employs and compensates him: McCaraher v. The Commonwealth, 5 W. & S. 21; Kellogg v. Harmer, 6 Phila. R. 90. Even if Leslie were the agent of the plaintiff \u2014 if at the time that the searches were ordered Leslie was aware of the prior mortgages, and intentionally omitted to notify the plaintiff thereof, the latter is fixed with his guilty knowledge, and having through 'Leslie\u2019s knowledge constructive notice of the fraud, cannot recover: Toulman v.
