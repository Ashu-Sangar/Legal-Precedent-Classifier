        "text": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court,\nPee Curiam.\n\u2014 The declaration of the plaintiffs charged that the defendants wrongfully, wilfully and injuriously, stopped up and obstructed the ways, passages, wharves, and slips of the plaintiffs. This was the second count, and in it the means of obstruction was not stated. The plea was not guilty, and the issue of course was, whether the defendant did wilfully and wrongfully stop up and obstruct the passage way into the plaintiff\u2019s slips, the plaintiffs having averred the tenancy of the slip, and a right of ferriage across the river from and to their slip. It was only in the evidence that the means of obstruction appeared to be by the defendants permitting the steamboat \u201cJohn A. Warner\u201d to lie across the entrance of the plaintiffs\u2019 slip, whereby free egress and regress out' of and into the slip were prevented. It is evident, therefore, that the primary questions in this issue were the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the slip as a place of land mooring, and to its free use as a place of landing, and the wilful and unlawful obstruction of this right. The question did not concern the general right of navigation as common to the public, and to these two parties in particular, but concerned an alleged unlawful privation of the land use, where private rights of property existed. Hence it is plain that the judge at Nisi Prius was by this issue called upon to instruct the jury only upon the primary questions raised by the issue, unless the defendants asked instructions upon any qualification which they deemed to arise out of the evidence before the court. In this view of the case ,the judge gave pertinent and proper instructions. He said, the defendants had the same right to navigate the river in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 slip as they had to navigate any other, part of the river, and an undoubted right to tie up and moor their steamboat in front of their own piers. On the other hand, he said, the defendants had no right to moor their steamboat immediately in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 slip, so as to obstruct the plaintiffs\u2019 use thereof, and prevent them from running their ferry boat in and out thereof, and had no right to overlap the plaintiffs\u2019 slip, and thereby to prevent them from running their ferry boat in and out of the same, and if they did, such obstruction was unlawful. Now, clearly there was no error in this instruction. It stated the right of each party, and it was then a question of fact whether the defendants did thus wrongfully and wilfully obstruct the slip and the plaintiffs\u2019 use of it. Now if the defendants thought their obstruction was only partial, and so far only as their own right to the use of their own wharf would justify a mere temporary obstruction, and therefore would be a reasonable and not a wrongful and injurious interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 shore rights, it was .their duty, if the evidence admitted of this view, to ask the proper instruction upon their right thus far to interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 right of landing and mooring in their slip. The question was one of fact, dependent upon the evidence, and therefore to be decided by the jury. Now the defendants claimed no direction to the jury upon the question of their reasonable exercise of their own right, but demanded an instruction that the defendants\u2019 interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 right was justifiable, unless they maliciously exercised their right to the prejudice of the plaintiffs.. This was properly refused by the court, and left the defendants resting upon the question of a wilful and wrongful obstruction of the plaintiffs\u2019 slip, so that the second and third prayers 'for instruction became immaterial, for if they were guilty of the wrongful act charged, there was no right to demand a re-arrangement of the plaintiffs\u2019 time of running their boat, or of the length of intervals between coming into and going out of the slip. The fact whether the exercise by the defendants of their riparian right and their right of navigation was reasonable towards their neighbors, the plaintiffs, was so clearly dependent on the evidence, and therefore a matter for the jury, and this rea- \u25a0 sonable exercise not being' made a distinct question, it is evident that there is nothing in the case which can make our decision infringe upon the right of navigation in the Delaware, and therefore the apprehended consequence cannot flow from the decision.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Delaware River Steamboat Co. versus Burlington and Bristol Steam Ferry Co.\n1. The plaintiffs, a ferry company from Bristol to Burlington, across the Delaware river, had \u201cslips\u201d into which they ran their boats on the side-of wharves in those towns belonging to the defendants, a steamboat company, running on the river from Philadelphia to the same towns. The defendants\u2019 boats when moored at t-heir wharves prevented the plaintiff\u2019s boats from going in and out. Held that the defendants had the same right of navigation in front of the slips as in any part of the river, and to moor their boats in front of their wharf, but had no right wilfully to obstruct the plaintiffs in the use of their slips.\n2. The declaration was that the plaintiffs owned the slips, &c., and the defendants wilfully and wrongfully obstructed their ways, the ferry and the slips, &c.; the plea was \u201cNot guilty.\u201d This pleading raised the questions of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the slip, and its free use as a place of landing, and the wilful and unlawful obstruction by defendants.\n3. The questions did not concern the right of navigation to the public in general, and to the parties in particular-, but an unlawful privation of the land used, where private rights of property existed.\nFebruary 14th 1876.\nBefore A&new, C. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nCertificate from Nisi Prius : Of January Term 1874, No. 60.\nThis was an action on the case, brought September 30th 1873, by the Burlington and Bristol Steam Ferry Company against the Delaware River Steamboat Company.\nThe declaration contained two counts. The issue tried was on the second count. It set out that the plaintiffs were owners, under charters from the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, of a ferry from a wharf and slip in the city of Burlington, New Jersey, and adjoining a wharf belonging to that city, to a wharf or slip in the borough of Bristol, in Pennsylvania; and for the purposes of the ferry the. plaintiffs leased real estate at the slips in Burlington and Bristol, on which they erected wharves, piers, slips and the necessary appendages, and procured steamboats for the use of the ferry, and therefore had the right to free ingress and egress for their steamboats, agents, &c., into and from their wharves and slips, across the Delaware river from Bristol to Burlington and back; and averred that the defendants \u201cwilfully and unlawfully intending to injure\u201d the plaintiffs, &c., stopped up and obstructed tbe ferry, wharves, slips, &c., so that the plaintiffs could not enjoy them, &c.\nThe defendants pleaded \u201cNot guilty.\u201d\nThe case was tried March 20th 1874, before Mr. Justice Williams.\nThe evidence of the plaintiffs was, that they were the owners of the ferry steamboat \u201cEllwood Doran,\u201d running between Bristol and Burlington. The defendants owned the steamboat \u201cJohn Warner,\u201d which ran from Philadelphia to Bristol, and across to Burlington and back again to Philadelphia. The defendants lease the wharves at which they land in Bristol and Burlington from the same persons from whom the plaintiffs lease their slips, which are alongside of the wharves. The defendant\u2019s pier at Bristol is from 40 to 60 feet, and at Burlington from 60 to 90 feet. The \u201cWarner\u201d is 226 feet long. When the \u201cWarner\u201d is lying at either wharf she extends beyond the slip, so that whilst she is there the plaintiffs\u2019 steamboat cannot get into the slip, nor, if in, get out. This prevents the \u201c Doran\u201d from making her regular trips, and her passengers miss the railroad trains with which they design to connect. The plaintiffs\u2019 boat makes the round trip about every forty or sixty minutes. They could get out and in by being \u201ccareful and cautious;\u201d the detentions would be for several minutes. Passengers who had missed making connections said they would go by the \u201cWarner,\u201d because the \u201c Doran\u201d could not get out. The captain of the \u201cWarner\u201d had been spoken to on the subject and requested to remove from the way of the \u201cDoran.\u201d This detention occurred frequently. Plaintiffs suffered damage to the extent of $200 or $300 a year. ,\nThe defendants gave evidence that they had been running to and from those piers from the year 1852, except five years. About fifteen years ago they began to give plaintiffs the fares they received for carrying passengers across the river. They do not stay at the wharves longer than is necessary. They would have to give up the landing to avoid the detention of the plaintiffs\u2019 boat. If plaintiffs would run differently as to time, there would be no interference.\nThe defendants request the court to charge:\u2014\n1. That defendants are not liable for any injury arising to plaintiffs by reason of mooring to their own piers, unless there was a malicious exercise of the defendants\u2019 right.\n2. If the plaintiffs could arrange their time so that the coming and going of the \u201cWarner\u201d would not conflict with the exercise of their right to come and go to their slips, it is an injury caused by their own neglect of duty for which defendants are not liable.\n3. If the running of plaintiffs\u2019 boat was at such irregular intervals that defendants could make no provision to guard against their detention, then defendants are not liable.\nThe court declined to charge as requested, and instructed the jury that the defendants had the same right to navigate the river Delaware in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 slips that they had to navigate any other part of the river; but they had no right to moor their steamboat immediately in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 slips so as to obstruct the plaintiffs\u2019 use thereof, and prevent them from running their ferry boat into and out of the slips for the purpose of receiving and landing passengers'; that the defendants had the undoubted right to tie up and moor their steamboat in front of their own piers, but they had no right to overlap the plaintiffs\u2019 slips with their steamboat and thereby prevent them from running their ferry, boat into and out of the same; and if they did, such obstruction was unlawful, and plaintiffs might recover therefor.\nThe verdict was for the plaintiffs for $371.\nThe defendants took a writ of error.\nThey assigned for error the refusal of their points and the charge of the court.\nD. W. Sellers (with whom was H. 0. Thompson), for plaintiffs in error.\n\u2014 The right of navigation includes the right to moor. Delay to another exercising a like right if unavoidable is damnum absque injuria: Commonwealth v. Passmore, 1 S. & R. 217 ; Baker v. Lewis, 9 Casey 301. There was no liability on the defendants unless there had been malice.\n6r. R. Snowden and J. R. Snoivden (with whom was A. H. Jones), for defendants in error.\n\u2014 The owner of a wharf or slip must use it in such a manner as not to interfere with the use of the lands or wharves of contiguous proprietors: Bainbridge v. Sherlock, 7 Amer. Law Reg., N. S. 720 ; Irwin v. Dixon, 9 How. 33; Price v. Ruddiman, 10 Mich. 125.\nMarch 4th 1876,"
