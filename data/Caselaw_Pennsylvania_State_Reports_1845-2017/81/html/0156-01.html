The manner of doing business is, — the returns are first made to the office by the miner, the gross shipments of coal taken at the end of the month, into this the number of mine cars mined within that month is divided, which is divided into the total shipments; the average weight per car is thereby ascertained and the total weight of the coal arrived at; the miners are paid so much per ton by weight, before it has gone through the breaker. The defendants were taking coal from the Burroughs property all the time they were taking coal from the Price property; there was a mine boss employed by defendants to take an account of the coal as it was mined. To distinguish between the coal mined from the Burroughs and Price properties, the chambers or breasts were numbered, and as each car came, the number of the breast it came from was attached to it and credit given to that car, which went to the account of the man working it; in that way it was ascertained exactly what portion of the mine it came from, and as it came to the breaker account was taken of the coal coming from particular chambers; witness had no books showing the returns of the cars; they might have been at the office in Wilkesbarre, or probably not in existence, as they were something that it was not thought worth while to preserve ; they were generally kept for some time; no separate account was kept in the defendant’s regular hooks of the coal taken from the mines respectively; that was kept in the monthly books, the auxiliary books at the time.</p>

Ascertain from the evidence, as nearly as you can, the number of tons taken from Mr. Price’s mine by these defendants, from the time they crossed the line of his property, until they ceased mining, that will give you the aggregate; then take from that aggregate the amount of coal that these defendants returned to Mr. J.

But a receipt is only one link in the chain of testimony, and although it may allege upon its face that it is in full, yet it may be proven to be otherwise — just exactly as a witness may be disproved, who alleges that he has paid his money in full. Whether it is in full or not in full, is to be ascertained by a comprehensive view of all the testimony in the case that has been received, and if you shall ascertain, after giving the testimony this examination, that it is not in full, then the presumption is overcome, and the receipt is entitled to no such benefit of the presumption that I have referred to.</p>

I have not seen the statements; I have heard them read; * w * but I have received the impression that certain detailed statements were given, constituting what is termed these returns. If the receipt was given for these returns, then you may consider whether, if they are in full, and I do not remember now whether they are — whether they do not have reference to the returns, and not to the entire demands of the plaintiff. * * * That is, if when the detailed statement came, the receipt was given for the statement, then it might be in full or not in full of the claim. If the statement was ascertained to be erroneous, then the receipt being in conformity to the statement, it' does not operate against the party giving the receipt at all. Now let us pass on to the evidence that we have got in this case, with reference to the amount of coal mined from this mine. We have got to contend with a difficulty right at the very outset, that neither of these parties could control. It seems they worked, or somebody worked so nearly to the bottom of the canal, or carried the roof of the mine so nearly to the bottom of the canal, that the pressure, or leakage, or moisture, finally percolated through, broke a hole and flooded the mine, whereby it now is a physical impossibility for engineering experts to enter the mine, and to make a calculation with reference to the number of tons taken from the excavations. Not being able to get this, then that which is the next best manner of ascertaining the quantity should be resorted to. Now I would think the next best, and probably the best of all, would be if we could get an account of <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>the quantity of coal for which this company paid miners mining the coal. Í say that for this reason, though these miners may not be able to make a mathematical calculation, that inspiring incentive of self-interest impels every one to make a calculation that will not permit his employer to take advantage of him, and what quantity they have been paid .for would be evidence of a very high character. It seems so to me, at least, and I submit it with these-observations for your consideration, and in doing so, I do not invade your province, which is the absolute disposal of all questions of fact, but it is within my province, and, indeed, it is my duty to call your attention to these, considerations, although they may be somewhat critical. Then that character of testimony not being before us, we come down to the surveys.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[131,957,1178,1204]]]'>“ It is alleged that this survey was not made for this purpose. Admitting that to be so, and it is a circumstance in the case to be considered, yet if you are of the opinion that it is accurate, then it is just as good as any testimony that could be received. They could produce nothing more, viz., accuracy; that is perfection. It don’t matter by which manner of means or mode accuracy is obtained, if obtained by any. It is useless to say other means would have produced the same result, because you have got all that any of the means would produce, viz., accuracy itself. Therefore I say that if the map satisfies you of the quantity of coal, or enables you to reach, or furnishes you data by means of which you may reach, the quantity of codl, then that is evidence for your consideration, and whether it does furnish such data you must determine, in view of all the circumstances in the case, as developed by all the testimony in the case ; but it is the only evidence, save the letters, that has been put in here.

All these experts testified, to my mind, with a great deal of clearness. They are witnesses of the highest character of intelligence in their way, and all of them I think must have impressed you so. There is this difference, I ought to say to you, between a witness who does a thing and works it out and produces a plan, and a witness who takes a plan after it is produced, and draws his deduction from it. I would suppose that the 'man who went over the ground, who entered the mine and took the chain, or the tape in some places, and stepped it in others, that man, it would seem to me, has a facility and an opportunity of acquiring a more accurate knowledge of the locality than the man who takes the product of his labor, and expresses an opinion upon it. However, whether this is so or not is for you. You have heard Mr. Hick’s testimony upon it, and he went very elaborately'in detail into the question, and gave you his reason for regarding the map as not being reliable on account of the want of means of accuracy. The defendants say it is not accurate. Well, I have no doubt that it fails of that entire accuracy that might be reached under any and all circumstances. But is it substantially accurate ? That is the question. Does it to a substantial extent furnish you the data by which you can reach a calculation ? If it does then you may consider it.

And whereas the best interests of the state require that this great and important improvement should be the prpperty of the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth ought to embark in it with that zeal and energy that is best calculated to carry it into effect,” therefore the governor was thereby required to appoint five canal commissioners, with a view of their ascertaining the most feasible routes' for the construction of a canal. Section third declared “ that the routes to be examined by virtue of this act shall be pne from Philadelphia, through Chester and Lancaster counties, and thence by the west bank of the Susquehanna, and the waters thereof, to the Allegheny and Pittsburg; also, from the Allegheny to Lake Erie; one other from the city of Philadelphia to the northern boundary of the state towards the Seneca or Cayuga Lake; one other through Cumberland and Franklin counties to the Potomac river; and one by the Conococheague or Monocacy and Conewago to the Susquehanna;” and also “through the county of Bedford to connect the route of the proposed Chesapeake and Ohio Canal with the Juniata route as aforesaid.”</p>

It had its inception in 1824, assumed a more specific and comprehensive form in 1825, and in 1826 the actual construction of the canals was authorized to be commenced. At first one link on the Susquehanna, another on the Allegheny, with no connection between them. From time to time as loans were effected, new links were formed and branches extended, until the system was completed in furtherance of the original design. The portion constructed along the north branch of the Susquehanna river was in its inception and construction an integral part of the main canal. The state acquired the same right and title to the land occupied by that portion of the canal as to the land occupied by any, other portion.</p>
    <p id="b174-7" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[299,1051,1166,689]]]'>The mode of assessing damages by the Act of 25th February 1826, was changed by the Acts of 9th April 1827, and of 6th April 1830, Pamph. L. 218, but neither of them professed to change the title which the Commonwealth acquired to the land. All the acts Avere part of the same system. They dealt with the same general subject-matter. They are in <em>pari materid. </em>They should therefore be construed in connection with each other: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Fisher <em>et al., </em>1 Penna.

This last case arose on the application of claimants for damages. The distinction between <em>perpetual </em>and <em>temporary </em>use, contemplated by the Act of 1826, received a careful consideration. It was there substantially held that temporary, was designed to apply to the use or possession of that larger portion of land which might be occupied during the construction of the canal, while perpetual, was restricted to that portion which Avas permanently occupied by it after its completion.</p>

The land had been taken under the Acts of 1826 and 1827, for the Pennsylvania canal. The damages sustained by the then owners of the land were duly assessed in 1828 and paid. The canal was constructed on the land and used till 1857. Then, under an act of the legislature, the canal commissioners were authorized to change, and did change, the location of the canal at that point. The old bed of the canal was filled up. The defendant in error, under the Act of 16th May 1857, purchased all that portion of the canal thus filled, and its appurtenances. On the old bed of the canal thus raised up, the railroad company erected shops and buildings. The land had wholly ceased to be used for the purpose for which it had been taken. Haldeman had acquired the title of the person who owned the land when possession was taken for the canal, and whose damages were assessed. He brought ejectment to recover possession. Thus the question directly aroso, <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>■what title did the state acquire when she took the land for the purpose of constructing a canal thereon ? This court fully adopted the correctness of the decision in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McAllister, <em><a href="/watts/2/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Watts 190" data-case-ids="1840173" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0190-01">supra,</a> </em>in holding that the title was thereby vested in the Commonwealth in perpetuity ; that being so vested, a subsequent change of its use, and the occupancy of it for other purposes, did not impair the title of the Commonwealth, or of her vendee ; that it was unlike a public road where the fee remained in the owner, but under the acts relating to the canal the state acquired title. Whether it was acquired by purchase and a deed from the vendor, or whether the state took it by virtue of her right of eminent domain, it mattered not. It therefore followed that a cessation of the use for which it was taken could not revest anything in the former owner.</p>
    <p id="b175-6" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[97,993,1174,607]]]'>The title which the Commonwealth acquired was again considered in Craig <em>v. </em>Mayor of Allegheny <em>et al., </em>3 P. F. Smith 477. There the owner of the land had released his damages in consideration of the benefits which would result to the community in general, and him in particular, from the construction of the canal. As in Haldeman <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., the canal had been constructed and used as such on this land for many years, had been sold by the Commonwealth in 1857, and had ceased to be used as a canal. The conclusion that the Commonwealth had acquired an estate in perpetuity in the land was again affirmed. It was said that the expenditure made by the state in the construction of the canal was equivalent to a pecuniary compensation to the grantor. Being an absolute and perpetual estate in the land occupied by the canal, the estate was neither revocable nor reversionary.</p>
    <p id="b175-7" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[94,1599,1177,390]]]'>The same question was again discussed in Robinson <em>v. </em>The West Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 22 P. F. Smith 316. This was also a case of release of damages. After many years’ use, the ground had been abandoned as a canal and- basin. The conclusion that the .Commonwealth took an absolute estate in perpetuity was reaffirmed. It was further said, the absolute estate of the Commonwealth would not be defeated or impaired by the owner’s neglect or refusal to make application for his damages within the time limited by the act.</p>

The law between landlord and tenant may be conceded as claimed, yet the conclusion by no means follows. There was no .contract creating a tenancy of lands by any certain or defined limits or bounds, nor was there any putting into possession by any designated or described lines or muniments. Possession of a part of the mines at first inadvertently taken on the lands of the defendant in error was merely continued under an agreement for the payment of royalty, for the coal that might he mined within a specified time. The defendant owned two separate and distinct pieces of land. Lying between them was the strip which he did not own, and of which he had no possession. There is no evidence indicating an intention to put the company into possession of land that he did not own. There is, therefore, no warrant for the assumption that the relation of landlord and tenant existed as to the land under the canal. Hence it follows that the question covered by the second assignment is irrelevant, and the other five assignments are sustained.</p>

    <p id="b176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[283,1598,1171,766]]]'>The 9th and 11th assignments may be considered together. The mining operations in question closed on the 1st of January 1871. An account of the quantity of coal mined in June was first rendered. After that quarterly returns were made; the last on the 19th of January 1872. During the whole time the mining operations were in progress no complaint was made as to the time, manner or truthfulness of these reports. Crans, who was both secretary and treasurer of the company, swears that no objection was made until after the mine was flooded in July following. While the work was in progress, the defendant in error was in nowise restrained in free access to the mines and the mining accounts for any investigations he may have desired to make. If he failed to exercise those rights, the conclusion is a reasonable one that he was then satisfied with the accounts rendered. Having then acquiesced in them for so long a time, the presumption is in favor of their accuracy. That presumption may be overthrown by testimony showing them to have been either inaccurately kept or untruthfully returned.</p>
    <p id="b176-7" data-blocks='[["BL_176.6",176,[331,2375,1122,44]],["BL_177.1",177,[127,388,1173,648]]]'>The testimony shows that.in conducting the mining operations <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>each chamber or breast was numbered. Each car had a number attached to-it, showing the breast from which it came. The credit was given to the car, and to the account of the man working the breast. As the coal came to the breaker, these accounts were taken. These returns were entered on the books, but the evidence further shows that these books were not thought worth preserving for any length of time, and were probably not in existence. If in existence, they were at Wilkesbarre, and no notice had been given to produce them. In view of all the facts, we think the learned judge unduly prejudiced the case in saying that it was not for the defendant in error “ to drag out as best he can, a detailed statement from them,’! and in further saying, “ there has not been the scrape of a pen, a book of any kind, produced here for the inspection of Mr. Price.” It does not appear that anything asked for, which was in the power of the plaintiff' in error to produce, had been withheld.</p>
