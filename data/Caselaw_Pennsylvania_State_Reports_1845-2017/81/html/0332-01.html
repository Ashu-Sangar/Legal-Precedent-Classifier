By the first clause above mentioned, clearly a fee simple is given. The devise is to him and to his heirs. No stronger expression could be used to carry a fee. But this clause must be taken in connection with every part of the will. The two other clauses have direct reference <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>to the same subject-matter. . Although a fee may be given in a former part of a will, it may be restrained by a subsequent clause so as to convert it into an inferior interest. Indeed a particular estate is more frequently given in this mode than in any other. Where a testator has given a fee, he cannot strip it of its nature and properties, that is, make a fee something else than that which the law recognises as such, but he may restrict the generality of his gift and devise to a less estate.</p>

It provides that all devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or perpetuity, unless it appears by words of limitation or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate. What, then, was the intention of Jacob Staudt in introducing the above second clause in his will ? The first gave a fee, which is the highest interest that any one can have in lands. The second could give no more. Why, then, insert it, if it was not his intention to limit the estate ? He could have had no other object. He says : ‘ I herewith make known, and declare it as my will that none of my aforesaid children shall have the right to sell or assign their land or property to them bequeathed as aforesaid. Neither shall they have a right to encumber it with debts or liens, but the land shall remain free for their children ; and they, my said children, shall have the use, income and profit of the said land and farms during their lifetime.’ This will was written by a person who knew something of legal terms without understanding their legal import. It is obscure in many of its provisions, and phrases are jumbled together in an incongruous manner. But if we transpose this clause somewhat, we may more clearly get at the intention of the testator. Thus : I herewith make known and declare it as my will that my children shall have the use, income and profits of the said lands and farms, during their lifetime; none of them shall sell or assign, neither shall they have a right to encumber with debts or liens, but the lands shall remain free for their children or heirs. From this it is obvious that a limited estate was only intended to be given. This is made more manifest by the last clause in the will, which contains not only a power of appointment that was never exercised, but a reiteration in the most emphatic manner of such limited estate in the testator’s children. ‘ Whereas, I have ordained in this, my will, that none of my children shall have a right to sell, nor encumber, nor involve any of the real estate to them bequeathed, but I do hereby give either of my said children power, authority and right to make a will and testament to take effect after their decease, so that either of them, to wit: John, Catharine, Sarah, Polly and Harriet, may and <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>shall have the privilege to dispose of their several legacies by will, <em>but not otherwise.’</em>

To each of his daughters by name he gave, a farm by separate clauses in his will, and used the same language, in the devise to them that was used in regard to the son. lie had a father’s solicitude for his daughters, and gave them an estate which he intended as a provision for their lives, and in case of their death his patrimony should descend to their children and not be enjoyed by their husbands, strangers to his blood. On behalf of the plaintiff it is claimed, that under the rule in Shelley’s case, John Staudt took a fee simple, and it matters nothing that the creation of a fee through the operations of this rule would defeat the intention of the testator. This position would probably be correct, if the cases of Williams <em>v. </em>Leech, 4 Casey 89 ; Naglee’s Appeal, 9 Id. 89; and McKee <em>v. </em>McKinley, Id. 92, had not been expressly overruled by Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/wright/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Wright 9" data-case-ids="626208" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0009-01">1 Wright 9</a>.</p>

But the intention of a testator when discovered by an examination of all parts of his will must govern. Therefore, when we come to the item defining the power of his children over the estates given to them, we discover plainly that he intended to confer a life estate only and not merely to restrict their power <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>over a precedently-conferred fee simple.
