An incorporated, cemetery company was authorized to make by-laws, &amp;c., to sell lots in, fee simple or otherwise for sepulture alone, under such rules as the managers might ordain for the burial of the dead, &amp;c. The bylaws provided that there should be no burial without a written permit from the secretary, and that all transfers of lots must be registered in the office of the association. Boileau bought a lot, and his deed was registered ; he conveyed it to Jones, a colored woman ; this deed was not registered. She applied for a permit to bury her husband; the secretary declined, because the lot was registered as Boileau’s. Boileau asked for a permit to her to bury her husband in the lot; the managers then directed the secretary to refuse an approval of the transfer to Jones. The secretary refused to issue <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>a permit for the burial: <em>Held, </em>that Boileau had the right to bury the husband ; that the refusal to issue the permit was arbitrary and unreasonable, and mandamus lay to compel the company to issue the permit.</p>

At or about said date the lot in question was inspected by the petitioners in the presence of the superintendent and secretary, who drew out the plan of the lot, marked the grave, and interposed no objection whatever to the contemplated transfer of the lot to Margaret Jones.</p>

Boileau omitted to obtain such approval and registration of the said deed before delivery thereof to Margaret Jones, simply because to his knowledge the rule enjoining such approval and registration was in most cases virtually a dead letter and never strictly enforced. This knowledge was based on the fact that your petitioner had disposed to purchasers of more than $50,000 in value of the burial lots of the said corporation, and not one-half of the deeds to the lots so sold were ever approved and registered, although in many instances interments of bodies took place in the lots referred to in such conveyances with the knowledge and full consent of the corporation aforesaid.</p>

Connell, who was the secretary and superintendent, intrusted with its general management. The previous interment of a colored woman in the lot, and that Margaret Jones was a colored woman, and the prospective uses of the»said lot for the interment of the colored members of the family of Margaret Jones, were known to him, and not only was no objection interposed to the conveyance, either by Connell or by the corporation, but at or about the time of the said sale and conveyance to Margaret Jones, Connell expressed to Boileau a regret that the company itself had not made the said transfer to Margaret Jones direct, and a desire that the improving the lot for the use of Margaret Jones should be intrusted to him and another official.</p>

This cause is not like the mere disturbance or obstruction of an easement for which damages may be recovered, as in the case of a pew-owner, who has generally a limited usufructuary right only, and who may recover damages for its destruction or loss ; nor is it analogous to the class of cases in which equity would decree the specific performance of a contract, because a remedy must be speedily applied. The very function of the writ of mandamus is to set in motion and compel action, and any existing legal remedy l’elied upon as a bar to interference by mandamus, must not only be un adequate remedy in the general sense of the term, but it must be specific, and appropriate to the particular circumstances of the case: High, Ex.
