L. 334), conditioned that John P. Horter, the party arrested, should apply to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, for the insolvent laws, and alleging a breach of the condition. To this the defendant, Hubert, the only one served with process, pleaded <em>non est factum, nil debet, </em>and a special plea — that the bond was obtained from him in a proceeding of and concerning a cause of action exclusively cognizable by the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in Bankruptcy, the said Horter having been theretofore adjudicated a bankrupt in the said court. The plaintiff replied, taking issue upon the first two pleas, and by a special replication denied that the cause of action was exclusively cognizable by the District Court of the United States, and averred that the District Court for the city and county of Philadelphia had jurisdiction to require of the said Horter the execution of the said obligation, and of this the plaintiffs put themselves on the country. It is very clear that the issue raised by the replication was an issue'of law and not of fact. It admitted the facts averred in the plea, but denied the inference of law. It admitted that Horter had been theretofore adjudicated a bankrupt. It can be regarded only as an informal demurrer. It must be considered, then, that the verdict rendered was upon the two other issues of fact. When, however, judgment was entered by the court below, it was necessarily upon the whole record.

Under the bankrupt laws, parties can still be sued and proceeded against for any “ debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation as a public officer, or while acting in any fiduciary character:” Revised Statutes U.
