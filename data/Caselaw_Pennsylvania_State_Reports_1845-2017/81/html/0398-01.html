    <p id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[276,583,1172,605]]]'>The only question which properly arises is as to the regularity of the judgment by default for want of appearance.

L. 574, entitled “ An Act relative to courts in this Commonwealth.” It provides “ that when any person or persons, being residents of this CommonAvealth, shall engage in business in any other county at the time of the issuing of such writ or process, it shall be lawful for the officer charged with the service thereof to serve any Avrit of summons or any other mesne process upon the agent or clerk of any such defendant at the usual place of business or residence of such agent or clerk, and to have the same effect as if served upon the principal personally.”</p>

A personal service is not sufficient. Why, it is not our place to inquire. <em>Ita lex scripta est. </em>It is clear that the return must shoAV on its face a legal service : Winrow <em>v. </em>Raymond, 4 Barr 501; Wilson <em>v. </em>Hayes, 6 Harris 354 ; Weaver <em>v. </em>Springer, 2 Miles 42.</p>
