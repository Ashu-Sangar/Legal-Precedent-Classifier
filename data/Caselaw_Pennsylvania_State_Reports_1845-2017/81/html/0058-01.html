Corporate agents, and especially the agents of municipal corporations, are to be confined, doubtless, within the literal boundaries of the authority delegated to them. In general, this rule is to be rigidly enforced. It is one of the necessary defences against dishonesty and profligate administration of municipal affairs ; and I may add, it is a rule which this court has always been strenuous to maintain, and which it would not willingly relax. It has no application, however, to the circumstances of this case, for here has been no unwarrantable departure from the letter of the authority. The city councils authorized their agents to have a work performed, which, up to a certain point, was altogether lawful, and beyond which the performance was prohibited by law. Was not this a good authority to the agent to have the work performed as far as it was lawful? Especially as the ordinance remained unrepealed, and stands to this day the evidence of sufficient authority for everything which could be lawfully done under it. It is to be observed, also, that the highway department, in the form of the contract, followed in good faith the very letter of the ordinance, and thereby fell into the same error which the councils themselves had committed; for the agreement which they prepared for the contractors and which they required them to sign bound them to <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>pave the whole distance from Woodland street to Forty-third street. We can come to no other conclusion upon the evidence than that the parties to the contract acted in good faith. It seems to be highly probable that they were ignorant of the existence of the Act of July 18th 1863, which was a private act, and might therefore well be unknown to the parties, and which prohibited the opening of streets through the Hamilton Park grounds. And we are of opinion that the plaintiffs ought not to be prejudiced by this, but that inasmuch as they have performed the contract as far as it could" be lawfully performed, the first point must be resolved in their favor.</p>

The first was, that the terms of the ordinance which require the pavers to be selected by a majority of the owners of property fronting on Beckett street, from Woodland street to Forty-third street, were not complied with. It cannot be denied that the paper, dated March 27th 1870, agreeing that the paving should be done by the plaintiffs, was signed by a majority of tbe property holders on Beckett street, between Woodland street and Forty-third street. It is true that, in the paper referred to, they describe themselves as the owners of property on Beckett street, between Woodland street and a point four hundred and five feet west to Forty-second street, but it was in evidence that the ground throughout the whole remaining distance, that is, from the point indicated to Forty-third street, all belonging to one person, viz., the corporation known as the Hamilton Park Association, and counting in the association as an owner, it is quite clear that the signers of the paper were a majority of owners between Forty-second and Forty-third streets. This was one of the facts in issue, and was found by the jury in favor of the plaintiffs, and found upon sufficient evidence. ,</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[136,1715,1170,557]]]'>“ It was also objected, that the paper signed by the majority of the owners was dated before the passage of the ordinance. We do not think this a tenable objection. It would be putting a very rigid construction upon the requirements of the ordinance to hold that a selection made immediately before the passage of the ordinance, and in anticipation, of it, is void under its provisions, and is to prevent a recovery by the party who has done the work upon the faith of it, especially in view of the fact that the majority allowed their selection to remain in full force, making no other selection, and permitting the work to proceed in accordance with the selection so made, when they might have revoked it at any time before the awarding of the contract: Dickerson <em>v. </em>Peters, 21 P.

But the ordinance of June 12th 1868, was repealed, so far as it related to Beckett street, by another ordinance, passed June 21st 1869, which was before the execution of the contract between the plaintiffs and the city, the contract being dated June 24th 1869. Now, the ordinance authorizing the paving did not require any particular kind of pavement to be laid. Under it the commissioner was authorized to contract for any kind of pavement which might be in accordance with the city ordinances upon the subject, and at the time he made the contract for the city with the plaintiffs the cobble-stone pavement was in accordance with the existing ordinances upon the subject. This is a sufficient answer to the objection that the kind of pavement required by law was changed subsequent to the passage of the ordinance authorizing the paving to be done. So far as the objection rests upon the fact that the kind of paving authorized by the city ordinance was changed by another ordinance passed subsequent to the selection of the pavers, by the majority of the property owners, it is disposed of by the considerations already referred to. The selection made by the owners was allowed to remain in full force and unrevoked, notwithstanding the commissioner had been released by the ordinance of June 21st 1869, from the restrictions contained in the ordinance of June 12th 1868. It is argued that the property owners might have selected other pavers, if they had foreseen that cobble pavement was to be used instead of rubble pavement. If so, then why did they not revoke their selection and make a new one before the city commissioner made the .contract? They had plenty of time in which to do so, but they allowed their selection to stand, and there is no evidence whatever that they have ever objected to it, or have ever desired to be released from it, or have ever desired to depart from it or annul it, or that they now object to it. The objection now made is not made by the majority of the property owners, but by the defendant alone, and there is xro reason to believe that they approve or adopt his objection. • The instrument which is the evidence of the selection made by the majority of the property owners, if it indicates anything in respect to kind of pavement to be used, plainly indicates that the cobble pavement was to be used, for the <em>price </em>fixed is the price for laying t'he cobble pavement, which, as is wrell known, is cheaper than the rubble pavement, and that is the price at which the city contracted with the plaintiffs, and for which the plaintiffs have obtained a verdict. It would seem that the property <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>owners had anticipated the repeal of the ordinance of June 12th 1868, confining the commissioner. to rubble pavements, otherwise they would not have fixed upon the price of cobble pavement. The ordinance was repealed on the 21st,of June 1869, and the commissioner made the city contract with the plaintiffs on the 24th of June 1869.</p>

In actions on entire contracts, entire performance must be alleged and followed by proof, showing complete performance or dispensation therewith, by the party entitled to the performance: Preston <em>v. </em>Finney, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 53" data-case-ids="1853553" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0053-01">2 W. &amp; S. 53</a>; Miller <em>v. </em>Phillips, 7 Casey 218; Wright <em>v. </em>Cumpsty, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20111" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="5 Wright 111">5 Wright 111</a>; Shaw <em>v. </em>Turnpike Co., 2 Penna.

The ordinance authorizing the paving is to be construed liberally; the agreement was evidently signed in anticipation of its passage, and it was effectually continued and ratified by the majority of the property owners, who allowed it to remain in full force, although they could have recalled it and revoked the selection at any time prior to the making of the written contract with the city: Dickerson <em>v. </em>Peters, 21 P. F. Smith 55. The provisions of the ordinance of Dec. 81st 1862 are merely directory. The contract with the city was complete in itself, and the contractors could reasonably presume that the public officers had done their duty in the premises. The <em>onus </em>of showing the contrary rested upon the defendant. Under the terms of the ordinance authorizing this paving, and of the Acts of Assembly, the city ratifies everything in relation to the contract, except the selection of the paver by the property owners, and the character of the work when done : Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Burgin, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20539" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="14 Wright 539">14 Wright 539</a>; Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Reilly, 10 P. F. Smith 467; Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Wistar, 11 Casey 431. One of the parties to a contract may waive any of its provisions, and if he does so, and the other party assents, a new contract will arise equally binding with the first. The estoppel relied on by the defendant does not' arise, because the agreement was not made with him, but with the City of Philadelphia, and might therefore be controlled by councils: Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Arrott, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%2041" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="8 Phila. 41">8 Phila.

It was stipulated that the work was to he done “ under the direction and to the satisfaction of the chief commissioner of highways,” and was to be paid for at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents per square yard. . When the agreement was executed this work had not been authorized by the city councils. On the 13th of April 1869, an ordinance was passed directing the department of highways “ to enter into a contract with a competent paver or pavers, selected by a majority of the owners of property fronting on Becket street from Woodland street to Forty-third street, for the paving thereof,” and providing, as one of the conditions of the contract, that the cost of the work should be collected from the respective property owners by the contractor or contractors. An ordinance of the 12th of June 1868, requiring the streets of West Philadelphia to be laid with rubble pavement only, was in force at the date of the agreement of the property owners with Cunningham and McNichol. And the same ordinance fixed the sum of one dollar and fifty cents per square yard as the charge for rubble pavement; and the sum of one dollar and twenty-five cents per square yard as the charge for cobble pavement. On the 21st of June-1869, so much of the ordinance of the 12th of June 1868, as related to Becket street from Woodland to Forty-third street, in the Twenty-seventh ward, was repealed. And on the 24th of June 1869, a contract was executed by Cunningham and McNichol “to pave Becket street from Forty-third street to Woodland street,” in accordance with “all the provisions of section third of the ordinance approved March 27th 1868.” Under this contract the work contemplated by the agreement of the -27th of March 1869, was done. That is, Becket street was paved from Woodland street to a point four hundred and five feet west of Forty-second street. It was shown on the trial that performance of the stipulation to pave the part of the street between the point last named and Forty-third street was impossible, because, .under the provisions of the two Acts of Assembly, passed respectively on the 18th of July 1863 and the 17th of March 1864, the lands of the Hamilton Park Association extended to that point, and the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>opening of streets on those lands while they should be used for park purposes was forbidden. The fact that the work was satisfactorily done by the contractors was established by the verdict of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.4",73,[127,566,1172,1848]],["BL_74.1",74,[250,403,1161,775]]]'>Various questions growing out of alleged irregularities in the proceedings, which resulted in the execution of the contract, were raised on the trial in the District Court. Many of thesé related to formal omissions of acts prescribed by statute or ordinance, on the part of the city officers. It was complained, for instance, that the certificate of the commissioner was not affixed to the bill which was rendered when the work was completed, according to the provisions of the ordinance of the 30th of August 1868. But the commissioner testified that he had supervised the paving during its progress, and had inspected and approved of it when finished. The omission of the approval of the sureties in the contract by the city solicitor, as required by the twentieth section of the Act of the 21st of April 1855, was also made ground for complaint. But such approval is Hot directed to be endorsed, and the fact that the bill was certified by the surveyor and solicitor, would imply in this action, in which the city has joined as the legal plaintiff, a ratification by the proper authorities of the action of the highway department. The existence of the Hamilton Park Acts of 1863 and 1864 was overlooked when the ordinance of the 13th of April 1869, was passed, and when the contract for the paving was subsequently executed. The work of the contractors was stopped at the line of the property of the Park Association by the express provisions of a statute. They did all that they could lawfully do under the contract with the city, and they executed literally the agreement they had made with the property owners on Becket street. Buies in cases of this kind could easily be made so rigid as to work injustice. In questions involving the liability of defendants for their proportions of the cost of municipal improvements, the relations between the city and the parties with whom they contract are ordinarily outside the line of legitimate inquiry. When such improvements are within what were the incorporated districts of the county of Philadelphia when the Act of the 19th of April 1843 was passed, a defendant can “only deny that the work was done, or the materials furnished, or prove that the price charged was greater than their value, or that the amount claimed has been paid or released.” Notwithstanding the doubt intimated by Mr. Justice Williams in Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Edwards, 28 P. F. Smith 62, that act has constantly been recognised by this court, to be in force. It was recognised in the Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Burgin, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20539" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="14 Wright 539">14 Wright 539</a>, and has been expressly followed down to the decision in Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Brooke, in February last, <em>antea, </em>p. 23. Indeed the terms of the forty-fourth section of the Consolidation Act of February 2d 1854, scarcely leaves the question open to debate. Those terms <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>are: “All acts of the legislature not inconsistent with this act, now in force, shall continue in operation within the limits of the county, city, district, borough or township in which they are now operative, under the authority of the city councils, courts and officers created by this act, or permitted to continue as consistent therewith, until such acts shall be altered or repealed by the legislature: Provided, That the city councils shall have power, by ordinance, to extend the operation of laws now in force within the city, police or municipal districts, to other parts, or over the whole of the enlarged limits, and to declare what laws have become obsolete by this act, or by the extension as aforesaid of other laws.” It has been uniformly held, that it is not competent for a defendant to raise questions relating to the formal details of agreements between the city and its contractors, and to their execution and performance, where the acts of the municipal officers have been ratified, and the work done by the contractors has been accepted : Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Wistar, 11 Casey 427; Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Burgin, <em><a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20539" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="14 Wright 539">supra;</a> </em>and Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Pittsburg, 22 P. F. Smith 320.</p>
    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[241,1177,1168,1249]],["BL_75.1",75,[141,401,1176,775]]]'>Other deficiencies, however, are developed in this record which have more significance. The ordinance of the 31st of December 1862, is in these words : “ Hereafter, before any contract for paving any street or streets, shall be enteréd into by the' highway department, the person or persons applying for such contract shall give notice of such application in two daily papers having the ■largest circulation by three consecutive insertions, at least two weeks prior to the making of such application, such notice to set forth: 1. The name of the contractor or contractors; 2. The locality of the space or spaces intended to be paved, with the length of each space in linear feet; 3. The name and residence of each person signing for contractor, together with 'the number of feet owned or represented by each person so signing fronting on said street or streets; 4. To such notice shall be added an invitation to the owners of property to meet at the department of highways, at a certain hour on a given day, to show cause, if any, why such contract should not be awarded to the applicant.” No evidence was given by either party on the trial on the subject of notice by these contractors. If the proceeding had been in other respects regular, the plaintiffs could rest on the presumption that the municipal officers had performed the duties imposed by law upon them. But while the contractors held the agreement of the 27th of March 1869, and while the ordinance authorizing the paving of Beeket street had been passed on the 13th of April 1869, yet the agreement stipulated for the cost of a cobble pavement, and no power to lay any other than a rubble pavement in West Philadelphia was conferred by councils until the 21st of June 1869. The contract was made on the 24th of June 1869. There was thus an interval of just three days between the grant of authority to lay a <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>cobble pavement and the execution of the contract in pursuance of the grant. Of course two weeks’ notice of the application of the contractors for the -work that was actually done was physically impossible. Let it be presumed that <em>some </em>notice was published, as required by the ordinance of 1862. If it described the work as a cobble pavement, the defendant was not bound by it, for such a pavement was prohibited by the ordinance of the 12th of June 1868. If the notice described the -work as a rubble pavement, the defendant could not be required to pay for that which was actually laid, for that was a cobble pavement. The facts prove affirmatively that the legal requisites of such a contract between the city and the contractors, as would create an obligation on the defendant to pay, were not fulfilled. There is no room for the application of the maxim <em>omnia prcesumuntur rite esse aeta, </em>for that principle heals only apparent irregularities or omissions, where jurisdiction or power over the subject-matter is clearly vested : Sharswooi), J., in Pittsburg <em>v. </em>Walter, 19 P. F. Smith 365. The irregularities, here upturn the very foundation of the jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[142,1176,1165,989]]]'>In view of the good faith in which the contract was entered into, and with which the work has been done by the contractors, it has been with reluctance that this' conclusion has been reached. But this is not a question between the city and the contractors, nor between the contractors and the property owners who employed them. It arises between the city and the defendant. The latter had assumed no duty expressly or by implication. He can be made subject to a legal obligation only where the power conferred on the municipal authorities has been legally exercised. Like The City <em>v. </em>Lea, 5 Phila. R. 77, this is “ a case depending wholly on the forms and requisitions of law, and in no degree on consent or contract, in which one of the forms, one of the conditions which the law itself has imposed, is wholly wanting.” It is within the principle of the Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Reilly, 10 P. F. Smith 467 ; of the City <em>v. </em>Stewart, 1 Weekly Notes 242, and of Pittsburg <em>v. </em>Walter, <em>supra. </em>The city could have waived irregularities and defects of form. The property owners who entered into the agreement with the contractors, by leaving the authority they had conferred unrevoked, could not make those irregularities and defects subjects of complaint. But jurisdiction over^the defendant and his property could be obtained only by pursuing rules prescribed by law, and the record proves that these rules could not possibly have been observed. The judgment is reversed.</p>
    <p id="b75-7" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[315,2165,989,170]]]'>And now, to wit, 22d May 1876, it is ordered that in addition to the judgment of reversal, entered on the 8th inst., judgment be entered in favor of the defendant on the points reserved.</p>
