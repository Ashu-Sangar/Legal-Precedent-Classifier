The jury below were empannelled to try three issues, which had been ordered by the court. Neither the learned judge before whom the issues were tried, nor this court upon a writ of error to the judgment, have any right to modify them, or consider what they ought to have been. They may indeed construe them, as was done in Clark <em>v. </em>Douglass, <em>supra. </em>The first of these issues might perhaps be construed so as to present the question, whether the judgment under which the plaintiff claimed, was obtained by fraud on creditors, but the other two issues Avere distinct, that the sum for' which the judgment was entered Avas not due, and that the note Avas signed by Lentz in blank. ■ What bearing the decision of the.se issues would have upon the distribution Avas not for the judge below nor for us.</p>

No person competent before the passage of the act was rendered thereafter incompetent, eitherby the words or the spirit of the law.
