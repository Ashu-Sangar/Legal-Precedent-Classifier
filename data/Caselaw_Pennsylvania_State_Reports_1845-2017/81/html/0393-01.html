The only words are, “ to be equally divided among all my children or <em>their legal heirs.” </em>If there were anything else in the will to evince the testator’s meaning to be <em>children </em>when he used the words “legal heirs,” we might conclude thát they were the legatees of the principal sum. But the form of the bequest to be “ equally divided among all my children,” shows an evident intention to put all upon the same platform of ownership, which would carry a vested interest in all. The words following, “ or their legal heirs,” evidently were used not to individuate grandchildren, but to supply a legal succession in the event of the death of any ‘ one, and mean simply legal representatives. The legacies were therefore vested, and passed on the death of any one to his executors or administrators.</p>
