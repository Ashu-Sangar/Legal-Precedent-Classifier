The defendant derived his property from his father, and owned the ground west of the plaintiif’s residence; it is occupied by a cotton and woollen factory. There is a stone party w'all foundation, built by the father, of about nine inches in width, extending partly upon the plaintiff’s and partly on the defendant’s line south from Lombard street and beyond plaintiff’s south line. A brick party wall is built on the stone foundation which runs forty feet south from Lombard street; at the end of these forty feet the brick wall of the defendant’s factory recedes four and a half inches westward, continuing on the stone'foundation ; this portion of the brick wall being <em>wholly on the defendant’s ground; </em>the brick wall thus built extends southwardly for a further distance of thirty-nine feet and one and a half inches, and then advances four and a half inches to the proper party line. Opposite to the receding part of the wall are the back buildings of plaintiff’s residence with a lateral yard about three feet wide leading to a larger yard, south of his dwelling-house, which is opposite the low'er part of the receding wall; the windows of this back building face westward and open towards defendant’s receding wall.

The important point to be decided is, whether the wall between the properties of the plaintiff and defendant is a party wall. If it is, then the openings therein under the authority of Vollmer’s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>118, are in violation of law, and a nuisance which a court of equity will abate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-6" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[258,485,1166,686]]]'>“Defendant is the owner of a lot and factory on the south side of Lombard street, adjoining the lot and dwelling of the plaintiff. Some years ago, the father of the defendant, from whom the latter derived title, erected a wall on the line between his property and that of the plaintiff. The foundation of the entire wall was laid as is usual in the case of party walls, upon the line between the two properties. Upon this foundation a party wall was built from Lombard street, southward forty feet. At this point the said wall for the distance of thirty-nine feet and one and one-half inches southward, recedes westward for the space of four and a half inches, to the line of defendant’s property. So that this portion of the wall, although the foundations thereof are partly upon the plaintiff’s ground, is built entirely upon defendant’s lot, after it rises above the cellar. In this portion of the wall thus set back, have been placed a number of openings or windows which are the cause of the present complaint.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-7" data-blocks='[["BL_56.5",56,[253,1172,1165,1073]]]'>“ That these openings are a source of very serious annoyance to the plaintiff and his family is apparent from the bill and is conceded by the demurrer. Has the defendant a right to maintain these openings ? It must be conceded that if the defendant or those under whom he claims, had constructed this portion of the wall entirely upon his own property, he would have had the right to leave openings therein. But having used his neighbor’s ground in part for his foundation, can he by receding at any point above to his own line, deprive the adjoining owner of the substantial benefits of a party wall? One of those benefits is the right to build thereto upon making compensation ; another is the right to have a solid wall (without openings) of brick or stone or other incombustible materials. ‘ If the first builder does not comply with the law and make the wall a solid^ne, he becomes a trespasser and wrongdoer.’ In Yollmer’s Appeal, and other cases cited in which the parties had been enjoined from using openings, the walls were admitted party walls their entire length and height. It would seem-, however, as if the present case comes within the reason of the rulings referred to. The character of the wall must be determined in part from its foundation. If the builder starts the latter upon the line and thus takes the land of the adjoining owner, he must carry it up strictly as a party wall or at least in such manner as to give the adjoining owner all the benefits of such a wall. Otherwise the land of the latter would be taken without any corresponding benefit.”</p>
