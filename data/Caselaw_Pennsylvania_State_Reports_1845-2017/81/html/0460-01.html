Taylor lent money to Schuon and took two mortgages, one for $3000, which was a first lien, the other for $10,000, prior to which was a mechanic’s lien; the aggregate was $656, more than the amount advanced by Taylor: the land was sold by the sheriff subject to the $3000. In distributing the proceeds, creditors alleged the $656 -were usurious and should be deducted from the $10,000. <em>Held, </em>that Taylor having advanced more than $10,000, he was entitled to receive the whole amount due on that mortgage.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b461-8" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[109,713,1182,865]]]'>Schuon in 1874 being largely indebted and executions pressing him, applied to William H-. Taylor, who agreed to lend him $10,000, for which he was to have as security a first mortgage on No. 2, the money to he applied by Taylor to the payment of the liens on No. 2. The mortgage was executed and it was afterwards ascertained that $10,000 would not be sufficient to pay all the liens. An arrangement was then made that Taylor should take an assignment of the $3000 mortgage, which was held by a bank as collateral security, and advance enough to discharge the liens against Schuon ; this being completed, Taylor recorded his $10,000 mortgage. The whole amount advanced by him was $12,643.56 ; for this he held as security the two mortgages amounting together to $13,000. Previously to the recording of the $10,000 mortgage repairs had been done to the building on No. 2 and the mechanic’s lien for them was entered afterwards. In consequence, this mortgage did not become a first lien as was designed, and it-was discharged by the sheriff’s sale; Taylor, therefore, had to come upon the fund in court, which was sufficient to pay the $10,000 mortgage and subsequent liens in full, except a judgment in favor of B. C. Roth, for $1750, entered November 27th 1874.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b461-9" data-blocks='[["BL_461.7",461,[106,1582,1176,305]]]'>Before the auditor, Taylor claimed that $656.44, the difference betwmen the money advanced by him and the amount of the two mortgages, had been allowed to him by Schuon under a contract, for his services in procuring the money for him. The subsequent lien creditors claimed that the sum of $656.44 was usurious interest and therefore should he deducted from the amount to which Taylor would apparently be entitled and be appropriated for their benefit.</p>

Under the arrangement for the $10,000 loan, that money was to be applied in discharge of liens upon the property to be covered by the mortgage to secure' that loan. After this mortgage had been executed, recorded and part of the money paid out by Taylor, it was found that $10,000 would not reach, <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>and Taylor says he refused to furnish more money without being secured. It was then agreed that Taylor should receive an assignment of a $3000 mortgage, known as the Eagan mortgage, covering No. 1, of defendant’s real estate. An assignment of this mortgage was executed August 22d 1874 * * * Mr. Schuon and Mr. Taylor seem to regard it as security for the money advanced by Mr. Taylor above the $10,000. As that mortgage ($3000) is not discharged by the sheriff’s sale, neither its validity, nor the sum due upon it, is in question before me.- In compliance with his engagement to lend $10,000, Mr. Taylor furnished more than that sum, which was applied in discharge of the liens on the property to be covered by his mortgage. * * *</p>

    <p id="Ax_" data-blocks='[["BL_463.10",463,[599,799,592,43]]]'>delivered the opinion of the court,</p>
    <p id="b463-10" data-blocks='[["BL_463.11",463,[101,886,1180,988]]]'>Conceding all that can be asked, that the advances by Taylor to Schuon constituted one debt, for which two several mortgages were taken as securities, and that the sum of $656.44, the differ.ence between the amount of these two mortgages and the sum actually advanced, was usurious, it is not easy to comprehend upon what principle of law or equity the usury is to be apportioned between these two mortgages. The opinion of the learned judge below does not enlighten us. A creditor who has several securities for the same debt, has a right to avail himself of any one' of them, until he has realized his whole legal claim, principal and interest. If Taylor had sued out the $10,000 mortgage, he would have been entitled to a judgment for the whole amount, principal and interest, for after receiving it, there would still have been a balance due him, for which he must look to his other security. That other security he may never realize or not in full. If both mortgages had been turned into money, and it was thus legally ascertained that there was more than enough to pay Taylor his debt in full with legal interest, there might then have arisen a question of marshalling the assets, there-being two separate funds. Here there -was but one fund in court, upon which the $10,000 mortgage stood as an undoubted lien, and the Eagan mortgage not a lien. It seems to us that there was error in the decree of the court below.</p>
