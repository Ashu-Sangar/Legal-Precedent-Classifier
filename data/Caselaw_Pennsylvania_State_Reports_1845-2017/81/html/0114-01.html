The verdict in that case was set aside and the suit discontinued. This suit was afterwards brought between the same parties. Before the trial the defendant died and his executors were substituted. On the trial the notes of the plaintiff’s testimony taken in the former suit were offered in evidence and rejected by the court. This is assigned for error.</p>
    <p id="b117-6" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[156,765,1174,820]]]'>The competency of this kind of evidence under similar circumstances, received a careful consideration in Evans’s Adm’x <em>v. </em>Reed, 28 P. F. Smith 415. That case differed in this. There the notes of testimony of the deceased party were held admissible in the same suit in which they were taken; here the testimony is that of a surviving party, offered in a subsequent suit involving the same subject-matter against the executors of the deceased party. There it was said “if the deposition of a party be duly and regularly taken so as to be admissible in evidence in a pending case it is very clear that it would be admissible in a subsequent suit, between the administrators of the parties involving the same subject-matter.” Here it is a subsequent suit, tried after the death of one of the parties, and involving the same subject-matter. The very case assumed there, substantially exists here. In each case the testimony was not only admissible when taken, but had actually been given in evidence. It must not be overlooked that the Act of 15th April 1869 is an enlarging, not-a restraining act. It makes no witness nor evidence incompetent that was competent before its passage.

    <p id="b117-7" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[157,1583,1170,593]]]'>The first section of the Act of 28th March 1814, Purd. Dig. 625, pl. 24, declares: “ Any deposition taken or to be taken in any cause, which by the rules of law may be read in evidence on the trial of the cause in which it is or may be taken, shall be allowed tobe read in evidence in any subsequent cause wherein the same matter shall be in dispute between the said parties or persons, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns.” The third section of the Act of 15th April 1869 authorizes the testimony of all witnesses made competent by that act to be taken “ by deposition or commission issued as the case may require.” In Evans’s Adm’x <em>v. </em>Reed, supra, the notes of testimony are considered substantially as a deposition duly taken. Hence it was there held, evidence competent under the Act of 1869, when taken, is admissible under the Act of 1814.</p>

Here he was no more interested when his testimony was offered,than when it was first taken. His interest had remained unchanged. The second assignment is therefore sustained.</p>
