    <p class="summary" id="b251-9" data-blocks='[["BL_251.7",251,[126,982,1178,995]]]'>“In the year 1844, a writ of covenant was issued by Mr..Joseph A. Clay, attorney for John Cassin, trustee for the beneficial plaintiff, Lauretta. Root. The suit, which was brought to collect $610, being the arrears of a ground-rent belonging to the trust, went to judgment and execution, and Mr. Clay became the purchaser at sheriff’s sale for the sum of $100. He took this step at Cassin’s instance, in order to prevent the ground-rent from merging in the land. In the year 1863, Mr. Clay conveyed the premises to the defendant for $266, received the price, and paid it over to Cassin. This sale was made in entire good faith so famas Mr. Clay was concerned, but without obtaining the sanction of the Orphans’ Court, as the deed of trust required. The jury were instructed that the purchase by Mr. Clay, being for a less sum than the amount of the judgment, gave rise to an implied trust for the estate which he represented. They found that the defendant bought without actual notice; but we are of opinion that he had constructive notice arising from the facts disclosed of record. It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment unless the case is within the 6th section of the Act of 22d April 1856, which provides that ‘ no right of entry shall accrue or action be maintained to enforce any implied or resulting trust as to realty,’ ‘unless within five years after such equity or trust accrued with the right of entry.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b251-10" data-blocks='[["BL_251.8",251,[123,1979,1178,476]],["BL_252.1",252,[257,415,1170,388]]]'>“ It is very clear that the act did not begin to run while the title remained in Mr. Clay. During the whole of this period the rent was collected by Cassin’s agent, and paid over to him; and it is established under the decisions that the statute does not apply as against one who is in the actual or constructive possession of the land. On the defendant’s entry in 1863, the situation changed-; and he was thenceforth in undisturbed and adverse possession until action brought. If we believe the verdict, he had no actual notice, and he would consequently be free from liability, but for the implied trust which appeared on the face .of his title. If this were all, the statute would confessedly be an answer to the present <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>suit. It was, however, contended during the argument that an examination of the record would have shown that behind the implied trust lay an express trust, constituted formally by deed. The defendant became constructively a trustee for Cassin, and as Cassin was under an express obligation to the plaintiff, the case is not, agreeably to this view, within the beneficial operation of the statute. This argument would be just, were it not that the sale under the paramount judgment passed the estate to Mr. Clay, free from the express trust.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b252-6" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[257,804,1160,1019]]]'>“ If he had bid the full amount of the judgment he would have acquired a good title of record. The accident of his giving less than the debt which he had been employed to collect entitled the equitable plaintiff and her trustee to demand a reconveyance if they thought fit to reimburse the sum actually paid, but this right was one which the act requires to be prosecuted within five years. As between the plaintiff and Cassin, the trust was express; as between Cassin and Mr. Clay, it arose by a legal implication from his duty as an attorney. This implied trust followed the title into the defendant’s hands, but he might justly consider the express trust as discharged. If he had dealt with Cassin the case might have been different, but as he bought from Mr. Olay, without actual notice of Cassin’s title, he was, at the most, subject to a constructive trust for Cassin. A chain cannot be stronger than its weakest part, and when the link betvreen defendant and Cassin was broken by the lapse of time, he was no longer bound to plaintiff. The object of the legislature was to guard against the uncertainty of parol evidence, by requiring implied and resulting trusts to be prosecuted while the facts are still fresh in the minds of the witnesses. This object must fail if the numerous estates which are settled or devised in trust are exempted from the operation of the statute. The danger incident to the failure of memory, and the removal of testimony by death, is equally great, whether the legal and equitable title are severed or united.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b252-7" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[255,1833,1163,554]]]'>. “ We do not regard the case as affected by the Act of March 29th 1865.

It is entirely just that an attorney should not be allowed to plead the statute in bar of a trust arising from a breach of professional obligation. Certainly no such plea would have been set up if the property had remained in the hands of Mr. Clay. But it would be difficult to find any valid reason why one who buys from an attorney should be in a worse position than .if he obtained the title from any other source.</p>
