Conceding all this to be true, it would not amount to a defence. The plaintiff would be entitled to recover the $2500, actually loaned to the defendant, with legal interest. It was not alleged that any payment had been made on account of either principal or interest. The case was argued upon the theory that the contract was void by the laws of the state of New York. Had the offer been to show that it was void, we should have had an entirely different question before us. The offer was to show that the contract was usurious.
