They were, as he asserted, the real principals instead of the sureties, and he sought to recover from them for his services, both in procuring and executing the contract. This claim is clearly contrary to law and cannot be permitted. It was an imposition upon the United States, who were entitled to a real principal to execute the contract, and to sureties who were not'interested as principals. The Act of Congress and decision in Tool Co. <em>v. </em>Norris, <a href="/us/69/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Wall. 45" data-case-ids="8299856" data-case-paths="/us/69/0045-01">2 Wall. 45</a>, establish this position.
