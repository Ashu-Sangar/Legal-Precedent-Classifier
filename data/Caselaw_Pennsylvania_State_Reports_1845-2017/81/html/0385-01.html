Schriffer and Charles Schriffer, but not averring that this woman was the wife of Charles Schriffer. The averment in the lien that the building was constructed by virtue of one contract, could not be proved by offering in evidence a contract under seal, signed by Mrs. A. Schriffer, a married woman, for work done, or to be done. The variance was fatal: Cunningham <em>v. </em>Shaw, 7 Barr 401 ; Scott <em>v. </em>Horn, 9 <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2047" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 47">Id.</a> 407 ; Stump <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20533" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Jones 533">1 Jones 533</a>.</p>

The court could not enter judgment against this married woman, since there is no averment that it wras for the improvement of her separate estate, nor does it aver her coverture, nor that the contract was under seal.

It did not set out the coverture of Mrs. A. Schriffer, but joined her with Charles Schriffer without indicating that he was her husband. Without more, that was sufficient to avoid the lien. In order to charge the property of a married woman, the fact of coverture should be set forth; and it must appear from the record that the debt which is sought- to be charged upon her separate estate is within the spirit and meaning of the Act of 1848 : Dearie <em>et ux. v. </em>Martin, 28 P. F. Smith 55. 2. The claim does not allege that the work and materials were done and furnished for and about the improvement of her separate estate. This also is a defect fatal to the plaintiff’s lien ; for it must appear affirmatively that the debt was contracted, not only with the intent to apply the proceeds thereof to such improvement, hut that they were actually so applied: Heugh <em>v. </em>Jones <em>et ux., </em>8 Casey 432. In fine, it must appear from the record that the debt charged is within the letter or • spirit of some one of the exceptions of the Act of 1848: Mahon <em>v. </em>Gormley, 12 Harris 80; Murray <em>v. </em>Keyes <em>et ux., </em>11 Casey 384. An amendment was made within the six months allowed by the statute for filing the claim, setting forth the 'fact that Charles Schriffer was the husband of Mrs. A. Schriffer. This doubtless cured the first defect which we have pointed out, but not the second. As, however, this amendment was stricken off by a subsequent one, striking out the name of Charles Schriffer altogether, and as the judgment was rendered on the record as it thus stood, it is clear that the first amendment failed of its object. Indeed this last error was, if <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>possible, worse than the first; for as the proceedings now stand they not only fail to show -coverture, but they charge the defendant, confessedly a married woman, as a feme sole. It is manifest, from the above, that the contract between the defendant and the plaintiffs should not have been admitted in evidence; for the record failing to show such a condition of affairs as would charge her estate, her contract, however explicit, must count as nothing: Dearie <em>v. </em>Martin, <em>supra.</em>
