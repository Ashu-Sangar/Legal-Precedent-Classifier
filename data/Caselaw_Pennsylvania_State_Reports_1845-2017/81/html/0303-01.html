The bill charged that Patton and Blakely had received considerable amounts of rent, had sold the real estate in Philadelphia and received the income from the investments, and that the plaintiff was entitled to such rents and income as tenant by the curtesy; but that the executors refused to pay them to him, alleging that by joining in the execution of his wife’s will he had waived his claim as tenant by the curtesy. He averred that his joining in the execution of the will was for the purpose of enabling her to make a will valid by the laws of Minnesota, and for no other purpose, and that he did not then or at any other time release or waive his right as tenant by the curtesy to her real estate in Pennsylvania.</p>
