A ship-builder contracted to build a vessel to be paid for in instalments as the work progressed ; while she was on the stocks unfinished the builder died, payments having been made on her ; she was appraised at the amount which had been paid. The executors having no funds, <em>the </em>vessel being subject to liens and there being doubt as to the title a purchaser would take, with other circumstances rendering it uncertain whether more than a small amount would be realized from a sale, under the advice of counsel the executor delivered the vessel to the persons for whom it was being built, and took credit for the amount of the appraisement in his account. An auditor found that under the circumstances the executor had acted wisely and for the best interests of the • estate ; the Orphans’ Court approved the finding : the Supreme Court on appeal affirmed the decree.</p>

Ten days after the probate of the testator’s will a majority of creditors, not including the exceptors, by writing authorized the executor to exercise the powers given him by the will, and to employ all the assets of the estate so far as to finish the schooner and a sloop in progress at the testator’s death, and to do repair work up to the time of finishing the vessels; they also released the executor from all responsibility by the use of the property of the testator for the foregoing purposes. At the meeting at which this agreement was entered into, the exhibit of the condition of the estate showed that it was insolvent. There not being enough due on the schooner to complete her, and the executor having no funds of the estate in his hands, he allowed the persons for whom she was being built to'take charge of her; they completed her at their own expense, and the executor allowed them to take her away. The executor expended no money or material of the estate upon her, he received no money from the contract, the persons for whom she was built having expended $1700 in excess of the contract price in her completion; it would have been of no advantage to the estate to complete the vessel. The claim before the auditor of the exceptors was, that by deliver<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>ing the vessel to those who had advanced money on her, they were preferred to other creditors to the extent of the payment in full of the amount advanced by them ; that the vessel as she stood should have been sold and the proceeds gone into the general fund for a distribution amongst all the creditors. The auditor found that there had been no fraud, supine negligence, nor wilful default on the part of thejexecutor; that the executor acted under the advice of counsel, and pursued what he thought to be the best course: the ship-yard was encumbered with liens which were threatened to be sued out, and in the judgment of' the auditor, if the vessel had been put up at public sale without a guaranty of the title, freed from liens and with the privilege of finishing her, with the use of the mill, machinery, and tools, she would not have brought anything more than a nominal sum, the title being liable to doubt and the vessel being liable to liens: neither the exceptor nor any other creditor requested the executor to sell the vessel nor was any dissatisfaction at his course expressed by any one. Some of the exceptors had liens and issued attachments on them, which they released upon receiving bonds from the persons claiming the vessel for whatever amount they should not receive from the estate, not to exceed a certain amount; the condition of the estate being worse than was anticipated, the claims of the exceptors will not be paid.</p>

J., delivered an opinion, holding that the ownership of the vessel was in the parties for whom the testator contracted to build it; he then proceeds; * * * “ This disposes of the whole case, but had the conclusion, as to the property in the ship, been against the owners, I am not prepared to say that the exceptions should be sustained. Two of the exceptants had liens upon the ship for the full amount of" their claims. According to the case of the Reaney Engineering Works, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20Leg.%20Int.%20157" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="29 Leg. Int. 157">29 Legal Intelligencer 157</a>, the liens were good, no matter which party owned the vessel. The estate was hopelessly insolvent ; mortgages were due upon the real estate upon which the vessel was being built; the executor had no means to finish her. To have sold her, without being able to warrant the title, would have realized nothing. He could neither warrant the title nor give the purchaser the privilege of finishing her where she then stood. Under the circumstances, according to the testimony of the except-ant himself, she would have realized nothing to the estate, and her owners would not only have had their action against the estate for damages, for breach of the contract to build her, but also a personal action of trover against the executor for her value, and in case of recovery he would be liable for the full value of the ship to the owners. Under these embarrassing circumstances, the executor did what any cautious man would have done — called a meeting of the creditors ; asked their counsel and advice; consulted his counsel, and took the advice of the creditors and his counsel. .If he has made a mistake, having acted in good faith, and with more than ordinary caution, he is not personally responsible. If he had finished the ship, instead of paying but a dividend on $1702, the amount expended over the contract price, the estate would have expended the whole of that sum, thus materially diminishing the dividends which the exceptants now receive. Granting, therefore, the title of the'ship to be in the executor, I cannot find from the evidence that he has been guilty of such negligence or improper conduct as is sufficient to charge him personally with the appraised value of the ship.</p>

The inclination of the coui’t is to hold that a ship on the stocks, and while under the law of this state, before reaching her proper element and coming under the dominion of admiralty law, differs not from other kinds of personal property ;■ and therefore no title papers before completion and delivery are necessary, unless otherwise provided for in the contract. This was so held in the case of Scull <em>v. </em>Shakspear, 25 P. F. Smith 297, in relation to the lien of materialmen and mechanics under a law of the state. But the existence of a different view in the English courts made this a question of some doubt, and counsel might well have advised under uhis adverse view. The insolvency of the builder, the want of funds to complete the large payments made by the parties contracting for the vessel, the necessity of continued control of the ship-yard, the responsibility necessarily incurred by the executor in undertaking to finish the vessel,- and the uncertainty of price a public sale would bring, all united to make it a case of great Uncertainty and doubt as to what would be the course to be pursued, which would be for the best interests of the estate. In this state of the case, the executor having acted under the advice of counsel, and upon the opinion and advice of a large number of the creditors of the estate (which was insolvent), it would be a harsh judgment to visit the executor with a surcharge, because he had not offered the unfinished hulk at public sale. The finding of the auditor, and the confirmation of the court, that the executor had acted wisely and for the best interests of the estate, ought not to be overturned in a case of so much doubt.</p>
