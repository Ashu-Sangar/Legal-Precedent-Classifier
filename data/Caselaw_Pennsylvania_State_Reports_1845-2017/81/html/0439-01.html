By that act jurisdiction is given to a justice of the peace only'“in cases where the sum demanded is not above $100.” A creditor who has a claim on, his debtor exceeding $100, cannot give jurisdiction to a justice by allowing a credit to the defendant of a distinct and independent debt, so as to reduce his own demand below $100: Stroh <em>v. </em>Uhrich, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 57" data-case-ids="1852586" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0057-01">1 W. &amp;.

But no part of the principal can be .thrown away in order to give the justice jurisdiction: Evans <em>v. </em>Hall, 9 Id. 235. The true spirit and intent of the act is, that the justice shall not investigate and consider any claim exceeding the sum mentioned in the act. It is not the amount of the judgment which gives jurisdiction. It is, in the words of the act, “the sum demanded.” When the defendant is brought before the justice by adverse process, and the amount in controversy, exceeds the jurisdiction of the justice, no mere delay in making the objection can give jurisdiction. As consent cannot give it, the objection may be made after trial and verdict in court: Collins <em>v. </em>Collins, <em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20387" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Wright 387">supra.</a></em>

The justice examined and investigated that claim. On the trial the justice, not the plaintiff, reduced the claim or sum demanded to $128.28. At no time was the sum demanded brought within the limits fixed by the Act of Assembly. The plaintiff’s claim was not reduced by any evidence, given .either by himself or by the defendant, of payment. It was reduced solely by separate and distinct items of set-off. Jurisdiction cannot thus be given: Bower <em>v. </em>McCormick, 23 P. F. Smith 427.</p>
