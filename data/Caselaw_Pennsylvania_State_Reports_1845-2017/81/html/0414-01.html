Every court of record has at common law a power of amendment, the difference between which and that which depends upon the statutes of amendment and jeofails, is that it is a matter within the legal discretion of the court, while the latter is of right. All mistakes originally were amendable the same term, because the record is a roll of that term, and so in the breast of the court during the whole term, and then a new roll might be brought in the cause, and consequently the same roll may be amended: Bacon’s Abr., title <em>Amendment </em>A. But this limitation, that it must be in the same term, was not very strictly adhered to, for as long as the cause was <em>in paper, </em>that is, at any time before final judgment was entered and the roll made up, amendment might be made, although the term had gone by: 1 Tidd’s Practice 697. Hence, in Bondfield <em>v. </em>Milner, 2 Burr. 1098, a <em>qui tam </em>action for usury, and therefore not within the statutes of amendment, it was allowed, Lord Mansfield saying: <em>“ </em>The rule is, that whilst all is <em>in paper </em>you <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>may amend.” It has been accordingly laid down as a general principle, well supported by the decided cases, that every court of record has power over its own records and proceedings as long as they remain incomplete, and until final judgment is rendered, and until that time it is the established practice in such courts to regard all actions, whether on the docket of the existing or a former term, as within the jurisdiction and control of the court: 1 Tidd’s Practice 161, note JB, and cases there cited. Any such distinctions, however, have been entirely repudiated in this state,.and the general power of amendment asserted to exist in the court whether before or after judgment. “ The old notion,” says Chief Justice GrlBSON, <em>“ </em>that the record remains in the breast of the court only till the end of the term, has yielded to necessity, convenience, and common sense. Countless instances of amendment after the term, but ostensibly made during it, are to be found in our own books and those of our neighbors.' The power of the court to amend being established, the conclusiveness of the record as amended follows of course. Even were the amendment erroneous, the regularity of it could not be inquired of collaterally ; and not being under the Act of 1806, it could not be inquired of even directly on a writ of error:” Rhoads <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 3 Harris 276.

The objection was that it left the witness to allow speculative and consequential causes of depreciation, instead of purely legal ones, in his estimate. That the true measure of damages is the differerence between the market value of the property before and after the construction of the road, so far as that difference, was caused by the construction, is not denied. It is not easy to see how the question could have been more accurately framed. Market value is what the property would sell for. As was said by the court, in Schuylkill Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411, <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>
      <em>“ </em>The only safe rule is to inquire what would the property, unaffected by the obstruction, have sold for at the time the injury was committed? What would it have sold for as affected by the injury ? The difference is the true measure of compensation.” This accords with all that has been held in subsequent cases, of which it will be enough to refer to Brown v. Corey, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20495" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="7 Wright 495">7 Wright 495</a>; Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Co. v. Burson, 11 P. F. Smith 369; East Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Hottenstine, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%2028" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="11 Wright 28">11 Wright 28</a>. Another objection was, that it did not appear that the witnesses had competent knowledge to speak upon the subject. The market value of land is not a question of science and skill, upon which only an expert can give an opinion. Persons living in the neighborhood may be presumed to have a sufficient knowledge of the market value of property with the location and character of the land in question. Whether their opinion has any proper ground to rest upon, or is mere, conjecture, can be brought out upon cross-examination. Such opinions have always been received. “ It is a kind of evidence,” said Chief Justice Tilghman, in Kellogg v. Krauser, 14 S. &amp; R. 142, <em>“ </em>so commonly admitted, without dispute or objection, that I have no doubt of its legality:” Brown v. Corey, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20506" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="7 Wright 506">7 Wright 506</a>; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Henderson, 1 P. F. Smith, 321.</p>
    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[255,1300,1169,519]]]'>The 3d assignment is, that the plaintiff was allowed to ask a witness whether the location and construction of this railroad upon the plaintiff’s farm was an advantage or disadvantage to it, and in what way. It seems to be considered that this question calls for an opinion which would embrace law as well as fact. It may be that there are consequential damages for which the law allows no recovery. But when the witness is asked in what way the road was an advantage or disadvantage, surely the answer must show whether it would fall within the rule. It would be hard to frame a question that would not either be open to this objection or to a more decisive one, of being leading : White Deer Creek Improvement Co. <em>v. </em>Sassaman, 17 P. F. Smith 421.</p>
    <p id="b426-7" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[255,1818,1168,594]]]'>The 4th, 5th and 6th errors assigned may be considered together. There was no inconsistency in the rulings of the court. The fact that before the railroad was constructed the canal afforded the plaintiff a cheap and sufficient means of conveying his products to market,, was surely material; and the fact that it belonged to the defendants and might , be abandoned by them, did not vary the aspect of the case. In the damages which the plaintiff originally received for the construction of the canal, it is to be presumed that the advantage he derived from it as a highway to market was duly considered. It may be that the abandonment of the canal by the defendants was <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>But the fact that it was there was an element in the assessment of the damages which was important. Nor was it material how much the plaintiff had demanded or received for the construction of the canal.</p>

      <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>As to the 7th assignment, the question “ how much (if any] does the burden of fencing the railroad detract from the value of the farm ?” was entirely proper-. Value meant market value. That was what the attention of the witness had been called to just before. The question then was the same as that which the learned counsel for the defendants thought ought to have been put: “ How much less would the whole farm sell for in market on account of additional fencing made necessary by the road?” The question was in the very words used in the charge of the judge below, and afterwards in this court, in Delaware Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Burson, 11 P. F. Smith 380.</p>

That rather involves a question of taste as to style, which we do not sit here to consider. But the clause thus extracted and objected to forms but part of the sentence, and the whole, taken together, is not even subject to <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>the objection of being too emphatic.
