He induced her to be operated on to produce abortion. A physician •procured by him operated on her and for a long time afterwards she was very sick, suffering very greatly. After she got well on one occasion, as she testified : “ He said he would buy me a house ; that he would pay me for having suffered for him.; he said he did not want me disgraced; that if I lost my good name it would be through him ; that he would keep my name up ; that he wanted me to be thought of as much as the rest. On the next day he said, ‘ Mary, I have made up my mind to make you a present of a house.’ He said I should look for a house. I found Mr. Fish-burn’s, the one I now live in.” Her father and Fishburn agreed upon the price, $4300; $200 were to be paid down. She told Neval, and he gave her that sum. On the 1st of October 1868, when the deed was made, he gave her $1600, in the afternoon, at the factory. They went to the law office of F. L. Smith, Esq., and by Neval’s instruction, she said she was of age, and that the $1600 were wages she had earned at the factory. Mr. Smith was to see that everything was correct. She paid it in the evening to Fishburn, in the office of the attorney of Fishburn, Mr. Schumaker, who prepared the deed. She then got the remainder of the money, $2500, from Neval, and she gave him a judgment-bond for it, He afterwards, June 21st 1869, gave .her the bond, <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>with a receipt on it, saying to her that it was hers ; he had can-celled the bond in the office, and it was then all square. The deed for the house was handed to her, by Neval, at Sehumaker’s office, when the $1600 were paid. He told her not to give it up; to have it recorded next day.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It is in evidence that the $200 paid by Daniel Gisaf had been previously handed to Mary by Neval to be paid on the agreement.. Mary testifies that Neval had previously said to her that he would buy her a house. When the deed was delivered nothing was said by the parties — but a judgment bond was given by Mary to Noval for $2500, .payable in one year with interest, which was entered in the prothonotary’s office on the 2d day of October 1868, and subsequently cancelled by Neval, and as both say without any money having been paid by Mary. It is an admitted fact in this case, that Mary was a single woman and under the age of twenty-one years when the deed and judgment bond was executed. It is also conceded that Neval was a married man with a wife and children living. Both parties then resided and still reside in the city of Reading. It will now be necessary to go back in the history of this transaction.</p>

An abortion was procured, and she became dangerously sick for a time. * * * [The defendant testifies that Neval owed her and gave her the money for the shame and <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>disgrace he had brought upon her.] [It is also in evidence, that after the delivery of the deed, and up to a few years ago, the parties continued criminal intercourse between them as before. * * * Now, the question arises, did this state of facts put the title of this property in Mary or in Neval. The law establishes a resulting trust in favor of one who pays the purchase-money, where the deed is to another.] [Now here, if the jury shall find that the purchase-money was paid by Neval, then a resulting trust would be created in his favor, which could only be defeated by the declarations and acts of the parties accompanying the transaction. If the nominee in the title be a wife, or a child, or a grandchild, or one to whom the purchaser stands in <em>loco parentis, </em>the moral obligation to provide for such a party is at once recognised and an advancement is presumed, but brothers are not within this rule. What presumption arises in favor of the defendants here? Who were the parties and what were their relations toward each other ? Was there any legal or moral obligation due from one to the other ? They were in <em>pari delicto, </em>and she could as little maintain an action against him as he against her.] * * * [In the absence of precedent, we are to decide this case upon the well-known principle of law that an immoral consideration will never support a contract. To hold this title to be valid in Mary under the evidence in this case, the court and jury would set a premium on immorality and encourage infidelity to the marriage relations.”]</p>

William Neval, plaintiff below, seduced Mary Ann Gisaf, defendant below, who was at the time a young girl, and in his employ. In order to hide the evidence of his crime and her shame, he advised and procured, an operation to be performed upon her, resulting in serious and protracted illness. After she recovered, to use her own words, “ William Neval said he would buy me a house ; that he would pay me for what I had suffered for him. He said he did not want me disgraced ; that if I lost my good name it would be through him.” Shortly after this a house was purchased by the defendant for $4300, the money for which was all furnished by Neval. This is the story, briefly stated, of this transaction, as it appears upon the record. That it was a gift of the money by Neval to the defendant, is clear from the evidence. That there could be no implied or resulting trust in such case, is too plain for argument.</p>

But it has no application to this case. The defendant is not seeking to enforce such a contract. The contract, so far as one existed, has been fully executed. • This is the case of a man who has wronged a woman, who has made her a compensation for that injury, and who now seeks to recover it back. In this the law will not help him.' As he has sown, so must he reap.</p>
