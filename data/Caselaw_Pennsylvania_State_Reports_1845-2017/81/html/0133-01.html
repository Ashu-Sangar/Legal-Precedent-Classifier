Keene, who stood respectively in the relationship of niece and nephew to the testatrix. The auditor holds that the executrix had no trust to perform, and that she must pay or transfer the securities belonging to the estate to the legatees respectively, upon their giving the security required by the Act of Assembly in case of payment of principal to a legatee for life. This conclusion is founded chiefly on Parker’s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith 478. * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AVd" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[274,837,1165,1585]],["BL_137.1",137,[113,425,1166,86]]]'>“We think it may be affirmed that the broad doctrine that a trust to invest and keep invested a fund to receive and pay income or profit to another, constitutes an active trust in Pennsylvania, and that it has not been overthrown by the case of Parker’s Appeal. In the case before us we have the sum of- $30,000 and the residue of the estate given to the executors, of whom Ellen Keene Mitchell was one, first to be invested in ground-rents or in bonds and mortgages; second, the interest to be paid during her life to Ellen Keene <em>only, </em>or to her attorney, whether she married or remained single; and after her death to her children absolutely. If the testamentary disposition of this portion of the estate ended at this point, it could not be rightfully claimed ‘ that the form of the bequest in Parker’s Appeal is substantially and indeed almost identically the same as that employed by Miss Keene.’ It would yet be wanting in a direction to invest the legacy in specified securities, and to keep it so invested for the life of the first taker, and with the power given to her to dispose of the residue by will in case she did not marry. When to this is added the duty upon the part of the executors to hold the property and pay the same to contingent devisees in case Ellen Keene should die unmarried, the income to be paid for life to said devisees, with remainder to their children absolutely, we think that it presents the case of a bequest, which is not substantially nor identically the same as Parker’s Appeal. But when to this is added the fact that there is a sole and separate use for Mrs. Mitchell during her marriage, the divergence from Parker’s Appeal becomes more apparent, the interest is directed to be paid to her only, or to her attorney, whether married or single. * * * That a separate use was intended cannot, we think, be questioned; the income was to be paid to <em>her only, </em>or upon her power of attorney. This brings it within the general principle that whenever it appears that the wife is intended to have property for her sole use that intention will be carried into effect by a court of equity. In a conveyance made directly to a wife any words which sufficiently show the intention to secure a use to her, or to separate for Her benefit the use from the title must also indicate an intention to exclude the husband. There is no particular form of words necessary for the creation of such an <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>interest; the question is one of intention,-and is to be solved by the established rules of interpretation. * * *</p>
