Cramp, administrators, &amp;c., of the decedent, filed an account of their administration, which was referred to W. H. Sutton, Esq., to audit, &amp;c., and report distribution. The auditor sat on the 21st of December 1869, to hear the case, after due notice published in a newspaper of the city of Philadelphia. There were present on that day and at four subsequent sittings a number of parties interested as creditors. On the 4th day of February 1870, he made a report distributing the whole fund amongst creditors. No exceptions were filed to his report and it was confirmed absolutely, February 19th 1870. On the 24th of September in the same year, James Holgate presented to the Orphans’ Court his affidavit, setting forth that the “ accountants sold real estate against which deponent had a first-recorded lien, in the sum of $601.19, with accrued interest and costs, and debited themselves with the proceeds ; that said account was referred to W. Henry Sutton, Esq., as auditor, who has filed a report, distributing said fund, without searches and without regard to the lien of deponent; that said sale and account and report of the auditor has recently become known to deponent, and not until the same was filed.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-8" data-blocks='[["BL_91.8",91,[150,1438,1169,120]]]'>The'Orphans’ Court thereupon issued a citation to the administrators, to show caúoe why the confirmation of the auditor’s report should not be set aside and recommitted to the auditor.</p>

It was their duty to retain funds to pay it, if not disputed, and at all events to retain sufficient funds to answer <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>the demand if it should be established. If from indifference or a want of knowledge of their duty they did not have the records searched to see what liens were against the property they sold, the lien-creditor is not to suffer; the fault is their own, and if there be loss, the loss should be theirs. They cannot protect themselves by the fact that the distribution was made under direction of the Orphans’ Court. It was their duty to make known to the court, as required by Act of Assembly, this claim and all other claims of which they had either legal or actual notice, and if they had done so, the court would have seen that the rights of the creditor were protected.</p>

But the respondents cannot avail themselves of this act, because they had what the law regards as notice of the claim, and they chose to permit distribution to be made without giving notice to the auditor or court of' the claim, and protecting it as was their duty. Both of the foregoing acts clearly point out that it is the duty of the executor or administrator to make known to the court the claims against the decedent’s estate, it follows, as a consequence, that the accountants cannot protect themselves by the fact that the distribution was made under the direction of the court, after a confirmation of the auditor’s report, when they failed in their duty of having presented to the court or its auditor a statement of the demand, of which they had legal notice. * * *</p>
