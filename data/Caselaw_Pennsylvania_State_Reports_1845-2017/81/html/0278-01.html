On the day Kuhn paid for his stock, C. L. Borie, acting for the defendants, obtained from Lewis, one of the defendants, a contract to convey to him, <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>Borie, two tracts of land in Blair county, containing together 186 acres, for $100,000.

The plaintiffs averred that all .,the defendants were jointly concerned in the common object of endeavoring to make an illegal profit by buying lands for a company which they were forming at one price and selling to the company at a higher one. At the same time the defendants were •engaged in obtaining a charter and organizing under it. On March 28th 1864 there was enacted an act supplementary to Act of 1854 before mentioned, extending its provisions to Blair county. The company was organized by a meeting of Charles Wister and two others of the corporators named in the Act of 1854; at this meeting a book for subscriptions for stock was opened and subscriptions were made by several of the defendants ; before any money had been paid to the company for stock or a conveyance made to them and without notice to the plaintiffs and others to whom stock had been sold, C. P. Bayard was elected president, C. L. Borie, treasurer, H. P. Borie, Gr. $. Eex, E. Y. Maitland, J. P. Bell and Charles Wister, directors. The defendants were affected with a fiduciary relation to those whose money was thus obtained and were bound to pay for any stock which they took, and to put all the money which they received for stock into the company’s treasury, and to buy the lands at the lowest prices without any profit to themselves, and every right and interest in the land bought from Lewis and the Tathams belonged to the company.</p>

Borie and Hopkins, and had made many representations as to its value. Wister also had endeavored to induce his co-defendants to unite with him in purchasing the lands of Lewis, the inducements being its intrinsic value, and the certainty of being able to sell at an advance; no determination had been reached as to the. mode of turning it to profit. On March 1st 1864, Wister procured from Lewis a contract to sell his farm in Blair county to C. L. Borie, Hopkins and, Wister, the price "being $100,000, with an option for a month to buy or refuse; the contract was secured by Wister without consultation with the others, his object being to secure for himself power to participate in the purchase. Whilst these three had this option, Tatham asked Borie to unite in forming a company with leasehold property held by them; Borie said <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>he and his associates thought of doing that with the Lewis property, and suggested to Tatham to join both properties in one company; the Tathams were informed that the Lewis property would be put in at $100*000, the Tatham at $50,000, two-thirds of the stock to belong to the owners of the Lewis land, and one-third to the owners of the Tatham land. Tathams declined this, but gave Borie by writing an option till April 1st to buy their property at $50,000. On the 24th of March Wister urged Borie to close with Lewis, assuring Borie that he, Lewis, could immediately resell at a profit. C. L. Borie, for himself and Henry Borie, said he would sell at $200,000, which would yield $50,000 profit, the Tatham property to be included, though no reference had been made to that property, Wister believing from inquiries that he could at that price find purchasers, they intending to form a company, the land to be converted into stock. This was the only proposal made to these defendants, and on this they consented to join. Borie, at Wister’s request, drew a paper to be signed by persons entering into the project; it was as follows :—</p>

Borie had expected that the $100,000 would purchase Lewis’s interest in the leasehold as well as his farm, but Lewis declined and. required that he should be paid for his leasehold interest as much as the Tathams were to receive; this interest had not previously been referred to, and Borie had no right to agree for the' others. He entered into a contract for this interest for himself and H. Borie, intending the others take it if they chose. Whster procured signatures to the paper to the extent of $130,000, but it was not deemed by any that there was a binding contract, both because there were but $130,000 subscribed; and the contract was but verbal with Borie, although he had contracted in writing with Lewis. Borie was then unwilling to sell unless the new interest in the leasehold was included, and the price increased to $250,000 ; of this "Wister and others-who had signed the paper were informed. There was then no binding contract affecting the title bought by Borie from Lewis, except Wister and Hopkins, nor any supposition then that Borie could not vary his offer. One of the signers to the paper proposed that they should give the Bories and their associates forty thousand shares of stock in the company <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>intended to be organized, in addition to the cash price they had agreed to pay. This being agreed to by Borie, he, on behalf of his firm and others who had authorized him to do so, subscribed enough to make up the $200,000 and to form a corporation, the capital of which was to be the land and the stock to be issued to the owners of the property, in the proportion of their interests. There were then added to the paper the names of the several persons on whose behalf Borie undertook to sign, and the whole amount of $200,000 filled, by subscriptions in sums of $20,000, $10,000 and $7500. The names of all the original individual defendants, except Woods, were to the paper, and also the names of A. E. Borie, Trotter, Lewis and Bartlett, afterwards brought in as defendants. At this time no one was interested but those who had signed the paper, and none of those who had originally signed were bound, because of the change after they had signed; but on the same day they ratified the change. None of them supposed that the Bories, Wister or Hopkins had been their agents. They were then under no obligation to apply for a charter, and when they obtained it none wmre included but those whom the grantees of the franchises admitted as associates; and, therefore, when the corporation was formed it was bound by the terms of the purchase, which had- been settled before the contract was applied for. When the Bories, Wister and Hopkins agreed to sell to those about to form a corporation, there was a refusal at the cost, and a demand for an advance, which was accepted. There was then no power in anybody to require the purchasers to sell on any terms, and no pretence that they acted as agent for any one. Those who bought and agreed to convey to the corporation, agreed subsequently amongst themselves to contribute ten thousand shares, to be sold and the proceeds paid to the company for wmrking capital. The organizers of the company agreed to pay for the land $200,000 and forty thousand shares. One hundred and sixty thousand shares were received by the owners of the property as the price of giving it to the corporation, and they sold ten thousand shares of the one'hundred and sixty thousand, and gave the proceeds to the corporation as working capital. Eorty thousand of the one hundred and fifty thousand remaining, were sold to reimburse the cash paid for the property. One hundred thousand shares, more than a year afterwards, were distributed amongst the owners in proportion to their rights. The larger portion of these shares was still owned by these parties. Twenty-eight thousand shares were sold more than a year after the company was organized at the then market price; and it is impossible for any one claiming in the right of the corporation to demand, as the property of the corporation, the difference between the cost of the property and the amount realized by the purchasers out of their stock sold, on the ground that C. L. Borie and his associates bought as agents <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>of the corporation. On the 24th of March 1864 the contract was signed to buy from the purchasers from Lewis. The Tatham property was not included. Some of those buyers, deeming the contract complete, offered to sell their proportion of shares of the stock they were to receive. They had offers to take it at the price named by them. These offers were without representations as to capital or property or cost; all that was stated was that it was a zinc farm, and the price five dollars per share. Neither of the plaintiffs/ were amongst those offering to buy; those who did offer were after-^ wards referred to the broker authorized to sell for all the owners jointly; they made their contract with him, paid him the money and received their stock. All these were “ the private acts of the individuals who, expecting to complete an inchoate bargain, had in anticipation proposed or agreed to sell the property they would' receive if that bargain had been carried out. That bargain was never made, as has Been stated. A distinct one was substituted, and under it these purchasers received the stock they had offered to sell, but on very different terms from those anticipated when they proposed selling. They submit that none of them are in any manner liable to the corporation by reason of any such transaction.”</p>

The price is five dollars.” There was no statement as to the location or cost of the property. They denied that Evans through Fisher made any contract by which he got any right to stock before March 28th. Fisher applied for one thousand shares of stock to Fox, who, supposing all that had been authorized <em>to be </em>sold had been sold at five dollars, agreed to sell at six dollars. Fisher accepted. Fox learning that the broker had not sold all he had been authorized to sell at five dollars, relieved Fisher from the sale, and referred him to Maitland, their broker, from whom, on the 28th of March, he bought one thousand shares for $5000.

Immediately after Borie made the contract, and before any sales were made, on the 25th of March he called for fifty per cent, of the cash purchase-money, and on the next day $100,000 were paid to him, none of which was from the sale of stock. Kuhn on the 24th deposited with Harris, United States certificates of debt for his stock, but none of his money was used for the purpose; Harris advanced his own money, and Kuhn’s securities were not cashed until the 28th; there was no agreement amongst any of the parties to organize a corporation and take the stock asa consideration for the property, less $50,000 to be raised from the ten thousand shares. Even if those who bought from Borie with intent to organize a corporation were compelled to let the corporation have the property at cost, the defendants are required to account to the corporation only for the profit on the transaction, which was $50,000, the proceeds of the ten thousand shares, viz., of the two hundred thousand shares, the capital, one hundred thousand shares were left with a committee of the purchasers, forty thousand shares, realizing $200,000, were paid for the property; and in addition there were paid forty thousand shares by agreement; there were ten thousand shares for working capital; which would leave ten thousand shares as above stated. The one hundred thousand shares left with the committee were not to be put on the market for a year; after that time they were distributed amongst the parties, and there were still held by them under that distribution seventy-two thousand shares.</p>

Up to April 1st stock could not have been bought at a less price than they paid, and up to April 4th it was generally at a premium. The corporators, in the Act of 1854, did not contemplate any connection between their charter and the property mentioned in the bill; but when the owners of the property contemplated organizing a corporation, they applied to the corporators to enable them to act under it. On March 24th 1864 it was agreed to organize a corporation, and they obtained a charter for that purpose oh March 28th. Evans’s agent, when he bought the stock, knew he bought it from persons who had undertaken there should be such a company. Kuhn’s agent told him it was a stock “we are about bringing out,” and on this he ordered the stock. The purchasers of the stock acquiesced in the conduct of the defendants in regard to the transaction by accepting their certificates, and not making complaint until they filed this bill, nearly six years afterwards.</p>

A committee of stockholders was appointed, to whétn all the facts were stated, explanations made and papers furnished; every fact now known was then known and made as public as possible.

On the 25th, Tatham inquired of Borie what the company was to be. Borie informed him that, if one should be formed, it would be on the basis of $100,000 for the Lewis farm, and the leases at their relative value. Tatham declined, thinking the Lewis farm not worth that sum. Borie said if Tathams would give him the refusal of the leases till April 1st, he would try to include them in any arrangement that might be made. The refusal for $50,000 was given as requested.</p>

The eases do not clearly define it, and perhaps it is incapable of strict definition. It must vary with the circumstances of each case.

This, I think, should be regarded as the general rule. There may be cases where even.six years cannot be allowed, as when a party, having a right to set aside a transaction or treat it as a trust, stands by and sees another dealing with the property in a manner inconsistent with any trust, and makes no objection. And so when the rights of third persons may have intervened. So, also, where the property is of a peculiar kind, and the alleged trustee, in ignorance of any intention to hold him to an account, relying on his ownership, enters upon a hazardous business or incurs large responsibilities. At least this is true when the alleged constructive trust does not grow out o.f actual or intended fraud. It has often been said that equity obeys the Statute of Limitations, and it has <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>been held that laches for a much shorter period than six years, aided by other circumstances, will bar a right.’</p>

    <p id="b300-9" data-blocks='[["BL_300.13",300,[263,2100,1165,174]]]'>This is substantially a corporation bill. It was filed by Evans and Kuhn, who are stockholders in the Keystone Zinc Company. Some two and a half years thereafter the bill was amended by adding two other stockholders as complainants.</p>

    <p id="b301-8" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[113,840,1175,1213]]]'>In March 1864, the agreement for the formation of the company was made, and the defendants entered into a contract for the purchase of the land. The necessary act of incorporation was procured in a few days thereafter. Early in the next month, the defendants obtained a conveyance of the land, and sold it to the corporation, of which they were three directors, and certificates of stock were issued thereon, in pursuance of a resolution of the stockholders. At a meeting of the stockholders, early in 1865, .Kuhn swears that he obtained information “ of such a damaging character to the overseer and those having the management of it, that I at once determined to take legal measures for the recovery of my money, which I considered had been improperly made use of.” With that view he consulted counsel, but in consequence of other persons occupying a similar position, having brought actions on the case, which were then pending, he postponed instituting any proceedings. At another meeting of the stockholders, held in October of the same year, Kuhn and Evans were both present and participated in the proceedings. They voted their stock on the question of the acceptance of an amendment to the charter, authorizing the company to borrow money, issue bonds and secure the same by a mortgage on the estate and franchises of the corporation. It is true they voted against accepting the amendment; but that fact in no wise changes the legal effect of their action for the purposes we are now considering it. The amendment was adopted by a vote of the majority of the stockholders, representing a majority of the stock. At the same time a resolution was also passed authorizing the directors to borrow money on the security of the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b301-9" data-blocks='[["BL_301.7",301,[113,2053,1166,128]]]'>This bill was not filed until nearly four and a half years after that meeting. If the case rested on the lapse of time alone, that would be insufficient to bar the plaintiffs’ rights to file the bill.</p>

The relief prayed for is not that the defendants shall pay anything directly to the plaintiffs, but that they shall pay into the treasury of the corporation, whereby the plaintiffs may be benefited by the increased property of the company. The attempt is to obtain relief through the equitable rights of the corporation. Then the knowledge and conduct of the latter must he considered.</p>
    <p id="b302-7" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[260,792,1166,388]]]'>The bill is not to repudiate so much as it is to enforce a constructive or implied contract. The land was conveyed to the corporation 8th of April 1863. Nearly six years thereafter the bill was filed. The minutes of the corporation of the same month of April show the facts on which the present complaint mainly rests. The manner in which the certificates of stock were issued, and payment for the lands made, were sufficient to make inquiry a duty of all who were unsatisfied. No steps were taken to establish a resulting trust.</p>
    <p id="b302-8" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[260,1179,1167,1119]]]'>In October following the company accepted the amendment to its charter and authorized a loan, predicated thereon, to be made. The plaintiffs had full knowledge of this action, both present and prospective. They instituted no proceedings to prevent it. They acquiesced in it. They thereby encouraged the directors to borrow money in pursuance of the resolution of the stockholders. They thereby induced the defendants to believe that no legal proceedings would be instituted predicated of the original purchase of the land. Afterwards the defendants lent money to the corporation, but not under the authority of the amendment. The master has found that the directors “ seem to have fairly and honestly endeavored to manage its affairs for the advantage of the stockholders.” Nevertheless the company became embarrassed. Judgments were recovered against it by creditors. All its property, both real and personal, was sold and bought in for the benefit of the' creditors. Hence, since the plaintiffs had full knowledge, new business arrangements have been made and other rights have intervened. These proceedings were delayed, under the attending circumstances, an unreasonable time. Having been so delayed, the laches is fatal to the plaintiffs’ bill. This view is fully sustained by Ashhui’st’s Appeal, supra, and the numerous authorities there cited. Although the transaction was originally voidable, yet having been acquiesced in by the parties who might have avoided it, for a length of time less'than six yeai's, but by their conduct having induced the offending parties to believe it was not to be questioned, they are now debarred from avoiding it.</p>
