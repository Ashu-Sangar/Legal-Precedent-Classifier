Although it may be true, as was testified before the auditor, that there was no market in tbe latter part of 1869 for any considerable quantity of whiskey at the appraised value, it is equally true that the stock, when sold by Mr. Martin, yielded a considerable advance on those values; and a surviving partner who elects to keep the stock instead of selling it, and to carry on the business for his own advantage, ought not to be permitted to take it at a price which could have been obtained for it only by its sacrifice at a forced sale in a peculiarly unfavorable market, such as the accountant alleged existed, from special and temporary causes, in the autumn of 1869. He can have no reason to complain if he is called upon to account for the stock, at its fair average price, under ordinary conditions of the market. Such a valuation the auditor finds in the appraisement made of the stock by Mr. Martin in July 1869, the correctness of which has not been questioned before the auditor. And adopting the valuation of that date, it will appear that the appraisement of September 1869 should be increased biy the sum of $18*,023.76. As a result of carrying this increase in the ‘ merchandise account’ into the ‘ profit and loss’ account, we find that, instead of the business from July 1st 1869 to September 21st 1869 showing a loss of $7572.17, it yields a profit of $10,451.58, one-eighth of which, or $1306.44, is to be added to the July statement of Harry E: Price’s account, making the true amount which should be to his credit at the date of his death, $5894.35. Deducting from this latter sum his share of the bad debts * * * amounting, &amp;c. * * * and we have a balance of $4904.98, which was the true amount of Harry E. Price’s interest in the firm at his death on September 6th 1869, for which the executor <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>is to account, instead of $2622.89, as charged in the account now before the auditor. * * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[122,487,1166,906]]]'>“ By the tenor of the agreement, and from the evidence afforded by the entries in the partnership books, it is clear that Price was entitled to one-eighth of the profits-of the business, and that he originally contributed no capital. * * * The books of T. J. Martin &amp; Co. show clearly to the mind of the auditor that it never ■was the understanding of H. F. Price that he had any fixed or definite interest in the capital of the firm, or any interest in the stock of assets, except in so far as the stock and assets represented his share of the undrawn profits of the business. The account of Thomas J. Martin is credited on the books, with the whole amount of the stock on hand, at the several dates of settlement, and is debited with the amount due to H. F. Price for his share of the profits; and nowhere is Mr. Price credited with any share of the capital stock of the firm. His interest, wherever it appeal’s upon the books, is stated to be one-eighth of the profits, and this share of the profits is all that is carried to his credit. There is, therefore, no room for doubt that it was well understood between the partners that the interest of Price was confined to the profits alone, and he could not, therefore, have justly claimed to be admitted to share with his copartner, Martin, in the capital which, as the evidence shows, was wholly contributed by the latter.</p>

      <em>“ </em>But, on the other hand, the proposition of the accountant’s counsel that Mr. Price had no interest in the stock on hand at his decease is equally untenable.

In failing to make an immediate sale of the stock, he appears to have been influenced by a desire to avoid the sacrifice which would in all probability have resulted, had so large a stock of goods been thrown upon the market immediately upon Mr. Price’s death. His own share of the stock was greatly in excess of decedent’s, <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>and his interest in preserving it identical with that of decedent’s estate; ho imputation of fraud or unfair dealing can be justly attributed to him in declining to make sale of the stock. By retaining the stock and continuing to deal with it, he became liable to account'to the decedent’s estate for all subsequent profits, while the responsibility for losses fell entirely upon his own shoulders. * * * There is no fixed rule at law which measures the interest of the deceased partner in the profits by the interest which he had in the business during his lifetime. * * * Out of this difficulty of apportioning the profits, has arisen the simpler rule which gives to the estate of the deceased partner his share of the stock at the time of his decease, with interest upon the same in lieu of profits. * * * It is manifestly for the interest of the <em>cestui que </em>trust, that the rule allowing interest in lieu of profits should be adopted in the present instance ; and moreover, the accountant, by neglecting to invest the moneys of the estate' by mixing them with his own, and by failing to account until cited so to do, has subjected himself to the penalty of paying interest upon the balance in his hands. The auditor has concluded to charge the accountant .with the value of the decedent’s interest in the partnership at the time of his death, with interest upon the same to the date of the filing of this report; first deducting any payments which the accountant may have made in the settlement of the estate. * * *</p>

Upon what ground said surcharge was made we are not informed, as no opinion was filed by the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court. It is always desirable in such cases to know the reasons of which the decree of the court below was predicated. The auditor’s report, however, discloses sufficient to show that the action of the Orphans’ Court should be in part sustained. The executor was also the surviving partner of the testator ; in his account he charged himself with the sum of $2662.89, as the value of the deceased partner’s interest in the firm. The auditor surcharged him with the sum of $2242.09, as the real value of said, interest. The contention upon this question protracted the audit very greatly, and involved a tedious examination of the books and the business of the firm. The burden of this increased expense ought not to be thrown upon the estate. It should be borne by the unsuccessful party by whom it was occasioned. It would be manifestly unj ust to charge the widow, <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>who succeeded in thus surcharging the accountant, with the amount expended by him in counsel fees in resisting her claim. But we think it was error to strike out all allowance for counsel fees. The accountant was entitled to the services and advice of counsel, and so far as those services were rendered for the benefit of *the estate, or to protect the accountant in his rights, compensation should be made therefor out of the estate. An examination of the auditor’s report discloses the fact that the widow objected to a number of items on the credit side of the account, which were allowed by the auditor. Among them was the item of funeral expenses. It is also noted that she attempted to surcharge the accountant with a much larger sum, as the value of the testator’s interest in the firm, than was found by the auditor. It is only right that a reasonable allowance should be made out of the estate, to pay for this portion of the services of counsel. We think $150 is sufficient for this purpose. The accountant must be surcharged with the residue, to wit, $350.</p>
    <p id="b273-6" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[102,1104,1165,463]]]'>We think the court below erred in disallowing the accountant’s claim to commissions. The auditor finds that he was not guilty of actual fraud or bad faith. It would be a harsh rule to hold that, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, an accountant should be deprived of his commissions merely because he has been surcharged in his account, especially when the subject of the surcharge was the value of the testator’s interest in the profits of a business. It is unnecessary to refer to the cases upon this point. The whole subject has been thoroughly discussed in a number of recent decisions. None of them sustains the disallowance of commissions in this case.</p>
    <p id="b273-7" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[99,1578,1163,387]]]'>No question as to the amount of the auditor's fee was raised in the court below. It was fixed by the agreement of the parties, with the approval of the court. The question is whether it shall be paid by the accountant or by the estate. The court below surcharged the accountant with all but fifty dollars of the amount. What we have said upon the first assignment of error is equally applicable here. The necessary and proper expenses of the audit should be paid out of the estate. So far as they were increased unnecessarily by the accountant the burden should fall upon him.</p>
