    <p id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[252,845,1160,947]]]'>At the trial plaintiff argued that Mrs. Smith’s letter accused him of the larceny of county materials, but the court rejected this contention and correctly held that the letter charged only the improper use of county vehicles and contained no allegation of theft; accordingly the court excluded evidence offered to show that plaintiff had not stolen anything. It was, of course, the duty of the court to determine as a matter of law whether the language used in the alleged libelous publication could fairly and reasonably be construed to have the meaning imputed to it in the innuendo, and an innuendo cannot be used to introduce new matter, or to enlarge the natural meaning of the words and thereby give to the language a construction which it will not bear: <em>Naulty v.

A privileged communication is one made upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive, in a proper manner and based upon reasonable <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>and probable cause <em>(Conroy v.

Here the court pointed out that in view of the extensive probe then being conducted and its public importance a communication by a private citizen to a public official, expressing an honest belief that an employee under his control or supervision was misusing public property entrusted to his charge, and suggesting that such an apparent violation of the law be investigated, completely justified it as a privileged communication; (Restatement, Torts, §598). The Controller testified as to his authority and investigative powers into all matters dealing with county business, and that he was engaged in making several similar investigations at the time. Nor was there any evidence of actual malice on the part of Mrs. Smith which would have deprived the publication of its privileged character, and therefore no question in that regard to be submitted to the jury.</p>

But the object of sending it the copy was obviously in order to have it cooperate in the request for an investigation and was thus intended to serve, not a private motive, but the public welfare. For that <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>purpose it enjoyed the same conditional privilege as the original letter to the Controller.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[257,454,1157,326]]]'>It remains only to add that, as far as Alma Double is concerned, she not only was not a signatory to the letter, but there was no evidence whatever that her sister wrote it with her knowledge or consent or on her behalf. No inference of agency arises from their mere family relationship.</p>
