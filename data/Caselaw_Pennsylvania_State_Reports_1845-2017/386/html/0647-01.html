Grossman died on January 4, 1955, leaving a personal estate in excess of $71,000. In his last Will dated August 5, 1949, he gave one-lialf of his estate to his widow and divided the other one-half in varying amounts among Ms brothers and sisters, one of whom, Hilda S. Grossman, is the claimant in the present appeal. After Grossman’s death his executor opened his safe deposit box in the Peoples First National Bank and Trust Company, Washington, Pa., and found in it cash, stock certificates, insurance policies, and other items belonging to decedent. Included therein was a certificate No. 1 for 100 shares of stock of Hudson’s, Inc. (a Pennsylvania corporation) which was dated January 14, 1947, and signed by the proper officers, namely, Theodore M. Grossman, President, and Simon Jacobs, Treasurer. In the space left for the owner or registered holder, appeared in typewriting “Theodore M. Grossman”. Immediately above Ms name, in entirely different style of typing, appeared the words “Hilda S. Grossman or”. The stock, which had a market value of $32,500., was registered in tire name of Theodore M. Grossman, and' there was nó evi<a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>dence when or by whom the words “Hilda S. Grossman or” were typewritten on the certificate. The safe deposit box was leased by decedent in his name on February 5, 1945, at which time he also executed a writing authorizing the bank to permit his sister, Hilda, as his deputy, to have <em>access </em>to such box. She exercised this right of access seven times between October 11, 1945 and December 28, 1949. Thereafter access was had only by decedent. Decedent was fond of his sister Hilda; she had taken care of many minor business matters for him; prior to his marriage he had helped her financially; and at one time they had maintained joint bank accounts.</p>
    <p id="b681-5" data-blocks='[["BL_681.4",681,[198,1080,1151,1057]]]'>Decedent made several loans at his bank and in connection with one of the loans pledged as collateral his Hudson’s, Inc. stock. This stock was returned to him on June 30, 1949. Attached to the said stock certificate of Hudson’s, Inc., as it was found in decedent’s safe deposit box after his death, was a printed power of attorney dated January 12, 1948, authorizing Theodore M. Grossman to pledge as collateral security for any loan his 100 shares of Hudson’s, Inc., which was signed by Hilda A. Grossman. There was no evidence to prove that decedent had ever actually delivered the stock certificate to Hilda Grossman or that Hilda ever had actual possession of the stock certificate. Decedent always voted the stock at the corporation stockholders’ meetings and included the dividends therefrom in his income tax return. We are of the opinion that these facts, without more, did not prove a completed inter vivos gift of the stock of Hudson’s, Inc. to Hilda S. Grossman.</p>

Claimant, we repeat, never had possession of the stock certificate; the stock certificate was always kept in the safe deposit box of decedent. <em>A right of access </em>to the safe deposit box which contained these shares, as well as many other shares of stock of the decedent, does not amount to or prove delivery or a completed gift to claimant. Even a joint lease of a safe deposit box, without more, is not of itself sufficient to establish joint ownership of securities found therein which originally belonged to one of the <em>lessees:, Tomayko v.

In that case where a mother opened a savings account with money of her own in the joint names <em>of herself or her daughter </em>Ruth, and retained possession of the pass-book until her death, and there was no evidence that any signature card or agreement concerning the account had been signed by either of them, the Court held that this evidence was not sufficient to establish a valid inter vivos gift or a joint estate with right of survivorship.

Moreover, under such circumstances evidence of subsequent acts of either or both of the parties is admissible to aid in clarifying the question of intention or delivery, although it is clearly established that “ ‘A gift inter vivos of stock, <em>when once made, </em>cannot be revoked or recalled by the donor without the consent of the donee, nor can the subsequent acts of the donor, to which the donee is not a party and to which he does not consent, affect his title, . . .’ ”: <em>Brightbill v.

I gave it to her because it was to be financial support <em>for her and his mother’ </em>Although thereafter he saw his brother quit frequently, this Avas the only time he mentioned the aforesaid gift to Hilda not of a joint tenancy, but for the financial support of Hilda and the decedent’s mother. Moreover, in October, 1954, decedent told Nathan he Avas going to sell <em>his </em>Hudson’s stock. David Grossman, another brother, testified that in March 1948 decedent said to him “ ‘Dave, ... I am leaving my stock to Hilda’ ” or “ ‘Dave, I am giving my stock to Hilda.’ ” He also testified that in 1954 decedent told him he Avas going to sell his stock in Hudson’s, Inc. because of his ill health.
