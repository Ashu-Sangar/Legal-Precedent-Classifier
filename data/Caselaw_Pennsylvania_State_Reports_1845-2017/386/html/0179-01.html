On exceptions, the compensation board affirmed the referee’s action. The claimant appealed from the board’s decision to the court of common pleas which reversed in an order remitting the matter to the board for specific findings as to the date when the claimant’s total disability <em>from silicosis </em>became known or should have been known to him.

The company’s doctor, Dr. Christ, Avho attended the claimant as his private physician, so testified. But, Dr. Christ did not testify (and the record is barren of any evidence) that <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>

The year within which a claim under that Act must be filed runs from the date when the compensable disability, due to the occupational disease, begins and that date is necessarily a variable one depending upon when the pertinent medical diagnosis is competently established <em>to the Imoioledge </em>of the claimant. It follows, therefore, that the prescribed time within which a claim for total disability due to an occupational disease must be filed is a limitation upon the remedy and not upon the substantive right. It is true that Section 315 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915 has long, and uniformly, been held to be a statute of repose. But, the difference between the provisions of Section 315 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act and the provision of Section 315 of the Occupational Disease Act is the same as the difference between Sections 311 in the two Acts which, in the main, require that notice of .an employee’s claim for compensation must be given to the employer- within ninety days of the “accident” or “disability”, otherwise “no-compensation .shall be allowed.” The legal distinction between <em>the </em>substantially 'similar*-.provisions of -Section 311 of ■the Workmen’s..Compensation-. Act-and Section-311 of the Occupational-Disease Act...was-, clearly and cogently pointed, out in Roschak v. <em>Vulcan Iron Works, </em><a href="/pa-super/157/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="157 Pa.

There, the Superior Court found a differing legislative intent between the relatively comparable Sections 311 of the respective Acts. The only difference in the language of the two Sections 311 (and the same is equally true of Sections 315) is that in the Occupational Disease Act it is the “disability” that begins the running of the prescribed period while, under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, it is the “accident” and, likewise, it is “the beginning of disability” in the Occupational Disease Act and “the occurrence of the injury” in the Workmen’s Compensation Act that starts the running of the notice limitation.</p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[167,1101,1149,1231]],["BL_216.1",216,[270,352,1155,1064]]]'>The <em>Roschak </em>case was the first time that Section 311 of the Occupational Disease Act had come before an appellate court of this State for interpretation. The employer argued that, it should be given the same construction as had uniformly been ascribed to Section 311 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, namely, that the period of limitation for serving notice of the claim was mandatory and not extendable. But, the Superior Court, noting the marked difference between the two Acts in respect of the character of the circumstances to which the period of limitation was made applicable, held that the period within which a compensation claimant, under the Occupational Disease Act, must give notice to his employer as required by Section 311 of that Act begins to run “from the time the employee is disabled and definfcely <em>knows </em>he is disabled <em>by the occupational disease.” </em>In justification of that ruling, we cannot do better than quote what the Superior Court so well said with respect thereto. “In the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the time is computed from the date of the ‘accident’ and ‘injury’; in the Occupational Disease Act, from the date the ‘disability begins’ and ‘the <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>beginning of the disability.’ In the former, the time which starts the running of the statute of limitations is easily fixed; in the latter it is much more difficult. On this subject, Corpus Juris says: ‘An occupational disease is not an injury by accident, and an injury by accident is not an occupational disease; an accident is distinguished from an occupational disease in that the former rises from a definite event, the time and place of which can be fixed, while the latter develops gradually over a long period of time’: 71 C. J. 600, Sec. 357. An accident or injury is a definite happening or occurrence or event of which the employee is almost invariably aware. An occupational disease is latent and insidious and the resultant disability is often difficult to determine. It is apparent, then, that the difference between the relevant provisions of the two acts is fundamental and basic. In construing the Occupational Disease Act, the problem devolves to one of ascertaining the point of time at which the disability begins.”</p>

Whether the widow’s claim for her husband’s death from silicosis had been filed timely was the crucial issue, and the answer depended upon whether the deceased husband had, in his lifetime, filed a valid claim for total disability from silicosis.

It was not until February 5, 1953, that Dr. Bisbing, a specialist in diseases of the lungs who had been called in as a consultant, diagnosed silicosis as the cause of the claimant’s total disability as of <em>that </em>date. Up to that time Dr. Christ, the company’s physician, had been treating the claimant for a cardiac condition exclusively; he never diagnosed silicosis as the primary cause of the claimant’s physical disability; nor did he ever treat Mm for silicosis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
