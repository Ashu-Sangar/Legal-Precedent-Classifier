The night was dark and rainy with no street lights where the accident occurred. Defendant was repairing the Sproul Road, and at a point 300 feet from the accident the travelable concrete portion of Sproul Road narrowed abruptly on plaintiff’s side of the highway. There were no signs, flares, barricades or other warnings to indicate this abrupt reduction in width. Plaintiff, Aleardo Listino, knew that the Sproul Road was being repaired and before the accident had on two occasions driven past other portions which were being reconstructed. Listino drove his car off the concrete highway on to that portion of the highway which was being repaired. He felt the right wheels of his car hit mud ruts. He estimated that his car traveled in the mud about 30 feet before he was able to swerve it back on to the paved concrete portion of the highway. Approximately 270 feet from where plaintiff got back on to the concrete portion of Sproul Road, he crossed the road and was struck on the opposite side of the road sidewise, i.e. in a right angle collision, by oncoming traffic. At ño timé did he put on his brakes, ñor did <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>he know whether his car skidded after he got it back onto the concrete portion of the highway.

It was a dark, rainy and somewhat stormy night, with the road in no way lighted except by the illumination supplied by the headlights of the car. Suddenly the road ceased to exist. It was as if a giant hand from the left had pulled the highway, like a rug, from beneath the wheels of the car. The three-lane highway, over which Listino had been travelling for 2% milés, abruptly became a <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>two-lane highway, leaving no concrete or asphalt flooring Kinder his car. What had been a 38-foot pavement was now only 30 feet wide. The car, with momentum unabated, left the pavement and dropped to a terrain of mud, water and deep ruts. The steering wheel violently jolted within the driver’s grasp as he fought to control the movement of the car which, after travelling 30 feet, swerved to the left, climbed to the remaining pavement, swung erratically toward the northbound lane, and, while in that lane, athwart the highway, was struck by a Chevrolet car moving northwardly. In the collision Aleardo Listino sustained some trivial hurts but his wife, Clara Listino, suffered a fractured pelvis, cerebral concussion and serious internal injuries.</p>

Listino is the only one who testified as to how the accident happened. He said: “All at once I felt that my right wheels hit ruts, deep rats to my feelings, Well, I tided to stay with the wheel and tried to control the car, hoping I wouldn’t go into a spin, until something happened, and it <em>threw mj ear </em>across; it swerved to the left.

The Majority could never have described so unrealistic, impalpable,' and impossible a movement were it not proceeding on the fallacious supposition that Listino’s cóurse of travel from the pavement’s abrupt ending to <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>the point of the collision with the Chevrolet was a tranquil, smooth journey under the conscious direction of Listino. The realities, of course, portray a wholly opposite picture. Listino’s trip from the moment he left the paved highway to the moment he met the Chevrolet (which, incidentally, was accomplished in about <em>jive seconds), </em>was a chaotic, catapulting movement over mud and slippery pavement, born of the momentum of the plunge on to the dark, slippery ground.</p>

On that preceding trip the road “was barricaded, different sections where you would detour traffic, say from one side to the other and all that.” Of course there was nothing like that on the night of the accident: “Then [the night of the accident] X didn’t see one barricade or anything to warn you that anything was ahead or detour, nothing at all.”</p>

I do not believe that the 300-foot journey was an intervening event which made it the superseding cause of the accident. The record clearly shows that it was the Union Paving Company’s negligence which forced the Listino car on to the northbound side of the highway and it was Union Paving’s negligence which, like a long whip, cracked over Listino and struck him down 300 feet away.

In that case, a truck driver by the name of Albert left his truck unattended on a highway.

Kline sued both Moyer and Albert. The jury returned a verdict against both Moyer and Albert. The lower Court entered judgment n.o.v. in favor of Albert, asserting that Albert’s negligence in leaving his truck unattended had been superseded by the negligence of Moyer in driving around it and that, therefore, only Moyer was liable in damages to the plaintiff. This Court reversed and, in doing so, laid down the rule which regrettably the Majority has today ignored. This is what Justice Stern (noAv Chief Justice) said: “Where a second actor [Moyer] has become aware of the existence of a potential danger created by the negligence of an original tort-feasor [Albert], and thereafter, by <em>an independent act of negligence, </em>brings about an accident, the first tort-feasor [Albert] is relieved of liability, because the condition created by him was merely a circumstance of the accident and not its proxi<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>mate cause.

The stream of causation which flowed from the pavement to the Chevrolet was as direct and undisconnected as a cascade falling down a mountainside. However, if, despite the helplessness of Listino as he was being carried in his wildly careening car, we are to regard as negligence his inability to control his vehicle, we must not rule out as non-negligence the tortious force of Union Paving which threw Listino into his dilemma. Thus, taking the second phase of the criterion laid down by the Chief Justice in the <em>Kline </em>case and applying it to the facts in the case at bar, we can paraphrase the Chief Justice’s language as follows: Since Listino did not become apprised of the danger of the collision with the Chevrolet until his own negligence, added to that of the existing perilous condition [caused by Union Paving] had made the accident inevitable, the negligent acts of the two tort-feasors [Listino and Union Paving] are contributing causes and proximate factors in the happening of the accident and impose <em>liability upon both of the guilty parties.</em>

Who became legally responsible for these injuries? Was Swartz liable for crossing over to the wrong side of the road? Was Sloan liable for driving into the Jeloszewski car on the road ahead of him? The present Chief Justice, in appraising that situation, said: “If Sloan, upon seeing the obstruction ahead of him and being thus apprised of the danger, could have avoided the accident, but instead was thereafter guilty of such negligent operation of his car as thereby to bring about a collision, such negligence on his part would have been the primary, active, efficient and proximate cause of the accident, thereby reducing the original negligence of Swartz to a non-causal factor divested of legal liability and breaking, as to him, the chain of causation . . .
