Failing to gain entrance by prying several other windows with a screw driver, he finally forced open the window of the bedroom in which his grandfather was sleeping. He “called to Mm a couple of times to <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>see if he was there or not”; and stated the reason for doing so as follows: “Well, I figured that was the only-way — I wanted to see if he was there, and then it was either forget about it, or else I had to kill him, if he knew I was there — if I could have got in without him hearing me, and I was in there robbing him or something, and he found that out, I would probably have to kill him anyway.” Upon receiving answer from his grandfather, he asked him to come out to his car to see an albino deer. They walked out, and as they did so, defendant struck his grandfather on the head with a 3/4" pipe, about five inches long. As he was falling to the ground, still conscious, the victim “grabbed hold of [defendant’s] . . . coat and pulled [him] . . . down with him, and got his hand around my neck a little, not enough to amount to anything.” Defendant then “started to choke him . . . hit him a couple of times more . . . until I didn’t think he was breathing.” Thereupon he removed the victim’s pocketbook and a key from his trousers; left him on the ground, to return to the house and search for money. The only items he found and removed were approximately $17.00 from the pocketbook, the victim’s watch and flashlight. He then placed the victim in his car, drove the body to a quarry hole filled with water and threw him into the hole.</p>

Their testimony was to the. effect that at twelve years of age he had to leave , the eighth grade of school because of St. Vitus Dance; that, he had had scarlet fever at the age of five, <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>which disease “left his heart in a weakened condition and his nerves bad”; that he developed a curvature of the spine, which prevented his doing heavy work and thus until the crime he could not retain steady work; that he was affected by spells during which he “would just pass out, he would not know anything, . . . and lots of times he would lay for a day at a time . . . just as if he was laying dead”; intermittently he received public assistance; that he was under great tension when living in his parents’ home because of his father’s drunkenness and “rough treatment received from his father”; that upon his discharge from the army, where he served approximately three years, “he was sort of despondent . . . , would not laugh or joke like he did before.”</p>

However, before testimony taken, by order of the court he was given a full examination by a commission to determine sanity. It is also to be noted that he was not intoxicated at the time of commission of the crime; that his confession was free and full as to every detail; that, as declared by the court, “During the taking of the testimony he was anything but dull and apathetic . . . was alert and interested in the proceedings and listened carefully and intently to all of the testimony”; and that he showed no remorse over the crime.</p>
