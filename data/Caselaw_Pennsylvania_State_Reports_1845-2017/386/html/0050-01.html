    <p id="b84-7" data-blocks='[["BL_84.9",84,[260,1192,1155,1157]]]'>Plaintiff, a building corporation, purchased on April 1,1954, a tract of land in the City of Philadelphia for the purpose of constructing row houses upon it. At that time the zoning ordinance of the City of Philadelphia permitted the construction of row houses. On June 24, 1954, the City amended the zoning ordinance to prohibit row houses in “A” Commercial Districts, which this was. On March 10, 1955, plaintiff filed an application for a permit for the erection of fifty-five single family attached dwellings along Lened Street. Plaintiff’s application was refused and on appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment the refusal was sustained. Plaintiff then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County. On September 25, 1955, the amendatory ordinance of June 24, 1954 was declared invalid. See <em>Kelly v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/382/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="382 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1259968" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0459-01">382 Pa. 459</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20238" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="115 A.2d 238">115 A. 2d 238</a>.

The Zoning Board of Adjustment failed or refused to issue the building permits. The Zoning Board of Adjustment on October 7, 1955 filed exceptions to the order of the Court of Common Pleas, which were stricken off by that Court (on plaintiff's motion) on November 2, 1955. In the meantime, on October 6, 1955, an amendatory ordinance was again introduced in Council, which prohibited the erection of row houses in the district in question; this ordinance was enacted and approved by the Mayor on November IS, 1955. In the meantime, plaintiff filed with the court below its complaint in mandamus to compel the issuance of a building permit and the court below entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on November 11, 1955.</p>
