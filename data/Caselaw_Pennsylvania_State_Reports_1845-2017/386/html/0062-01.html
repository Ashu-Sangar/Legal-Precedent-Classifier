At about 9:30 that evening he got into an argument with the bartender who called for Williams, the manager. Williams told Cannon that his drinks were shut off and that he would have to put Mm out. Cannon was then escorted to the door. Several seconds thereafter he reappeared, approached Williams, and when he was about five feet away pulled a pistol from underneath his coat and fired three shots into Williams’ abdomen. Five witnesses testified that they saw the defendant in Stanley’s Grill the night of the murder. Two witnesses testified that they saw defendant shoot and kill Williams. Williams made a dying declaration accusing defendant of his murder. Notwithstanding all this testimony, defendant — taking the stand in his own defense — denied that he had done the shooting or that he was in Stanley’s Grill on the night in question. He testified that earlier that day he had left Pittsburgh by bus for Chicago after an argument with a girl friend with whom he had been living. He was a fugitive until he was apprehended in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 7, 1953.</p>

The introduction of this record deprived James Cannon of due process of law and entitles him to a new trial.

He is made to drag chains from which the law has already emancipated him. He is made to suffer a punishment which the law has already remitted. To pardon and yet to punish is a blatant contradiction. It is like a parent forgiving his child while chastising him with a strap; or like absolving one’s debtor while ordering the sheriff to sell his home; or condoning a neighbor’s transgressions while shooting his dog; or wiping a slate clean while immersing it in mire; or letting bygones be bygones while preparing an act of vindictive reprisal.</p>

      <em>ence of his guilt, so that, in the eye of the </em>law, <em>he is thereafter as innocent as if he had never committed the offense.” </em>Today the Majority of this Court says that the pardon does <em>not </em>blot out the existence of guilt and that in the eyes of the law the pardoned man is not as innocent as if he had never committed the offense. The Majority explains its refusal to abide by what this Court proclaimed in 1942 by saying that the Chief Justice’s utterance in 1942 was dictum. It may be regarded as dictum but I cannot believe that so solemn, measured and profound an utterance was thrown into an opinion as mere literary garniture. Furthermore, this specific language was not used for the first time in the <em>Banks </em>case.

Garland, who had served the Confederacy during the Civil War, was pardoned by the President of the United States “for all offenses by Mm committed, arising from participation, direct or implied, in the Rebellion.” When, later, Garland applied to be readmitted to practice before the Federal Courts, it was demanded of him, under a Rule of Court and an Act of Congress, that he take an oath to the effect that he had never given aid to any power hostile to the United States, This, of course, he was unable to do because he had actually participated in the Rebellion. The Supreme Court of the United States held that the effect of Garland’s pardon was to relieve him from all penalties and disabilities attached to the offence of treason committed by his participation in the Rebellion and that it was beyond the power of Congress to inflict punishment beyond the reach of executive clemency. Speaking for the Court, Justice Field said: “A pardon reaches both the punishment pre<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>scribed for tbe offence and tbe guilt of tbe offender; and when the pardon is full, it releases tbe punishment and <em>Mots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offence. </em>If granted before conviction, it prevents any of tbe penalties and disabilities consequent upon conviction from attaching; if granted after conviction, it removes tbe penalties and disabilities, and restores him to all bis civil rights; it makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him a new credit and capacity.”</p>

Both are statutory consequences of tbe conviction, and tbe remission of one is no more a violation of tbe statute than tbe remission of tbe other. Tbe statute does not say in either case, 'unless be shall be pardoned,’ because tbe legislature in enacting tbe statute was not contemplating tbe exceptional case of a pardon, nor considering its effect on any part of tbe act. Tbe word 'forever’ was introduced in tbe disqualification not with any reference to the effect of a pardon, but to show that it was not merely to run with tbe term of imprisonment, and to concur with the exception of <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>the case of perjury in section 181 of the same act, providing that the endurance of the punishment shall have the effect of a pardon.

It says that the pardon granted the defendant in that case “did not obliterate the record of his conviction, or blot out the fact that he had been convicted.” If the NeAV York Court means to say that the Governor of New York, at the time he granted the pardon, did not actually go to the Court records and with the chemicals of an ink eraser physically obliterate the records of the conviction, the Court speaks correctly, but if it means to say that a superseding, authoritative, and superior action of constitutional government does not blot out (in the sensible meaning of the phrase) the effect of the repudiated and overruled action, the Court is simply indulging in fanciful semantics. According to that type of reasoning, the official hangman ought to proceed to hang a defendant if a jury’s verdict is so recorded even though the appellate court reverses the verdict but no <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>one actually blots out with ink, chemicals, knife, or explosive the words of the verdict in the record book of the Court. According to that type of reasoning, a patient recovered from a hospital may never be declared cured until some one destroys his fever chart. Without quoting Omar Khayyam, the New York Court apparently is of the impression that once the moving finger writes, nothing can blot out what it writes. It overlooks the salient reality that the finger of another person, possessed of greater wisdom or at least more enlightenment in the matter, may also write, rendering innocuous and insipid what the first finger wrote.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">*</a>

      <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>One of the primary objectives of court procedure is to bring a legal conflict to a definitive end. Once the processes of government in any given criminal case have been exhausted and a pardon has terminated the turbulent episode, the books on the subject should be closed and laid away on the shelf to gather the dust of oblivion. Indeed the word <em>amnesty </em>a synonym of the word <em>pardon, </em>comes from the Greek, <em>amnestia, </em>meaning oblivion, the state of condition of being forgotten, no longer remembered.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">*</a>

    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[284,901,1155,1165]]]'>After arguing that the lower Court was justified in permitting the record of the Maryland conviction, the Majority says in its opinion that even if inadmissible the evidence did not harm the defendant because the jury returned a verdict of first degree murder with life imprisonment, and not death. This is a rather academic view. It presupposes that a jury classifies and labels evidence with all the technical nicety of a post-graduate student preparing a thesis. A jury does not appraise testimony in that fashion; it takes no notes. It listens as any twelve average intelligent citizens would listen and reacts with the human impulses common to mankind. Though the Judge instructs that the jury is not to consider the previous conviction except in connection with their deliberation on the matter of first degree penalty, the jury will never be able to dismiss from their minds the fact that the defendant has already manifested an inclination toward grave crime. Thus they will, even unconsciously, allow that item of evidence to influence them in their deliberation on the issue of guilt in the current case.</p>

Such a remark portrays the accused as one indifferent to the sanctity of human life, although by law he is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[169,847,1151,934]]]'>One of the cardinal rules of American trials is that a man on trial shall be required to answer only the charges on which he stands indicted. The fact that he may have slipped in a puddle of water today does not prove that he may not walk dry shod tomorrow. Chief Justice Steen well put it when he said in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Burdell, </em><a href="/pa/380/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="380 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1256071" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0043-01">380 Pa. 43</a>, 47: “One of our most fundamental and prized principles in the administration of criminal law is that a distinct crime, except under certain special circumstances, cannot be given in evidence against a defendant who is being tried for another crime. This is because the fact that a person has committed one offense is not proof that he has committed another and because the effect of such testimony upon a jury is nevertheless bound to create prejudice and an emotional reaction on their part against the defendant.”</p>

Prom that record I would say that the defendant did not receive the fair trial to which he was entitled under the Constitution and the laws of this Commonwealth and the decisions of this Court. Therefore, the verdict remains tainted. Therefore, I would grant a new trial. Since the Majority refuses to do this, I, therefore dissent.</p>
