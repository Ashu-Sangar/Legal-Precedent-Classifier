If a particular clause be construed as an exception from the grant, no words of inheritance are necessary because title to the excepted part remains in the grantor and never passes to the grantee; but, if it be construed as a reservation, words of inheritance are necessary, otherwise the right ceases at the death of the grantor, because the grantor creates a reservation to himself of some new right or thing out of the property which he has granted, and which ivas not in existence at the time of the granting: Whittaker v.

In <em>the'same Mandle v. Gharing </em>case already cited,- we said: “We think the intention of the parties to the deed was that ’Gharing should retain the oil and gas from the grant, and that, therefore, the <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>clause in question created an exception and not a reservation. This was not a lease authorizing the lessee to explore and operate for oil and gas on the premises of the lessor, while he retained the fee in the land. It was not the purpose to convey the oil and gas on a royalty to be paid to the lessor. The instrument was a deed conveying in fee the land which included the oil and gas, but ‘excepting and reserving, however, from the above all oil or gas produced from the said undivided one-fourth of the above described piece of land.’ This was a reservation not of royalty, but of all the oil and gas which could be produced on the premises. The entire estate of the oil and gas was reserved from the grant, leaving in the grantor the same title to the oil and gas as he would have in the coal and other minerals had they been reserved. No other reasonable inference, we think, can be drawn from the reservation.”</p>

Brown, </em><a href="/citations/?q=48%20Pa.%20197" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="48 Pa. 197">48 Pa. 197</a>, the grantor was the owner of a tract of land containing 6 1/2 acres, which he conveyed in a deed containing the following language: “He, the said Boyle Irwin, saving and reserving, nevertheless, for his own use, the coal contained in the said piece or parcel of land”. This court held that these words of reservation operated as an exception: “Thus it appears, upon sufficient authority, that words of reservation may operate by way of exception, and to have any effect, <em>must </em>do so when the subject of the reservation is not something newly created, as a rent or other interest strictly incorporeal, but is a thing corporate and in esse when the grant is made . . . At the date of the deed, Irwin held it (coal) in fee simple, and because it did not pass by the conveyance, he continued to hold it in fee. The word heirs was not necessary in the reservation, for an estate of inheritance ex-isited already in Irwin, and, unimpaired by the conveyance, it descended to 1ns heirs at his death. . .</p>

      <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>“But what was the extent of the coal reservation? It is an undoubted rule that an exception in a deed is to be construed most strongly against the grantor, and most favourably to the grantee. And upon this principle it is claimed, that it was only a special and temporary use of the coal that was reserved to Irwin himself, a right to use the coal during his life, but which ceased at his death. We cannot so read the clause, ‘The coal contained in said piece or parcel of land’ was the subject of the reservation. If that means less than the whole, how much less? what proportion of the coal was reserved? Words not larger than these were construed to mean the whole of a coal right in Caldwell v. Fulton, and we confess we should not know by what rule to restrict these words if we felt called upon to impose a restriction where the parties imposed none. Do the words ‘for his own use’ amount to a restriction? Sometimes the use is limited in point of duration, as while the grantee is tenant of a particular messuage, or so long as he manufactures a specific production; but here it is as general and absolute as so few words could make it. ‘For his own use,’ means, in such a reservation, the same dominion and proprietorship over the coal that he would have had if he had made no deed for the land. He held it for his own use in all the forms that it was capable of being used at the date of his deed — he held it just as absolutely after his deed was delivered.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

In the case of <em>De Forest v.

In rejecting the plaintiff’s contention there, the Court said: “It appears that from the year 1886 to 1888 Walters (defendant) held this piece of land under lease from the plaintiff’s ancestor, the grantee in the deed . . . but in the subsequent years he took a lease from the town and was in possession under such lease at the commencement of this action, so that he was not in possession as the plaintiff’s tenant or under the plaintiff. The testimony in the case is entirely consistent with the theory that he went into possession under the lease from the plaintiff’s predecessor, supposing that he owned the demised premises and had the right to lease, and that subsequently he ascertained that such was not the fact and then abandoned that possession and attorned to the true owner. The rule that estops the tenant from denying the landlord’s title does not apply to such a case, even as between the original parties. . .”</p>

It erred, however, in also holding for trial the defendant’s claim to a return of the paid rentals. Even if we were to assume that the defendant’s counterclaim is “a claim arising from the same transaction” and therefore would <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>be assertable in this ejectment action,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> it nevertheless fails to state a valid cause of action. In its counterclaim the defendant asks for the return.of the $1,002.00 rentals paid to plaintiff under its two leases with him, as heretofore described. The only ground alleged as basis for the return of the rentals is that the plaintiff was not the lawful or rightful owner of the gas and oil and therefore was not entitled to receive and accept rentals. Nowhere does the defendant allege that its enjoyment of the rights under the leases was in any way interfered with during the specified terms. If the defendant company had been sued for the rentals, the tenant could not have defended on the ground that the landlord did not have title: “There was no eviction by the Oil Company, nor was there duress or any other set of facts which entitled defendant to have the judgment opened.
