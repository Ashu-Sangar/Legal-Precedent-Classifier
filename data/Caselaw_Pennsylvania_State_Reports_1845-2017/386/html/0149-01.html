The crime thus committed was murder in the first degree, the only question being the identity of the assailant: Thé defendant, Earl Richard Saunders, a lad not quite 16 years of age at the time, of the crime, was charged with the murder, tried, convicted, and sentenced-in pursuance of - the tecommendation of <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>the jury to life imprisonment, the court having denied him a new trial.</p>

He testified as to the cap, shirt or jacket, and jeans worn by the assailant, the gray or white mask which covered part of his face, that he was a colored man, that there was something unusual about his gait — “he had sort of a gangling walk”- — and that he ran up Fulton Street. Smaltz further testified that he attended a line-up in the police station two days after the murder where he picked out Saunders by Ms posture, the way he was built and the manner in which he walked. However, at the coroner’s inquest and at the trial he stated that he could not “positively” identify him, as he had not had a good look at his face.</p>

He handled himself so intelligently, so quietly and so effectively on cross-examination that no one could doubt the sincerity of his story.” This young negro boy was on friendly terms with defendant; they had known one another very well for from three to five years; their houses were only five doors apart, they attended adjoining schools, and they saw one another practically every day. Hargrove testified — not aggressively nor venomously but with laudable caution and restraint — that he happened to be standing with his little sister that early morning in front of the defendant’s house at Fulton and Medley Streets when he saw the gas-station attendant come down Ridge Avenue to open the station door. He saw someone wearing a mask come out from the side of the station <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>and attack the attendant, and he heard the victim’s screams. He saw the robber go through the man’s pockets and then run up Fulton Street still wearing his mask, but when he came to the corner of Fulton and Medley Streets, right across the 24 foot wide street from where Hargrove was standing, the mask slipped for a moment, Hargrove got a good look at his face and immediately recognized the defendant. He told his mother and stepfather what he had seen and that it was the defendant who had committed the crime, and he identified defendant at the police line-up. He testified at the trial that he was sure it was the defendant, that he had “never doubted it,” that he had had a good look at his face and had recognized him also by his arm which “was kind of bent out” of all the boys he knew none looked like the defendant. Hargrove was well acquainted with defendant, he saw his face clearly even though briefly, his identification of him was without reservation, and his testimony was not weakened in the slightest by cross-examination.</p>

Some of them said that he was in bed that June morning under the covers with his clothes on, including a pair of blue jeans, from which the jury might well have believed that he had but recently and hurriedly slipped into bed, although his family testified that it was his habit to sleep with his clothes on.</p>

      <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>This brings us to one of the principal issues in the case which arises from the so-called “recantation” of the Hargrove boy’s testimony. It appears that some five months after the trial, in an examination in the office of defendant’s counsel,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">2</a> he stated: “I was going to change my mind because it could be somebody else who looks like Richard [the defendant] and I don’t think it was him now.” Because of this development the court itself examined Hargrove in connection with the argument on the motion for a new trial. At that hearing Hargrove insisted that he had told the truth when he testified at the trial, but that he had had “bad dreams” and “something kept telling me it wasn’t him.” The court came very definitely to the conclusion that it was not “something” but more likely “somebody” who “kept telling” him. He gave his testimony this time under obvious stress, tension and emotion and occasionally with tears. While he insisted that it was because of the “bad dreams” that he came to believe that it was not the defendant whom he had seen, it appeared that the boys in the neighborhood, friends of the defendant, would no longer play with Hargrove as they had been wont to do, nor talk to Mm except to call Mm names and charge him with having told a lie at the trial; some of them told him they weren’t allowed to play with him because of his having “told on Richard.” There were other manifestations of pressure, brought to bear upon Mm to get him to retract Ms identification which he had made so positively at the trial. Never<a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>theless, while he insisted upon the “bad dreams,” he would not admit that what he had testified to at the trial was a lie. The court was unanimous in its finding that Hargrove had told the truth at that time and that it was the “recantation” that “rang false.” This, therefore, is not a ease of an essential witness admitting that he had committed perjury, in which event a new trial should be granted <em>(Kvaternik v. </em>Yochim, <a href="/pa/360/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="360 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="475085" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0387-01">360 Pa. 387</a>, 389, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20815" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="61 A.2d 815">61 A. 2d 815</a>, 816); on the contrary, as was said in <em>Commonwealth v. Palarino, </em><a href="/pa-super/168/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="168 Pa. Super. 152" data-case-ids="471955" data-case-paths="/pa-super/168/0152-01">168 Pa.

    <p id="b187-3" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[159,1388,1150,836]]]'>We find no merit in appellant’s contention that the court committed error in permitting the witnesses Smaltz, Wenzelburger and Nicholson, to testify that they had identified the defendant at the police line-up. In many respects identifications made immediately after the occurrence of a crime are more reliable than when testified to at a later trial. As pointed out in <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.L.R.%20911" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="70 A.L.R. 911">70 A.L.R. 911</a>, the majority of jurisdictions have decided in favor of the admission of such so-called “extrajudicial identification” both as substantive and corroborative evidence.

The charge carefully summarized the testimony of each of these witnesses and instructed the jury that it was their duty to evaluate the testimony, the opportunity there had been for identifying, and whether a proper identification was made. While it was said in <em>Commonwealth v. Kloiber, </em><a href="/pa/378/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="378 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1250885" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0412-01">378 Pa. 412</a>, 424, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20820" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="106 A.2d 820">106 A. 2d 820</a>, 826, 827, that, where the accuracy of the identification is doubtful the court should warn the jury that the testimony as to identity must be received with caution, it was there also pointed out that where the opportunity for positive identification is good, and the witness — as here Hargrove — is positive in his identification, such testimony need <em>not </em>be received with caution and may be treated even as the statement of a fact. Incidentally, it is there further stated that “a positive, unqualified identification of defendant by one witness is sufficient for conviction even though half a dozen witnesses testify to an alibi.” (citing many cases).</p>

Since it is uniformly held that such a test is not judicially acceptable (see <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Riccio v.

And you didn’t even get a good look at his face, did you? A. What I saw, I saw it true enough. Q. But you didn’t see his whole face, did you? A. No, I didn’t. Q. You saw only part of his face? A.

This kind of extrajudicial identification is, of course, not only proper, logical, and just, but necessary under the circumstances. Otherwise, the imputation of fabricated testimony would go uncorrected. In fact, many States hold that extrajudicial identification may be called to the attention of the court and jury even if there has been no impeachment of the identifying witness or his testimony. For instance, in <em>State v. Frost, </em><a href="/conn/105/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="105 Conn. 326" data-case-ids="1529373" data-case-paths="/conn/105/0326-01">105 Conn. 326</a>, the Court said: “The trustworthiness of the identification is of the first importance. An identification of an accused, made publicly for the first time by a witness in court, when there presumably have been many opportunities for the witness to have seen the accused and to have heard him spoken of by a given name, may be open to question; but, if it be shown that the witness identified the accused previously and the first time after his arrest or incarceration and under circumstances which remove the suspicion of unfairness or unreliability, the prior identification, together with the circumstances surrounding its making, will be of utmost aid in determining the trustworthiness of the identification made in the court room.”</p>

If Mr. Smith’s horse is stolen on Monday and he identifies (without taking) a certain horse on Tuesday as that stolen horse, but on the following Saturday, when a <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>horse is brought before him, he is unable to say whether it is his horse, how can it be said that the horse he selected on Tuesday must be the horse he lost on Monday?</p>
