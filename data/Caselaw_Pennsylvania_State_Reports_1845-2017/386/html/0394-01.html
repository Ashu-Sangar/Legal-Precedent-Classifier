Her fall was caused by a patch of ice which was hidden from her view by a fall of fresh snow less than one inch in depth. Dagmar Avenue is a steep street and the plaintiff was walking uphill on the sidewalk to the home of her daughter, 1634 Dagmar Avenue, where she had been living for approximately a year. The plaintiff testified that she had boarded a trolley car in downtown <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>Pittsburgh for her home approximately a half hour before the accident and at that time it was not snowing; that it began snowing during the ride home and was still snowing at the time she fell. The sidewalk involved was made of concrete and there was no evidence that it was defective or in a state of disrepair. The plaintiff stated that she was having no difficulty in Avalking along the sidewalk and that she Avas the first person to Avalk on the sideAvalk after the siioav had commenced to fall; that Avhen she reached a point in front of 1622 Dagmar Avenue, the home of the additional defendant, she suddenly fell. No one Avitnessed the plaintiff’s fall except herself. Immediately next to the property owned by the additional defendant, going uphill, is a vacant lot oAvned by the City of Pittsburgh. Plaintiff testified that after falling, she discovered ice at the point of her fall underneath the snow, that the ice Avas rough and had ridges on it and extended “some distance”. Plaintiff did not describe hoAV large an area the ice covered, hoAV thick it Avas, or describe the ridges or give their size. No other witness described the icy condition of the sidewalk on the day in question and there Avas no evidence Avhatsoever as to hoAV long the ice had existed at that particular spot preceding the accident. Nor Avas there any evidence of when any precipitation of snow or rain had occurred prior thereto.</p>

It was not contended that there were structures of any <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>kind on tliis lot carrying the water onto the sidewalk or that the water which flowed from it was anything but a natural runoff from rain or snow which fell on the lot and followed the natural downhill lay of the land. The plaintiff testified that she had no knowledge of any drainage problem with respect to surface water coming off the vacant lot ana draining over the sidewalk. Mr. Walsh, plaintiffs grandson, testified that approximately half a dozen times he had seen water flowing from the lot onto the sidewalk and at times he had seen it frozen; that he had seen ice on this portion of the sidewalk when there was ice nowhere else on Bagmar Avenue at the time. However, it was developed on cross-examination that the only time Mr. Walsh observed ice at the place in question was when he was unable to drive his car up the hill due to the street being covered with ice and snow. Mrs. Korenich, plaintiffs granddaughter, who had lived at 1834 Bagmar Avenue for a year preceding the accident, testified that she had seen water draining from the lot onto the sidewalk and that she had seen ice form from it. She stated that she had seen this spot wet when the rest of the pavement was dry and that she had seen ice at this spot when there was no ice elsewhere on Bagmar Avenue. She did not say how often she had seen this spot wet or icy, or how much ice or water were present when the rest of the sidewalk was dry, or how long after a rain or snow this portion of the sidewalk remained wet or frozen. The additional defendant, Mrs. Marie Leahy, called by the plaintiff as on cross-examination, testified that she had lived at 1822 Bagmar Avenue for thirty years and during that time water and mud had drained from the higher city-owned lot into the Leahy cellar malting it necessary for her to put up bricks and plant hedges which successfully prevented this drainage from entering her home. She also testi<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>fied that her sidewalk was installed approximately four and a half years before the accident and that the sidewalk in front of the city-owned property was put in sometime later on, although she could not say exactly when.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

A city is not liable for personal injuries sustained by a fall on a sidewalk, where it appears that the accident was due to the general slippery condition of the street which occurs in all cities in wintertime. This is so because of the practical impossibility of keeping streets and sidewalks free from ice in this climate during the winter season: <em>Bailey v.

It was contended that the borough was negligent because of its failure to construct and maintain a drain or gutter to carry off the water from the terrace. The Supreme Court was unable to find ‘in the record [such] evidence of an unusual volume of water washing over the retaining walk as would charge the borough with negligence.

The complaint was that the city was negligent in failing to construct a gutter to prevent the drainage of water on to the pavement. In affirming the judgment, entered by the court below in favor of defendant n.o.v., we said: ‘Undoubtedly, there was a certain amount of seepage and drainage that under natural conditions must have gotten from time to time on the sidewalk, as it was lower than the yard, but there was no proof of an unlawful gathering or disposal of the water, nor that it flowed in such quantity, nor in a way as to charge the city with negligence in failing to control it.

Similarly, the evidence in the instant plaintiff’s case does not show that the flow of water from the city-owned lot and the ice formed thereby was sufficient in volume to constitute negligence in not constructing drains to abate it. The plaintiff’s witnesses who saw this part of the pavement wet while the rest of it was dry did not say how long after the other sidewalks were dry this wet condition continued. Likewise they did not say how long ice would remain on this particular portion of the sidewalk after it had disappeared from other sidewalks, or how thick the ice generally was, or how much ice was present there on the day of the accident. There was little testimony as to volume of the flow of water and accumulation of ice and certainly no evidence that it Avas a constant flow in a steady stream at any season of the year. In a city with the climate and hilly terrain of the City of Pittsburgh Avhere water from rain and melting snow unavoidably runs across many miles of sideAvalks and freezes in the winter, it would be unreasonable to impose liability except upon sufficient proof that the amount of water and ice formed by natural drainage floAving over the sidewalk was so unusual in quantity as to present a substantial risk to pedestrian traffic.</p>

Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/363/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="363 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1221677" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0365-01">363 Pa. 365</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%2093" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="69 A.2d 93">69 A. 2d 93</a>, the ice was caused not by natural drainage, but by the freezing of water allowed to flow over the cement surface of the sidewalk from a downspout intended to carry off water from the roof of a house. In addition there was evidence to support a finding that for the four years preceding the accident, this surface water froze during freezing weather and constituted a nuisance menacing the safety of pedestrians. In <em>Zieg et vir v. Pittsburgh, </em>supra, the water flowed from a spring and covered the entire sidewalk with water, which condition remained throughout the year with a possible exception of a prolonged drought. In freezing weather ice formed over the entire sidewalk varying in depth from eight to twelve inches. In <em>Fritzky et al. v. Pittsburgh, </em>supra, the water flowed over a stone wall and formed a solid cake of ice across the sidewalk and across half the width of the street. The ice extended two hundred and fifty feet along the street and was sixteen inches deep adjoining the wall, twelve inches deep at the curb and from four to six inches deep near the center line of the street.</p>

      <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[254,1818,1155,504]]]'> Plaintiff maintained in the court below, and also- in this Court, that the City of Pittsburgh is primarily liable on the theory that it knowingly allowed a dangerous condition to exist on the sidewalk. Plaintiff does not maintain that the additional defendant was in any way negligent and the only issue raised in her statement of questions involved is whether there was sufficient evidence of the city’s negligence to go to the jury. Therefore the question of the additional defendant’s liability is not before us: Rule 35, Buies of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania; <em>Blue Anchor Overall Co. v.
