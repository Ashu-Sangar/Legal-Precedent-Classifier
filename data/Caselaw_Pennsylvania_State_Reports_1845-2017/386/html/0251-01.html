The corridor is reached by means of a public elevator and a stairway. Entrance to the court room is from the corridor. Near this court room door the defendants surreptitiously took photographs of Wable and deputy sheriffs as he was being escorted to the court room.

However, as pointed out by Erwin D. Canham, Editor of the Christian Science Monitor, “freedom of the press is not a right of the press. It is a right of the people.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> By the instant rule the court was attempting to preserve the dignity of the court and the decorum of trial, thereby insuring the orderly administration of justice. To be valid, such rule must be reasonable. Thus in <em>American Communications Assn</em>., <em>C.I.O. v. Douds, </em><a href="/us/339/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="339 U.S. 382" data-case-ids="362716" data-case-paths="/us/339/0382-01">339 U.S. 382</a>, 399, it was held: “When particular conduct is regulated in the interest of public order, and the regulation results <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>in an indirect, conditional, partial abridgement of [freedom of the press] . . ., the duty of the courts is to determine which of these two conflicting interests demands the greater protection under the particular circumstances presented.” In <em>Fitzgerald v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/376/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="376 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1246191" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0379-01">376 Pa. 379</a>, 387, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.2d%20887" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="102 A.2d 887">102 A. 2d 887</a>, this Court held: “'Of course, it is accepted constitutional doctrine that these fundamental human rights are not absolute . . .

But it must be conceded that if we sustain their contention that this rule of court infringes upon their rights of freedom of the press, the court likewise would have no power to forbid the taking of pictures in the court room which were accompanied by no disorder or disturbance. Yet this Court has adopted Rule 223 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, which has the effect of a statute,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and which provides: “During the trial of actions the court shall prohibit the taking of photographs and motion pictures in the court room and the transmission of communications by telegraph, telephone, or radio in or from the court room.” In addition, Canon <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>35 of the American Bar Association reads as follows: “Proceedings in court should be conducted with fitting dignity and decorum. The taking of photographs in the court room, during sessions of the court or recesses between sessions, and the broadcasting or televising of court proceedings are calculated to detract from the essential dignity of the proceedings, . . . degrade the court, and create misconceptions with respect thereto in the mind of the public and should not be permitted.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The taking of a picture of a person called for sentence certainly does not inform the public as to any material facts, and serves no purpose except to pander to the lower tastes of some individuals. Court rooms and court houses are not places of entertainment, and trials are not had for the purpose of satisfying any sadistic instinct of the public seeking sensationalism.</p>

There can be no question that American jurisprudence recognizes the right of privacy; the only question being its limits. See “The Bight to Privacy,” by Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandéis, 4 Harvard Law Beview, 193. As stated in 77 C.J.S., Bight of Privacy, at page 397, in some, but not in all jurisdictions the existence of such right has been recognized, even in the absence of statutory regulation. In this jurisdiction we find no basis for denying the existence of such right or its enforceability. See the excellent opinion of Judge Alessandroni in <em>Clayman v.

It cannot be doubted that the prisoner was powerless to do so by any means within his control; and in such case the court has an inherent duty to use all reasonable means to safeguard that right. It is true that, in <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>a sense, the prisoner has been set apart from the general public and has become a “public figure.” Yet he is the. involuntary subject of court restraint and entitled to the safeguard of his individual right of privacy, just as the court is charged with securing to him his right of a fair trial and other rights too numerous to mention. In this case the defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree by verdict of the jury, but at the same time he was a ward of the court who must be protected against the invasion of his rights by the press as well as the public. All reasonable rules looking to the establishment of such safeguards must be sustained. It needs no citation of cases to prove that many innocent persons have been found guilty and sentenced upon criminal charges, and later released when their freedom from guilt has been established.

It did not spring full-grown as Minerva did from the broiv of Jupiter, nor rise as quickly as did the warriors when Cadmus soAved the dragon’s teeth. It was planted by many hardy, freedom-loving souls and nurtured by public opinion for several centuries before it grew to be a tree of gigantic stature. Government both in England and the United States constantly tried to suppress or destroy it. Freedom of the press became a recognized inherent Eight only after and as a result of the famous Zenger libel case in New York City in 1735. In that case Zenger’s lawyer, AndreAv Hamilton of Philadelphia,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> argued vigorously for the right of a newspaper to criticize freely and truthfully the acts and conduct of governmental officials. The Court refused to recognize the theory of freedom of the press, or permit Hamilton to prove “Truth” as a defense; nevertheless the jury, ignoring the charge of the Court, acquitted Zenger. Public opinion rallied to the cause which Hamilton pleaded and freedom of the press gradually became recognized as an inalienable Eight which <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>was ordained and affirmed in the Constitution of the United States and in the Constitution of Pennsylvania.</p>

In such a case he becomes a public figure who, with certain limitations, as for example when he is in the Courtroom or in the County jail, is subject to being photographed in a public place, on a proper occasion and for a proper purpose. I believe that in such a case, the public interest is (subject as aforesaid) paramount to the private right or interest. Pictures have become a colorful and important part of a newspaper.

They also believed that the Westmoreland County Rule of Court No. 6084 violated the Freedom of Speech guaranty in the Constitution and that, therefore, they were acting within the framework of the organic law of the land when they directed their cameramen to photograph Wable.

Furthermore, the cameras employed to take the few pictures involved were so small and were operated so unobtrusively, silently, and inconspicuously that no one, with the exception of the photographers themselves, were even aware that camera shutters had been clicked.</p>

It must be obvious to any high school student that when the press contends for its freedom, it necessarily battles for the right of the people to have a free press. When a lawyer lifts his voice in behalf of the constitutional rights of his client he is not pleading for his own personal prerogatives: he is presenting the claims of the person for whom he speaks. When a newspaper, through its representative, seeks admittance to legislative halls and courtrooms it asserts that right in the interests of the people. Thus, to say that freedom of the press is not the right of the press but of the people, is as trite as saying that the right of a senator to speak in the senate is not his own right but the right of the people who have elected bim and whom he represents. Freedom of the press is the right of the people to be informed through the press and other media of communication.</p>

Moreover, newspapers serve the human race to a degree beyond the mere supplying of news. If there were no newspapers, a decent and orderly people would demand their creation. Newspapers are daily reminders that in life, eternal vigilance is the passport to safety, health, and happiness. With the story of every crime, accident, and untoward happening goes the unspoken preachment that the reader could himself have been the fateful and unfortunate recipient of the punishment, the injury, or sorrow related, if he had succumbed to the same temptation, or had been equally careless, or had allowed himself to be drawn into a web of pernicious circumstance similar to the one depicted in the columns which now engross his attention.

The defendant-photographers used their invisible cameras in the corridors of the first and fourth floors of the courthouse. The pictures on the fourth floor (floor of the courtroom) were taken prior to the convening of the Court and before the presiding judge had mounted the bench. The slight photographing on the first floor occurred after the Court had risen and was separated from the courtroom floor by three layers of steel beams, concrete, cement, heavy beams, stone and marble.

A temporary restraining order issued the same day. The Sheriff then made a motion that the Court dissolve the restraining order, and, on this issue joined, the District Court went into an extensive hearing on the matter.

It was unnecessary for them to subject themselves to criminal proceedings in order to have those rights and obligations adjudicated. If the Westmoreland County Court had, by Rule of Court, prohibited the general public from entering the courthouse, this Court could certainly have intervened to strike down so obviously unconstitutional a ban. The fact that the ban was something less than a wholesale prohibition does not lessen the power of this Court to determine the constitutionality of the rule actually made.

In Philadelphia, the largest county in the Commonwealth, pictures may be taken without restraint in the corridors of City Hall which houses most of the Philadelphia courts, as well as the Superior and Supreme Courts of Pennsylvania.</p>

      <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>How can this Court approve a rule in one county which has no counterpart in the other counties? On what foundation of law, logic, or abstract justice may this Court build a judgment which pronounces the defendants in this case guilty of criminal contempt in Westmoreland County when others who performed the. same acts in Philadelphia and Warren Counties suffer no legal penalty? What makes a wholesome test in Westmoreland County an illegality while a similar test in Philadelphia County is free of taint? Lawyers and lay citizens have the right to expect consistency in the law. Where is there the consistency in the present state of affairs? Where is there the harmony of decision which should symbolize the jurisprudence of a Commonwealth ?</p>

As wise as are the defendants in the ways of life, being experienced newspaper men, it would never have occurred to them that the Supreme Court would not stand by with life preservers to save them in the event that the ice, which they had been urged to test, might have broken under their weight.</p>
