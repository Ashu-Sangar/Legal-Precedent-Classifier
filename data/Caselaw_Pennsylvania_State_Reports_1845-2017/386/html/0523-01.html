I further regret that the Majority Opinion in the Superior Court should have been written by a jurist who commands admiration and respect for his ability, learning, and deep sense of fairness, but who in this case arrives at a conclusion which may in the future be used as authority to support unfairness and injustice.</p>

      <em> </em>After thus riveting the crippling charge to the defendant’s shield of innocence the Judge asked the jury to unrivet it. He was asking for the impossible. The Judge’s instruction in this respect, while of course spoken in good faith, was as futile as Macbeth’s plea to Lady Macbeth’s doctor that he pluck from her memory “a rooted sorrow” and “raze out the written troubles of the brain.” How could the jury raze from its mind the startling information it had just heard that the defendant was a proved criminal, an outcast from society, a penitentiary graduate? And what chance did Savor have of proving innocence when it became known at the very outset of his trial that he had already committed an offense of such gravity that he had been committed, not to a house of correction, not to a jail or a workhouse, but to the penitentiary, the ultimate asylum of the wicked and the depraved?</p>

But it would not be a work of supererogation for the Chief Justice, and those of this Court who refuse a new trial in this case, to explain how the principle in this case differs from the principle which was so wisely, so emphatically, and so unequivocally announced in the <em>Burdell </em>case and the eight cases which the Chief Justice enumerated in his excellent Opinion.</p>

Logically, the commission of an independent offence is not proof, in itself, of the commission of another crime. Yet it cannot be said to be without influence on the mind, for certainly, if one be shown to be guilty of another crime equally heinous, it will prompt a more ready belief, that he might have committed the one with which he is charged; <em>it therefore predisposes the mind of the </em>

The witness replied: “Me is a little better looking now, because it was a penitentiary photograph.” Defense counsel objected and moved for the withdrawal of a juror. The motion was refused and the trial court, as here, instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. The Superior Court, however, in reversing the conviction ruled that the error could not be remedied by an instruction to the jury: “The only inference which could be drawn from the testimony was that appellant was a former convict. <em>It toas incompetent and highly prejudicial testimony. . </em>. The testimony must have left a deep and lasting impression of truth, and ... we cannot confidently assert that the instructions wholly abstracted it from the interplay of impressions and convictions which generated the jury’s ultimate conclusion. . . It is not an unwarrantable assumption that it [the jury] experienced trouble in arriving at a conclusion, and we cannot be certain <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>that appellant’s criminal record was not placed in the scales in the formation of the ultimate judgment. ..

In the <em>Blose </em>case the witness was a State police officer who had aided in apprehending the defendant, but who had had no association with the defendant. In the instant case the witness was a former convict himself who had served in the penitentiary with the defendant, and, in addition was a self-asserted accomplice of the accused in the perpetration of the very crime which was the subject of the trial. Tt would be difficult to conjure up a situation where a statement of the kind made could do more unfair damage against an accused.</p>

Superior Ct. 328</a>), in a learned and exhaustive opinion on the subject, Judge Woodside said: “The general rule is that ‘on a prosecution for a particular crime, evidence which shows or tends to show that accused has committed another crime wholly independent of, and unconnected with, that for which he is on trial, even though it is a crime of the same sort, is irrelevant and inadmissible. . . . The reason for the general rule was stated by Judge, later Chief Justice, Hep-hart, in Commonwealth v. Dumber, <a href="/pa-super/69/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="69 Pa. Super. 196" data-case-ids="632528" data-case-paths="/pa-super/69/0196-01">69 Pa.

The objection to this <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>sort of evidence is that it compels the defendant to meet a charge of which he had no notice. It confuses him in his defense, raises collateral issues, diverts the attention of the jury from the crime immediately being tried, and generally shows that the defendant should be convicted because he is a bad man.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b561-3" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[159,685,1147,317]]]'>In his opinion Judge Woodside cited nearly 50 cases, and said of them: “In practically every case cited in this opinion it has been said in one form or another that evidence of a crime independent and distinct from the one charged cannot be received to prove a disposition to commit crime.”</p>

It will be recalled that in the <em>Blose </em>case (supra), the statement with regard to the photograph was made more or less accidentally and without specifc intention to prejudice the defendant’s case, but the Superior Court reversed, because pernicious statements which get into the stream of the trial cannot be strained out like tea leaves in a tea pot.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.6",561,[149,1657,1152,552]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that a new trial is not required even where a statement is prejudicial, if “a witness blurts out a statement 'which implies that the defendant has a criminal record.” But what is the relevancy of such an observation? The question is not <em>how </em>and <em>why </em>a statement was made but as to what effect it has on the fairness of the trial. Whether an aggressor draws his knife stealthily, or whips it from its sheath noisily, has no bearing on the degree of the criminality involved if the knife actually destroys the victim.</p>

An unrestrained accusation from the witness stand may so mutilate the fabric of a fair trial that no judicial stitching can render it whole again. Suppose a defendant is on trial for the possession of narcotics, and a witness declares that he met the accused in a opium den, how can it ever be said that such a remark did not influence the jury? An accused’s character can be so stained by a degrading slur from the witness chair that no mere words from the bench can wash away the blemish so that the accused may stand before his judges, as he is constitutionally entitled to stand, presumed innocent until proved guilty of the crime charged in the indictment.</p>

A may do the act once and may never do it again; and not only may he not do it again, but it is no degree probable that he will do it again. The conceivable contingencies that may intervene are too numerous. . . The natural and inevitable tendency of the tribunal whether judge or jury is to give excessive weight to the vicious record of crime thus exhibited, and either to allow it to bear too strongly on the present charge, or to take the proof of it as justifying a condemnation irrespective of guilt of the present <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>charge. Moreover, the use of alleged particular acts ranging over the entire period of the defendant’s life makes it impossible for him to be prepared to refute the charge, any or all of which may be mere fabrications . . ”</p>
    <p id="b563-3" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[170,640,1148,1634]]]'>The Majority apparently seems to be of the thought that, admitting all what Professor Wigmore says is true and what so many of this Court’s decisions have declared, to be true also, namely, that evidence of an independent crime may not be introduced, no harm was done in the instant case because the defendant was guilty anyhow. But how is a defendant proved guilty in an American court of law? Not on supposition and not on illegal evidence. The Majority affirms the proposition : “In the case at bar, we are satisfied from our review of the record that appellant received a thoroughly fair trial and was properly convicted. Indeed a verdict of not guilty would have been a miscarriage of justice.” We presume that in reaching this conclusion the Majority excluded the damaging remark of the witness Reese. That being so, it can be assumed, arguendo, that a new trial would have again worked a conviction of the defendant. Would it not have been infinitely preferable to have a conviction based only on legal evidence rather than one which can be questioned from now until Doomsday? It has always been the proud boast of our American way of life, and justifiably so, that every defendant, no matter of what he is accused, and no matter what may be the temper of the surrounding community, is éntitled to, and will receive a fair trial, with the introduction against him only of evidence which is sanctioned by established law. Even if a defendant has confessed a hundred times to an alleged crime, he may not be brought to trial with a rope around his neck.</p>

Will they now be required to review the whole landscape of an accused’s life, and be ready to explain every incident which rises above the static level of a normal man’s existence? And having prepared to defend against the multitudinous arrows which can be shot from the bow of defamation, all irrelevant to the indictment, will the Court permit such defense evidence?
