Plaintiff sought to prove their rights by descent, but the uncontradicted effect of defendant’s documentary evidence clearly refutes their claim. There was conveyed to J.

As to plaintiffs’ contention that the partition proceedings were not proper, it is sufficient to note that they were had under the Act of 1874, P. L. 156, 12 PS §1760, and there was no proof of irregularity in the proceedings.</p>
