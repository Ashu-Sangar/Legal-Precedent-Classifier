The Gas Company maintained a curb box for the adjoining house at 48 Crawford Street which was located in the sidewalk and close to the divsion line between the two houses. The consumer’s gas service pipe for the house at No. 48 commenced at the curb box, ran into the cellar vault of that house beneath the sidewalk, through the front Avail of the vault and along that wall to the inlet side of the gas meter, then from the outlet side of the meter along the front wall and a side Avail, through the rear Avail of the vault, and thence throughout the house.</p>

Although there were supporting beams above the vault the <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>weight of the car caused the sidewalk to cave in with the result that the front end of the car crashed into the cellar vault of the 48 Crawford Street house. Either the car itself or a section of the sidewalk struck and broke the gas pipe at a point between the front wall of the vault and the inlet side of the meter; gas escaped from the broken end of the pipe for about 20 minutes and then somehow ignited and exploded.</p>
    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[258,811,1156,666]]]'>The Gas Company was notified of the accident either about 20 minutes as plaintiffs claim, or 5 minutes as claimed by the Gas Company, before the explosion occurred, and it immediately dispatched an emergency man to the scene. He arrived shortly after the explosion but could not shut off the gas because Underwood’s car was in the hole and over the curb box. As soon as the city fire department, which was only a few blocks away, was able to remove the car from out of the fire burning in the hole, — an operation which took about 20 minutes, — the Gas Company’s employee shut off the gas at the curb box.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[255,1499,1156,723]]]'>Plaintiffs produced testimony, which was contradicted by the Gas Company, that the sidewalk in front of 48 and 50 Crawford Street was cracked and that there was a depression in the concrete paving three or four feet long, of that same width, and ankle deep, and that this condition had existed for nine years pri- or to the accident. There was also testimony by the tenant of 48 Crawford Street, Avhich was likewise contradicted by the Gas Company, that after the accident, and just before the explosion, he had noticed that the broken pipe was rusted and “egg-shell thin.” He also testified that some of the bricks had fallen from the ceiling of the vault some time before the accident.</p>

The jury returned a verdict in favor of both the defendants and the additional defendants.

    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[161,756,1152,1286]]]'>Plaintiffs’ claim against the City is based on the alleged long-existing defective condition of the sidewalk, of which, they contend, the City had at least constructive if not actual notice. It did not appear, however, that the sidewalk was not safe for the only purpose for which it existed, namely, to support proper users thereof. A sidewalk is not designed to bear the weight of a parked automobile, and the City was not obliged to anticipate that it would be subjected to any such improper purpose, the only duty of the City being to keep it in a reasonably safe condition for the use of pedestrians: <em>Dunkerton v.

If the depression claimed by plaintiffs actually existed, and if a pedestrian had slipped or fallen into it, liability of the City might well hare resulted.

    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[266,533,1157,1446]]]'>As to the first of these charges, plaintiffs assert that a rule of the Public Utility Commission required that urban meters should be installed inside of the building, but, if necessary to locate them outside, they should be enclosed by some kind of protective device. Assuming, arguendo, that the location of the meter in the vault of 48 Crawford Street was not a compliance with the rule, nevertheless it is obvious that, no matter where the meter were placed, the consumer’s gas pipe would have had to run underneath the sidewalk from the curb to the house, and would therefore have been broken by the caving in of the sidewalk. The failure to enclose the meter in a protective device had no causative relation whatever to the happening of the accident. Presumably that provision of the rule is merely for the protection of the meter against the weather. Violation of a statute or ordinance is not a ground of liability unless it is the proximate and efficient cause of an accident which is of the type the legislative enactment was designed to prevent: <em>Shakley v.
