The Banking Board concluded as a matter of law (1) “A community within the meaning of the Banking Code is not necessarily limited by municipal lines and boundaries, but may denote an area having common residential, social, business, commercial or industrial interests. (2) The Borough of Clifton Heights and the portion of Upper Darby Township including Oak Park Shopping Center are a community within the meaning of the Banking Code.” (3) <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>The banking facilities of that community would be inadequate without the continuance of the facilities furnished by the branch hank of Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company which is presently located at 242 West Baltimore Pike and is to be relocated at the Oak Park Shopping Center.</p>
    <p id="b49-3" data-blocks='[["BL_49.4",49,[189,675,1143,831]]]'>The Upper Darby National Bank protests the relocation of Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company’s branch hank, and in its appeal to this Court made three main contentions: (1) the words “other community” as used in §204(D) of the Banking Code must be construed as meaning a township or a single political subdivision such as a well defined area in an unicorporated political subdivision, and does not mean “community” as that word is generally understood; (2) in determining the adequacy of banking facilities the Banking Code does not permit the Banking Board to exclude from its consideration the services of the branch proposed to be relocated; (3) Fidelity failed to prove the hanking facilities at the place of relocation were inadequate.</p>
    <p id="b49-4" data-blocks='[["BL_49.5",49,[183,1520,1146,830]]]'>Considering these contentions in their inverse order, not only was the evidence sufficient to justify the Banking Board in finding that the community is without adequate banking facilities if the Fidelity’s branch is excluded, but the Upper Darby National Bank had itself recognized this fact by applying on April 14, 1955 to the Comptroller of the Currency for permission to establish and operate a branch office somewhere in Upper Darby Township in the vicinity of the proposed relocation of the Fidelity’s branch hank, the exact location not yet having been determined. This application of the Upper Darby National Bank was approved by the Comptroller of the Currency on July 25, 1955 on the ground, inter alia, that the locality in question was without adequate banking facilities.</p>
    <p id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.3",50,[263,347,1148,715]]]'>
      <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>Two legal questions raised by appellant have never previously been decided by this Court. The first one, and the one on which they lay most stress, is the interpretation of §204(D) of the Banking Code, with reference to the factual situation here involved. Section 204 (D) reads: “Any institution may, in the case of an incorporated institution, in the manner provided in this act for an amendment to its articles ... (2) establish a branch ... in any place within any county contiguous to the county in which its principal place of business is located, if the city, borough or other community in which such branch is to be established is without adequate banking facilities . . .”</p>
    <p id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[259,1076,1151,1169]]]'>Appellant contends that the words “other community” refer to a political subdivision and can only mean “township”, especially when taken in conjunction with §203 which refers to relocations within or without a city, borough or township in which a bank’s principal place of business or branch is located. We do not agree with this contention which is based on the principle of a ejusdem generis and which appellant frankly admits is a narrow technical interpretation. The Legislature knew how to use the word “township” whenever it so desired, as in §203. Community in its ordinary or popular meaning does not mean township or other political subdivision; it means an area in which there is a community of people or interests, such as in this case banking interests or banking facilities. In rural counties people rarely ever know where a borough or township line begins or ends, and in making deposits or doing a banking business they rarely ever think of whether they are crossing a township or political line, nor does a bank in a rural community think of political lines when it seeks to serve a community.</p>
    <p id="b50-6" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[250,2256,1154,101]],["BL_51.1",51,[178,348,1148,1293]]]'>In <em>Philadelphia Saving Fund Society v. Banking Board of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/383/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="383 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1261948" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0253-01">383 Pa. 253</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.2d%20561" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="118 A.2d 561">118 A. 2d 561</a> <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>(which involved the establishment of a branch bank in Ardmore in a county contiguous to Philadelphia), the Secretary of Banking and all the parties <em>agreed </em>that the area or community involved included portions of Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, and portions of Haverford Township, Delaware County, within a radius of two and one-half miles from the site of the proposed branch office. Appellant correctly says that the question here involved was not there decided; but that case proceeded on the assumption that the Department of Banking believed, and in passing upon banking applications, always acted on the basis that the word “community” meant the area served or likely to be served by the bank or branch bank, and not a political subdivision known as a township. For these reasons we agree with the Banking Board that “A community within the meaning of the Banking Code is not necessarily limited by municipal lines and boundaries, but may denote an area having common residential, social, business, commercial or industrial interests. The Borough of Clifton Heights and the portion of Upper Darby Township including Oak Park Shopping Center are a community within the meaning of the Banking Code.”</p>

Once again we agree with the Banking Board’s interpretation. In <em>Delaware County National Bank v. </em>Campbell, <a href="/pa/378/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="378 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1250881" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0311-01">378 Pa. 311</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.2d%20416" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="108 A.2d 416">108 A. 2d 416</a>, in a case involving the right of a bank whose principal office was in Philadelphia County, to establish by merger a branch bank in .a contiguous county, the Court held that the Banking Board could approve such a merger “if the city, ■borough or other community in which such branch is <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>to be established is without adequate banking facilities <em>excluding </em>the institutions which are a party to the plan of merger.”</p>
    <p id="b52-5" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[264,527,1153,484]]]'>While the present case is not a case of establishing a branch in another county <em>bg merger, </em>it is a case, <em>not of additional </em>banking facilities, but an application for the transfer and relocation of existing banking facilities of a .branch 'bank to a new location within the same banking area or community; and the same test or yardstick which was applied in the Delaware County National Bank case is equally applicable in this situation.</p>
