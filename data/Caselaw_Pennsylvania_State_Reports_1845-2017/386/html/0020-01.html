Ballem made two confessions. The first confession was a lengthy one consisting of questions and answers. For reasons which will hereinafter appear, defendant does not object tó the admission of this confession. Ballem stated therein that he killed in self defense in his home a man whose name he did not know; that the killing occurred on the Thursday or Friday of the week preceding April 30, 1954-; that he met the deceased either at the Essex Bar or Dewey’s in Philadelphia; that they drank together; that he took tlié man to his (Ballem’s) home where they drank some more; that the deceased went upstairs to the toilet and when he came down he had Ballem’s ring on his finger; that he then told deceased to drop everything and get out. Deceased shot at him and Ballem <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>then shot deceased in the abdomen, and the deceased fell on the floor and some time thereafter died. Ballem dragged the body to his basement and removed and burned the clothing in the furnace. He then got drunk and decided to dispose of the body. He purchased lye and placed it on the hands and over the face, but it did not destroy the features. He then applied a torch. After several hours he decided the torch was not working successfully and he went upstairs and got drunk all over again. After he sobered up, he cut up the body with a saw. lie tried unsuccessfully to burn the cut up portions of the body, piece by piece, in the furnace. 1-Ie burned successfully some parts of the body; then he took sheets and newspapers, put the ashes therein and flushed them down the drain or sewer with a hose. The drain was located in his basement. He then bought plastic raincoats and wrapped therein other portions of the body, some of which he placed in a trunk which he bought and brought home in a taxicab. Other parts he placed in a suitcase which he hid on the third floor of his home. He took other parts of the body, with the raincoats wrapped around them, and rolled them into a creek known as Naylor’s Bun, Upper Darby, which is four or five blocks from his home. He cleaned and re-loaded his gun so that if it was found no one would know it had been recently fired. He confessed that the gun which was found in his home was the one with which he shot and killed the deceased; he confessed that the torch and the saw which were found in his basement were the torch and saw with which he burned and subsequently dismembered the body of the deceased ; and he stated that the gloves found in Ms home were the gloves which he used so that no finger marks would be found.</p>

There could not be the slightest doubt in the world from the detailed explanation and answers given that Ballem was a very intelligent person, and that he had shot and killed and dismembered a man. There is, we repeat, no claim by Ballem that this confession was not free and voluntary, or that it was in any way or in any degree coerced. It was witnessed by six persons who were present when the confession was made. Probably the reason why no objection was or is made to the admission of this confession is that Ballem stated therein that he shot and killed in self defense.</p>

He then said in question and answer form, that after hearing the man talk about big money he intended to get him drunk, take him back to his home, and after he had gotten him sufficiently stupefied with liquor to rob him of his money, and after he had robbed him to put him in a taxicab and get him out of the house. He then stated that after he arrived home with this man he supplied him Avith more liquor and attempted to stupefy him further by <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>putting cigar ashes in the liquor. He then saw the man with his, Ballem’s, ring on his finger, which made him all the more anxious to rob the man. “I started going through his brown coat which was on the chair in the living room, for the purpose of finding his wallet which he had given me the impression was full of money. I was very drunk but I knew what I was doing with reference to robbing this man of his money.” Just at that time the man walked into the room, and said: “I am going to kill you, you thieving — .” Ballem then offered to call it quits. He had gone out of the room when he heard the man coming downstairs, and had gotten his gun. When the man attempted to cock Ballem’s revolver which he had stolen from a room in Ballem’s house Ballem said: “Well, you asked for it”; fired into his abdomen and killed him. Ballem was standing <em>áy2 to </em>6 feet away from him when he shot him. This is the statement which counsel for Ballem contends was coerced and therefore inadmissible.</p>

There is no merit in defendant’s contention that the corpus delicti and all the ingredients of murder in the first degree were not proved by the Commonwealth. The evidence was sufficient to justify the jury in finding that the defendant killed Dopirak while he was engaged in the commission of a robbery and not, as defendant contended, while attempting to commit larceny, or in self defense. The jury did not have to believe that part of defendant’s confession which stated that he shot and killed Dopirak in self defense. In <em>Commonwealth </em>
