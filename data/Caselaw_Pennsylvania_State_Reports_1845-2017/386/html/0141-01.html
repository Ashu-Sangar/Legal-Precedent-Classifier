According to Vincent G. Fisher, he was operating a Mercury Coupe on May 3, 1953, at about 2:15 A.M. eastwardly on Eoute 22 (Jonestown Eoad) near Harrisburg; as he approached 39th Street a Dodge Sedan driven by Allen J. Dye in which his wife Leticia M. Dye was a passenger, and which had been proceeding westwardly on Eoute 22, made a diagonal left-hand turn into 39th Street when Fisher was only 10 to 30 feet away and without Dye having given any warning of his intention so to do; although Fisher tried to apply his brakes he was unable to avoid the collision. Dye’s story, on the other hand, was that he stopped briefly at the 39th Street intersection before turning; he signalled his intention to turn, looked to the west and, seeing no car approaching within a distance of up to 700 feet, he then proceeded, with the result that Ms car was struck after its front wheels had already passed the south edge of the pavement of the eastbound lane and were on the berm of the road.</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[162,1604,1149,722]],["BL_176.1",176,[259,356,1155,554]]]'>Fisher instituted suit against Dye to recover for the damage to his car and for personal injuries. Dye, both in his own right and as administrator of the estate of his wife who had been killed in the collision, filed a cross suit against Fisher, seeking recovery for property damages and for personal injuries and, as administrator, for damages under the Wrongful Death Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 869, Section 19, as amended, and the Survival Act of July 2, 1937, P. L. 2755, Section 2, re-enacted in the Fiduciaries Act of April 18, 19-49, P. L. 512, Sections 801, 603. The suit of Dye in his own right was severed from his suit as administrator and he was joined as an additional defendant in the action <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>brought by him as the administrator of his wife’s estate. The three actions were then consolidated for trial. In the suit of Fisher v. Dye the jury found for the defendant; in the suit of Dye in his own right against Fisher the jury likewise found in favor of the defendant; in the suit of Dye as administrator against Fisher as defendant and himself as additional defendant the jury found in favor of both the defendant and the additional defendant. The jury, therefore, must have concluded that Fisher and Dye had both been negligent.</p>
    <p id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.4",176,[257,924,1157,1223]]]'>The principal issue on the present appeals arises from the fact that in the survival action brought by Dye as administrator the trial judge instructed the jury that if they found that Leticia M. Dye at the time of her death had no creditors, that her husband was her sole heir, that Dye was negligent, and that his negligence contributed in any degree to the happening of the accident, he could not, as administrator of his wife’s estate, recover any damages in the action. This instruction was based on the theory that if Dye had helped to bring about his wife’s death he ought not to be allowed to profit thereby. Subsequently, however, the court en banc came to the conclusion that, since neither the Survival Statute nor the Intestate Act contained any provision depriving a husband of the right to share in his wife’s estate even if the fund for distribution had come into being as the result of his own negligent act, the court should not write into the Acts an exception which the legislature had apparently not seen fit to make. Accordingly the court decided that the instruction given to the jury was erroneous and therefore granted the administrator’s motion for a new trial.</p>

In our opinion, however, the question whether Dye can ultimately receive or share in the proceeds of any recovery he might obtain as administrator of his wife’s estate under the Survival Act is now prematurely raised, and the court below properly granted a new trial so that the right of the estate of Leticia M. Dye to recover damages from either Fisher, or her husband, or both, can be determined without regard to the ultimate disposition of the proceeds of any recovery that may be made. Thus it may be found by the jury that her estate, for any one or more of several possible reasons, <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>is not entitled to recover any damages,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and, even if there should he such a recovery, it may be that she did in fact have creditors (this can only be determined in a proper proceeding in the Orphans’ Court), and there is also a suggestion in the record that her husband is <em>not her </em>only heir but that her father is still living, in which case, of course, the latter would be entitled to a share of her estate. The sole question in these negligence actions is whether her estate is entitled to recover the loss it has sustained by reason of her death; it is only in proceedings in the Orphans’ Court that the proper distribution of the proceeds of any recovery can be determined, and therefore the question as to Avhether the decedent’s husband would be entitled to participate in such recovery must wait for determination until such proceedings have been properly instituted and conducted. This was the conclusion reached in <em>Burns v. Goldberg, </em><a href="/f2d/210/0646-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="210 F.2d 646" data-case-ids="554486" data-case-paths="/f2d/210/0646-01">210 F. 2d 646</a>, Avhere, in the course of an able opinion by Judge Hastie, it was said (p. 650) : “It does not folloAV . . . that the normal survival recovery itself should be reduced in any Avay because part of it may ultimately pass to the negligent husband through operation of the laws of succession. It is the invasion of the interest of the decedent which finds redress in this action. Hence damages are viewed and measured in terms of loss suffered by the decedent. The survival of such an action finds primary justification in the protection it affords creditors. It also serves to some de<a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>gree as a means of assuring that the distributable estate shall include some present value in lieu of what the deceased might have been expected to accumulate during a normal lifetime. Thus, the policy underlying such a recovery does not yield any implication concerning either the eligibility or the disqualification of anyone as a participant in the ultimate distribution of the- net estate. Indeed, any such question is premature in the survival action. The appropriate forum is the Orphans’ Court at whatever time the matter of distribution of the decedent’s estate shall be in issue. Cf. Moore v. Prudential Ins. Co., 1941, <a href="/pa/342/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="342 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1206940" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0570-01">342 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.2d%2042" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="21 A.2d 42">21 A. 2d 42</a>; Pantazis v.

Our conclusion is that the husband’s negligence does not in any way reduce the recovery of the administratrix in the survival action.”</p>

Fisher as defendant and himself as additional defendant, the court was clearly justified in also granting a motion of Fisher for a new trial in his action against Dye, and a new trial on its own motion in the case of Dye v. Fisher. It is obvious that, if only one of the three suits were to be retried, the result might be inconsistent with the verdicts previously rendered in the other actions. The factual issue involved in all three is whether Dye, or Fisher, or both, were negligent, and the determination of that question necessarily governs the result that should follow in each and all of them. As stated in <em>Liebendofer v. Wilson, </em><a href="/pa-super/175/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="175 Pa.
