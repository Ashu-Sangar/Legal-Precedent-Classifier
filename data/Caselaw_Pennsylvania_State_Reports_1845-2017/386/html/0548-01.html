The will is, in many respects, a remarkable document; it was prepared with the aid of William J. Duane, distinguished leader of the bar in 1ns day, and was the product of protracted consultations between them which extended over the course of some five or six weeks. Briefly summarized, it provided, after making a number of specific gifts to various institutions and individuals, for a devise and bequest of his entire residuary estate to “The Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of Philadelphia”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> their successors and assigns, in trust to erect a “college” on a square of ground between High and Chestnut Streets and 11th and 12th Streets, in the City of Philadelphia (by a codicil he changed this location to an estate he had purchased on “the Bidge Boad in Penn Township.”). He stated that “I am particularly desirous to provide for such a number of poor male white orphan children, as can be trained in one institution, a better education as well as a more comfortable maintenance than they usually receive from the application of the public funds”. He provided for the selection of a competent number of instructors, teachers, assistants and other necessary agents, and that as many poor white male orphans, between the ages of six and ten years as the <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>income should be adequate to maintain, should be admitted into the college, preference being given first to orphans born in the City of Philadelphia, secondly, to those born in any other part of Pennsylvania, thirdly, to those born in the City of New York, and lastly, to those born in the City of New Orleans. He provided that the orphans admitted into the college should be “there fed with plain but wholesome food, clothed with plain but decent apparel (no distinctive dress ever to be worn) and lodged in a plain but safe manner”; due regard was to be paid to their health, and to that end they were to have suitable exercise and recreation, and he prescribed in detail the branches of education in which they should be instructed. He declared that “together with the object just adverted to [that is, the provision for the poor male white orphans], I have sincerely at heart the welfare of the City of Philadelphia, and, as a part of it, am desirous to improve the neighborhood of the River Delaware . . .”, and accordingly, he bequeathed out of the residue the sum of $500,000 in trust to pave Delaware Avenue and Water Street and to make certain other improvements in that part of the city. After a bequest to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of $300,000 he left the remainder of his residuary estate in trust to apply the income to the further improvement and maintenance of the college, to enable the city to provide for a competent police force, and to improve the property and general appearance of the city. He stated that “To all which objects, the prosperity of the City, and the health and comfort of its inhabitants, I devote the said fund as aforesaid, and direct the income thereof to be applied yearly and every year for ever — after providing for the College as hereinbefore directed, as my primary object.” If the city should knowingly and wilfully violate any of the conditions in the will, the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>said remainder of the residue was given to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the purposes of internal navigation, except that the income from his real estate in Philadelphia was to be forever applied to the maintenance of the college; if the Commonwealth failed to apply the bequest to the purposes mentioned, the said remainder was given to the United States of America for the purposes of internal navigation. There was a provision in the will that the city should keep separate accounts of the trust funds, which were not to be used for any but the prescribed purposes, and should furnish an annual account thereof to the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[168,1095,1151,1292]],["BL_586.1",586,[260,347,1159,1115]]]'>Because of the financial panic of 1837 and the consequent shrinkage of the assets of the estate there was some delay in the construction of the buildings and the college was not opened until January 1, 1848. Since that time, a period now of over a hundred years, it has been conducted in conformity with the purposes expressed in Girard’s will. As is not altogether unusual in such cases, some of his heirs were disappointed at the disposition he made of his wealth, and accordingly they indulged in a number of attacks upon the validity of the will, the first of which resulted in the famous argument in the Supreme Court of the United States in 1844 between Daniel Webster on the one side and Horace Binney on the other. Two main questions were there involved, one, whether the city had the legal power to accept the trust confided to it, and the other, whether the trust in regard to the college was rendered invalid by a provision in the will that no ecclesiastic, missionary or minister of any sect whatsoever, should ever hold or exercise any station or duty whatever in the college, nor be admitted there for any purpose. (Girard carefully explained in his will that he made this provision because, there being <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>a multitude of sects, lie did not wish to expose the orphan children to any doctrinal or sectarian controversies.) The legislature, by Acts of March 24, 1832, P. L. 176, and April 4, 1832, P. L. 275, had provided the necessary legislation for the improvement by the city of Delaware Avenue and Water Street, and had provided further that it should be lawful for the city to enact all such ordinances and do all such acts as might be necessary and convenient for the full and entire acceptance and execution of all the bequests, trusts and provisions in Girard’s will, and for the appointment of such agents as might be deemed essential to the execution of the trusts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Supreme Court held in <em>Vidal et al. v. Stephen Girard’s Executors, </em>43 U. S. (2 Howard) 127, in an elaborate opinion by Mr. Justice Story, that the city was legally capable of taking the bequest of the estate for the erection and support of the college upon the trusts designated in the will, and that these were valid charitable trusts and capable of being carried into legal effect.</p>
    <p id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.4",586,[255,1475,1157,669]],["BL_587.1",587,[155,334,1157,1462]]]'>In <em>Girard v. Philadelphia, </em>74 U. S. (7 Wallace) 1, the decision in the <em>Vidal </em>case was affirmed, and it was held that the Consolidation Act had not changed the identity of the city so as to affect in any way its administration of the trust. The Court stated (as will be referred to again hereafter) : “Now, if this were true [that the city had become unable to administer the trust] the only consequence would be, not that the charities or trust should fail, but that the chancellor should substitute another trustee.” In <em>The City of Philadelphia v. The Heirs of Stephen Girard, </em><a href="/pa/45/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="45 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="9502081" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0009-01">45 Pa. 9</a>, our own Court likewise held that the trusts created <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>in the will were valid, and pointed ont that the distinction must carefully be observed between the purposes and provisions of the trust itself and any problems or difficulties arising from the mode of its administration, the former not being affected by the latter; attention was called to the important fact that Girard stated that it was his “primary object” to construct and maintain the college. In <em>Philadelphia v. Fox, </em><a href="/pa/64/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="64 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1021273" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0169-01">64 Pa. 169</a>, it was once again held that Philadelphia could act as a trustee to carry out the trusts under Girard’s will, and that the Act of June 30, 1869, P. L. 1276, providing for the administration by a Board of Directors of City Trusts of the trusts confided to the city, the Board being “dissociated from the general government of the city,” ivas a valid enactment. And finally, in <em>Girard’s Appeal, </em>4 Pennypacker 347, dealing with another attack on the will by Girard’s heirs, it was held that they were concluded by the decree of the United States Supreme Court in the <em>Vidal </em>case, and that the establishment of the Board of Directors of City Trusts was legal and proper. All these onslaughts in both the Courts of Pennsylvania and of the United States left the Girard charity, as was said by the Court in <em>Benjamin Franklin’s Administratrix v. The City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pa.%20D.%20435" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Pa. D. 435">2 Dist.

It is contended that the Fourteenth Amendment has made the <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>restriction to white children unconstitutional. The city, the Commonwealth, and two negro applicants for admission to the institution, have filed petitions for a citation on the Board of Directors of City Trusts to show cause why these applicants should not be admitted. The court affirmed the Board’s refusal of the applications for admission and dismissed the petitions for a citation.</p>

By that act he makes a law for the disposition of his own property, acquired by his own industry, which, if it does not contradict the law of the country, has hitherto been considered inviolate. Shall it be so considered no longer in Pennsylvania ?” Equally cogent language is to be found in many other cases in this Court, for example, in <em>Ervine’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/16/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="16 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="410246" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0256-01">16 Pa. 256</a>, 265, and again in <em>Cauffman v.

No right is more solemnly assured to him by the law. Nor does it depend in any sense upon the judicious exercise of it. . . . In many instances testamentary dispositions of property seem harsh, if not unjust, ... It is doubtless true that narrow prejudice sometimes interferes with the wisdom of such arrangements. This is due to the imperfections of our human nature. It must be remembered that in this country a man’s prejudices are a part of his liberty. ... he is entitled to the control of his property while living, and by will to direct its use after his death, subject only to such restrictions as are imposed by law.” In <em>Dulles’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/218/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="218 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="999587" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0162-01">218 Pa. 162</a>, 163, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.%2049" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="67 A. 49">67 A. 49</a>, it was said: “The fundamental law of Pennsylvania in regard to property, which ought not to require restatement as often as it does, is that the owner may do as he pleases with it provided the disposition be not to unlawful purposes, and what he may do himself he may do by agent while living, or by executor after death.” In <em>McCown v.

Admittedly there are provisions in the will which represent Girard’s individual views regarding the education and rearing of the children the wisdom of which might be subject to differences of opinion, but, even if those provisions be considered peculiar, Girard was entitled to prescribe them for the operation of the institution which he was founding.</p>

No such question could possibly arise in the case of a private charitable trust for the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to agencies of the State or of a municipality within the State; it is directed solely against State, not individual, action. It was said in the <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em><a href="/us/109/0003-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="109 U.S. 3" data-case-ids="8181" data-case-paths="/us/109/0003-01">109 U.

Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the Amendment.’ ... It is obvious that none of these Amendments prohibited private individuals from entering into contracts respecting the control and disposition of their own property; . . . .” In <em>Shelley v. Kraemer, </em><a href="/us/334/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="334 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6157293" data-case-paths="/us/334/0001-01">334 U.

S. 3</a> (1883), the principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.” And in <em>Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, </em><a href="/us/349/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="349 U.S. 70" data-case-ids="11333480" data-case-paths="/us/349/0070-01">349 U.

Only if a State deprives any person or denies Mm enforcement of a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment can its protection be invoked.” And Avhile it Avould no doubt constitute “State action” for a court to enforce a restriction or discrimination invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, the restrictive provisions themselves, as was said in <em>Shelley v. Kraemer, </em><a href="/us/334/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="334 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6157293" data-case-paths="/us/334/0001-01">supra</a> (p. 13), “cannot be regarded as violative of any rights guaranteed to petitioners by the Fourteenth Amendment. So long as the purposes of those [provisions] . . . are effectuated by Amluntary adherence to their terms, it Avould appear clear that there has been no action by the State and <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>the provisions of the Amendment have not been violated.” It is perfectly clear, therefore, that private trusts for charitable purposes, not being subject to or controlled by “State action,” are wholly beyond the orbit of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such trusts abound in overwhelming numbers and there can be no question as to their legality however limited be the class of their beneficiaries or whatever be the nature or basis of their restrictions; charitable trusts for limited groups, whether racial or religious, are as valid as if for all the people of the world. We have charitable trusts for ministers of various church denominations, for foreign missions, for churches, priests, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, whites, negroes, for relief of the Indians, for widows or orphan children of Masons or other fraternities, for sectarian old folks homes, orphanages, and so on. Certainly no one would contend that a donor or a testator could not establish a charity, the beneficiaries of which were to be those whom he designated, — persons of any prescribed race, creed or color, or however otherwise differentiated. The court is concerned only with the legal right of such selection by a donor or testator and not with whatever illiberalism he may display in his exercise of the right.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

It is true that Girard appointed the City of Philadelphia as the trustee to administer the trust according to the terms of his will, but he certainly did not intend thereby to empower it to conduct such administration in its <em>public or governmental capacity, </em>or to bring into play any of its <em>proprietary </em>rights since it is merely the title holder of Girard’s property and not its beneficial owner. As a <em>trustee </em>it was to act and could act only in a <em>fiduciary </em>capacity, exercising no State or governmental function or power in the slightest degree, but being limited to the same rights, powers and duties, no more and no less, as those of any private individual or trust company acting as trustee.'1 If it were to be held that the city was acting in a public or governmental capacity instead of merely as a fiduciary, and therefore was engaged in “State action,” it could legislate; it could change the plans, structure and terms of the entire will; it could provide for co-education instead of the beneficiaries being limited to males; it could prescribe a different age limit instead of the children being confined to those between six and ten years of age; it could provide that not only orphans but <em>all </em>children should enjoy the benefit of the charity; it could, in short, assume to exercise the same complete, unrestricted control over the college as if it were a <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>
      <em>public </em>institution. In fact the college is solely responsible for its own policies and management. Its employes are not employes of the city but of the trust estate. All provisions of the will show that it was not intended to be a public school; indeed, it is not merely a school at all but what Girard himself called in a codicil to his will, an “Orphan Establishment,” a home where the fatherless boys eat, sleep, study and live together, enjoying the testator’s bounty which provides for them not only an education but also lodging, board, clothing and all the necessities of life. \The situation, therefore, is not to be confused with the so-called de-segregation cases which dealt Avith public schools Avhere no discrimination in respect to race, creed or color, as the United States Supreme Court has decided, is permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment. Girard College is a comparatively large institution, but no different legal principles apply to it for that reason than to the smallest of private schools. It is erected on land owned by Girard and the buildings were constructed Avith his own funds (cf. <em>Reuben Quick Bear v. Leupp, Commissioner of Indian </em>Affairs, <a href="/us/210/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="210 U.S. 50" data-case-ids="3651379" data-case-paths="/us/210/0050-01">210 U. S. 50</a>, Avhere the Commissioner was alloAved to contract Avith a sectarian mission for the education of Indian pupils supported by trust funds belonging to their OAvn tribe.) ¿The college has been supported and maintained for iioav over a century by Girard’s estate; not a penny,,of State.jar city money has ever gone into it no;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> taxpayer has ever been called upon to contribute to it; true, it is exempt from local taxation, but so are all other charities even <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>though restricted as to their beneficiaries and managed by private trustees. It is contended that, because Girard’s will provided that the funds of the trust should be held and invested by the city treasurer and that an annual financial accounting should be presented to the legislature, this pointed to a public institution, but this argument loses sight of the fact that the will provided that none of the monies of the trust were at any time to apply to any other purposes than those prescribed by the testator and that separate accounts distinct from any other accounts of the city should be kept by it; it must also be remembered that the city in its own right was a secondary beneficiary of part of Girard’s residuary estate, so that it had an independent interest of its own to protect, wholly apart from its status as fiduciary. Petitioners point out that two of the provisions of Girard’s will have in fact been disregarded by the courts, the one, that no part of his real estate in Pennsylvania should ever be sold but should be rented out from time to time on leases not exceeding five years. It is true that there were some sales made under the authority of the Orphans’ Court but only because the income of the trust had shrunk to a point where the college could not be efficiently maintained and therefore the sales were the only recourse open in order to preserve the purposes of the trust; this was purely an administrative matter, sanctioned by law, and involving no change or violation whatever of any of the substantive provisions or objects of the trust, and the same is true of the. authority given by the court to execute leases for fifteen years of certain mine properties, it having been found impossible to secure good tenants on shortdr term leases.</p>

From that time on the Girard trust estate, as well as all the other charitable trusts of which the city is the trustee, has been managed exclusively by this Board.

It is of interest to note that if the city itself had considered the Board to be an agency of its public government and subject to its control it could, and no doubt would, have exercised its resulting authority by directing the Board to admit these applicants to the collegia, instead of which, recognizing that it was merely a fiduciary, it petitioned the Orphans’ Court for that purpose. And it is further to be observed, in that same connection, that the Board filed an Answer to the city’s Petition, thus evidencing the complete severance between the city in its ordinary municipal or governmental capacity and the Board of Directors of City Trusts administering the trusts confided to the city as trustee.</p>

If the city, because bound in its public or governmental actions by the inhibition imposed upon it by the Fourteenth Amendment, cannot carry out a provision of Girard’s will in regard to the beneficiaries of the charity as prescribed by him, the law is clear that the remedy is, not to change that provision, which, as an individual, he had a perfect right to prescribe, but for the Orphans’ Court, which has final jurisdiction over the trust which he created, to appoint another trustee. It is hornbook law, pronounced over and over again by the decisions of this court and presumably by those of all other jurisdictions, that, as stated in <em>Girard v. Philadelphia, </em>74 U. S. (7 Wallace) 1, 13: “Now, if this were true [that the city could not act as trustee] the only consequence would be, not that the charities or trust should fail, but that the chancellor should substitute another .trustee.” Already in the first attack on the trust the Supreme Court in <em>Vidal et al. v. Stephen Girard’s Executors, </em>43 U. S. (2 Howard) 127, 188, had said: “It is true that, if .the trust be repugnant to, or inconsistent with the proper <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>purposes for which the corporation [here the City of Philadelphia] was created, that may furnish a ground why it may not be compellable to execute it. But that will furnish no ground to declare the trust itself void, if otherwise unexceptionable; but it will simply require a new trustee to be substituted by the proper court, possessing equity jurisdiction, to enforce and perfect the objects of the trust.” The incompetency of a trustee does not destroy the trust nor affect its validity or enforceability. No bequest or devise for a charitable use is void or in any manner impaired because given to a person or corporation incapable, for any reason, of acting as trustee or carrying out its terms; in such a case it is for the court to appoint a trustee to administer its provisions: <em>Frazier, Trustee v. St. Luke’s Church, </em><a href="/pa/147/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="147 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="829769" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0256-01">147 Pa. 256</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.%20442" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="23 A. 442">23 A. 442</a>. It was stated in the opinion in that case (p. 260, A. p. 442) that the 10th section of the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 331, that “no disposition of property hereafter made for any religious, charitable, literary or scientific use, shall fail for want of a trustee, . . . but it shall be the duty of the orphans’ court, or court having equity jurisdiction in the proper county, to supply a trustee, . . .” was “merely declaratory of the law as it had existed and been enforced by the courts of chancery in England for hundreds of years.” In <em>Toner’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/260/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="260 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1040280" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0049-01">260 Pa. 49</a>, 54, 55, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.%20541" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="103 A. 541">103 A. 541</a>, 543, it was said: “It is a cardinal maxim in the courts of chancery, upon this subject, that a trust will not fail for want of a [faithful] trustee,” citing many cases.

Not only is this, at best, mere speculation, but the most casual consideration of the terms of the will shows that the exact opposite is the truth. Who can tell better than Girard himself what his “dominant” purpose was? In his will he said, “I am <em>particularly desirous </em>to provide for such a number of poor male white orphan children, as can be trained in one institution, a better education as well as a more comfortable maintenance than they usually receive from the application of the public funds”. And he further said, after speaking of his devotion of the fund to the prosperity of the city, that this was to take place only “after providing for the College as hereinbefore directed, <em>as my primary </em>objectHis <em>secondary </em>objects, as he stated them, were the improvement of the city’s police force, the property and general appearance of the city, and the diminution of the burden of taxation. He provided that even if the city should violate any of the conditions of the will the income from his real estate in the City of Philadelphia was nevertheless to be forever applied to maintain the college. His voice therefore, on this point, speaks from the grave. Indeed, if specula<a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>tion were to be indulged in, it is obvious that he wished the institution he was creating to be perpetual, — in fact he says so, — and that therefore he required a perpetual trustee, hut at that time there were no trust companies, such as those with which we are now so familiar, existing in Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Accordingly, if he wanted, as he undoubtedly did, to obtain an immortal trustee, he had no other resource but to choose the City of Philadelphia. Incidentally, appellants have apparently not been able to find any case — they have cited none — where the identity of the named trustee was held to be more important than that of the beneficiaries of the trust as provided in the deed or will.</p>

As previously stated, they belittle the importance in Girard’s mind of this provision, claiming that the ony reason for it was that at the time he executed his will negroes were slaves and therefore it never occurred to him that they could or should he admitted into such an orphanage or educational institution. However, slavery had been abolished in Pennsylvania by the Act of March 1, 1780, 1 Bm. L. 492, and there were said to be at that time 15,000 negroes in Philadelphia who were free, not slaves. There is no need whatever in the present case for the application of the doctrine of cy pres, because that doctrine applies only if it has become impossible or impracticable to carry out the objects of a trust; here there is no such situation for the trust can he enforced according <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>to its literal terms as it lias been for well over a hundred years. To continue to execute it in compliance with the exact directions of Girard’s will has not become either impossible or impractical, nor, as has been pointed out, illegal. There is no shortage of poor white male orphans between the ages of six and ten; on the contrary there are more qualified applicants than can be accommodated. To sanction a change of the express terms of the will of Stephen Girard, in which he exercised his inalienable right to declare who the beneficiaries of his charity were to be, would, in the opinion of the court, be a wholly unwarranted and improper decision, unjustified by any principle of applicable law.</p>

Indeed, the public or common school, as Ave knoAV it today, dates only from 1840. For generations all Americans — including those who fought for liberty and independence in the eighteenth century, and Avho drafted the Declaration of Independence, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, and the Constitution of the United States — Avere educated in private or religious schools, and mostly the latter. Perhaps no institution is older or a more intimate part of our colonial and national life than religious schools and colleges, both Catholic and Protestant. The private and religious schools have been the laboratories in which educational methods have been worked out and pedagogic progress accomplished from the very beginning of our history. Out of them have developed, or to them is due, our greatest colleges and universities, the most important of them to this day being private or religious institutions. In more recent times commonwealth colleges and universities have groAvn up.

On whose will shall the hand of legislative innovation next be laid? . . . <em>What private charity will next be disturbed and invaded? </em>The will of Stephen Girard offers a conspicuous mark.

At the age of 14, he, like his father who was a mariner, took to the sea and made several voyages to the West Indies. When only 23, he became a duly licensed ship’s captain, and sailed into many ports of the world. He first touched at American soil (San Domingo) in February, 1774, and in July of that year brought his ship for the first time to a North American continental port (New Yorlx). Then in May, 1777, he entered the waters of the Delaware and dropped anchor off Philadelphia’s shores. He was never again to return to his original homeland. He rented a store on Water Street of that city and entered into business.</p>

During the epidemic of the yellow fever in 1783 and again in 1797-8, Stephen Girard aided the sick, comforted the dying, and made liberal contributions to the funds required in fighting the ravages of the pestilence which gripped Philadelphia in a threatening catastrophe. For his benevolent services in these trying periods of the city’s history he was honored by his fellow-citizens with testimonials and public laudation.</p>

For several weeks the testator and scrivener toiled together and by February 16, 1830, there came to light a document of 35 pages which, through litigation, commentary, and application to the works announced therein, has inspired tens of thousands of pages of writing. In this document which disposed of his riches, Stephen Girard was just and generous to relatives who would survive Ms death, but he stopped short of the thought that they merited the lion’s share of his financial empire. An avid reader of Voltaire’s writings and other philosophical works, he believed that one’s own community and mankind itself deserved a place in the sunshine of the good fortune which had blessed him in the gilded days of his profitable career. Thus, he bestowed on the City of Philadelphia and its people gifts which were more reminiscent of the largesse of a rich, benevolent city father than the munificence of a private citizen. For instance, he set aside funds with which to establish a competent police force, he bequeathed money for the gargantuan task of removing wooden buildings from the limits of the city, he provided for the paving and widening of certain streets, he supplied means for cleaning and keeping clean the city’s docks on the Delaware, and redistribution of .the waters o.f the Schuylkill Biver within <em>the </em>city limits.

However, as appreciative as he was of what the State and City had offered him in the way of opportunity, he was pragmatic enough to realize that even philanthropy calls for rigid organization and supervision. It also in some ways requires sanctions.

It will be recalled that Mr. Girard bequeathed $300,000 to the Commonwealth. This legacy was conditioned upon the Commonwealth’s enactment of the legislation necessary to permit Philadelphia to perform the cleaning, building, paving and other operations he had outlined. Stephen Girard also provided that if the City of Philadelphia did not carry out his wishes with regard to the Girard College, the residue of his estate (the $2,000,000 and accumulations) would go to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for internal navigation; and if the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania failed to “apply this or the preceding bequest to the purposes before mentioned,” the money in that event would pass to the United States for the purposes of internal navigation.</p>

With the exception of the fact that Stephen Girard originally supplied the funds for the founding of the institution there is not one item in the whole 125-year history of Girard College to support the contention that it is a private institution.

Because of the pains taken, the time spent, and the wisdom exercised by the City of Philadelphia acting through its designated officials, the Girard estate, after a perilous escape from a near-foundering, has sailed on to fortune, having now an appraised value of $98,000,000. Its real property alone is worth over $10,000,000. And it must not be overlooked in this connection that the Girard estate did not have to pay commissions on income and capital gains, which it most assuredly would have had to do if the trustees had been private trustees instead of governmental agencies.</p>

Fox, <a href="/pa/64/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="178" data-cite="64 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1021273" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0169-01">64 Pa. 169</a>, where the policy it represented was described (p. 183) as 'having such a board dissociated from the general government of the city’ But the Majority only released part of the quotation. The whole passage reads as follows: “We have nothing to do with the wisdom of the measure — with the policy of having such a board dissociated from the general government of the city, or with the mode of its selection. Those are questions exclusively for the legislature. No one I think can doubt that it was entirely competent for that authority to vest the entire management and control of all municipal affairs in just such a body as that constituted by this act. If they could do the gréater, they can do the less. They could make a similar provision for any other department of the municipality. They might es<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>tablish a board of police, of highways, of sewerage, of cleansing.” It will be seen that in the <em>Fox </em>case the Court equated the Board of City Trusts with a municipal board of police or a board of highways. How can one fail to see that when the Court there spoke of a board “dissociated from the general government,” it meant something dissociated from sovereign authority? If it had meant what the Majority here wants to try to have it mean, the Court would never have included a board of police as an illustration because a board of police is certainly part of the municipal government.</p>

If it had lingered a little longer in discussion with that epochal decision, it might have concluded that in reality it is decisive of the question before us. For Instance, Justice Sharswoop, who wrote the decision, said: “Such a municipal corporation may be a trustee, under the grant or will of an individual or private corporation, but <em>only </em>as it seems <em>for public purposes, germane to its objects </em>. . . I am aware that it has been said by high authority in England that it may take and hold in trust for purposes altogether private . . . But the administration of such trusts, and the consequent liabilities incurred, are altogether inconsistent with the public duties imposed upon the municipality.” If this Court follows the <em>Fox </em>case, and it is bound to do so since the Majority cites it favorably, it cannot possibly declare the Board of City Trusts to be engaged in administering a private trust. A municipal corporation, as Justice Siiarswood stressed, may only be a trustee where the grant has to do with <em>a public purpose, </em>germane to the object of the corporation. Justice Siiarswood said further: “When, therefore, the donors or testators of these charitable funds granted or devised them in trust <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>to the municipality, they must be held to have done so with the full knowledge that their trustee so selected was a mere <em>creature of the state, an agent acting under a revocable power </em>... It is surely not competent for a mere municipal organization, which is made a trustee of a charity, to set up a vested right in that character to maintain such organization in the form in which it existed when the trust was created, and thereby prevent the state from changing it as the public interests may require”.</p>

Stephen Girard specifically announced in Article XX of his will: “So far as regards my real estate in Pennsylvania, in trust, that <em>no fart thereof </em>shall ever be sold or alienated”. But real estate belonging to the Girard estate has been sold. The Majority Opinion here, in affirming the lower Court’s Opinion, seeks to explain this diametrical defiance of Mr. Girard’s specific request by saying: “It is true that there were some sales made under the authority of the Orphans’ Court but only because the income of the trust had shrunk to a point where the college could not be efficiently maintained and therefore the sales were the only recourse open in order to preserve the purposes of the trust; this was purely an administrative matter, sanctioned by law”.

He desired a government trustee because he knew that government activities are more exposed to public scrutiny than private enterprises and that, under the spotlight of public attention, there would be less chance for corruption, inertia, and mismanagement to worm their way into the trust estate and eat out its substance. Girard was so determined that the whole project be governmental that he directed that if the City of Philadelphia failed to carry out his instructions, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would become the successor in title, and if the Commonwealth was also indifferent to its obligations under the will, the estate would then become the property of the United States of America. What more could a person do to demonstrate the undeviating public character of the trust?</p>

But only that no ecclesiastic of any sect shall hold or exercise any station or duty in the college. Why may not the Bible, and especially the New Testament, without note or comment, be read and taught as a divine revelation, in the College — its general precepts expounded, its evidences explained, and its glorious principles of morality inculcated?” In fact, Stephen Girard specifically declared in his will: “My desire is, that all the instructors and teachers in the college shall take pains to instil into the minds of the scholars the purest principles of morality, so that, on their entrance into active life, they may, from inclination and habit, evince benevolence towards their fellow creatures, and a love of truth, sobriety and industry, <em>adopting at the same time such religious tenets as their matured reason may enable them to prefer.”</em>

It cannot seriously be maintained that Stephen Girard himself could build a college large enough to house all the poor white orphan boys in Philadelphia, New York, and New Orleans. Even if he limited himself to the numbers suggested by the Majority, there would still be left countless numbers of boys that could not enjoy his limited fortune. Stephen Girard’s restriction, therefore, was not based on the proposition of accommodating numbers of children to quantity of dollars. The limitation indicated was merely an expression of Mr. Girard’s determination to help as many as he could on the thoroughfare of life, just as one might build a fountain along the road to refresh such travellers who came that way, without intending that the whole world should bend its steps toward that particular highway in order to obtain a draught of water.</p>

On the contrary, it is impossible to conjure up a more obvious public trust than this one.

We are speaking here, not of private charitable trusts; we are speaking of public charitable trusts <em>administered by the </em>government! In every reference to the Girard charity trust, there must be added in assumed parentheses the limitation: Charitable Trust administered, controlled and directed by the State, which of course, makes the trust something quite different from the charity which the Majority is defending, but which needs no defense because it is not being attacked by anyone.</p>

The Majority Opinion defends, defends and defends a cathedral in the wilderness near which, in the whole century-old litigation over the Girard estate, not a hostile arrow has fallen. Certainly there can be a charitable trust for Indians, but to say that such a trust administered by the government may legally and constitutionally deny Indians any of the provisions of the Bill of Eights or of the Fourteenth Amendment is to pose what everyone knows to be insupportable.</p>

But how else can a City act except in its public or governmental capacity? A City is not like an individual citizen. It is the composite of all the citizens: it speaks and acts for everyone within its boundaries. The Majority says that the City is not the beneficial owner of the trust estate. It is indeed a beneficial owner. It is accepting the benefits of an obligation which otherwise it would have to discharge, namely, educating the children who are actually in Girard College.</p>

The Girard College has a board of directors made up of the Mayor of Philadelphia, the President of City Council, and twelve members appointed by the Courts of Common Pleas. This Board thus represents the body politic, the public, the citizenry of the County of Philadelphia, a sovereign subdivision of the sovereign State. Since our judges are elected by the people, as are the Mayor and President of City Council, the Board of City Trusts is therefore an expression of the people themselves. The private school, on the other hand, is strictly a private commercial enterprise run for profit. The legal principles which control Girard College are separated by a chasm as wide as the constitution itself from a private school owned by private individuals, and run by private individuals, all for the monetary advantage of private individuals. Private schools receive no tax exemption. For that reason alone the legal principles which guide their destiny are quite different from those which apply to Girard College which enjoys a tax exemption annually of §550,700. <em>(Ogontz School </em>

Who can calculate the cost to the State of the printing, clerk hire, and secretarial service which went into the actions of the General Assembly in holding hearings, conducting investigations, drafting bills and enacting them into law?
