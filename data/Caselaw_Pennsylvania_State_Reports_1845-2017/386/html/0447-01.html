Miss Puccinelli contends that the agreement for support of Fessman’s son terminated upon Fessman’s death, and that she was entitled to one-half of his residuary estate. The Court interpreted Fessman’s letter of July 15, 1952 (in conjunction with certain oral testimony) to impose a liability upon the father to support his son during minority; and awarded to Mrs. Fessman arrearages for the support of their son, and a large sum to a trustee to pay for the support of the son $100. a month from Fessman’s death on October 11, 1954.</p>
