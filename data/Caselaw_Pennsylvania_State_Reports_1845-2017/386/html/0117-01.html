It was pending there when, because of the evident public importance of the issue involved and the desirability of a conclusive decision thereon at the earliest possible date, the Attorney General, representing all of the defendants, requested us by petition to certiorari the record here for our original and final disposition. Counsel for the plaintiff having joined in the Attorney General’s request, a special certiorari was accordingly issued. The case has since been ably argued before us by respective counsel.

Watson, was appointed on March 4, 1952, by the then Governor of the Commonwealth as a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission for the term expiring on June 4, 1961. The appointment was duly confirmed by the Senate. The appointee was sworn in as a member of the Commission and thereupon assumed the discharge of the duties of his office. On or about December 7, 1955, the other members of the Turnpike Commission (being the individual defendants herein) excluded the plaintiff from all meetings of the Commission and divested him of all authority to perform any official acts for or on behalf of the Commission as a member thereof. They averred that they had so acted because, on December <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>6, 1955, the Governor, acting in reliance on the authority vested in him, as the appointing power, by Article VI, Section 4, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and, in the absence of any other provision in the law relating to the removal of a Commissioner, had removed the plaintiff from office and had given written notice thereof to the plaintiff who had acknowledged in writing his receipt of the notice. On December 20, 1955, the plaintiff instituted the present action in an effort to obtain a judgment against the defendants requiring them to accord to him the duties, rights, privileges and emoluments of a commissioner for the term for which he was appointed and also a money judgment against the Turnpike Commission for the amount of his unpaid salary from December 1, 1955.</p>

The legislature may very well say that it is desirable that certain officers should be appointed but, for reasons which it deems sufficient, they should not be subjected to removal at pleasure and, if so minded, the legislature may of course provide for such officers, the Constitution containing no provision to the contrary.” No extended reasoning is required to make plain that <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>legislatively annexed conditions of tenure may determine the method of removal of an appointee of the related legislatively created office.</p>

But, the Act expressly and definitely annexed conditions to the tenure of the four appointed members of the Commission (the Secretary of Highways is ex officio the fifth member) with the result that they are not removable at the pleasure of the Governor under the power conferred on him by Article VI, Section 4, of the Constitution.

The Act expressly provides that three members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum who, for all purposes, shall act unanimously. Were the Commissioners to be held removable at the pleasure of the Governor, the carefully expressed scheme of term rotation would be effectually nullified. If it be countered that the Governor, in appointing to a vacancy created by his dismissal of a Commissioner, would respect the spirit of the Act and appoint a successor for the balanee of the unexpired term, of the dismissed Commissioner, the answer is that the power so attributed to the Governor would still violate the plain intendment of the Act. He could render all of the offices vacant at one time which, obviously, the Act was specifically designed to make impossible. To urge that such a situation would never be provoked is irrelevant to the question of the power of the Governor in the premises as affected by the Act creating the office and prescribing the tenure therefor.

However, the decision in the <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>
      <em>Benn </em>case was that the Commissioners were veritably the deputies of the legislature for the more efficient exercise of the purely legislative function of regulating public service companies; that the legislature was the real appointive power, the Governor merely acting as a convenient agent of the legislature in nominating them; and that, in the Act of 1913, supra, the legislature evidenced an intention to retain control over the removal of the Commissioners when it provided that they could be removed by the Governor by and with the consent of the Senate for cause. It seems plain enough that, had the legislature intended that the Governor, as the designated appointor of the Commissioners, could also remove them <em>at Ms pleasure </em>by virtue of Article VI, Section 4, of the Constitution, the provision prescribing the method of their removal for cause would in practical effect be a superfluity.</p>

Thus, the <em>Benn </em>case was truly <em>sui generis </em>because of the Public Service Commission’s special relationship to the legislature as its continuing and active agent. The legislature was not, therefore, to be deemed to have abdicated to the Governor control of the removal of its deputies from their exercise of the State’s police power,, in relevant regard, which only the legislature or its authoritatively designated agent, the Public Service Commission, was competent to exercise. We note, in passing, that the Public Service Company Láw of 1913 likewise provided for a rotation in the terms of office of the Commissioners which was not referred to in the <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>opinion in the <em>Berm </em>case, being unnecessary to the decision.</p>

    <p id="Aut" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[167,840,1150,1434]]]'>On April 4, 1952, Governor John S. Fine, acting under the authority of the Act of 1937, May 21, P. L. 774, appointed David E. Watson as a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission for a term expiring on June 4, 1961. On December 6, 1955, Governor George M. Leader, acting under the authority of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, Article VT, Section 4, dismissed David E. Watson as a member of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. The majority of this court have in today’s decision reinstated David E. Watson to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. I dissent from that action because it runs counter to the crystalline-clear language of the Pennsylvania Constitution which says: “All officers shall hold their offices on the condition that they behave themselves well while in office, and shall be removed on conviction of misbehavior in office or of any infamous crime. <em>Appointed </em>officers, <em>other than judges of the courts of record arid the Superintendent of Public </em>Instruction, <em>may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall home been appointed. </em>All officers elected by the people, except Governor, Lieutenant Governor, members of the General Assembly and judges of the courts of record learned in the law, shall be removed by the Governor for reasonable cause, after due notice and full hearing, on the address of two-thirds of the Senate.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a>

      <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>It was argued by the plaintiff in this case that the Governor, in appointing Watson, was merely acting as agent for the Pennsylvania Legislature on the theory that the Turnpike Commission has been assigned legislative functions by the General Assembly. The Majority very properly rejects this argument and holds that the power which appointed Watson was the power of the Chief Executive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a> However, although the Majority concedes that -the appointment was made by the Governor and not by the Legislature, it holds that the Governor has no power to dismiss his appointees to the Commission. The Majority points out that the authority in Article XII, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which confers on the Legislature the power to provide for the election and appointment of officers other than those created by the Constitution, embraces and implies legislative power to annex conditions of tenure and removal, saying: “where the legislature creates a public office, it may impose such terms and limitations with reference to the tenure or removal of an incumbent as it sees fit.” It is not clear, however, how, after making this definitive statement, with which I thoroughly agree, the Majority can go on and hold that an application of that principle denies to the Governor in this case the power to dismiss Turnpike commissioners, when the Act which creates the Commission says absolutely NOTHING about the removal of the Governor’s appointees.</p>

Such an argument, if at all entertained, is untenable; I believe <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>that the Legislature is as much aware oí the provisions of the Constitution as the Courts. There cannot be excluded from the interpretation of the Act of 1937 the proposition that the Legislature purposely omitted any reference to removal of Commission members because Article VI, Section 4 of the Constitution already provides the machinery of removal should it become necessary to use it.</p>

A commissioner may become irresponsible to the point that his services are no longer reliable or trustworthy but not of such a character as to justify criminal or impeachment proceedings. Who is to remove him? According to the Majority, no one. Such a commissioner must serve his ten years, no matter how inefficient, irresponsible and unreliable he may be, no matter how much he may impede the work of the Commission. Certainly the framers of the Constitution never intended that government should be helpless in the face of such a threat to orderly and efficient administration.</p>

    <p id="b164-6" data-blocks='[["BL_164.6",164,[253,1708,1153,592]]]'>There is nothing in the Act of May 21, 1937 which indicates that the Legislature intended that the members of the Turnpike Commission were to be immune from dismissal, regardless of misconduct, inefficiency or refusal to cooperate with other government officials equally charged with responsibility in carrying forward the business of government and in protecting the welfare of the people. The Turnpike Commission is not a bombproof shelter in which officials may hide away from the responsibility which must guide and control all other officers of the Commonwealth.</p>

      <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>The Legislature never intended that the Turnpike Commission should have a perpetual existence. When all its financial obligations will have been liquidated, the Turnpike will belong to the people who shall utilize all its services without the payment of tolls. It would be strange indeed that the Turnpike Commission should be so closely integrated with the various departments of our State government, and particularly the Highway Department, and yet be beyond the control of the State. It would be bizarre indeed that an enterprise which is eventually to become a part of the Commonwealth could be run by individuals not responsible to the power of the Commonwealth which appointed them, that same power being charged with protecting the welfare of the people who will be the owners of the Turnpike. The enabling Act of 1937 specifically makes the Commission an instrumentality of the Commonwealth: “The commission is hereby constituted an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, and the exercise by the commission of the powers conferred by this act in the construction, operation and maintenance of the turnpike shall be deemed and held to be <em>an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth”</em>

The Turnpike Commission is an important part of that government, exercising many executive and administrative functions which require the supervision of the Governor himself and the Department of Highways. The bonds which its officers must supply in guaranteeing faithful performance of their duties require the approval of the Governor. The bonds which are issued by the Commission to obtain funds with which to carry on its work must be signed by the Governor. The Department of Justice must approve applications by the Commission for the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>appointment of viewers in connection with the condemnation and acquisition of land. In the construction of highways and 'bridges, the approval of the Department of Highways is required. All construction work done on highways and bridges by the Commission must be accomplished under the supervision of the Department of Highways which must also approve contracts and agreements appertaining to such construction. When the Legislature provided for extensions of the turnpike it provided also that the new locations had to have the approval of the Department of Highways and the Governor.</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[251,985,1151,264]]]'>It must be apparent from all this that no governmental activity on Capitol Hill in Harrisburg is more intimately a part of the administrative and executive departments of the 'State than the activities of the Turnpike Commission.</p>

If a member or members of the Turnpike Commission should, through incompetence, recklessness or indifference, injure the main artery, someone must be found who can immediately apply the tourniquet by dismissing the person or persons causing the damage. According to the Majority, the only power that can render the imperative surgical attention in such a situation is the Legislature. But the Legislature has made no provision for emergencies of this character.</p>

The Legislature placed the power of appointment in the Governor, it indicated the length of term of office, <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>but it said nothing about removal. If the Legislature intended to retain control over the removal machinery, a sentence or two in the Act would have assured that retention. The Legislature, however, purposely made no mention of a removal power. The only possible explanation for that omission, as already stated in the early part of this Dissent, is that the Legislature realized that Article YI, Section 4 of the Constitution always stands ready to meet any dilemma which calls for immediate action in the way of dismissals. Hence, there was no necessity to legislate on the matter of removal.</p>
    <p id="b167-3" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[159,1021,1146,994]]]'>In pursuing any given policy in the spheres of finance, welfare, health, highways, banking, mining and so on, the Governor must have as aides individuals who will cooperate and work with him. If, between the Chief Executive and his Department heads, there should arise differences and controversies of such a nature as to be irreconcilable, the Governor has the duty of taking such action as will guaranty a smoothly working administration dedicated to the needs of the people. In such a situation, substitutions in any involved department may be imperative. No one can decide the need for such substitution better than the Governor. If it be said that that power may be abused, then it must be said that any power in government may be abused. The safety valve lies in the fact that in our form' of government, the Chief Executive is responsible to the people, and there is no need to fear that he will or can be indifferent to that responsibility.</p>

Thus, the Majority says that: “No extended reasoning is required to make plain that legislatively annexed conditions of tenure may determine the method of removal of an appointee of the related legislatively created office.” But the Act of 1937 has not determined the method of removal of a Turnpike commissioner.</p>

But, after the Majority gives this clean-cut answer to its own observation, it continues to debate with itself by saying that the Governor “could render all of the offices vacant at one time which, obviously, the Act was specifically designed to make impossible.” I doubt that such a situation would arise and the Majority almost admits the improbability of such an occurrence. But it goes on to say that it is irrelevant whether .such, a situation would ever be provoked. I do not see how such a discussion is irrelevant.
