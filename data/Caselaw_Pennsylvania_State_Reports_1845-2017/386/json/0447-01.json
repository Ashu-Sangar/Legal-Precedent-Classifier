        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThe question involved may be succinctly stated: Did Fessman agree to support his son during his minority, or did the support agreement terminate on Fessman\u2019s death? ; . \u25a0.....\u2022.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court awarded the bulk of Fessman\u2019s estate to a trustee for the minor\u2019s support during minority. From this decree one of the residuary legatees appealed.\nFessman and his wife had a child, Charles Richard Fessman, who was born March 17, 1949. Mrs. Fess-man, on May 24, 1949, filed a complaint in divorce a mensa et thoro. On January 18, 1951, the Court ordered Fessman to pay his wife |14Q. a month as alimony pendente lite. On July 27, 1951, Fessman executed a will in which he left his residuary estate to be divided equally between his parents on the one hand and Eva Puccinelli, the appellant, on the other hand. On March 18, 1952, Mrs. Fessman\u2019s complaint was amended to ask for an absolute divorce.\nOn July 15, 1952, Fessman executed and his attorney, Tasso E. Camarinos, sent to Mrs. Fessman\u2019s attorney, William J. Graham, the following important letter:\n\u201cJuly 15, 1952\nMr. William J. Graham\nAttorney at Law\n620 Frick Building\nPittsburgh 19, Penna.\nDear Mr. Graham:\nIt is understood and agreed that I will continue to pay to Minnie Fessman, the sum of $100.00 monthly payable between the 10th and 15th day of each month for the support of Charles Richard Fessman in lieu of the Order of Common Pleas Court dated January 18, 1950. Very truly yours,\nChaeles H. Fessman\u201d\nOn July 16, 1952, without any foreknowledge on the part of the parties, the Court granted an absolute divorce to Mrs. Fessman.\nFessman made payments of $100. a month for the support of his son under and in accordance with the letter of July 15, 1952, except that at the time of his death on October 11, 1954, he was in arrears in such payments in the total sum of $580. On \u25a0 February 3, 1954, Fessman wrote his former wife enclosing some money to pay part of his arrearages for the support of their son and asked her to marry him. However, Fess-man did not change his last will dated July 27, 1951, in which as above noted he gave Miss Puccinelli one-half of his . residuary estate. Miss Puccinelli contends that the agreement for support of Fessman\u2019s son terminated upon Fessman\u2019s death, and that she was entitled to one-half of his residuary estate. The Court interpreted Fessman\u2019s letter of July 15, 1952 (in conjunction with certain oral testimony) to impose a liability upon the father to support his son during minority; and awarded to Mrs. Fessman arrearages for the support of their son, and a large sum to a trustee to pay for the support of the son $100. a month from Fessman\u2019s death on October 11, 1954.\nThe letter from Fessman to Graham dated July 15, 1952, promising to pay .the sum of $100. monthly for the support of his son, is undoubtedly ambiguous for the reason that it is silent as to the duration of the payments. Appellant contends that parol evidence as to the intention of the parties and the duration of Fess-man\u2019s obligation was inadmissible, under the well settled general rule: Where an agreement purports to contain the entire agreement between the parties, and there is no averment and proof that anything.was omitted therefrom by fraud, accident or mistake, all prior negotiations and verbal agreements are merged in and superseded by the subsequent written agreement and parol evidence is inadmissible to alter, contradict, vary, subtract from or add to the written agreement: Grubb v. Rockey, 366 Pa. 592, 79 A. 2d 255. However, this general rule does not apply where the written agreement is ambiguous. In such a ease parol evidence is admissible to explain the agreement and to resolve the ambiguity in order to ascertain the intention and meaning of the parties: McCready Trust, 387 Pa. 107, 126 A. 2d 429; Morgan v. Phillips, 385 Pa. 9, 122 A. 2d 73;Lipsie v. Dickey, 375 Pa. 230, 100 A. 2d 370; Waldman v. Shoemaker, 367 Pa. 587, 80 A. 2d 776.\nWhere a contract does not fix a definite time for the duration of the relationship or the terms or obligations which are created therein, parol evidence is admissible to show \u201cthe surrounding circumstances, the situation of the parties, the objects they apparently had in view and the nature of the subject-matter\u201d of the agreement, in order to ascertain the intention of the parties-. Lipsie v. Dickey, 375 Pa., supra; Price v. Confair, 366 Pa. 538, 79 A. 2d 224; Slonaker v. P. G. Publishing Co., 338 Pa. 292, 13 A. 2d 48.\nMr. Graham, counsel for Mrs. Fessman, was permitted by the Auditing Judge to testify that upon receipt of Fessman\u2019s letter of July 15, 1952, he telephoned Fessman\u2019s attorney, Mr. Camarinos, who prepared the ambiguous letter, and objected to the words \u201cin lieu of the order of Common Pleas Court dated January .18, 1950\u201d. Graham testified that he told Camarinos that the clause \u201cin lieu of the Order of Common Pleas Court\u201d was entirely unnecessary, since the support order (alimony order) in the Common Pleas Court was for Fessman\u2019s wife and this agreement was to be for the support of their boy during Ms minority; and that Camarinos replied that his client\u2019s word was good for the support of the boy during his minority. The auditing Judge believed Graham\u2019s testimony.\nThe aforesaid conversation with, and admissions by, Fessman\u2019s attorney are admissible in evidence with the same force and effect as if they had been made directly by Fessman himself, since Fessman\u2019s counsel was acting within the scope of his express or implied authority to negotiate a settlement with Fessman\u2019s wife of their marital difficulties and her claims for alimony and the support of their son: McGarity v. New York Life Insurance Co., 359 Pa. 308, 314, 59 A. 2d 47; Cherry v. Mitosky, Administrator, 353 Pa. 401, 406, 45 A. 2d 23, 26; Truby v. Seybert, 12 Pa. 101; Floyd v. Kulp Lumber Co., 222 Pa. 257, 268, 71 A. 13, 15; Henry, Penna. Evidence, 4th Ed., Yol. 1, \u00a796, p. 143. While Graham\u2019s testimony, like Fessman\u2019s letter, was not as clear as it could or should have been, we believe, considering the subject-matter and the objectives of the parties, that it was sufficient, taken in conjunction with Fessman\u2019s letter of July 15th, to establish that Fessman agreed to support his son during his minority.\nWe have not overlooked the principles of law advanced by appellant that a father, in the absence of a contract, has no legal obligation to support his children after his death, and is under no legal obligation to leave his children anything by will. However, these principles are inapplicable when a father contracts to support his child during minority; in such a case, the father\u2019s contract for support is valid and will be binding upon his estate: Huffman v. Huffman, 311 Pa. 123, 166 A. 570; Stumpf's Appeal, 116 Pa. 33, 8 A. 866.\nAmended Decree affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.\nThe parties agree that 1950 was erroneously inserted for 1051. \u2022 . \u2022 ....",
