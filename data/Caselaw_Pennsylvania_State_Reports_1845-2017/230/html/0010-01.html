From the top of this tipple down to the railroad track below were pairs of steps, used by the plaintiff and other employees in ascending and descending. Between two pairs of these steps was a platform, used in going from one pair of steps to the next, and the negligence complained of by the plaintiff is the defendant’s failure to supply and put in place a hand rail or guard rail along the side of the steps and the platform. These steps and this platform were built by carpenters of the defendant while the plaintiff was there, and had been in use by the plaintiff and other employees of the defendant company, to the number of hundreds, for many months before the accident. The absence of the guard rail was plain to the notice of all, and the danger, if any, therefrom, was obvious. Not only this, but the plaintiff himself, not considering it safe, as he states, requested the head carpenter of defendant to put up a guard rail: the answer was that the company declined to do it. On the morning of the accident, the plaintiff was called by the mine foreman up to the . top of the tipple, to answer some questions or receive some information, after which he started to go down to the railroad track below, going by way of these steps and platform, and upon reaching the platform mentioned and passing over it to the head of the next pair of steps, he stepped upon a loose lump of coal, which turned under his foot, and he slipped or fell down the next pair of steps and was injured. Notwithstanding the fact that the absence of the railing, and danger, if any, were obvious, and although the plaintiff considered it unsafe, as shown by his request for a railing, which was refused, he continued, <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>along, with many others, to use the steps and platform from August of 1905 until March, 1906, when the accident occurred. No argument is needed to show that he assumed the risk of his employment.</p>
