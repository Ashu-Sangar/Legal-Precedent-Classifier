Folwell, <a href="/whart/2/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="2 Whart. 11" data-case-ids="1830593" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0011-01">2 Whart. 11</a>. “To be for her and her family’s use:” Heck v.

We regard the words in the will of the testator, “to be for their support and maintenance” as being fully equivalent to those just cited, as “for their own use,” and “for their own use and benefit,” and the additional words “notwithstanding any coverture” make the intention of the testator to guard his daughter in the enjoyment of the estate he was providing for her, as clear as though he had used the technical expression “for her sole and separate use.” Any other construction would ignore the manifest purpose of the testator in qualifying the absolute <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>gift to his daughter.

But in addition to the point noted by Judge Penkose, that the exclusion of the marital rights of the husband is here wrought into the very fiber of the gift to the daughters, there is the additional fact that in the language under consideration in Murray v. Lowrie, <a href="/pa/208/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="208 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="998098" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0001-01">supra,</a> there was nothing equivalent to “for their and each of their support and maintenance notwithstanding any coverture.”</p>

Darley, 3 Atk. 398, an estate was given to a husband for the livelihood of his wife, and it was held that he was to be considered a trustee for her separate use. Lord Hardwick said (p. 399): “Technical words are not necessary to make it a separate trust, for the word livelihood is sufficient to show the intention of the giver that it should be for her sole and separate use.” Livelihood of course has the same meaning as “support and maintenance.” In Cape v. Cape, 2 Y. &amp; C. Ex. 543, the words “support and maintenance” were construed. By a codicil to his will testator directed that a legacy of £300 should “be applied to the support and maintenance of the wife of my said son Henry and for the support and education of his children born in wedlock.” There were no children at the date of the will or of testator’s death. It was held by Baron Alderson (p. 546) that the wife took the legacy “absolutely to her separate use.” In Lee v. Prieaux, 3 Bro. Ch. *381, it was held that (syllabus) a “legacy to a feme covert, ‘her receipt to be a sufficient discharge to the executors,’ is equivalent with saying ‘to her sole and separate use.’” The master of the rolls refers (p. 318) to the words “notwithstanding her coverture” as sufficient to indicate an intention to create a separate use trust, and cites a manuscript case, Woodman v. Horsley, decided February 11, 1783, where the words “the wife’s receipt shall be a sufficient discharge, notwithstanding <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>her coverture,” were held to constitute a trust for the wife.</p>
    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[138,468,1153,540]]]'>And in our own case of Winthrop Company v. Clinton, <a href="/pa/196/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="196 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="916837" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0472-01">196 Pa. 472</a>, the syllabus reads: “Testator gave his estate to his executors to pay the net income to his wife 'into her hands for her separate use and maintenance during all the term of her natural life,’ and after her decease to pay the net income to his son 'for his use and support for and during all the term of his natural life, and not to be liable to anticipation, and his receipt alone to be the sole discharge’ to the trustees. There was a gift over after the son’s death. Held, that a spendthrift trust was created in favor of the son.”</p>
    <p id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[142,1025,1152,635]]]'>While the question whether there was a separate use trust for the widow did not arise, Mr. Chief Justice Green said (p. 475-76): “We think it will hardly be contended that this provision in favor of the widow was not adequately protected against the claims of any creditors she might have. . . . The word 'maintenance,’ in the wife’s case, speaks for itself, and needs no interpretation.” After considering various definitions of the word “support,” the opinion holds that “maintenance” and “support” have the same meaning, and. both indicate an intention to protect the estates given, in the case of the wife, by a separate use trust, and in that of the son, by a spendthrift trust.</p>
