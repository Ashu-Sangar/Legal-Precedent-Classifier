Her will was dated September 15, 1891, and after her death was duly probated, and now remains on file in -the register’s office of Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, and is recorded in Will Book, vol. 51, p. 471.

Marshall Bell has agreed to sell and convey, by deed of general warranty in fee simple, the said lots hereinbefore described, to John H. Ricketson, Jr., for the sum of $2,500, and has tendered to said Ricketson a proper deed therefor, but said John H. Ricketson, Jr., has refused to pay the said A. Marshall Bell the said sum of $2,500, upon the ground that the said A. Marshall Bell does not have the title in fee simple to said premises, but has only a life estate therein under the will of Emma M. Bell, his mother. The question for decision therefore is, whether or not, under the will of said Emma M. Bell, the title in fee simple to said premises became vested in said <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>devisees; and it is agreed that, if the court be of opinion that title in fee simple did pass to them by virtue of said will, then judgment shall be entered in favor of A. Marshall Bell and against John H. Ricketson, Jr., for the sum of $2,500; otherwise, judgment shall be entered in favor of the defendant. The costs are to follow the judgment, each party reserving the right of appeal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[307,686,1156,799]]]'>In said will, the testatrix, after bequeathing certain personal property to her daughter, Mary Marshall Bell, proceeded, “The remainder of my estate I should like divided into three portions, and given one-third to each child.” Further along this appears: “In such an event as the death of all my children without heirs, I wish my property divided between my sister’s children, those of E. B. M. Denny under no circumstances is money of mine to revert to my husband’s family. Let my children in making a will remember this.” Also, “In case of the death of any one of the three, without children of his or her own, such property must go to the surviving brother or sister.” The final clause of the will is: “But in case of the death of all my children without family and without a will all possessions are to return to my own family, and in no case to revert to the family of my husband.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[297,1495,1160,742]]]'>It appears to us that in the clause of the will first above cited the testatrix did give to each of her three children an estate in fee simple in the land described. It is true that she does not use words of inheritance, but those words are not now necessary. Her intention, as we gather it from the whole will, was to vest in her children estates in fee simple. The question then is, does the subsequent apparent devise over, in case of the death of the first takers, reduce the estates thus granted in fee simple to life estates? We are of opinion that the devise over does not have that effect. We think the proper meaning of the clause under consideration is that the death of the first taker must have taken place in the lifetime of the testatrix, and that the case is ruled by Richar4s v. Bentz, <a href="/pa/212/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="212 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="941803" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0093-01">212 Pa. 93</a>.</p>
