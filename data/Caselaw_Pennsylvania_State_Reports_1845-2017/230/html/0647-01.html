A motion by the plaintiff for a new trial hairing been made and argued the court permitted the plaintiff to renew his motion to amend his statement of claim. This having been done and an amended statement having been put in form and presented with the motion for leave to amend, the right of the plaintiff to so amend was objected to by the defendant and the question thus raised is now to be disposed of.</p>
