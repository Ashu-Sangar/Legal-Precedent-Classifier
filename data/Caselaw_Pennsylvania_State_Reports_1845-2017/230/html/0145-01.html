    <p class="summary" id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[280,689,1154,588]]]'>Following Graeser’s death, his widow, the accountant, had the license duly transferred to herself individually; she took, possession of the stock of liquors and fixtures and continued to operate and conduct the place as her husband had done in his lifetime. In March, 1909, she applied for and was' granted a new license, paying the fee of $1,000 from the funds of this estate. Later she remarried, and removed from the premises, but owns and conducts the same as in the former manner under some delegated management. She asserts that she holds the premises, license, good will, etc., now and has continued to hold them as trustee for Graeser’s creditors.</p>

The decedent’s debts as proven exceed $10,000, consisting largely of unpaid liquor accounts. In August, 1909, she was offered $8,500 for the place, exclusive of the real estate, including the license, stock, good will and fixtures, which she accepted, but for some reason the transfer was refused by the quarter sessions court. The daily receipts have been from $20.00 to $35.00; there is testimony estimating the value of this good will and license of the place at from $3,000 to $4,000, assuming the transferee should retain possession as a licensed vender of liquors.</p>

    <p id="b179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_179.11",179,[184,866,1155,542]]]'>The appellant charged herself with a value of $1,115.15. The orphans’ court adjudged the value inadequate and surcharged the accountant with a difference of $5,384.85. In making this surcharge the court properly said, “That the value of good will taken in connection with a continuance of a well-established licensed business .... when ascertained, is an asset of a decedent’s estate, even though the original license itself was a mere personal privilege and does not pass to his representatives, is well settled in a line of cases.” These cases are all reviewed in Aschenbach v. Carey, <a href="/pa/224/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="224 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="963162" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0303-01">224 Pa. 303</a>.</p>
    <p id="b179-7" data-blocks='[["BL_179.12",179,[188,1418,1158,644]]]'>The decedent’s estate was insolvent, and the appellant took over the business, good will and fixtures; the license was transferred to her, and subsequently to her new husband, who now holds it. Under these circumstances, when the issue was raised, it was for the orphans’ court to decide whether or not the accountant had charged herself with the full value of the good will, business and fixtures. Upon the evidence before him, the learned auditing judge found that she had not, and determined that their real value was $6,500. This is a finding of fact which under our rulings will not be disturbed unless manifest error is apparent. A careful review of the evidence fails to convince us of any such error.</p>
