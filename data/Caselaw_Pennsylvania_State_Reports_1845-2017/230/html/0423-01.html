    <p id="b456-7" data-blocks='[["BL_456.12",456,[306,1339,1154,397]]]'>This appeal involves the construction of item 4 of the will of Thomas Lilley: “I give devise and bequeath to my daughter Ruth J. Elliott .... [a farm] .... to have and to hold unto my said daughter and her children forever. I also devise and bequeath to my daughter .... [another farm] .... to have and to hold unto my said daughter and her children forever. I also give to my daughter three hundred and fifty dollars in money.”</p>

Hague, <a href="/pa/161/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="161 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="854216" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0643-01">161 Pa. 643</a>; Estate of Mary Catherine Vaughan, <a href="/pa/230/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="230 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="8846654" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0554-01">230 Pa. 554</a>. The authorities are collated in Hague v.

    <p id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.4",457,[203,624,1152,890]]]'>Here, the daughter had children in being at the time of the making of the will, and her husband also was alive. In phrasing the item under consideration, it may well have been the intent of the testator to protect the interests of these grandchildren and to guard against the possibility of his son-in-law’s holding the entire real estate therein disposed of as tenant by the curtesy. When we look at the will from its four corners it bears out the thought that the testator did not intend to vest the fee in his daughter. In the items preceding the one in question he devises farms to three of his sons, using in each instance the following language: “I give devise and bequeath to my son .... to have and to hold unto my said son, his heirs and assigns forever,” thus showing knowledge of correct technical words for the creation of a fee. Therefore the change of phraseology in item 4 has significance as some evidence of a different intent concerning the disposition of the property then in mind.</p>
    <p id="b457-5" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[209,1521,1148,497]]]'>The last clause, “I also give to my daughter three hundred &amp; fifty dollars in money,” should have no controlling effect in construing the preceding devises in the item, since it is entirely distinct from all that goes before. “The word, 'also,’ which is prefixed to the sentence, serves, as it most frequently does in wills, to point out the beginning of a new devise or new bequest:” Evans v. Knorr, <a href="/rawle/4/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="4 Rawle 66" data-case-ids="1823578" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0066-01">4 Rawle, 66</a>. We conclude that the learned court below fell into error in determining that the testator devised the farm in question to Ruth J. Elliott in fee simple.</p>
    <p id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[213,2023,1144,97]]]'>The assignment of error is sustained and the judgment is reversed with a procedendo.</p>
