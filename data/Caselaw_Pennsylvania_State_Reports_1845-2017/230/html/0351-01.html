The ordinary and usual meaning of “vaccination,” and the sense in which it must be supposed to have been used by the legislature, is inoculation with the virus of cowpox for the purpose of communicating that disease as a prophylactic against smallpox. It indicates an operation, and not a result. If a person should take cowpox by milking cows, or otherwise, or from other contact with the disease he could not be said to have been vaccinated. The operation is comparatively old, having been in use for over 100 years, and during that time has always consisted of inoculating the body, that is, grafting upon it the disease, by inserting the virus under the skin, and the test of its success has always been considered to be the appearance of the symptoms of the disease including those which manifest themselves on the skin.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[204,1320,1156,790]]]'>It appears in this case that for some years past another method of guarding against smallpox has come into use more or less extensively, which, as we understand it, consist in attenuating to a high degree the virus of smallpox, or of cowpox, the attenuation of the virus of smallpox being called variolinum, and that of cowpox, vaccininum, and administering one or the other of these substances by the mouth, and it is claimed that in this way there are produced in the body practically the same symptoms as are produced by vaccination except the exterior and local inflammation, and that either of these methods has the same preventive virtue as ordinary vaccination. From what is known of the use of toxins of other diseases this would seem to be possibly true, but whatever it may be, and whatever the result may be, it is not vaccination as the term is used in the act.</p>

In order, therefore, to guard against such ambiguous use of the term by which the act would be evaded, the health department, under the terms of the act of 1905, prescribed a form of certificate which would prevent such ambiguity, and the requiring of that form is really what is complained of in this case. It was strenuously argued that the authority given by the act of 1905 to the health department to fix forms of certificates is a delegation of legislative power and if it is claimed to authorize that board to require safeguards against disease which the act does not substantially require, it would be open to that objection. But all we understand the act of 1905 authorizes, and all that the department has done in this case, is to regulate the form of the certificate so as to prevent ambiguity, and to require the certifying physician to use words in the same sense with which they are used in the act.</p>
