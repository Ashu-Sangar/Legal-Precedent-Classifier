An affidavit of defense is to be taken most strongly against the defendant, for it is to be presumed that he has made it as favorable to himself as his conscience would allow him.</p>

As to items 4 and 12, the defendant admits that “had the plaintiff companies continued on with the business .... the claim-of commissions on returned premiums must have been credited to the companies.” As to items 3 and 11 the defendant contends that he is “entitled to a reasonable amount as damages for the breach of the contracts.” In the schedules referred to in connection with these latter items, the basis of the figures claimed is shown to be a calculation of the daily average of the net premiums, and the multiplication thereof by ninety. Upon this product the defendant makes an arbitrary claim of fifteen per cent as the reasonable amount which he could have earned had the contract lasted ninety days longer. Aside from the question of the sufficiency of the averments covering these several items, or of the defendant’s right to claim them as damages arising from the alleged breach, we are of opinion that, as a matter of law, the facts averred do not constitute a breach of the contracts.</p>

Weighing Company, <a href="/pa-super/12/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="12 Pa. Super. 55" data-case-ids="823401" data-case-paths="/pa-super/12/0055-01">12 Pa. Superior Ct. 55</a>, it is held: “Where a corporation’s charter is declared void for nonpayment of taxes and a receiver is appointed, a claim by its manager for services rendered after the date of the forfeiture cannot be allowed. . . . The contract relation is terminated .... as completely as by death of individual parties to the contract.” And in Hammond’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/123/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="123 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="967123" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0503-01">123 Pa. 503</a>, we held that when an insolvent corporation has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, upon acceptance by the assignee the relations of its officers to it are “effectually dissolved by operation of law.” An examination of the cases from other jurisdictions, cited in 34 Cyc. 267, shows the rule as stated in the text to be supported in New York and other states, but not in New Jersey.</p>
    <p id="b497-4" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[154,1564,1162,699]],["BL_498.1",498,[319,328,1180,749]]]'>Whether or not this rule shall be applied seems to depend upon the circumstances in each case; but we are convinced that it is applicable to the facts in the case at bar. Llere the insurance companies were engaged in a business which could not be conducted by receivers. It is one of the many instances where the appointment of a receiver would be in effect an injunction upon the further continuance of the business: Appeal of Newcastle &amp; Franklin Rd. Company, <a href="/walker/3/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="3 Walker 281" data-case-ids="265235" data-case-paths="/walker/3/0281-01">3 Walker, 281</a>; Treat v. Penna. Mutual Life Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/199/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="199 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="922890" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0326-01">199 Pa. 326</a>; and we must assume that the plaintiff, when he entered into the agreements with these corporations, knew and contemplated that in such a contingency his agency contracts would come to an end. The clause providing for the ninety days’ notice was only <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>applicable to a discontinuance of the contracts during the ■ natural business life of the companies and cannot be construed to apply to the circumstances of the present case. There is not any averment in the affidavit of defense that the receivership was- other than an entire one, that it was necessitated by the improper conduct of the corporations or their officers, or that it was brought about for the -purpose of ending the contracts in question. In point of fact the defendant states that the business under the contracts was carried on with entire satisfaction until th,e earthquake in San Francisco “greatly impaired the finances of both insurance companies;” and, no doubt, that is the real explanation of their failure. There was no breach of the contracts on the part of the companies, and hence the items in question were properly disallowed.</p>
    <p id="AMY" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[339,1085,1156,741]]]'>Concerning thé second class of items, we find no warrant in the contracts for items 5 and 15. As to items 6 and 14, the affidavit fails to aver that these are what is termed in the contracts, “approved incidental expenses,” or otherwise to bring them within the provisions of the contracts covering allowances to the defendant; again, the vouchers referred to are not to be found in the record. Item 13 is so vaguely averred that it is difficult to tell exactly what is meant, but, from other parts of the record, it appears to cover premiums due by a subagent. If this is so, under the terms of the contracts, it is an improper charge against the insurance companies. Item 7 represents an insurance loss paid by the defendant some years after the receivership, but it is not averred with sufficient precision to enable us to determine whether or not it should be allowed.</p>

Averments of set-off must be as specific as those used in a statement of claim. The defendant in respect to such a claim is the actor, and the obligation is upon him to aver his set-off in terms incapable of being misunderstood: Loeser v. Warehouse, <a href="/pa-super/10/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="10 Pa. Super. 540" data-case-ids="819461" data-case-paths="/pa-super/10/0540-01">10 Pa. Superior Ct. 540</a>. An affidavit of defense is to be taken <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>most strongly against the defendant, for it is to be presumed that he has made it as favorable to himself as his conscience would allow: Comly v. Simpson, <a href="/pa-super/6/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="6 Pa. Super. 12" data-case-ids="281909" data-case-paths="/pa-super/6/0012-01">6 Pa. Superior Ct. 12</a>; Kemp v. Kemp, 1 Woodw. 154. With these familiar rules in mind, we cannot say that the court below erred in holding the present affidavit insufficient as to any of the items disallowed.</p>
    <p id="b499-4" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[197,722,1155,838]]]'>It is urged by the appellant that the record should be returned to the common pleas because of its failure to comply with the rule laid down in Pierson v. Krause, <a href="/pa/208/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="208 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="998083" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0115-01">208 Pa. 115</a>. We are convinced by the brief opinion filed that the court below intended to bring itself within the letter of the rule in question. But the learned judges of that court would have greatly facilitated the work of review, had they given us the benefit of their own labors by a separate adjudication of the different items, or classes of items, held to be insufficient, with a brief statement of their reasons for so determining, instead of enumerating the items thought to be sufficient with a mere general dis-allowance of those held to be insufficient. Before entering judgment under the Act of July 15, 1897, P. L. 276, the common pleas ought to see that the items which they hold to be insufficient are enumerated in the rule for judgment or specially indicated in their written adjudication.</p>
