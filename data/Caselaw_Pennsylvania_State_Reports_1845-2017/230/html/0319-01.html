The Riter-Conley Manufacturing Company was granted a charter under the laws of the state of New Jersey on September 28, 1898. It was duly organized thereunder the next day to engage in the “manufacture of iron, steel and other structural work, machinery and appliances manufactured from iron, steel, or other materials.” The corporation was the successor of Riter &amp; Conley, a partnership. Its capital stock was fixed at $750,000, of which $633,000 were subscribed. Its principal office was fixed at Jersey City, N. J., but its board of directors was authorized to have offices outside of the state of New Jersey; and it did establish and has since maintained an office in the city of Pittsburg, Pa., where the greater part of its business has been transacted. It had two plants, one on Preble avenue, Allegheny, Pa., and the other at Leetsdale, Allegheny county, Pa. The business transacted was very large and very profitable.</p>

Coffin, <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>Herbert P. Hatch and Robert A. McKean, the plaintiff, were chosen directors. Under the by-laws which were adopted the number of directors was fixed at six and a majority of those in office was necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Mr. Riter was elected president, Mr. Coffin, vice president, and Mr. Craig, secretary and treasurer. Mr. Riter continued as president and director until his death April 23, 1907. Mr. Coffin and Mr. Craig continued in their offices as directors until January, 1908. The said Robert A. McKean also continued as director until November 11, 1907. He had been in fact the general manager of the previous partnership and shortly after the organization of the corporation his position was officially designated general manager; and he continued in that position until January, 1908. He never was one of the executive officers of the corporation. His duties as general manager required him to look after the manufacturing part of the business and the erection of work. His salary as general manager was fixed about the time of the organization of the corporation at $4,000 per year.</p>

The plaintiff was one of the original subscribers to the capital stock of said corporation. An account with the plaintiff was opened upon the books of the corporation about the time of its organization. In this account he was charged with his subscription to the capital stock and with such other moneys as he drew from time to time; and in said account he was credited with such dividends as he was from time to time entitled to receive, and with interest upon any credit balances which were shown by the books to be in his favor. From and after July 1, 1903, the plaintiff had a balance to his credit in the account aforesaid and in January, 1908, said balance was apparently $62,'600. But the salary to which the plaintiff was entitled was not entered in said account except as hereinafter specified in findings of fact No. 4.

The only authority which Mr. Gillespie had for entering said credit in favor of the plaintiff was the paper exhibit No. 1, mentioned in findings of fact No. 4.

The plaintiff’s salary was originally fixed at' $4¡000 per annum by Mr. Riter. Some time during the year 1901 the plaintiff had a conference with Mr. Riter in which he asked for an increase of his salary from $4,000 to $5,000 per annum. Several similar conferences were held by them afterwards. In the spring of 1906 the plaintiff again asked Mr. Riter for an increase,, this time to $6,000 per annum. Mr. Riter declined to make said increase. While he raised no objection he replied substantially in each conversation that he would make it satisfactory or would arrange it later. In the meantime the plaintiff’s salary at the rate of $4,000 per year was regularly paid him in the manner described in findings of <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>fact No. 3.

Within a day or so after the last named meeting of the board of directors the auditors called the attention of several of the board to the entry of $6,000 in favor of the plaintiff mentioned in findings of fact No. 4. On January 22, 1908, the resignations of Mr. Coffin and Mr. Craig as officers and directors of the defendant corporation were accepted and the same day the resignations of the plaintiff and of T. D. Gillespie from their positions were also accepted. On January 27, 1908, an agreement was made between the defendant corporation and the plaintiff, John S. Craig, William C. Coffin and several others whereby the corporation purchased all their stock therein and agreed to pay for the same and also their credit balances in the manner therein specified. It was further agreed that the books of the corporation as they then stood should not be held conclusive upon the defendant, the audit being then in progress, but that said books might be corrected later and that the said parties (including the plaintiff) should not be bound by the results of said audit, but that corrections should be made in ac<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>cordance with the actual facts. Pursuant to this agreement the defendant paid the said plaintiff for his said stock and it also paid to him the amount of his credit balance except the sum of $7,421.05 to which it claimed he was not entitled. When the audit above mentioned was completed, the defendant on March 27, 1908, which was within a reasonable time, notified the plaintiff of its said objections to the items aforesaid of his account aggregating $7,421.05. When the defendant filed its answer, however, it admitted that the plaintiff was entitled to $46.50, for which it tendered a decree with costs to the date of answer, but it declined to pay the balance, to wit, $7,374.55.</p>
