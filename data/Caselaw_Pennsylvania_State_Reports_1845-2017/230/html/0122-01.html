The exception in the lease which relieves it from liability is the “acts of God.” The position assumed by defendant is that “acts of God” and “inevitable casualty or accident” are synonymous terms, and that the ease at bar is ruled by Kelly, Administrator, v. Duffy, 11 Atl. Repr. 244. In this case the lease contained a clause “and to surrender the same in as good order and condition as they were at any time during the term, ordinary decay and inevitable casualty only excepted,” and in which case the following point was affirmed.</p>

Duffey does not rule the case at bar, as contended by the defendant. The terms “inevitable casualty or accident” and “acts of God” are not synonymous. “Inevitable casualty” is a broader and more comprehensive term, than “act of God.”</p>

Damage done by lightning is an inevitable accident, and also an act of God, but the collision of two vessels in the dark is an inevitable accident, but not an act of God, as the stroke of lightning, nor is it so considered by the authorities.”</p>

Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 584, by “act of God” is meant, “A natural necessity which could not have been occasioned by the intervention of man, but proceeds from physical causes alone, such as the violence of the winds or seas, by lightning or other natural accidents.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[208,1432,1149,347]]]'>Or, as said in Coggs v. Bernard, 1 Smith’s Leading Cases, *199: “As to loss by act of God, this means such irresistible disaster as results from natural causes and is in no sense attributable to human agency. The civil law employs a corresponding term, viz., major, and inevitable accident is not a fair synonym, and the loss by fire is not an act of God, for fire originates in human agency.”</p>
