Where the councils of a city of the second class in pursuance of the authority exclusively given to them fix the compensation of the tax collector at a per centum on his collections, the mayor has no power to require the person he proposes to appoint collector to enter into a written contract binding' himself to accept for his services a fixed sum instead of a per centum on the collections as allowed by the ordinance, thereby reducing his compensation very much below that which he otherwise would be entitled to. Such a contract whether it is executory or executed, is contrary to the settled policy of the law as indicated in the constitutional provision which prohibits a public officer from contributing or paying any money or other valuable thing to' secure his appointment.</p>

It is this sum for which the city claims judgment, together with interest thereon from November 17, 1909. He replies that he is not indebted to the city for any amount, because, at the time of his appointment, and during the whole of his term, his compensation was fixed by law, namely, by ordinance of councils, pursuant to the provisions of statute law; that the mayor had no authority to change the law by providing for him as a public officer a compensation different from that fixed by law; that the agreement of June 20, 1906 was against public policy, and without valid consideration; and that consequently it is not binding upon him, is void, and of no effect. If he is correct in this contention, it is agreed that judgment shall be entered in his favor, because his commissions for the full term served would equal the amount claimed by the city.

The law fixed his compensation. No city officer had authority to change it. But there was no misrepresentation, fraud or compulsion on the part of the mayor. He was the appointing power. He believed that the compensation of the collector of delinquent taxes, as fixed by ordinance, was too great. Goshorn so believed, and stated to the mayor that, should he be given the appointment of collector, he would accept a salary in lieu of commissions, and pay into the treasury all sums collected, less the amount of his salary and certain expenses. The mayor, being satisfied of his <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>fitness for the office, took him at his word, and appointed him. The mayor did not mislead him in any manner. Goshorn did not accept the appointment under compulsion. He was not forced to assent to the fixed salary in lieu of commissions, as stated in exhibit No. 2. He himself agreed “that the compensation provided by ‘ordinance’ was ‘excessive.’ ” He desired the appointment, thought the compensation was excessive, agreed to accept less in case of his appointment, and thus secured the appointment. The mayor evidently thought that, by making the appointment with the understanding as to compensation, as provided in exhibit No. 2, he was serving the interests of the city. Goshorn thought so, too, and apparently meant to carry out all that he agreed to do. How can it be said, therefore, that his action was other than voluntary on his part? If, during the term of his office, he had repudiated his agreement of June 20, 1906, and had- given notice to the city by word or deed that he intended to claim the compensation fixed by ordinance, and after such notice, the city had continued him in office, his claim should be sustained in law. If, on the contrary, no such notice was given, and the city authorities were thereby led to believe that his compensation was as fixed by exhibit No. 2, he should be estopped from enforcing his claim for commissions now.</p>

It is not expressly stated that he ever gave such notice, nor is it expressly stated that he did not. But he collected $4,604,081.63 during his term of office, and paid to the city only $4,510,613.16, of which amount the sum of $41,406.97 was paid more than six months after the expiration of his term. There was nothing, therefore, in his retention of moneys to put the city on notice of an intention on the part of the collector to claim commissions, and thus repudiate his agreement. He did not merely retain the exact amount of his commissions. His retention of moneys far exceeded all commissions to which he could possibly be entitled under the ordinance.</p>

The situation, therefore, is this: Goshorn makes no claim that, during his term of office, he ever gave express notice of an intention to demand commissions. It is not set forth in the stated case that he did. As to any act or deed on his part, so far as disclosed in the stated case, clearly there was nothing to put the city upon notice. Without such notice, having served his full term, his contract has been executed, and he cannot now be heard to say that the agreement under which he was appointed was illegal and void, and that he is now entitled to a greater compensation than that to which he agreed, served for, accepted and received. In other words, the transaction has been completed, although all the collections have not been paid over. This state of affairs does not arise because of a disputed claim made at any time during the term of service, and it could only be by means of süch a claim that the defendant could successfully contend that the contract was not executed. If it were not executed, possibly it would be void, as without legal consideration to support it; and possibly, further, as against public policy. But, if executed, as we think it is, the time for raising these questions has passed.</p>

Unquestionably the borough had power to make that change, and it is not intimated, either in the affidavit of defense or in appellant’s brief, that any abuse of discretion was involved in the transaction, or that it was tainted with fraud, or that it was not justified by the conditions existing at the time.

If this were all, the authorities cited by the learned trial judge in his opinion filed in the case, would give large support to his conclusion. But it is far from being all. The defense relied on is not only that the contract was an attempt on the part of the mayor to do something for which he had no authority, but that it was a clear usurpation of a power which by law was committed to another department of city government, and which by that department had been duly exercised. The position taken is that the contract is repugnant to the policy of the law. The law intrusted exclusively to the councils of the city the power to fix the compensation of the collector, and this they had done by ordinance duly adopted. It is to be presumed that in fixing this compensation, they had regard to the work to be performed, and what compensation was necessary to command the services of one qualified to discharge the duties of the office. When the mayor came to exercise his power of appointment, because he thought the compensation fixed by the council excessive, he required of the person he proposed to appoint — making it a condition of his appointment — that he enter into a written contract binding himself to accept for his services a fixed sum, instead of a per centum on the collections as allowed by the ordinance, thereby reducing his compensation very much below that which he otherwise would be entitled to. The mayor was thus substituting his views, in a very practical way, for the deliberate action of the only body that had any right to determine the question of compensation. No matter how meritorious his motives, he was setting at defiance the law governing the case, annulling arbitrarily the action of councils, and taking to himself as mayor a power which had not only not been conferred on his office, but which was expressly <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>and exclusively lodged in another department. The terms he exacted excluded from possible appointment the entire class of men willing to accept the office at the compensation fixed by law, but who would accept for nothing less. His act was an undue interference with the proper exercise of governmental functions, and for this reason, if for no other, it contravened the settled policy of law. But the case presents another condemnatory feature which must not be overlooked. We have a public policy so clearly indicated in our state constitution that it admits of no dispute. By constitutional provision every public officer before entering upon the discharge of the duties of his office, is required to make oath that he has not paid, or contributed, or promised to pay or contribute, either directly or indirectly, any money or other valuable thing, to procure his nomination, election or appointment. The condition of the appellant’s appointment to the office of collector was that he would promise “to pay over to the City Treasurer the amount of the commissions allowed by the ordinance, less his compensation as above fixed and the expenses of his office,” etc. This promise having been made, his appointment followed. The promise was the price of his appointment. If it should be supposed disputable by any, whether this contract offends against public policy for the first reason given, what answer can be made to this? The policy here asserted is written in the fundamental law of the state. But reasoning further on general principles is made unnecessary by our own express adjudications. We need only refer to the case of Wilkes-Barre v. Rockafellow, <a href="/pa/171/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="171 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="985597" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0177-01">171 Pa. 177</a>. The contract there set up was that the treasurer to secure his appointment had promised to pay to the city interest on his balances. “This agreement,” says Mr. Justice Williams in the opinion, “if made, did not amount to a loan of any particular sum of money by the city council to the Treasurer, but was in the nature of a premium demanded from him as the price of the office. It was a premium for which he was not <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>liable, which he could not be compelled to pay if he had taken defense to it, and for which the sureties are not liable. The agreement if made was against public policy and is incapable of enforcement.” This decision is . in full accord with the doctrine which prevails generally. If then this contract offends against public policy, as it unquestionably does, the legal results which follow are far more serious than those which attach to a contract simply ultra vires. The latter is illegal only in the sense that it lacks authority for the making; the infirmity is remediable; it may be cured by subsequent ratification, and is even enforcible against a party who has received the benefits under it and afterwards seeks to repudiate it. What results to a contract against public policy is a total and irremediable paralysis, which leaves it absolutely without any force or effect whatever, so that it cannot, under any circumstances, be made the basis of a cause of action. The law when appealed to will have nothing to do with it, but will leave the parties just in the condition in which it finds them. If they have fully executed their unlawful contract, the law will not disturb them in the possession of what each has acquired under it. If one has executed in whole or in part, the law turns a deaf ear when he pleads for its aid to compel the other to do as much. In the latter case the maxim in pari de-licto melior est conditio possidentis applies. The “con-ditio” referred to in the maxim, as explained by Mr. Pom-eroy, in his work on equity jurisprudence, is clearly the condition of the parties with respect to their property rights created by or resulting from the contract. If the contract is still executory, the promisor is left undisturbed in the possession of the money or other property which he agreed to pay or transfer; if the contract has been executed, the promisee is left undisturbed in the possession of the money or other property which has been paid or conveyed to him. Now the result must be the same whether the contract here sought to be enforced be regarded as executed or executory. If the former, the law <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>leaves the parties in possession of what has been acquired under it; if executory, it refuses to enforce it. In either case the city is remediless. It is clear however that it remains executory; the appellant though he has had the benefit of the office has not paid the price he agreed to pay; he has not paid to the city treasurer the difference between the salary he agreed to accept and the compensation he was entitled to under the law. A contract can be said to be executed only when the object of the contract has been performed. Here the only object of the contract remains unfulfilled, the appellant retains the money, and the only purpose of the contract is defeated. For the reasons above stated the assignments of error are sustained, the judgment is reversed, and judgment is now entered on the case stated for the defendant.</p>
