The findings of fact are that the increase <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>was made by the unanimous action of the directors at a regular meeting of the board at which the plaintiff, who was a director, was present; that as vice president of the company he received the increased salary until his connection with the company as an officer thereof ended; that it was not shown that the salaries paid were unusual or excessive or more than the services rendered were worth. There was ample evidence to sustain these findings and they are conclusive of the controversy.</p>
