    <p id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.12",170,[291,1152,1154,1102]]]'>Appellant’s claim against the appellee is for commissions alleged to be due on a sale of 300 of its cars to the George’s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Company. The averment in his statement upon which he seeks to recover is that he was employed by the appellee to sell the cars to the coal and iron company and that L. G. Woods, the ap-pellee’s treasurer, made a verbal promise to pay him $15.00 for each car included in the order from the purchasing company. The claim is upon an express promise to pay a fixed sum for alleged services, and unless this was established at the trial, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover anything under the pleadings. The learned trial judge, in sustaining the motion for judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto, was of opinion that, though the appellant had tried to secure the order for the 300 cars, he had failed to do so; but whether this conclusion, reached upon a review of all the evidence, was correct, is immaterial, for even assuming that he did procure the order, he failed to show any authority in Woods to bind the appellee to pay $15.00 for each ear included in the order from the coal and iron company or any ratification by it of its treasurer’s alleged act.</p>

From all that took place between the appellant and Hanson, the president of the defendant company, the latter was fully justified in regarding the former as the representative of the George’s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Company. As to this the learned trial judge correctly said that the burden was upon him to clear up the misapprehension which he himself had created by writing about the instruction of his customer and by allowing himself to be introduced by the treasurer of the company to its president as an engineer who had a customer. He entirely failed to show any authority in Woods to make the contract upon which he would hold the company, and the affirmative uncontradicted testimony is that the treasurer had nothing whatever to do with the sale of the company’s cars, his duties, as defined by the by-laws, being confined to keeping the accounts of the receipts and disbursements of its moneys, of placing them to its credit in such depositories as might be designated by the board of directors and of keeping an account of stock registered and transferred in such form or manner as a board of directors might prescribe. The promise which the appellant alleges was made by him was no more binding upon the company as a promise by it than if it had been made by one of its subordinate employees.</p>
