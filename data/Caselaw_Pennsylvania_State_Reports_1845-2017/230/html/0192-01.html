The proceeds of this sale being insufficient to pay the taxes, on September 24, 1889, a tax lien was entered against Dunker, and thereunder on March 6, 1891, the property in question was sold to one Chantler.</p>

L. 18 (extended to the county of Allegheny by the Act of April 5, 1844, P. L. 199); the language of that act being practically similar to the act of 1857.

L. 1131, wherein it is provided: “If on any .... judicial sale, enough be not realized to pay off the lien, it shall continue to be a lien, until the whole amount, with the costs, be paid in full.” In discussing this act, Chief Justice Thompson there said: “Generally judicial sales divest all liens. But the Legislature thought proper to enact at least the equivalent of the provision contained in the Act of 1824 'that the assessment should be and remain a lien until fully paid and satisfied,’ by the clause quoted above, 'that if on any judicial sale enough was not realized to pay off the lien, it shall continue to be a lien until the whole amount shall be paid with costs.’ This provision corresponds with our decision in 1861 under the Act of 1827 (should be Act of 1824, as appears from an examination of the original manuscript): Allegheny City’s App., <a href="/pa/41/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="41 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="479991" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0060-01">41 Pa. 60</a>. We held that the words quoted, meant, that if enough to pay off the taxes was not realized by the sale, the unextinguished balance continued to be a lien.” As this dictum concerning the act of 1824 has crept into other of our cases, and as it led the court below into error, it is well now to explain it away.</p>
