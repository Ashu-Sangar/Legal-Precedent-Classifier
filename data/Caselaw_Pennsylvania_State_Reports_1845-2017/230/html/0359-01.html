In order to a proper understanding of this question, it is necessary a preliminary statement should be made: Mr. Bell sometimes did business in his own name, sometimes under that of the Western Bank, and sometimes under that of the Western Savings Bank. He had no partner; and accordingly in the settlement of his estate these assumed names were treated as merely formal and the assets in whatever character they appeared, as his assets. He died in 1886, leaving a will in which his niece Mrs. Emma M. Bell, and James M. Bell, were appointed executors, the term of the latter being limited to one year. Mrs. Bell united in taking out letters and in filing accounts; but took no part in the business of administration <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>even to the extent of drawing a check: James M. Bell, who had been his uncle’s bookkeeper and was familiar with his affairs, took up the business of exclusive administration at his uncle’s death, and continued until the time of his own death. Books carefully kept by himself show the course of administration. In the investigation here the deposits were eliminated. From the date of Thompson Bell’s death until his own, the assets were practically in his possession; and when therefore Mrs. Bell died and letters were granted to him no transfer was necessary. Among these assets there was at that time a cash balance on hand of $2,235.34 on deposit, subject to his control. Even if this fund had not in fact been in his possession, his own books showed a liability for this amount on Mrs. Bell’s part which it would have been his “proper duty” to have enforced because they were decedent’s assets in course of administration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[225,1225,1156,890]]]'>2. In 1881, Mr. Bell bought a tract of land in Stowe township, which he subdivided into a plan of lots, and afterwards conveyed the legal title to certain of these lots to Mrs. Bell, for reasons which have not been explained and are not material. When Mrs. Bell died in 1896, the legal title to some of these lots still remained in her, and in 1899 James M. Bell as administrator sold Thompson Bell’s equity in them to Mrs. Bell’s children for $20,000. This appears in the ledger of the Western Bank in his handwriting on the credit side without date in the account of “Stowe Township lots,” page 535 as follows: “Sold to account of E. M. Bell, guardian, $20,000;” and on page 128 debit side of same ledger, “March 30th, 1899, Stowe Township lots 40 — $20,000.” Corresponding entries appear in books kept by Mr. Bell for Mrs. Bell as guardian of her children, and continued by him after her death known as “E. M. Bell guardian account.” These entries are:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b394-11" data-blocks='[["BL_394.7",394,[303,793,1156,1397]]]'>These guardian books show on hand when the entries were made over $31,000 — which was reduced to the extent of this $20,000 payment on March 30, 1899. No deed was made by Mr. Bell, although he had power under Thompson Bell’s will; Sheets’s Estate, <a href="/pa/215/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="215 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="948346" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0164-01">215 Pa. 164</a>; but it is enough that his method of extinguishing the equitable title was approved and ratified by Mrs. Bell’s children. Objection is made that this is simply a method of bookkeeping; that it does not appear that a dollar was ever paid by Mrs. Bell’s children to James M. Bell. Aside from the significance of these entries, it is answered that there is no reason why Mrs. Bell’s children should be given this credit; they are not the only parties interested in the fund under Thompson Bell’s will; and that James M. Bell who was acting executor under Mrs. Bell credited Mrs. Bell's children with payment of this purchase money as above shown. The suggestion of lack of evidence that Mr. Bell received any purchase money has no merit. His own entries show he made a sale and received the proceeds. There could have been no occasion for these entries unless this was true. Good bookkeeping might have required formal debit and credit of this equitable title as being an unadministered asset on hand if that had been the fact, but the entry of consummated sale was an averment that this was an administered asset ready for distribution. The moving finger writes and having writ moves on; and nothing can change a line or blot out a word of it.</p>

He had exclusive charge of the business and the assets; and the only record of the course of his administration is what he voluntarily wrote in them. He filed no account and ex-ceptants were therefore forced to rely upon these books as representing the facts.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[233,879,1154,591]]]'>It was suggested at the hearing that inasmuch as these accountants inadvertently omitted to claim compensation in the account filed, allowance should be made for Mr. Bell’s services. The question does not appear to be within the scope of the matter submitted; but this court suggests in the interest of justice that the services rendered by Mr. Bell are deserving of recognition. His failure to file an account has, to say the least, increased the expenses of settlement; but in view of the fact that he has rendered valuable services extending over a long period and seems to have kept accurate books, there would seem to be a balance of compensation due him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[233,1479,1156,393]]]'>The accountants have charged themselves with $46,477.89, and the court surcharges them with $79,541.81, making a total of $126,019.70, which may serve as a basis on which commissions may be calculated if the Supreme Court sees fit to make an allowance. Exceptant’s counsel contends that Mr. Bell was fully compensated in Mrs. Bell’s lifetime, but it does not appear that he was compensated for services rendered as administrator.</p>
