        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThe appellant states the question involved to be, \u201cShould the value of a retail liquor business and fixtures be accounted for by an administratrix, who, after ineffectual efforts to sell it, continued the business of her deceased husband as her own?\u201d\nThe appellant charged herself with a value of $1,115.15. The orphans\u2019 court adjudged the value inadequate and surcharged the accountant with a difference of $5,384.85. In making this surcharge the court properly said, \u201cThat the value of good will taken in connection with a continuance of a well-established licensed business .... when ascertained, is an asset of a decedent\u2019s estate, even though the original license itself was a mere personal privilege and does not pass to his representatives, is well settled in a line of cases.\u201d These cases are all reviewed in Aschenbach v. Carey, 224 Pa. 303.\nThe decedent\u2019s estate was insolvent, and the appellant took over the business, good will and fixtures; the license was transferred to her, and subsequently to her new husband, who now holds it. Under these circumstances, when the issue was raised, it was for the orphans\u2019 court to decide whether or not the accountant had charged herself with the full value of the good will, business and fixtures. Upon the evidence before him, the learned auditing judge found that she had not, and determined that their real value was $6,500. This is a finding of fact which under our rulings will not be disturbed unless manifest error is apparent. A careful review of the evidence fails to convince us of any such error.\nCounsel for the appellant explains in his printed argument, \u201cIt will be noted that throughout the proceedings in this estate, the term 'license\u2019 is used .... as synonymous with \u2018business\u2019 or \u2018good will.\u2019 It is not contended by either side that the license as such had any value, but only as was said in Buck\u2019s Est., 185 Pa. 57, that 'The opportunity to secure a transfer of the license and a renewal at the end of the year may materially affect the value of the fixtures and good will.\u2019 . . .\u201d\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed.",

The value of good will taken in connection with a continuance of a well-established licensed liquor business, is, when ascertained, an asset of a decedent\u2019s estate, even though the original license itself was a mere personal privilege which did not pass to his representatives.\n2. Where the administratrix of the estate of an insolvent liquor dealer takes over the business, good will and fixtures, and the license is transferred first to herself, and subsequently to her second husband, the value of the good will is an asset of the estate, and the finding by the orphans\u2019 court of such value in money, when based upon sufficient evidence, is a finding of fact, which will not be disturbed by the Supreme Court in the absence of manifest error.\nArgued Oct. 26, 1910.\nAppeal, No. 129, Oct. T., 1910,' by Annie M. Graeser, now Annie M. Watkins, Adminis-tratrix, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., Feb. T., 1910, No. 100, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Philip Graeser, deceased.\nBefore Bkown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nMiller, J., stated the facts to be as follows:\nPhilip Graeser died October 14, 1908; he owned and conducted a licensed hotel or saloon at No. 124 Wabash avenue, in the city of Pittsburg; he bought the land and buildings, license, good will and stock from the former owner who had been a licensed vender there for twenty-eight years, in July, 1907,- for about $17,000, of which the license, fixtures, stock and third-floor furnishment, exclusive of the real estate, was valued at $8,600; the daily receipts of the bar at that time averaged $50.00.\nFollowing Graeser\u2019s death, his widow, the accountant, had the license duly transferred to herself individually; she took, possession of the stock of liquors and fixtures and continued to operate and conduct the place as her husband had done in his lifetime. In March, 1909, she applied for and was' granted a new license, paying the fee of $1,000 from the funds of this estate. Later she remarried, and removed from the premises, but owns and conducts the same as in the former manner under some delegated management. She asserts that she holds the premises, license, good will, etc., now and has continued to hold them as trustee for Graeser\u2019s creditors.\nIn the inventory filed by her as administratrix, the stock, license and bar fixtures are valued at $1,115.15, with which she charges herself in the present account. The decedent\u2019s debts as proven exceed $10,000, consisting largely of unpaid liquor accounts. In August, 1909, she was offered $8,500 for the place, exclusive of the real estate, including the license, stock, good will and fixtures, which she accepted, but for some reason the transfer was refused by the quarter sessions court. The daily receipts have been from $20.00 to $35.00; there is testimony estimating the value of this good will and license of the place at from $3,000 to $4,000, assuming the transferee should retain possession as a licensed vender of liquors.\nThe court surcharged the accountant with $5,384.85.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\n\"E. W. Arthur, with him J. M. Magee and W. S. Thomas, for appellant.\nJanuary 3, 1911:\nCharles Mitchell, for appellee,\ncited: Mueller\u2019s Est., 190 Pa. 601."
