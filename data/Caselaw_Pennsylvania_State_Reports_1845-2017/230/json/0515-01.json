The judgment was entered without notice on the first day after the expiration of the year. The statute of limitations would be a bar to a new action on the claim. The rules of court under which the judgment was entered, provide that \u201cJudgments by default may be set aside or opened at the discretion of the court, when deemed necessary for the purpose of justice,\u201d and that the court may enlarge the time to declare or plead on cause shown. There is therefore, no question of the construction of a rule of court, for there is nothing to construe, nor of the violation by a court of its rule for there was no violation. The matter was within the discretion of the court.\nThe order is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.",
