A nonsuit was entered because of the failure to prove any damages, and the assignments of error relate to the rejection of offers of testimony. The plaintiff had not been deprived of possession but the access to his property had been interfered with and he moved before the termination of his lease and during the course of the improvement. Proof of the cost of his fixtures was clearly inadmissible and on the proper test of the measure of damages, the difference in value of his leasehold estate before and after the change of grade, his witnesses were not qualified to testify. They had no special knowledge of the subject and what knowledge they had was obtained by an examination of the reports of road juries, and the awards made to tenants of other properties in the vicinity and their opinions were based wholly or in part on their knowledge of these awards. This would have been the use of the opinion of other persons in relation to other property.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

In such a case witnesses are not qualified to testify, whose only knowledge on the subject was obtained by an examination of the reports of road juries, and the awards made to tenants of other properties in the vicinity, and whose opinions are based wholly or in part on their knowledge of these awards.\n3. Proof of the cost of the tenant\u2019s fixtures are clearly inadmissible on the question of damages.\nArgued Jan. 9, 1911.\nAppeal, No. 291, Jan.
