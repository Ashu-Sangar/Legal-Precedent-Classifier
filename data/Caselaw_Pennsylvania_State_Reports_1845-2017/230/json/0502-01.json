        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nThe question presented by this appeal, is whether a devise of all the residue of an estate to three daughters, \u201cto their and each of their heirs, executors and assigns, to be for their and each of their support and maintenance, notwithstanding any coverture, and not to be in any manner liable for the contracts, debts or engagements, or subject to control of any of their said husbands,\u201d creates a separate use trust for one of the daughters, who is at the time of the execution of the will, in contemplation of marriage.\n, In the opinion of the orphans\u2019 court, the language employed by the testator makes the exclusion of the marital rights of the husband a part of the gift to the daughter, and this appears so clearly that the validity of the trust must follow. When the purpose to create a separate use trust, is clear, no particular form of words is necessary: Steinmetz\u2019s Est., 168 Pa. 171; Scott v. Bryan, 194 Pa. 41. Nor is it necessary that a trustee should be appointed, or active duties be imposed. It is only needful that the instrument clearly indicate the intention of the donor: Mac-Connell v. Lindsay, 131 Pa. 476, 482. Afterwards, in MacConnell v. Wright, 150 Pa. 275, it was held that when the language of the will in question was read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, the doctrine of the former case was inapplicable; but that the court stood by the doctrine of MacConnell v. Lindsay clearly appears from the opinion in Hays v. Leonard, 155 Pa. 474, 480.\nThat the court below was right in its construction of the will in the present case, we have no doubt. The language used impresses us as being quite sufficient to create a separate use trust. In Pennsylvania the estate subject to a separate use may be for life: Souder\u2019s Est., 203 Pa. 293; or it may be an absolute estate: Shields v. McAuley, 205 Pa. 45. The words of the will before us, after an absolute gift to testator\u2019s daughters, are: \u201cto be for their and each of their support and maintenance, notwithstanding any coverture, and not to be in any manner liable for the contracts, debts or engagements, or subject to control of any of their said husbands.\u201d The following words have been held to create a separate use trust: \u201cFor her own use:\u201d Jamison v. Brady, 6 S. & R. 465. \u201cTo and for the only proper use and behoof of:\u201d Thomas v. Folwell, 2 Whart. 11. \u201cTo be for her and her family\u2019s use:\u201d Heck v. Clippenger, 5 Pa. 385. \u201cFor her own proper use:\u201d Snyder v. Snyder, 10 Pa. 423. \u201cWholly for her own use and benefit, and subject to her own control:\u201d MacConnell v. Lindsay, 131 Pa. 476; approved in MacConnell v. Wright, 150 Pa. 275, as to the effect of the words standing alone, although, as noted above, in the light of extrinsic circumstances, it was held that a separate use trust was not created. We regard the words in the will of the testator, \u201cto be for their support and maintenance\u201d as being fully equivalent to those just cited, as \u201cfor their own use,\u201d and \u201cfor their own use and benefit,\u201d and the additional words \u201cnotwithstanding any coverture\u201d make the intention of the testator to guard his daughter in the enjoyment of the estate he was providing for her, as clear as though he had used the technical expression \u201cfor her sole and separate use.\u201d Any other construction would ignore the manifest purpose of the testator in qualifying the absolute gift to his daughter. Counsel for appellant cites and presses strongly upon us the case of Murray v. Lowrie, 208 Pa. 1, as authority against the construction adopted by the court below. But in addition to the point noted by Judge Penkose, that the exclusion of the marital rights of the husband is here wrought into the very fiber of the gift to the daughters, there is the additional fact that in the language under consideration in Murray v. Lowrie, supra, there was nothing equivalent to \u201cfor their and each of their support and maintenance notwithstanding any coverture.\u201d\nThese English cases illustrate the question before us. In Darley v. Darley, 3 Atk. 398, an estate was given to a husband for the livelihood of his wife, and it was held that he was to be considered a trustee for her separate use. Lord Hardwick said (p. 399): \u201cTechnical words are not necessary to make it a separate trust, for the word livelihood is sufficient to show the intention of the giver that it should be for her sole and separate use.\u201d Livelihood of course has the same meaning as \u201csupport and maintenance.\u201d In Cape v. Cape, 2 Y. & C. Ex. 543, the words \u201csupport and maintenance\u201d were construed. By a codicil to his will testator directed that a legacy of \u00a3300 should \u201cbe applied to the support and maintenance of the wife of my said son Henry and for the support and education of his children born in wedlock.\u201d There were no children at the date of the will or of testator\u2019s death. It was held by Baron Alderson (p. 546) that the wife took the legacy \u201cabsolutely to her separate use.\u201d In Lee v. Prieaux, 3 Bro. Ch. *381, it was held that (syllabus) a \u201clegacy to a feme covert, \u2018her receipt to be a sufficient discharge to the executors,\u2019 is equivalent with saying \u2018to her sole and separate use.\u2019\u201d The master of the rolls refers (p. 318) to the words \u201cnotwithstanding her coverture\u201d as sufficient to indicate an intention to create a separate use trust, and cites a manuscript case, Woodman v. Horsley, decided February 11, 1783, where the words \u201cthe wife\u2019s receipt shall be a sufficient discharge, notwithstanding her coverture,\u201d were held to constitute a trust for the wife.\nAnd in our own case of Winthrop Company v. Clinton, 196 Pa. 472, the syllabus reads: \u201cTestator gave his estate to his executors to pay the net income to his wife 'into her hands for her separate use and maintenance during all the term of her natural life,\u2019 and after her decease to pay the net income to his son 'for his use and support for and during all the term of his natural life, and not to be liable to anticipation, and his receipt alone to be the sole discharge\u2019 to the trustees. There was a gift over after the son\u2019s death. Held, that a spendthrift trust was created in favor of the son.\u201d\nWhile the question whether there was a separate use trust for the widow did not arise, Mr. Chief Justice Green said (p. 475-76): \u201cWe think it will hardly be contended that this provision in favor of the widow was not adequately protected against the claims of any creditors she might have. . . . The word 'maintenance,\u2019 in the wife\u2019s case, speaks for itself, and needs no interpretation.\u201d After considering various definitions of the word \u201csupport,\u201d the opinion holds that \u201cmaintenance\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d have the same meaning, and. both indicate an intention to protect the estates given, in the case of the wife, by a separate use trust, and in that of the son, by a spendthrift trust.\nIn the present case, we are satisfied that the testator did intend to create a separate use trust for the benefit of his daughter. The assignments of error are dismissed, and the decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed.",

T., 1910, by Laura A. Davis, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Jan. Term, 1887, No. 378, dismissing petition of Laura A..

J.\nThe facts appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nError assigned was in dismissing the petition.\nFrederick J. Shoyer, with him Henry Arronson, for appellant.\nThe question whether the testator has created a separate use trust estate is always one of intention, but the burden is upon those claiming that he intended to create a separate use trust estate to show this, by language clearly indicating such intent: MacConnell v. Lindsay, 131 Pa. 476; Morrison v. Dollar Savings Bank, 36 Leg. Int. 215; Rank v. Rank, 120 Pa. 191; Ringe v. Kellner, 99 Pa. 460; Todd\u2019s App., 24 Pa. 429.\nThe failure to name a trustee, is an element to be taken into consideration: Todd\u2019s App., 24 Pa. 429; Murray v. Lowrie, 208 Pa. 1; Chadwick v. Stroud, 27 Pa. C. C. Rep. 393; McClelland v. Floyd, 52 Pitts. L. J. 163.\nThe creation of a sole and separate use trust estate being a question of intent, other cases of construction of wills may assist but not control in the conclusion to be reached in this one. It is to be observed that the same judge who delivered the opinion in Murray v. Lowrie, 208 Pa. 1, delivered the opinion in Holliday v. Ilively, 198 Pa. 335, and it is impossible to reconcile the opinions in the two cases, with reference to the propositions enunciated by Haines v. Ellis, 24 Pa. 253, and Ringe v. Kellner, 99 Pa. 460, and Bailey v. Allegheny National Bank, 104 Pa. 425.\nT. Walter Gilkyson, with him Martin H. Stutzbach for appellee.\nThe burden is upon the appellant to show that in presenting her petition for a trustee she was clearly mistaken, that the will of her father did not create a separate use trust, and that the court should not have appointed a trustee. The question whether or not a separate use trust was created depends solely on the intent of the testator as expressed in his will: Scott v. Bryan, 194 Pa. 41; Wilbert\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 113; Pierce v. McKeehan,\nFebruary 27, 1911:\n3 W. & S. 280; Jamison v. Brady, 6 S. & R. 465; Wilson v. Bryn Mawr Trust Co., 225 Pa. 139.\nTechnical words such as \u201csole,]\u201d \u201cseparate,\u201d \u201cown\u201d or \u201cexclusive\u201d are not necessary for the creation of a separate use trust: Heck v. Clippenger, 5 Pa. 385; Steinmetz\u2019s Est., 168-Pa. 171; Scott v. Bryan, 194 Pa. 41; Berg's Appeal, 166 Pa. 113. j\nThe naming of a trustee or an express gift \u201cin trust\u201d is not necessary: MacConnell v. Lindsay, 131 Pa. 476; Wright v. Brown, 44 Pa. 224. ;\nThe fact that an estate in fee is granted is ii\u00f1material in determining whether or not a separate use trust has been created: Steinmetz\u2019s Est., 3 Pa. Dist. Rep. 440; Wilbert\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 113."
