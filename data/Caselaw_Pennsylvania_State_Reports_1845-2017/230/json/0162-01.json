        "text": "Per Curiam,\nIn a proceeding instituted by Josephine A. Coles, under the Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, the court below made a decree securing to her the privileges of a feme sole trader, and from it her husband has taken this appeal. His appeal, if he had a right to take it, is to be treated merely as a certiorari. As to his objection that the court erred in taking jurisdiction, it is sufficient to say that in addition to the appellee\u2019s averments in her petition that she was the wife of the appellant and the owner of real estate, there is jurisdictional averment of his desertion of her. This was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction; and it further appears from the record that, before the court granted her a certificate, it had appeared that due notice of the hearing of the application had been given to the husband and that the court had been satisfied by the testimony of at least two responsible witnesses of the justice and propriety of the petitioner\u2019s application. This met every requirement of the fourth section of the act.\nThe second objection of the appellant is that his wife \u2022was not a competent witness. No objection was made to her competency when she was called and examined; but, aside from this, two other witnesses were called, who testified that the husband had not lived with her for more than a year before her application was filed.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.",

    "head_matter": "Coles\u2019s Case.\nMarried women \u2014 Husband and wife \u2014 Feme sole trader \u2014 Appeals\u2014 Certiorari \u2014 Evidence.\n1. An appeal by a husband from an order of court declaring his wife a feme sole trader is to be treated merely as a certiorari.\n2. An averment in a petition by a married woman to have herself declared a feme sole trader, of her husband\u2019s desertion of her, gives the court jurisdiction.\n3. Where on a petition by a married woman to have herself declared a feme sole trader it appears that the husband had due notice of the hearing, and two responsible witnesses satisfy the court of the propriety of the petitioner\u2019s application, the action of the court in granting the petition wall not be reversed. In such a case the question as to whether the wife was a competent witness is immaterial, and will not be considered by the appellate court, and this is especially so where no objection was made as to her competency in the lower court.\nArgued Oct. 26, 1910.\nAppeal, No. 139, Oct. T., 1910, by Noah Coles, from decree of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., March T., 1909, No. 732, declaring a woman a feme sole trader In re Petition of Josephine A. Coles.\nBefore Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition to declare a woman a feme sole trader.\nThe petition was as follows:\nThe petition of Josephine A. Coles respectfully represents :\nThat she is the wife of Noah Coles, to whom she was married on October 22, 1903, and that she resides at and owns real estate at No. 5640 Rural avenue in the city of Pittsburg, Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, and also owns other real estate in said city:\nPetitioner avers that her husband, the said Noah Coles, deserted your petitioner on or about January 19, 1908, and since said time petitioner has never seen or heard from said Noah Coles, and the said Noah Coles since said date has neglected to provide for your petitioner, his wife.\nWherefore your petitioner prays that your honorable court will make a decree and grant her a certificate that she shall have all the rights and privileges seemed to a feme sole trader as provided by the Act of assembly of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430.\nNoah Coles, petitioner\u2019s husband, filed an answer denying the desertion, and supported this denial by his testimony at the hearing.\nThe court granted the petition.\nError assigned was order granting the petition.\nJohn D. Watson, with him Haven V. Wolf, for appellant.\nThe court erred in taking jurisdiction of said matter because, under said petition, the court was without jurisdiction to make said order: Cleaver v. Scheetz, 70 Pa. 496.\nJosephine A. Coles was not a competent witness in this case: Ca\u00f1\u00f3le v. Allen, 222 Pa. 156.\nThe court erred in finding from the testimony given that No\u00e1h Coles had willfully and maliciously deserted his said wife, Josephine A. Coles, and had willfully refused and neglected to support her: Weiler v. Greiner, 34 Legal Int. 13; King v. Thompson, 87 Pa. 365.\nJanuary 3, 1911:\nRobert B. Petty, Jr., with him R. B. Petty and Wm. F. Petty, for appellee."
