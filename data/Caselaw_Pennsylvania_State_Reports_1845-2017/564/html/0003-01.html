The scientific testimony was based on data from epidemiological studies, chemical structure analysis, <em>in vitro </em>(test tube) and <em>in vivo </em>(animal) teratology studies, as well as unpublished “recalculations” performed on the findings of previously published studies. The trial court apparently admitted the testimony under the evidentiary rule embodied in <em>Daubert, </em>and the jury returned a verdict for the Blums and against Merrell Dow in the amount of $19.2 million, including $15 million in punitive damages. Merrell Dow moved unsuccessfully for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal, Superior Court held that it was error for the trial court to apply <em>Daubert, </em>a standard somewhat less exacting than that of <em>Frye, </em>after this court specifically deferred a decision on that question.

Under <em>Daubert, </em>expert scientific testimony is admissible if it fulfills two criteria. First, it must relate to “scientific knowledge,” thereby establishing “a standard of evidentiary reliability,” which “will be based upon scientific validity.” To constitute scientific knowledge, the evidence must be grounded in the methods and procedures of science, based on more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation, and supported by appropriate scientific validation. The second criterion is that the evidence must be relevant; it must assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Under <em>Daubert, </em>in federal trials, “general acceptance” no longer constitutes a threshold necessity in determining admissibility. Other factors are whether the technique or methodology can be or has been tested, <em>i.e., </em>its “falsifiability, or refutability, or testability.” Another consideration is whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication. Other factors bearing on scientific validation are the known or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique’s operation. <em>Crews, supra, </em>536 Pa. at 518 n. 2, 640 A.2d at 400 n. 2.</p>

Over thirty published epidemiological studies have found no statistically-significant association between Bendectin and limb defects; the FDA, after complete review in the 1980s, found that available evidence showed no basis for a conclusion that Bendectin causes or increases the risk of birth defects in humans. Nevertheless, Dr. Done, who is not an epidemiologist, discounted such conclusions on the basis of a selective review of the data from several of these studies, in which he detached the underlying data from the controls set up by the studies, and recalculated using simple math (as opposed to epidemiological principles). In effect, Dr. Done worked backwards through the science, from the statistical results back to the original mere associations that led to the studies in the first place.

It is certainly not incumbent on this court to engage in a point-by-point analysis of a lower court’s opinion. However, I believe that in this matter it is important to discuss the Superior Court’s recitation of the <em>Frye </em>test as it has the potential to mislead the lower courts and the practicing bar. Specifically, I refer to the Superior Court’s statement that there are “two ways to analyze the question of whether the causation testimony proffered ... meets the <em>Frye </em>... standard. One focuses on whether the causal relationship is generally accepted by the scientific community, and the other on whether the methodology is generally accepted by the scientific community.” <a href="/a2d/705/1314-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="705 A.2d 1314" data-case-ids="11878703" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/1314-01">705 A.2d at 1322</a>.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[177,1075,1155,360]]]'>The Superior Court is correct that this court has long interpreted <em>Frye </em>as requiring that the <em>methodology </em>employed by the testifying scientist be generally accepted in the scientific community. <em>See e.g. Commonwealth v. Blasioli, </em><a href="/pa/552/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="552 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="559435" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0149-01">552 Pa. 149</a>, <a href="/a2d/713/1117-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="713 A.2d 1117" data-case-ids="11827232,559435" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/1117-01,/pa/552/0149-01">713 A.2d 1117</a>, 1119 (1998). Yet, we have not stated that the <em>conclusion </em>reached by the scientist regarding causation must also be generally accepted in the scientific community.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[176,1461,1155,353]]]'>As noted by the Superior Court, this additional step in the <em>Frye </em>test — requiring that the conclusion also be generally accepted by the scientific community — was added by the Commonwealth Court in <em>McKenzie v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em><a href="/a2d/674/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="674 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="7869766" data-case-paths="/a2d/674/1167-01">674 A.2d 1167</a> (Pa.Commw.Ct.1996).

The <em>Frye </em>standard is limited to an inquiry into whether the <em>methodologies </em>by which the scientist has reached her conclusions have been generally accepted in the scientific community. This is a sensible standard, one which imposes appropriate restrictions while stopping short of being needlessly inflexible. It restricts the scientific evidence which may be admitted as it ensures that the proffered evidence results from scientific research which has been conducted in a fashion that is generally recognized as being <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>sound, and is not the fanciful creations of a renegade researcher. Yet, such a standard is not senselessly restrictive for it allows a scientist to testify as to new conclusions which have emerged during the course of properly conducted research. Thus, I would squarely reject that portion of the Superior Court’s holding which would require that a scientist’s conclusions, as well as the methodologies utilized in reaching those conclusions, are generally accepted in the medical community.</p>

The trial court claimed it properly applied the <em>Frye </em>standard in making the determination that Appellants’ scientific evidence was admissible. Tr. ct. slip op. at 50 n. 143. The Superior Court, on the other hand, concluded that while the trial court claimed that it was applying the <em>Frye </em>standard, it did not in fact do so. The Superior Court found that the trial court abandoned its role of keeping out junk science as a “gatekeeper,” and instead improperly left in the hands of the jury the initial determination of whether the scientific evidence was reliable. <a href="/a2d/705/1314-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="705 A.2d 1314" data-case-ids="11878703" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/1314-01">705 A.2d at 1322</a>.

Rather, I believe that in situations such as these, an appellate court attempting to “review” the decision of the trial court would instead be performing its own, independent review of the evidence, arriving at its own <em>Frye </em>conclusion rather than reviewing the <em>Frye </em>determination made by the trial court. For, how can an appellate court be said to be reviewing the determination of the trial court where there <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>is so much confusion as to what the trial court actually decided?</p>

In my opinion, this crucial gatekeeper function is one which demands the particular skills and abilities of a trial court judge, and should not be commended to an appellate court in the first instance. Thus, in recognition of the special function played by the trial court judge in these determinations, I believe that where, as in this case, there is confusion as to which standard was applied, it would be prudent to remand the matter to the trial court for a new trial and therefore respectfully dissent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

The trial court found, and the record amply demonstrates, that, with untold millions of dollars at its disposal, and untold millions more at stake, Merrell Dow was able to create and influence a scientific subdiscipline devoted to result-driven studies that Merrell Dow could then cite to defeat lawsuits brought by those who alleged that their birth defects were caused by Merrell Dow’s Bendectin.</p>

The only dispute involved their <em>conclusions </em>on causation. The record here — a record never discussed by the majority — overwhelmingly supports this finding. Indeed, even Dr. Brent admitted that the four scientific methodologies employed by appellants’ experts — chemical structure analysis, <em>in vitro </em>analysis, <em>in vivo </em>animal studies and human epidemiological data<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_9" id="ref_footnote_3_9">9</a> — were the generally accepted methodologies utilized by the relevant sci<a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>entific community to examine whether Bendectin caused birth defects such as Jeffrey Blum’s clubfeet.

The flaw in this reasoning is that it conclusively determines that no opinion other than the initial researcher’s may ever be heard.

Even if some justification was needed to explain why the appellants’ experts interpreted the data differently, the explanation was forthcoming. The appellants’ evidence demonstrated that the conclusions in the studies that Bendectin was not a teratogen— studies often subsidized by Merrell Dow — were based upon severe underestimates of the significance of Bendectin’s association with birth defects. This resulted from both poor study designs as well as a fraudulent failure to report data. For example, in Merrell Dow’s Bunde-Bowles epidemiological study, the women taking Bendectin in some cases were also designated as the control match for themselves. Furthermore, some women in the control group had taken Bendectin while some women in the Bendectin group had not taken Bendectin. Done Testimony at 2121a, 2151a. In another epidemiological study that received funding from Merrell Dow, the Jick study, the researcher calculated his results using only part of the data he collected — omitting data obtained between 1976 and 1977 — which obviously undermined the conclusions on causation suggested in that study. <em><a href="/a2d/705/1314-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="705 A.2d 1314" data-case-ids="11878703" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/1314-01">Id.</a> </em>at 2169a, 2998a.

The Shapiro Heinonen study examined the effects of ingestion of certain drug compounds (including the compound in Bendectin) during the first four months of pregnancy. Dr. Shapiro’s statistical analysis of the data concluded that 63% more children had birth defects when their mothers ingested the chemical compound in Bendectin within the first four months of development than when they had not taken Bendectin. N.T. 5/23/94 at 1182. Dr. Shapiro reached this number by reducing the raw numbers of cases involving birth defects by accounting for hospital-by-hospital deviation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_10" id="ref_footnote_3_10">10</a> and comparing the hospital standardized data against the control group. The effect of Shapiro’s “standardization” was to reduce the instances of an apparent causal relationship between Bendectin and birth defects. Dr. Shapiro did not believe the incidence of birth defects detected in his interpretation of the data was statistically significant and, accordingly, concluded that Bendectin was not a teratogen.</p>

First, the Shapiro-Heinonen study underestimated the probability of Bendectin’s causing limb malformations because the study included women who took the drug beyond the period in pregnancy where limb bud development occurs. N.T. 5/23/94 at 1298.

In Merrell Dow’s Bunde-Bowles study, for example, the company did not standardize the data for hospital deviation. <em>See e.g., </em>Defendant’s Exhibit 251. Merrell Dow had also relied upon a study completed by a Dr. Paul Stolley that used the recalculation “methodology” to analyze a study completed by Dr. Smithell. <em>See </em>Defendant Exhibit 3057; Hoekenga Testimony at 152a.

Merrell Dow subsidized or otherwise influenced most of the studies that concluded that Bendectin does not cause birth defects. Merrell Dow’s role in virtually creating, and then slanting, the “scientific community” should be a relevant factor in the <em>Frye </em>analysis.
