Gray </em>addressed one of the questions that <em>Richardson </em>had left open: <em>i.e., </em>“whether redaction that replaces a defendant’s name with an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space, the word ‘deleted’ or a similar symbol, still falls within <em>Bruton's </em>protective rule.” <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">523 U.S. at 192</a>, <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. at 1155</a>.

Whenever Gray’s name, or the name of a third co-conspirator who had died prior to trial, Jacquin Vanlandingham, appeared in the confession, the police officer who read the statement into evidence substituted the word “deleted” or “deletion.” Immediately after the officer had finished reading the confession to the jury, the prosecutor asked him, “after he gave you that information, you subsequently were able to arrest Mr. Kevin Gray, is that correct?” The police officer responded, “That’s correct,” thus reinforcing the implication that one of the deletions referred to Gray. The prosecution also introduced into evidence a written copy of the confession, which contained a blank space set off by commas appearing wherever Gray’s name or Vanlandingham’s name appeared. Thus, unlike the redaction in <em>Richardson, </em>which removed not only the defendant’s name but any reference to her existence, the co-defendant’s redacted confession in <em>Gray </em>“referr[ed] directly to the existence of the non-confessing defendant.” <em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">Id.</a></em>

The Court gave an example in which the statement “I, Bob Smith, along with Sam Jones, robbed the bank” was redacted to read, “I, Bob Smith, along with ——-, robbed the bank.” The Court explained that, “[a] juror who does not know the law and who therefore wonders to whom the blank might refer need only lift his eyes to Jones, sitting at counsel table, to find what will seem the obvious answer, at least if the juror hears the judge’s instruction not to consider the confession as evidence against Jones, <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>for that instruction will provide an obvious reason for the blank.” <em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">at 193</a>, <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. at 1155</a>. The Court also noted that the obvious deletion may well call the juror’s attention to the omitted name: “By encouraging the jury to speculate about the reference, the redaction may overemphasize the importance of the confession’s accusation once the jurors work out the reference.” <em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">at 193</a>, <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. at 1155-56</a>. Finally, the Court noted that, like the statements in <em>Bruton, </em>the statements in <em>Gray </em>were directly accusatory: “The blank space in an obviously redacted confession also points directly to the defendant and it accuses the defendant in a manner similar to Evans’ use of Bruton’s name or to a testifying co-defendant’s accusatory finger.” <em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">at 194</a>, <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. at 1156</a>. Thus, the Court concluded that the <em>Gray </em>redaction presented the same confrontation problem as the non-redaction in <em>Bruton: </em>the defendant was expressly implicated in the confession of the non-testifying co-defendant. Although the defendant in <em>Gray </em>was not specifically named in the confession, the Court concluded that it was nonetheless clear, from the face of the confession itself, that he was the other man.</p>

The Court “concede[d]” that <em>Richardson </em>had placed outside the scope of the <em>Bruton </em>rule statements that incriminate inferentially, and that the jury in <em>Gray </em>had to employ an inference to connect the blanks in that redacted confession to the defendant. <em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">Id.</a> </em>But the Court refined <em>Richardson, </em>concluding that inference “pure and simple” could not make the critical difference in a <em>Bruton </em>analysis, since that would exclude shortened first names, nicknames, unique descriptions and the like from <em>Bruton’s </em>sweep, while the Court, in other cases, had already at least assumed that the rule would cover those circumstances. <em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">at 195</a>,<a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. at 1156</a>.

Specifically, the co-defendant’s statement here was redacted to replace references to appellant by name with the term “the other man.” Although this was not the type of redaction at issue in <em>Gray, </em>the <em>Gray </em>Court’s reasoning, including its distinction of <em>Richardson, </em>leaves little question that this sort of redaction is appropriate under the Sixth Amendment. At a minimum, as one Circuit Court has noted, the Supreme Court “strongly implied” in <em>Gray </em>that a redaction employing a neutral pronoun such as “the other guy” does not offend the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Akinkoye, <a href="/f3d/185/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="185 F.3d 192" data-case-ids="11584155" data-case-paths="/f3d/185/0192-01">185 F.3d 192</a>, 198 </em>(4th Cir. 1999).</p>

The redacted statement here neither referred to appellant by name (the <em>Bruton </em>proscription) nor did it contain an obvious indication of a deletion or an alteration that was the functional equivalent of naming him (the <em>Gray </em>proscription). Indeed, use of a neutral pronoun is not an obvious <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>alteration at all: “For all the jury knew, these were [the non-testifying co-defendant’s] actual words, not a modified version of them.” <em>Logan, </em><a href="/f3d/210/0820-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="210 F.3d 820" data-case-ids="11532002" data-case-paths="/f3d/210/0820-01">210 F.3d at 823</a>.

Instead, as in <em>Richardson, </em>the redacted statement could become incriminating only through independent evidence introduced at trial which established the defendant’s complicity and, even then, only if it is assumed that the jury ignored the court’s charge.</p>
