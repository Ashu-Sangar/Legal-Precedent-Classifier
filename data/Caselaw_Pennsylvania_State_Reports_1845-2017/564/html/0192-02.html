      <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>In February of 1997, N.B., a former girlfriend of Appellee, Gregory A. Baker (“Baker”), acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a petition for protection pursuant to the PFA, using the standard form then employed in the Court of Common Pleas for York County, similar to that which is presently prescribed by Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1905 (effective July 1, 1998). N.B. alleged that, on one occasion, Baker had physically assaulted her and, on another occasion, entered her apartment without permission and verbally threatened her life; through standardized language in the form petition, N.B. also affirmed that she was in immediate danger of further abuse, and that a court order was necessary to protect her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> The trial court entered a temporary protection order pursuant to section 6107(b) of the PFA. The order provided, in pertinent part, that “[Baker] shall refrain from abusing, harassing, threatening and stalking [N.B.] or placing her in fear of abuse in any place where she may be found”; indicated that any violation would constitute contempt of court; and scheduled a hearing concerning the availability of a permanent order. Like the petition, the temporary order was also inscribed upon a standardized form, with the pertinent language being substantively identical to the form of order currently provided in Rule 1905.</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[192,1545,1152,517]],["BL_326.1",326,[263,326,1163,256]]]'>Two deputy sheriffs undertook the task of serving the order upon Baker at the York County Prison, where he was incarcerated for unrelated charges. Baker was brought to the prison admissions area, at which time the order was read and explained to him, and he acknowledged receipt in writing. Subsequently, while departing the admissions area, Baker said, “I’m going to kill this bitch.” Overhearing this statement, the deputies lodged a criminal complaint against Baker in the nature of indirect criminal contempt, alleging a violation of the temporary protection order. The trial court scheduled <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>a hearing on the charge, and subsequently issued a bench warrant for Baker’s arrest when, he failed to present himself at the appointed time (apparently he had been released from his incarceration for the unrelated offense). Baker was then jailed for approximately two months pending hearing.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[264,604,1162,947]]]'>At the hearing, the parties stipulated to the above facts, and the trial court found Baker guilty and sentenced him to “time served to six-months,” the latter representing the maximum penalty available under the PFA for the offense of indirect criminal contempt. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 6114(b). The trial court found that N.B. was the subject of Baker’s statement, but noted that the record did not reflect that N.B. had ever been informed of the statement. However, the trial court did not believe that the statement needed to be communicated to N.B., since “threat” was defined as “an expression of an intention to inflict pain, injury or evil...” and the statement was clearly a threat which applied to N.B. Trial court order at 3, 4. Moreover, the court was persuaded by the fact that Baker knew of the court order, yet uttered a threat to kill N.B. in deliberate disregard of that order. Based upon these factors, the court concluded that Baker’s conduct, uttering a threat in the presence of third parties, constituted indirect criminal contempt.</p>
    <p id="b326-6" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[264,1575,1161,470]]]'>On appeal, Baker asserted that under the facts of this case, the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty of indirect criminal contempt.

More persuasively, Baker asserts that the order in this case was not <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>specific enough to put him on notice that a threat could include communications to third parties.

    <p id="b330-9" data-blocks='[["BL_330.9",330,[259,1886,1162,473]],["BL_331.1",331,[185,314,1149,201]]]'>Certainly, as the majority effectively concedes, there should be no uncertainty that the proscription against “threatening” would generally bar public expressions of an intent to kill another — the common understanding of the term does not entail an element of presence or communication vis-á-vis the intended victim. <em>See, e.g., </em>Webster’s New World College Dictionary (4th ed.1999) (defining the term “threat” as “an expression of intention to hurt, destroy, punish, etc.”). It may be, then, that the majority relies upon the order’s employment <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>of the phrase “in any place in which she may be found” as implying a limitation concerning presence or communication. I do not believe, however, that this is either the intent of the order or the likely interpretation of a subject.</p>
    <p id="b331-5" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[185,541,1156,1265]]]'>Significantly, the order under consideration is, for all intents and purposes, identical to the standard form of order for temporary protection from abuse set forth in Rule of Civil Procedure 1905. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. No.1905 (prescribing in the standard form of order that “[djefendant shall not abuse, stalk, harass, threaten the Plaintiff or any other protected person in any place where they might be found”). Presently, therefore, the Court is not merely deciding a case; rather, it is effectively determining the scope of all temporary orders for protection from abuse as implemented through the directive of Rule 1905. The majority’s decision means that, unless and until Rule 1905 is amended, all subjects of temporary protection from abuse orders are free to publicly express their intentions to inflict harm upon the petitioner, so long as there is no evidence of presence or communication. In this regard, I share the concern expressed in the Superior Court dissent that permitting such conduct, which is clearly disrespectful of the court’s intervention, would thwart important purposes of the Act. <em>See Commonwealth v. Baker, </em><a href="/a2d/722/0718-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="722 A.2d 718" data-case-ids="11775788" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0718-01">722 A.2d 718</a>, 724 (Pa.Super.1998)(Orie Melvin, J., dissenting)(emphasizing the Act’s aim of reacting to early signs of abuse and preventing more serious abuse from occurring, as well as its numerous provisions which enable courts to respond quickly and flexibly to advance warnings of abuse).</p>

The record of the underlying PFA case suggests that the trial court entered the temporary protection order without conducting an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding and without the threshold finding that N.B. faced immediate danger. <em>See generally </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 6107(b). Indeed, since N.B. apparently did not pursue the matter beyond the mere filing of her petition, there is no <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>record evidence or finding that she ever suffered abuse or was at risk of harm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> While the court’s temporary protection order so entered was properly served upon Baker, the record of the contempt proceedings (reflected in the form of a stipulation to the fact of the statement and the general circumstances under which it was made) does not reveal specifics concerning the nature of the explanation provided by the deputies who served the order; further, Baker’s offending utterance, having occurred shortly after service of the order, was apparently made without significant opportunity for reflection upon the implications of that order. Nor does the record reflect that the deputies subsequently cautioned Baker concerning the inappropriateness of his comment in light of the order, or were faced with repeated or flagrant conduct. Additionally, while Baker’s comment was certainly an expression of anger directed at N.B., it was not necessarily a description of an actual, intended course of future conduct. While many of these factors would go more to Baker’s degree of culpability than to the fact of a violation, such legal conclusions are more closely intertwined in the area of indirect criminal contempt than in usual judicial proceedings. <em>See generally Cooke v. United, States, </em><a href="/us/267/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="267 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="6143413" data-case-paths="/us/267/0517-01">267 U.S. 517</a>, 538, <a href="/us/267/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="267 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="6143413" data-case-paths="/us/267/0517-01">45 S.Ct. 390</a>, 395, <a href="/us/267/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="267 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="6143413" data-case-paths="/us/267/0517-01">69 L.Ed. 767</a> (1925)(stating that “the intention with which acts of contempt have been committed must necessarily and properly have an important bearing on the degree of guilt and the penalty which should be imposed”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Therefore, while <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>the seriousness of Baker’s utterance cannot reasonably be disputed, some further finding by the trial court related to the intention or effect of Baker’s statement would have been warranted, beyond the mere conclusion that his speech was a voluntary act, prior to the imposition of a sanction reaching to the maximum available penalty. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 6113-14(b)(establishing the maximum period of incarceration for indirect criminal contempt for violation of a protection order as six months). Absent such finding, an appellate court is simply unable to judge whether the punishment of incarceration imposed was reasonably commensurate with the gravity of the offense and an exercise of the least oppressive sanction necessary to redress the violation.</p>

Significantly, courts have been circumspect in their resort to contempt powers, restraint in this area being particularly appropriate since indirect criminal contempt generally involves violation of parameters of acceptable behavior established by the courts, contrasting with the conventional situation in which the judiciary interprets and applies the laws as established by a legislative body. In this sense, the judiciary is itself a subject of the affront by the contemnor and is necessarily in the position of vindicating its own authority. <em>United Mine Workers of America v.
