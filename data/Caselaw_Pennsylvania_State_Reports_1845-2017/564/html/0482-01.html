LaValle, a member of the Senate of Pennsylvania, directed several letters to the Office of General Counsel (“OGC”) seeking access to a report that had been prepared by Ernst &amp; Young LLP, an accounting consultant to the Commonwealth, Department of Transportation (“PennDOT”). Ernst &amp; Young had been retained in connection with litigation commenced against the Commonwealth by Envirotest Partners (“Envirotest”). In this litigation, Envirotest had alleged that, by abandoning a large-scale, centralized automotive emissions testing program, PennDOT breached a government contract providing for Envirotest’s administration of such program; in settlement of this action, the Commonwealth ultimately had paid in excess of $145 million to Envirotest. Apparently having received no response to his prior correspondence, on February 18,1998, Senator LaValle and several other members, of the Senate (including the Honorable Rich<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>ard A.

They assert that the Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young report constitutes a public record pursuant to the Act since it formed the basis for the expenditure by the General Assembly of more than $145 million dollars of public funds in settlement of the Envirotest litigation, and that, as such, it was closely related to or an “essential component” of an account, voucher or contract. The Senators advance no argument contesting OGC’s contention that the report is within the scope of the work product doctrine and therefore outside the definition of public records <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>under the Act. In this regard, the Senators note only that the work product doctrine is not expressly included in the statutory language of the Act, thus apparently suggesting that it may not be a pertinent consideration. The Senators’ core argument, however, is that any claim to privilege or exception from disclosure has been waived by the Commonwealth, since, they allege, the legislative record pertaining to the authorization of the Envirotest settlement indicates that at least some contents of the report were disclosed to selected members of the General Assembly. Reflecting Judge Kelley’s concurring and dissenting opinion, the Senators also emphasize the importance of public disclosure concerning the disbursement of funds of the magnitude reflected in the Envirotest settlement.</p>

The policies that inform such privilege as well as the work product doctrine, however, are pertinent to our construction of the Act as an aid in determining legislative purpose. Notably, in prescribing the right of access to public records, the General Assembly evinced no expression of intention to subject the internal, deliberative aspects of agency decision making to mandatory public scrutiny. Indeed, although it did not craft a specific exception or exclusion for records reflecting deliberative processes or work product, the General Assembly delineated the subjects of mandatory disclosure by reference to concrete decisional implements, namely, minutes, orders, decisions, accounts, vouchers and contracts. Therefore, the underlying mental impressions, opinions and conclusions of agency decision makers and their representatives could qualify as public records under the Act only pursuant to the incremental expansion resulting from the Commonwealth Court’s decisions in relation to the min<a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>utes/orders/decisions category and our extension of this logic to the accounts/vouchers/contracts category. But the materials at issue in the pertinent decisions, such the payroll records in <em>Sapp Roofing, </em>simply have not concerned deliberative aspects of agency decision making. In light of the policy considerations referenced above, and in the absence of some further expression of legislative intent, we decline to infer that by prescribing a right of public access to minutes, orders, decisions, accounts, vouchers and contracts, the General Assembly meant to expose predecisional, internal deliberative aspects of agency decision making to mandatory public scrutiny. Thus, we hold that the definition of public records prescribed in the Right to Know Act, 65 P.S. § 66.1, does not apply to materials or portions thereof which reflect such deliberative aspects.</p>

Public records are subject to disclosure precisely because they reflect the aspects of government decision making identified in the Right to Know Act. For example, in the case of accounts, vouchers and contracts, records are subject to public inspection because they “dealt ] with the receipt or disbursement of funds by an agency or its acquisition, use or disposal of services or of supplies, materials, equipment or other property,” 65 P.S. § 66.1, not because the agency was required to receive or disburse the funds or use services or supplies, but because it in fact made the decision to do so.</p>

Although the Commonwealth Court found that PennDOT had no obligation to pay Envirotest, certainly Commonwealth agencies bear the general obligation imposed by law to pay their rightful, contractual debts — that such obligations are disputed and ultimately settled does not alone justify the conclusion that the debts are not actually owed. The scant record presented in the Commonwealth Court provides no basis for any conclusion concerning whether and to what extent the settlement payment ultimately tendered by the Commonwealth to Envirotest represented a satisfaction that was obligatory in nature (although certainly the amount of the settlement payment suggests that Envirotest’s claims were predicated upon a substantial foundation). Nor, as further discussed below, <em>see infra </em>notes 13-14, does the record provide a basis for determining whether, to what extent, and in what manner the Ernst &amp; Young report underlies or reflects the settlement actually tendered.</p>

Here, OGC provided scant description of the Ernst &amp; Young report in its letter denying access. The absence from the record of sufficient information concerning the contents of the report is further reflected in the conflicting positions of OGC and the Commonwealth Court concerning whether the report is or is not an audit. The Commonwealth Court majority also distinguished <em>Sapp Roofing </em>on the basis that the Ernst &amp; Young report only "tangentially relatfed] to disbursements by the Commonwealth,” <em>see LaValle, </em><a href="/a2d/737/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="737 A.2d 330" data-case-ids="11569003" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0330-01">737 A.2d at 333</a>; however, there is no factual basis in the record to support this conclusion (although OGC made an assertion to this effect in its denial letter).

Questions concerning the availability of <em>in camera </em>review in the Commonwealth Court in its appellate capacity on review of an informal adjudication of a state agency denying public access pursuant to the Act are not presently before us.

The potential applicability of such remedies illustrates the importance of preserving the question of the adequacy of the record in the agency and raising it specifically on appellate review. We expect that the Commonwealth Court will, in the first instance and in appropriate cases, develop standards to ensure that state agencies provide sufficiently detailed information concerning the contents of requested records to permit meaningful appellate review-This can be most effectively accomplished where the question is placed in controversy before the court, and the court is thus provided with the informed views of the parties concerning the extent of detail required and the manner in which its development should occur at both the agency level and on appellate review.
