Appellant first argues that DUI roadblocks are <em>per se </em>unconstitutional under the heightened protections against unreasonable searches and seizures of Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Alternatively, Appellant asserts that even assuming that DUI roadblocks are not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional under the Pennsylvania Constitution, <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>the police administered the DUI roadblock in the present case in an unconstitutional manner.</p>

The <em>Sitz </em>Court acknowledged that a roadblock was a seizure; thus, it focused its examination on whether such a seizure was unreasonable. In examining whether a DUI roadblock was an unreasonable seizure, the Court utilized a three-pronged balancing test derived from its decision in <em>Brown v.

Ultimately, the Court concluded that the momentary seizure of a DUI roadblock was not unreasonable, stating that “the balance of the State’s interest in preventing drunken driving, the extent to which this system can reasonably be said to advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists who are briefly stopped, weighs in favor of the state program.” <em><a href="/us/496/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="496 U.S. 444" data-case-ids="12123840" data-case-paths="/us/496/0444-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/496/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="496 U.S. 444" data-case-ids="12123840" data-case-paths="/us/496/0444-01">at 455</a>,<a href="/us/496/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="496 U.S. 444" data-case-ids="12123840" data-case-paths="/us/496/0444-01">110 S.Ct. 2481</a>.</p>

This court accepted roadblocks in the first place, as a legitimate means to combat the dangers of drunk driving where traditional law enforcement techniques failed. With the advantage of hindsight, 'can it really be stated that roadblocks satisfy this compelling state interest in a more efficient and effective manner than traditional law enforcement techniques? The balancing test established in <em>Blouse </em>was never intended to grant a license for the indiscriminate use of roadblocks in perpetuity if the purpose of those roadblocks is not met. The idea of general suspicionless searches is an anomaly. In order to justify such massive law enforcement actions, which admittedly interrupt individual liberty and privacy, there is more to balancing this equation than simply pitting the state interest against the individual interest. There must be empirical proof that this manner of search is effective where traditional methods of law enforcement are not.</p>

It defies common sense to argue that by consolidating police resources on one section of one street, the police can catch more drunk drivers. This logic somehow presumes that drunk drivers will voluntarily line up at predetermined checkpoints. The more realistic presumption, however, is that an unknown number of drunk drivers who would have easily attracted the attention of trained law officers on routine patrol evade detection simply by using roads other than those targeted for DUI roadblocks. <em>See </em>Jon M.
