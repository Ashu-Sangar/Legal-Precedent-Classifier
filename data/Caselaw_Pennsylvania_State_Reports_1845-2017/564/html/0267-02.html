Shortly thereafter, she entered into a contingency fee agreement with Appellant and initiated a personal injury action in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County.</p>
    <p id="b400-9" data-blocks='[["BL_400.8",400,[267,1486,1160,418]]]'>On January 24, 1992, Appellant attended a settlement conference and subsequently agreed to a settlement figure of $275,000. On August 28, 1992, Appellant requested that Appellee execute a release as part of the settlement of her case. Appellee refused to do so, asserting that she had not been consulted about a settlement offer, that she had not authorized any settlement of her case, and that she would not accept the amount of $275,000 in settlement.</p>

Two hearings were held before the Honorable Marjorie C. Lawrence, during which Appellant testified as a witness.

The Agreement provided in pertinent part:</p>

    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[263,512,1160,732]]]'>The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court determined that the plain language of the Agreement provided that Appellant could not recover without the existence of a settlement. The court noted that in the proceedings regarding the Petition to Confirm Settlement, another court of competent jurisdiction had already afforded the parties a full and fair chance to litigate the existence of a settlement. As that court had determined that no such settlement existed, the trial court concluded that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded a finding that there had been one. Consequently, the trial court granted Appellee’s motion for summary judgment, denied Appellant’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Appellant’s complaint with prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.6",402,[263,1280,1162,794]]]'>The Superior Court affirmed in an unpublished opinion. The court found that although the Agreement contained a liquidated damages provision (regarding payment of fees if the Agreement was breached or terminated), the capitalized language at the bottom of the Agreement (the “no recovery no fee” provision) indicated that the parties contemplated payment of a fee to Appellant only in the event that Appellee recovered some amount through Appellant’s representation; because Appellee did not recover any amount through Appellant’s representation, Appellant was not entitled to any fee. The Superior Court further concluded that the liquidated damages provision only entitled Appellant to recover his fee in the event that he negotiated a settlement offer with his client’s consent, and that finding otherwise would allow recovery of a fee for services that the client did not request or authorize.</p>

He further asserts that the liquidated <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>damages provision is valid, and that he was required to include such a provision pursuant to Pa.R.P.C 1.5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[181,430,1156,468]]]'>Appellee counters that Appellant has not properly preserved the issue of quantum meruit; that the present claim is barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel; that the Agreement is unconscionable and violates several Rules of Professional Conduct; that Appellant himself breached the Agreement by accepting a settlement without his client’s authority to do so; and that the Agreement’s plain language precludes any recovery because Appellant did not obtain any money by suit or settlement.</p>
    <p id="b403-6" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[182,923,1155,574]]]'>Initially, we will address Appellee’s argument that Appellant is not entitled to recover on the basis of the equitable doctrine of quantum meruit, but only pursuant to the liquidated damages provision. Appellant contends that he was not required to plead a separate count requesting equitable relief as the Agreement included his right to quantum meruit pursuant to the specific contractual provision he sought to enforce. Despite the nuances of their arguments, the parties agree that Appellant’s recovery depends upon the express terms of the contract, a claim which was raised in the complaint. Therefore, we will analyze this case according to those provisions.</p>

    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[254,651,1161,795]]]'>Applying these principles, it is evident from the Agreement that the parties intended to provide for payment to Appellant in the event of two possible outcomes: (1) when it is the case that Appellant is retained until resolution of the litigation, and (2) when the Agreement is terminated prior to resolution of the litigation. In the event that Appellant is retained until the claim’s resolution, the “no recovery no fee” provision (in conjunction with the 30% contingency fee clause) establishes that Appellant will be paid 30% of any amount Appellee receives, only if there is recovery by suit or settlement; if there is no recovery, then Appellee pays no fee. In contrast, in the event that the Agreement is prematurely terminated, the liquidated damages clause establishes that Appellant will receive the greater of 30% of a negotiated settlement offer or a fee based upon his prevailing rate.</p>
    <p id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.5",404,[251,1475,1159,634]]]'>The Superior Court found that the “no recovery no fee” language indicated that the parties contemplated payment of a fee to Appellant only in the event that Appellee recovered some amount through Appellant’s representation. This interpretation improperly nullified the preceding liquidated damages provision, which addressed the specific outcome that occurred in this case — a termination of Appellant’s services. Instead, the Superior Court should have given effect to both clauses, as they address different outcomes of the attorney/client relationship. Thus, the Superior Court erred in determining that the “no recovery no fee” language in the Agreement bars Appellant’s recovery.</p>

Appellee, relying on the trial court’s reasoning, asserts that <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>the denial of the Petition to Confirm Settlement conclusively established that there was no settlement, so Appellant is not entitled to any fee based upon the settlement offer of $275,000.</p>
    <p id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[190,511,1150,472]]]'>We disagree. Collateral estoppel applies when the issue decided in the prior adjudication was identical with the one presented in the later action; there was a final judgment on the merits; the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication; and the party against whom it is asserted has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question in the prior adjudication. <em>Safeguard Mutual Ins.
