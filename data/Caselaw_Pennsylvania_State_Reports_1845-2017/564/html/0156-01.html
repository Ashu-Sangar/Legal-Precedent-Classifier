Appellee provided medical services to Baxter for the injuries she received. Subsequently, Baxter commenced a medical malpractice action against Appellee. Following Baxter’s death, Appellant, as administratrix of Baxter’s estate, was substituted as the plaintiff. As the case proceeded to trial, an issue arose as to the appropriate measure of compensatory damages for Baxter’s past medical expenses. The court reserved that issue for itself and submitted the case to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of Appellant, awarding $46,500 in non-economic damages including pain and suffering.</p>

R. 12a. The fair and reasonable value of the medical services rendered to Baxter was $108,668.31. <em>Id. </em>The Medicare allowance for those services was $12,167.40. <em>Id. </em>Of the $12,167.40, eighty percent was paid by Medicare and twenty percent was paid by Blue Cross 65. <em>Id. </em>Appellee was a voluntary participant in the Medicare program and consequently accepted the $12,167.40 as payment in full for the medical services it rendered. <em>Id. </em>Appellee cannot obtain the difference of the cost of its services and the Medicare allowance (i.e. $96,500.91) from Appellant or from any other source. R. 12a-13a. Conversely, Appellant never was and never will be legally obligated to pay more than $12,167.40 for the medical services. R. 13a.

Appellant concedes that pursuant to agreements with Medicare and Blue Cross, Appellee was contractually obligated to accept $12,167.40 as full payment for services rendered. When a plaintiff will continue to incur expenses for medical services, it is appropriate for the factfinder to determine the amount of damages which will compensate the plaintiff for those expenses that “are reasonably necessary to be incurred.” Conversely, where, as here, the exact amount of expenses has been established by contract and those expenses have been satisfied, there is no longer any issue as to the amount of expenses for which the plaintiff will be liable. In the latter case, the injured party should be limited to recovering the amount paid for the medical services. See 25 Corpus Juris Secundum, Damages § 91(3) (1996 &amp; Supp.1999) (“Where the amount paid for medical services is in accordance with a contractual schedule of rates, recovery is limited to that amount although the reasonable value of the services in the absence of contract is higher.”) (footnote omitted).</p>

If, however, the injured person paid less than the exchange rate, he can recover no more than the amount paid, except when the low rate was intended as a gift to him.” It also is consistent with the approach taken in other jurisdictions. <em>See Hanif v.

In <em>Kashner, </em>the plaintiff was treated at Geisinger Medical Center (GMC) and Geisinger Clinic (the Clinic) by Dr. Arthur Colley. The plaintiff brought a medical malpractice action against all three providers; the Clinic and Dr. Colley each were found to be fifty percent negligent. While a portion of the plaintiff’s medical bills were paid by the Department of Public Welfare (DPW), the remainder were "written off” by GMC and forgiven by the Clinic. The trial court limited the amount of medical expenses submitted to the jury to the amounts paid by DPW. The Superior Court reversed, finding that the trial court erred in preventing the plaintiff from proving medical expenses in excess of the amounts paid by DPW. The court determined that "the amount actually paid for medical services does not alone determine the reasonable value of those medical services. Nor does it limit the finder of fact in making such a determination." <a href="/a2d/638/0980-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="638 A.2d 980" data-case-ids="7374496,940018" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0980-01,/pa-super/432/0361-01">638 A.2d at 983</a> (citations omitted).</p>

While that may be true, such reasoning fails to take into account the fact that if Baxter had not been covered by Medicare and Blue Cross 65 or some other health insurance at the time of her fall at Crozer, she would have been personally responsible to Crozer as her medical provider for her entire medical bill of $108,668.31.

According to the majority, when a medical provider contracts with a third party payor to accept an amount less than the reasonable value of the medical services provided as payment in full, the purpose of compensatory damages is no longer served by permitting an injured plaintiff to recover the reasonable value of her past medical services made necessary by the medical provider’s tortious conduct. The majority repeatedly notes that the actual medical expenses paid on behalf of Baxter by Medicare totaled $12,167.40, and contends that any further recovery against Crozer in the nature of compensatory damages for past medical expenses would constitute a windfall. Although the majority chooses to emphasize the $12,167.40 payment that Medicare and Blue Cross 65 made to Crozer on Baxter’s behalf, that is not the proper focus. Rather, the collateral source rule prohibits the wrongdoer from diminishing the damages recoverable against it based on the payments, compensation, or benefits that a collateral source confers on a wronged plaintiff on account of her injury. <em>See, e.g., Hileman v.

Instead, by fully covering Baxter’s post-injury medical services, Medicare and Blue Cross 65 conferred a benefit on Baxter equal to the reasonable value of the medical services provided, which the parties stipulated to be $108,668.31. The collateral source rule dictates that Crozer cannot profit from the benefit that Baxter received from her health insurers, but that is exactly what the majority allows today.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

While Section 911 generally governs valuation, Comment h deals specifically with the measure of recovery for a plaintiff “who sues for the value of his services tortiously obtained by the defendant’s fraud or duress, or for the value of services rendered in an attempt to mitigate damages.” That provision is clearly not applicable to the instant case. The majority ignores Section 920A, which specifically explains the effects of benefits provided by collateral sources:</p>
    <blockquote id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[306,949,1123,799]]]'>[Collateral-source benefits] do not have the effect of reducing the recovery against the defendant. The injured party’s net loss may have been reduced correspondingly, and to the extent that the defendant is required to pay the total amount there may be a double compensation for a part of the plaintiffs injury. But it is the position of the law that a benefit that is directed to the injured party should not be shifted so as to become a windfall for the tortfeasor. If the plaintiff was himself responsible for the benefit, as by maintaining his own insurance ..., the law allows him to keep it for himself. If the benefit was ... established for him by law, he should not be deprived of the benefit that it confers. The law does not differentiate between the nature of the benefits, so long as they did not come from the defendant or a person acting for him.</blockquote>

Although it is the tortfeasor’s responsibility to compensate for all harm that he causes, and not just the net loss of the injured party, the majority exempts tortfeasors from liability for collateral benefits received by injured plaintiffs. Based on the above analysis, I would affirm that portion of the Superior Court opinion holding that Baxter is entitled to recover the reasonable value of the medical services ($108,-668.31) provided to her by Crozer as compensatory damages. However, I cannot agree with the Superior Court’s conclusion that Crozer is entitled to a setoff for the difference between the reasonable value of the medical services ($108,668.31) and the amount that Crozer accepted as payment in full pursuant to its voluntary participation in the Medicare program ($12,-167.40). Accordingly, I would award Baxter additional compensatory damages in the amount of $96,500.91, which is the difference between the reasonable value of the medical services provided to Baxter and the amount of compensatory damages for past medical expenses awarded by the trial court.</p>

It bears noting that Crozer could have litigated the reasonable value of the medical services it provided to Baxter in the trial court and could have argued to the trier of fact that the amount accepted as payment in full for such services from Medicare and Blue Cross 65 is the most accurate barometer for calculating the reasonable value of the medical services provided to Baxter. But Crozer forewent that opportunity, and instead opted to stipulate to the reasonable value of the services while arguing that: (1) Baxter’s compensatory damages should be limited to the amount of the payment from Medicare and Blue Cross 65; and (2) it was entitled to a setoff in the amount of the difference between the reasonable value of the medical services provided and the amount accepted as payment in full from Medicare and Blue Cross 65.</p>

I disagree with this finding. "It is only where the tortfeasor himself makes a payment towards his tort liability that the payment will have the effect of reducing his liability.” <em>Kashner, </em><a href="/pa-super/432/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="432 Pa. Super. 361" data-case-ids="940018" data-case-paths="/pa-super/432/0361-01">432 Pa.Super. at 368</a>, <a href="/a2d/638/0980-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="638 A.2d 980" data-case-ids="7374496,940018" data-case-paths="/a2d/638/0980-01,/pa-super/432/0361-01">638 A.2d at 984</a>. No such payment in the form of free medical services or a voluntary relinquishment of a right to collect occurred in the instant case. Crozer was required, pursuant to its preexisting contract with the federal government to participate in the Medicare program, to provide the services in question for $12,167.40. In my view, Appellant should not be made to bear the cost of Crozer's agreement with the federal government, and Crozer should not be granted a setoff simply because it chose to become a Medicare provider and subsequently treated Baxter for the injuries she sustained due to Crozer’s own negligence. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A(2)(1979)("[B]enefits conferred on the injured party from other sources are not credited against the tortfeasor’s liability, although they cover all or a part of the harm for which the tortfeasor is liable.”). As noted by Judge Olszewski in his dissenting opinion below, "[Crozer] did not contribute anything to [Baxter] that [Baxter] had not already received from Medicare.” <em>Moor-head, </em>705 A.2d at 456 (Olszewski, J„ dissenting). Thus, I would reverse the decision of the Superior Court to the extent that it granted Crozer a setoff in the amount of the difference between the stipulated reasonable value of the medical services provided and the amount that Crozer accepted as payment in full for such services pursuant to its voluntary participation in the Medicare program.</p>

I further note that the majority ignores the fact that the underlying bases for tort recovery of medical expenses and the payment of an insured’s medical benefits are distinct. The basis for the former is liability — -an injured party is entitled to receive compensation, including the reasonable value of medical services, from a culpable tortfeasor. The basis for the latter is contractual — health insurers are contractually obligated to pay medical benefits to, or on behalf of, their insureds. <em>See </em>Michael F. Flynn, <em>Private Medical Insurance and the Collateral Source Rule: A Good Bet?, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20U.%20Tol.%20L.%20Rev.%2039" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="22 U. Tol. L.

Likewise, medical providers are sometimes contractually obligated to accept as payment in full reimbursement from health insurers which is less than the reasonable value of the services actually provided to the insured. By concluding that the contractual obligations between an insured and his or her health insurer and a medical provider and that insurer diminish the insured’s recovery of compensatory damages, the majority blurs the distinction between the bases for tort recovery of medical expenses and payment of an insured’s medical benefits.</p>

In support of its conclusion, the majority also claims that awarding Baxter the additional amount of $96,500.91 would violate the tenets of fair compensation. The majority claims that its conclusion is consistent with several theories: that damages cannot be presumed, that damages must be reasonably precise, that duplicative recovery results in unjust, enrichment, that the injured person should be compensated with the least burden to the wrongdoer, and that a plaintiff has a duty to mitigate damages.</p>
      <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[231,1712,1117,427]]]'>There were no presumed damages in this case. In fact, the parties stipulated to the exact amount of the medical expenses: $108,668.31. While it is true that an injured party cannot recover twice for one injury, under the collateral source rule, the tortfeasor is required to pay for all the harm he causes, even if this creates a double compensation for part of the plaintiff’s injuries. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. b. Moreover, the principle behind the collateral source rule, that it is better for the wronged plaintiff to receive a windfall than for the tortfeasor to pay less than the damages he owes, specifically refutes the majority's contention. <em>Johnson v. Beane, </em><a href="/pa/541/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="541 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="470766" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0449-01">541 Pa. 449</a>, 456, <a href="/pa/541/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="664 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="470766,7862380" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0449-01,/a2d/664/0096-01">664 A.2d 96</a>, 100 (1995).</p>

For example, the majority cites <em>Robison v.
