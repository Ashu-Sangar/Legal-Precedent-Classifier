Concerned by this erratic driving, the corporal followed the vehicle, which then accelerated and crossed the road’s centerline.

The vehicle traveled an additional two-tenths of one mile before stopping approximately one-half mile from the airport. Upon approaching the driver, Appellant C.

Further, to the extent that concerns are presented regarding an extraterritorial aspect to the HIA corporal’s encounter with McKinley, the Bureau points to a line of Commonwealth Court decisions holding that, while considerations regarding an officer’s territorial jurisdiction may be pertinent in suppression proceedings in criminal cases, they have no relevance in civil license suspension proceedings pursuant to the Implied Consent Law.

However, the common pleas court accepted McKinley’s argument that the officer’s police authority ended at the airport boundaries and that such limitation was outcome determinative. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court’s references to the statewide jurisdiction of municipal police suggest that it viewed the extent of the corporal’s territorial jurisdiction as relevant to the question of whether he should be deemed a police officer for purposes of his off-premises encounter with McKinley. We proceed, therefore, to review the breadth of the HIA corporal’s territorial jurisdiction in light of the limited issue upon which appeal was allowed. The pertinent questions are: 1) was an HIA officer’s territorial jurisdiction limited to airport property?; and 2) does the issue of territorial jurisdiction affect the determination of whether one is a “police officer” under the Implied Consent Law?</p>

Conversely, in other examples, when it has intended to confer upon officers authority throughout the Commonwealth, the Legislature has also clearly so stated in the statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>61 P.S. § 309.1 (prescribing arrest authority directed to the apprehension of parole violators); 72 P.S. § 8279 (conferring authority upon field investigators of the Department of Revenue to arrest, <em>inter alia, </em>those engaged in the sale of unstamped or counterfeit cigarettes). As the statutes presently under review are not specific in either regard, a closer examination is warranted.</p>

First, the enabling provisions could be read as affording a grant of authority flowing directly from the Legislature, unconstrained by the jurisdiction of the employer-agency or the primary impetus for the officers’ employment. Under such an interpretation, absent express limitation, the officers’ territorial jurisdiction might be construed quite broadly, since the General Assembly’s own jurisdiction extends to the boundaries of the Commonwealth. Alternatively, the enabling provisions for HIA police could be construed as crafting the officers’ authority to correspond with that of the administrative agency that they serve, as well as to the purposes of the officers’ commissioning. Legislative drafting along the latter lines would favor a construction yielding a narrower concept of territorial jurisdiction which would be no greater than that of the administrative agency and would be directed to the specific security purposes underlying the employment.</p>

In a separate provision, however, the General Assembly has vested municipal police officers with certain arrest authority outside the territorial limits of the employer-municipality. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8953 (statewide municipal police jurisdiction).

No question is presented here concerning the applicability of these requirements to HIA officers or the extent of the HIA corporal’s training, as such was not within the scope of the limited allowance of appeal, and, further, the issue was deemed by the Commonwealth Court to have been waived. <em>See McKinley, </em><a href="/a2d/739/1134-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="739 A.2d 1134" data-case-ids="11568928" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/1134-01">739 A.2d at 1137</a>.

It could be argued that the General Assembly crafted Section 1791.1 specifically to limit officers’ authority to the premises according to the last clause of the provision quoted above (“upon any part of the premises of any such building or installation as aforesaid”). Such construction would yield the following reading: HIA officers are granted “the full power to make arrests [ Qfor all violations of the law which they may witness!) ] upon any part of the premises,” or, in other words, HIA officers may make arrests only on the premises for violations of the law which they may witness. This interpretation, however, would be inconsistent with the last antecedent rule of construction, which advises that a proviso usually is construed to apply only to the provision or clause immediately preceding it. <em>See Commonwealth v. Rosenbloom Finance Corp., </em><a href="/pa/457/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="457 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="478486" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0496-01">457 Pa. 496</a>, 500, <a href="/citations/?q=325%20A.2d%20907" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="325 A.2d 907">325 A.2d 907</a>, 909 (1974)(stating that "referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent, which consists of 'the last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence’ ” (citations omitted)).

We acknowledge the policy considerations within the General Assembly’s purview in establishing the territorial jurisdiction of HIA officers. On the one hand, there is a legitimate, societal interest in assuring that wrongdoers do not escape punishment; moreover, the implementation of strict territorial limits upon security officers might, in some instances, encourage offenders to flee to the boundaries of the airport to escape the officers’ reach, thus raising safety concerns. On the other hand, particularly since the General Assembly has not implemented specific training requirements for HIA police, concerns arise regarding the conferral of broad powers, particularly in off-premises areas that may be less familiar to the officers. Indeed, the general function of airport officers (protection of airport property and persons thereon), could be viewed as having been served once an offender has departed, leaving the effectuation of more general social policy objectives, such as punishment and deterrence, to officers having broader jurisdiction. It is not our function, however, to weigh the competing policy concerns that arise in this context — such is the task of the General Assembly. The judicial undertaking is of a more limited nature, namely, to discern the intent of the General Assembly concerning the territorial jurisdiction of the officers it has empowered.</p>

I do not read the remaining statutory provisions cited by the majority to prohibit an HIA police officer from pursuing a driver whom the officer witnesses violating the vehicle code, even if the officer effectuates the stop while not on airport property. The decision of the majority handcuffs legitimate law enforcement activities in stopping drivers who present a danger to other motorists, and I do not see a clear legislative purpose to place such limitations on HIA police officers. When, as in this case, an HIA officer views conduct while on airport property that creates a reasonable suspicion that a person may be driving while under the influence, the officer is empowered to stop the person and investigate. 74 Pa.C.S. § 5904(a)(10). If the officer pursues that individual beyond the boundaries of the airport in order to investigate further the driver’s suspicious behavior, then that is merely a continuation of the officer’s original investigatory power. Further, the absence of an express statutory grant of “hot pursuit” powers to HIA police, such as that governing municipal police officers,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> does not necessarily mean that HIA police lack inherent pursuit powers. I cannot accept that the legislature would have intended to limit an HIA police officer’s authority by compelling him or her to halt his or her investigation of suspected criminal activity at the airport property boundary.</p>

      <p id="b715-5" data-blocks='[["BL_715.6",715,[179,2121,1151,233]]]'>. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a)(2). The legislative grant of "hot pursuit” powers to municipal police officers should be read as part of the legislative scheme to coordinate the authority of the various municipal police departments statewide. It does not indicate, however, a legislative intent to restrict the extraterritorial law enforcement activities by police officers generally.</p>
