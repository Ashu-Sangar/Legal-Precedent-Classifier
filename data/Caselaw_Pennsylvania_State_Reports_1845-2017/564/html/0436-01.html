Under Section 1532(b)(3) the bureau is required to suspend for one year the driver’s license of any person who is reported by another state as having been convicted of the equivalent of Pennsylvania’s drunk driving statute, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a).

On November 15, 1999 Crooks was found guilty of DUI in Avalon Municipal Court. New Jersey is a party state to the Driver License Compact. In conformity with its obligations under the compact, New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles reported Crooks’ conviction to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Driver Licensing. The Pennsylvania bureau treated Crooks’ conviction as if he had been convicted of violating Pennsylvania’s drunk driving statute, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a). On December 29, 1999 the bureau mailed Crooks a notice that it was treating his New Jersey DUI conviction as the equivalent of a conviction for violating 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a), and as mandated by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(b)(3) it was suspending his driver’s license for one year.</p>

Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em><a href="/us/339/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="339 U.S. 306" data-case-ids="362818" data-case-paths="/us/339/0306-01">339 U.S. 306</a>, 314, <a href="/us/339/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="339 U.S. 306" data-case-ids="362818" data-case-paths="/us/339/0306-01">70 S.Ct. 652</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20L.%20Ed.%20865" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="94 L.

The report also describes Crooks’ New Jersey offense by date of offense, September 12, 1999, statute violated, N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a), date of conviction, November 15,1999, and a description of the <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>offense, “operate under influence liq/drugs.” Missing from the New Jersey report is information as to what plea Crooks entered to the New Jersey DUI charge and whether his conviction resulted from a guilty plea or an unremitted forfeiture of bond or other security. Although the missing information is required under Article III of the compact, Crooks was supplied with enough information to understand the pendency of the proceedings and was afforded an opportunity to present a defense, <em>Mullane. </em>That is all that is minimally required to satisfy due process.

Since the New Jersey drunk driving statute contains a subsection allowing for a conviction if a person permits another to operate a motor vehicle while drunk, but Pennsylvania’s statute does not have a similar provision, and the New Jersey notice of offense does not notify Pennsylvania of what subsection was violated, the lower court was correct that it could not determine whether the offenses were substantially similar.</p>

The facts in the present case are similar to those in <em>McCafferty. </em>In both cases there was deficient notice of the foreign statutes on which the license suspensions were based. But in this case, as in <em>McCafferty, </em>appellee does not allege that he lacked notice of the actual conviction that led to the suspension hearing, or that he did not know of the nature of the suspension proceeding, or that he had no meaningful opportunity to be heard. Because we have held that Section 1584 does not violate due process, and that section provides that the omission from foreign state reports of any information required by Article III shall not prevent the department from complying with its duties under the compact, the real question in any case of this type is whether the notice appellee received was consistent with due process. Since appellee does not claim that he did not know of the nature of the proceeding or that he had no meaningful opportunity to be heard or that he lacked notice of the actual conviction underlying this proceeding, there is no due process violation and the suspension should have been upheld. Appellant in this case, as in the <em>McCafferty </em>case, is essentially asserting a due process right to be obtuse.</p>

Crooks, (“Crooks”), pursued several issues in appealing the suspension of his driver’s license by the Appellant, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, (“Bureau”). The issue that served as the basis for the trial court’s decision to rescind the suspension was presented as follows: “[Whether] the [Bureau] and the New Jersey [Division] of Motor Vehicles [“Division”] have not complied with the [Driver License Compact as enacted in Pennsylvania, 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1581 <em>el seq. </em>(the “Compact”) ] with regard to the notice of defendant’s conviction by the [Division] and the subsequent suspension of the defendant’s Pennsylvania operating privileges.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> (R. 6a). It was Crooks’ position that the suspension could not stand because the report the Division transmitted to the Bureau did not contain all of the information that Article III of the Compact requires, including the particular subsection of the New Jersey statute he violated. His argument was premised on the assertion that since Article III demands strict compliance, any omission in a report invalidates a suspension. The trial court agreed.</p>

In doing so, the trial court relied on <em>Commonwealth, Dep’t. of Transp. v. Harrington, </em><a href="/pa-d-c4th/42/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="42 Pa.

First, as I read it, the majority’s analysis construes and decides the issue that Crooks raised with respect to the New Jersey report upon which the Bureau acted as one that involves notice to Crooks and the constitutional issue of due process. Although we rejected the licensees’ assertion in <em>McCafferty </em>that the Bureau’s certified records deprived them of the right to procedural due process, <a href="/a2d/758/1155-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="758 A.2d 1155" data-case-ids="11196913,11196965,1366942,1366957" data-case-paths="/a2d/758/1155-01,/a2d/758/1155-02,/pa/563/0145-01,/pa/563/0146-01">758 A.2d at 1163</a>, Crooks did not make that argument here. As I have explained, I am of the view that the issue Crooks raised, and one which <em>McCafferty </em>settled, was whether Article III mandates strict compliance in the reports the Bureau receives from party states, and not one of notice.</p>

The majority notes that the trial court observed in its opinion that the omission in the New Jersey report of the statutory subsection that Crooks violated prevented it from “determinfingl whether or not the violation was ‘of a substantially similar nature’ to our statute 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3731”, and meant that the Bureau did not meet its “burden of proof.” (R. 55a-56a). The majority then concludes that the omission to which the trial court referred does not have “legal significance” under the due process principles that <em>McCafferty </em>and <em>Harrington </em>discussed.</p>

The predicate for invocation of this court’s direct review pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 722(b)(7), which provides the jurisdictional basis for this appeal, is a declaration by the court of common pleas that a statute is unconstitutional. In my view, the issue or issues to which the trial court was alluding lie outside the scope of § 722(b)(7). That is to say, whether as the Compact requires, the New Jersey statute under which Crooks was convicted is “of a substantially similar nature” to Article IV(a)(2), <em>see Petrovick v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/559/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="559 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="837188" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0614-01">559 Pa. 614</a>, <a href="/a2d/741/1264-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="741 A.2d 1264" data-case-ids="11658223,837188" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1264-01,/pa/559/0614-01">741 A.2d 1264</a>, 1266 (1999), or whether the Bureau failed to meet its “burden of proof’, were unrelated to the trial court’s declaration that 75 Pa.C.S. § 1584 violates due process. In <em>Harrington, </em>we decided that in the interest of sound jurisprudential practice, we will remand to the court of common pleas, or, where appropriate, transfer to the proper intermediate appellate court, these kinds of ancillary issues. <em>Harrington, </em><a href="/pa/563/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="563 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1366907" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0565-01">763 A.2d at 393</a>.

First, Crooks argued that the suspension was improper because the notice he received from the Bureau advised him that the offense he committed in New Jersey was “equivalent”, not “substantially similar” to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731. (R. 6a). The trial court disagreed, concluding that the Bureau subjected itself to “a more strict standard than is required by the Compact” by using the word “equivalent”. Second, Crooks asserted that his conviction in New Jersey contained a civil reservation which pursuant to New Jersey Rule 3:9-2 prohibits the use of the judgment of conviction in any civil case. (R. 7a). Again, the trial court disagreed, finding that the New Jersey Rule Crooks cited does not apply to administrative proceedings.</p>

When the trial court was considering what the consequences of a deficient report should be, counsel for the Bureau mentioned "that under the <em>Scott </em>case [the] description [on the report of the New Jersey offense that Crooks committed] has been established as being a substantially similar offense to Pennsylvania’s with regard to the guilty/not guilty plea....” (R.20a.-21a.) Counsel for Crooks pointed out that <em>Scott </em>had no relevance to the argument he was presenting at the moment, which went to the "reporting requirements of the Compact." (R.23a.-24a.).
