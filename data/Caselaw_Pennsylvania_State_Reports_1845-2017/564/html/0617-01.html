The accident occurred at the intersection of State Route 394 and the south exit ramp of State Route 15. Trooper Hershey observed a stop sign and thirty-two feet of skid marks on the exit ramp and determined that the driver of the van had failed to stop, entered State Route 394 in the path of a westbound vehicle and caused the collision. Trooper Hershey’s subse<a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>quent inspection of the interior of the van revealed a cooler containing ice and several unopened cans of beer.

Trooper Hershey informed Appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the implied consent law, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547, and advised him that the hospital would be drawing a sample of blood for treatment purposes. Appellant then requested that Trooper Hershey inform him of the results.</p>

I believe that the limited result reached by the majority and, perhaps more importantly, the analysis employed in order to reach that result, does damage to the settled methodology this Court has used to analyze state constitutional provisions in comparison to their federal counterparts to determine whether the former provide additional protections which the latter do not. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

In my view, <em>Riedel </em>should be expressly overruled, and this Court should find that the warrantless police seizure of Appellant’s blood test results was invalid under both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>

While I recognize that <em>Riedel </em>is a decision of somewhat recent vintage, I believe that it was wrongly decided because the blood test at issue in that case was performed for purely medical reasons, and not in response to any request on the part of a police officer or in accordance with a perceived statutory duty to do so pursuant to Section 3755(a). Based on its own terms, Section 3755(a) applies only in limited situations where emergency health care providers <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>draw a blood sample based on a police request or a perceived statutory obligation to do so in order to assist the police in procuring evidence for a possible future DUI prosecution. Thus, it seems clear that the <em>Riedel </em>Court erred in relying on Section 3755(a) in upholding the police seizure of Riedel’s blood test results. Assuming that the <em>Riedel </em>Court had instead found Section 3755(a) inapplicable to the warrantless police seizure of Riedel’s blood test results, it seems only logical that the Court would also have found that the seizure violated the Fourth Amendment. In fact, the <em>Riedel </em>Court said as much in dictum, stating: “We recognize that in the absence of the implied consent scheme [i.e., Section 3755(a) ], the actions of Trooper Davis would constitute an unreasonable search and seizure.” <a href="/pa/539/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="539 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="474173" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0172-01">539 Pa. at 182</a>, <a href="/a2d/651/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="651 A.2d 135" data-case-ids="12253579,12253606,12253620,474161,474173,474174" data-case-paths="/a2d/651/0135-01,/a2d/651/0135-02,/a2d/651/0135-03,/pa/539/0171-01,/pa/539/0172-01,/pa/539/0170-01">651 A.2d at 141</a>.</p>

As the <em>Riedel </em>Court noted, the intrusion involved in a simple oral request <em>for </em>BAC test results is minimal, <em>i.e., </em>it is “far less intrusive” than the actual withdrawal of blood and administration of a test which had already occurred. In addition, the existence of the implied consent scheme obviously diminishes any expectation of privacy a properly suspected drunken driver could have had in the BAC test results. Thus, even if a particular test was not administered for “legal purposes,” the fact remains that the statute implies the consent of suspected impaired drivers to such testing, and that fact affects the driver’s expectations. Given that reality, the <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>distinction between blood withdrawn for “medical purposes” or blood withdrawn for “legal purposes” adds nothing to the reasonableness of a driver’s expectation that his BAC test results would not be disclosed.

As I have noted earlier, a simple request for the results of a medical purposes BAC test is far less intrusive than a request that a second blood sample be taken and tested — a practice I believe plainly authorized by the implied consent scheme and, as a practical matter, required by the majority’s approach. The decidedly lesser intrusion of a request for the results, which spares the driver multiple drawings of blood, unquestionably is reasonable. Finally, requiring a warrant in these circumstances would do little to further the driver’s right of “privacy.” The “search” at issue here involves a hospital’s disclosure of a single item, the driver’s BAC test results. It is not a search of the driver’s home, person, or effects. In fact, the police here did not actually “search” the driver’s medical records. Instead, it was the hospital that reviewed its file, upon police request, and then provided only the results of the BAC test and nothing <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>further to the police officers. Thus, the officers had no access to other arguably confidential test results or physicians’ notes. Neither the driver’s person nor his possessions are the subject of the request; instead it is the BAC results in the possession of the hospital, a third party. In such an instance, whatever residual privacy interest the driver retains in the test results is more than adequately protected by the ability to later mount a court challenge for lack of probable cause if an arrest arises in a particular matter.</p>
