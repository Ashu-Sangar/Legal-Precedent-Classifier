Instead, we looked to the elements of the crime <em>as charged </em>in the case at bar.

Appellant’s characterization of his criminal conduct as “unsafe driving while intoxicated,” paints the factual predicate with too broad a brush. Here, Appellant’s driving while intoxicated (which resulted in death) satisfied the elements of homicide by vehicle/DUI, while his non-DUI Vehicle Code violations (which resulted in death) satisfied the elements of homicide by vehicle.

To the contrary, however, we presume that the legislature was fully cognizant of our case law regarding the merger of offenses as well as the traditional <em>Blockburger </em>merger test when it crafted the elements of the offenses as mutually exclusive.

In making this contention, the majority applies the “same offense” test that was first articulated in <em>Blockburger v.

Under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, if each offense contains an element not contained in the other, the offenses are not considered to be “the same” and therefore, there is no double jeopardy bar to imposing separate punishments for the two offenses. <em>See <a href="/us/284/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="284 U.S. 299" data-case-ids="5719289" data-case-paths="/us/284/0299-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/284/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="284 U.S. 299" data-case-ids="5719289" data-case-paths="/us/284/0299-01">at 304</a>, <a href="/us/284/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="284 U.S. 299" data-case-ids="5719289" data-case-paths="/us/284/0299-01">52 S.Ct. 180</a>. While there can be no dispute that homicide by vehicle does not contain the same elements as homicide by vehicle/DUI, strict application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test in the instant case results in a conclusion that is both unfair and illogical, i.e., two separate homicide convictions for one death. Moreover, as the U.S. Supreme Court has stated, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is simply a rule of statutory construction. <em>See Missouri v. Hunter, </em><a href="/us/459/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="459 U.S. 359" data-case-ids="6196436" data-case-paths="/us/459/0359-01">459 U.S. 359</a>, 367, <a href="/us/459/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="459 U.S. 359" data-case-ids="6196436" data-case-paths="/us/459/0359-01">103 S.Ct. 673</a>, <a href="/us/459/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="459 U.S. 359" data-case-ids="6196436" data-case-paths="/us/459/0359-01">74 L.Ed.2d 535</a> (1983).

      <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>Significantly, this construction is supported by the legislative history of the pertinent statutes. When it was originally created in 1976, the offense of homicide by vehicle was a misdemeanor of the first degree, regardless of whether the underlying offense was speeding, reckless driving or driving under the influence. In 1982, the legislature passed an act in an effort to deal with problems caused by drinking and driving. <em>See </em>Act of June 17, 1976, Pa. Laws 162, § 1, as amended, Dec. 15, 1982, Pa. Laws 1268, § 9, effective in 30 days (codified as amended at 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3731 (1982)). Although, mechanically, the General Assembly reposited the homicide by vehicle/DUI provisions in a separate section of the Vehicle Code, the essential import of this act was to <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>increase the grading of homicide by vehicle/DUI from a misdemeanor of the first degree to a felony of the third degree<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and provide a mandatory minimum sentence of three years imprisonment. Further, the act amended Section 3732 (homicide by vehicle) by adding the words “except Section 3731(DUI).” Thus, the Legislature clearly indicated that while the commission of any traffic violation that resulted in the loss of human life was a serious offense, driving under the influence implicated a greater social evil and therefore warranted a concomitantly greater and more certain penalty. I do not believe, however, that its decision to organize the more serious form of the offense under a separate section heading evidences an intention to multiply the available offenses resulting from a single death.</p>

In the context at issue here, the rule merely means that if the legislature does not fix the punishment for an offense clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses. <em>See Bell v.

As noted by the majority, even the Commonwealth concedes that Appellant should be granted relief and states in its brief to this Court that the “[t]he fair import of the [homicide by vehicle] and [homicide by vehicle/DUI] statutes reveals a design to proscribe the same harm, i.e., taking of a life as a result of the criminal operation of a motor vehicle. Each statute simply provides alternative bases upon which to proceed if a life is taken as a result of the commission of a traffic offense. Where the underlying offense is DUI, however, the penalty is greater.” Appellee’s Brief at 10. Nonetheless, given these differing interpretations of the homicide by vehicle and homicide by vehicle/DUI statutes, it cannot be said with certainty whether the legislature intended multiple punishments. Under the rule of lenity, this ambiguity must be construed in favor of Appellant and, consequently, he should only be sentenced for one homicide conviction. I would therefore vacate the judgment of sentence as to homicide by vehicle and affirm the judgment of sentence for homicide by vehicle/DUI.</p>
