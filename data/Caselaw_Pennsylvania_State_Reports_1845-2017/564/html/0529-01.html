Duchess (“Duchess”) was injured while cleaning internal components of a machine manufactured by Appellant, Langston Corporation (“Langston”), which was sold to Duchess’ employer, 4-M Manufactur<a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>ing, in June of 1988. In August of 1991, Duchess and his wife commenced the present civil action, asserting causes of action based upon theories of negligence and strict liability. Principally, they contended that the design of the machine was defective, because it lacked an interlock device to halt injurious moving parts upon the opening or removal of their covering guard or shield. Langston took the position that the machine’s design was safe, but it admitted in answers to interrogatories to the incorporation of an interlock device at the pertinent location on newly-manufactured machines as of July, 1991, approximately one year after Duchess’ accident. Langston filed a pre-trial motion seeking to bar the admission of evidence of this subsequent design change. The trial court initially deferred ruling but ultimately granted the motion, thus precluding the Duchesses from revealing to the jury Langston’s subsequent integration of the interlock.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[266,1196,1162,900]]]'>At trial, the Duchesses pursued only the strict products liability claim. Both parties offered detailed testimony describing the machine and its operation to apprise the juiy how the accident occurred and provide necessary context for the Duchesses’ claim and Langston’s defenses. The Saturn III Flexo Folder Gluer and Die Cutter (the “Saturn III”) fabricates corrugated board into finished boxes. Its seventy-foot length is divided into functional segments which, respectively, accept sheets of corrugated cardboard; add printed material according to customer specifications; score and slot the cardboard; place strips of glue; fold; and count finished boxes. A main drive powers a conveyor system guiding the materials through the process, and auxiliary motors drive specific functional sections, with various controls positioned throughout, including three “emergency stop buttons” that primarily affect the main drive, and a single main disconnect switch controlling power to all components.</p>

The components of this segment are inaccessible during normal operations, but, during cleaning, the sections are separated to permit access. Upon division, a hinged <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>ink shield is exposed, which may be opened or removed to reveal the printing components, including an engraved, inking roll carrying a trade name of “anilox”;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> a wiper roll; a print cylinder, to which the actual printing elements are attached; and an impression cylinder. The anilox and wiper rolls operate in tandem, both turning inward toward a point of contact called a “nip point”; the wiper roll is powered by an auxiliary motor, whereas the anilox roll is not independently powered but operates dependent upon friction resulting from contact with the wiper roll. Functionally, printing is accomplished by tunneling liquid ink into the nip point between the anilox and wiper rolls, where it forms a reservoir, with the operator manipulating the proximity of the rolls to adjust flow and, correspondingly, print quality. Minute engravings in the anilox roll capture miniscule quantities of ink, which is transferred to the printing elements in measured amounts. Apparently, the rolls turn in relative silence; however, a green light on the side of the print section illuminates during operation.</p>

He indicated that he had depressed an emergency stop button, which he believed would de-energize all of the Saturn Ill’s moving components; he further stated that his observation that the anilox roll was stationary seemed to confirm this belief.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> According to Duchess, he had separated the anilox and wiper rolls to facilitate cleaning; he was unaware that the wiper roll was powered by an auxiliary motor that was not affected by the emergency control employed; and he was also unaware of the control relationship between the anilox and wiper rolls (i.e., that, if separated, the wiper roll could be turning although the anilox roll was not). Duchess also suggested that the green light that indicated <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>operation of the wiper roll was not readily visible to him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Duchess’ gloved left hand touched the rotating wiper roller and was drawn into the nip point; the resulting injuries required amputation of his ring and small fingers, as well as a segment of his middle finger.</p>

The expert described the operation of an interlock, indicating that such devices are frequently used in common appliances, such as residential washing machines and dryers, and expressed the opinion that its integration into the Saturn Ill’s ink shield was necessary to render the machine safe. Langston expressly conceded that an interlock was feasible, but it limited this concession to an admission that the design change would have been technologically possible at the time the Saturn III was sold to Duchess’ employer. Langston then presented evidence and argument to the effect that the change was impractical because: the location of the components at a site that is inaccessible during normal operations, as well as easily-applied precautions to be taken during setup and cleaning, were sufficient to ensure reasonable safety; access to the printing components while active was necessary to make adjustments to the ink flow during set-up, and therefore, proper printing would be precluded by the introduction of a print-shield interlock; and interlock devices have the potential disadvantage of functioning as an inappropriate “reliance mechanism,” which operators may come to utilize in place of proper safety measures. Although the Duchesses argued that Langston’s strategy opened the door to the admission of the evidence of subsequent incoiporation of an interlock (since evidence of subsequent remedial measures may generally be admitted where feasibility is contested, <em>see </em>Pa.R.E. 407 (see <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>generally <em>infra </em>note 9)), the trial court agreed with Langston’s position distinguishing feasibility from practicality, observing that Langston “had not taken the position that adding an interlock was not capable of being carried out.”</p>

First, since the central question in a negligence action is the reasonableness of the defendant’s actions in relation to the applicable duty of care measured as of the time of the accident, subsequent repairs are not relevant, as they may be occasioned by a new and potentially different set of circumstances and/or corresponding duties prevailing at the later time. <em>See Duchess, </em><a href="/a2d/709/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="709 A.2d 410" data-case-ids="11831181" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0410-01">709 A.2d at 413</a> (stating that “actions taken with hindsight are not probative of actions taken without such hindsight”). Second, the majority recognized that the prohibition of evidence of <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>subsequent remedial measures is grounded in social policy, the central concern being that allowing its admission might discourage repairs or alterations that would enhance safety or otherwise constitute improvements, since, if the rule were otherwise, the fact of any such change could be employed adversely in a future tort action. <em>See <a href="/a2d/709/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="709 A.2d 410" data-case-ids="11831181" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0410-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/709/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="709 A.2d 410" data-case-ids="11831181" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0410-01">at 413</a>. <em>See generally Matsko, </em><a href="/pa-super/325/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="325 Pa.

Whereas the majority had indicated that evidence of subsequent repairs was not relevant in a negligence action, it found such evidence directly relevant in a strict liability action, since in this form of action the pertinent question does not concern the defendant’s conduct, but rather, the character of the product. <em>See Duchess, </em><a href="/a2d/709/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="709 A.2d 410" data-case-ids="11831181" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0410-01">709 A.2d at </a>413 (citing <em>Matsko, </em><a href="/pa-super/325/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="325 Pa.

Arguments presented to this Court amply illustrate this danger, as the Duchesses contend, as presumably they would to a jury, that, “[w]hen the dust settles and the smoke clears, ... evidence of subsequent remedial measures in a strict products liability action is the one piece of evidence that is truly dispositive of product defect.” Thus, and as reflected in the cases and commentary, this form of evidence has the potential to be essentially dissected from the facts and circumstances in which the remedial measures were effectuated, and highlighted to jurors as controlling, thereby diverting their attention from relevant considerations concerning the condition of the product as it existed at the time it left the manufacturer’s <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>control, and the associated risk and utility as also measured against the appropriate time frame. <em>See supra.</em>

Our task, however, is not to evaluate the propriety of the defense presentation, but to determine the effect upon the evidentiary exclusion which Langston sought to maintain. In this regard, the argument that the Saturn III machine cannot be made to function properly with an interlock in place at the print shield location raises a substantial feasibility question under the general definition of the term. Langston’s expert specifically framed his assertion to this effect in categorical terms (“you preclude the ability ... to set the printing unit up properly”), which position was reinforced in other passages of his testimony. Such an assertion, if deemed credible, would gain substantially greater advantage than would more tempered explanations concerning the considerations underlying the original design balance struck by Langston in the time frame in which the decision was made. Langston further capitalized upon this advantage on cross-examination of the Duchesses’ expert witness and in closing argument by reiterating the position that visual observation of the anilox and wiper rolls in operation is essential, and in the analogy between the Saturn III print shield and an automobile engine cover. Langston was able to suggest to the jury that <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>the opposing expert was stymied by the strength of this analogy, whereas, in fact, an effective rebuttal (“new car hoods remain the same, but new Saturn Ill’s have print shield interlocks”) was denied him by the exclusion of evidence of the subsequent design change.

Significantly, however, the rule does not require the surrender of a vigorous defense — presently, Langston was free to fully develop and advance the position that, in the time frame in which the Saturn III was delivered to Duchess’s employer, its design was both acceptable and safe. To this end, Langston’s presentation of evidence concerning the restricted access to the print shield location during normal operations, the ready availability and ease of application of safety precautions, and the training and experience of operators was both relevant and consistent with maintenance of the evidentiary exclusion. Langston also could have addressed the trade-offs associated with the design process on such terms, for example, by pointing out that an interlock would require substantial adjustments to the set-up process for printing that were not warranted given the safety of the existing design. Langston’s evidence and arguments, however, went further, advancing the position that visual observation of the anilox/wiper rolls in operation was essential to the performance of the machine’s function, and thus proper printing would be precluded by introduction of an interlock.</p>

It is difficult to fully address this position, since no alternative paradigm is specifically described. Presumably, the dissent would adopt Langston’s approach that once a defendant concedes the technological possibility of a remedial measure, it gains the full benefit of Rule 407’s exclusion regardless of the remaining character of the defense, including defense assertions that application of the remedial measure would not be at all practical or would preclude product operation. Certainly, such a bright-line rule would be simpler for trial courts, to apply than the evaluative approach that has developed in the federal courts and other jurisdictions and is described above. However, we find that this approach better maintains the balance of fairness struck by Rule 407 and its common law antecedent and trust that our trial courts are capable of implementing the rule in the same manner as they routinely implement others requiring similar evaluations, <em>see, e.g., </em>Pa.R.E. 403, in the ordinary exercise of their discretionary decision making in the evidentiary arena.</p>

In this regard, neither dissenting opinion is able to offer any authority for the novel proposition that a plaintiff's tender of evidence to establish feasibility of an alternate design (other than remedial measures evidence) should open the door for the defendant to contest feasibility while maintaining the benefit of Rule 407. Significantly, such evidence is an essential element of the plaintiff’s liability case predicated on a theory of design defect based upon the availability of an alternate, safer design. <em>See generally </em>63A Am.Jur2d Products Liability § 1095 (1997) (stating that "[t]he reasonableness of choosing from among various alternative product designs and adopting the safest one if it is feasible is not only relevant in a design defect action, but is at the very heart of the case”); Restatement (Third) of Torts, Products Liability § 2(b) <em>&amp; </em>comment d (1998).

Moreover, in this case it is abundantly clear that Langston's stipulation as to feasibility did not obviate the need for the development of feasibility evidence in the Duchesses’ case in chief, particularly as this concession was clearly limited to the mere technological possibility of introducing an interlock.</p>
