The following year, appellee was again eligible for parole but was denied relief. On December 11, 1997, appellee filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania challenging the denial of his parole and seeking immediate release from prison. The petition alleged that between the time of appellee’s offense and the time his parole was reviewed, changes in the criteria for granting parole<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in this commonwealth violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the federal constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Following the district court’s dismissal <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>of the petition, appellee appealed to the U.S. court of appeals for the third circuit.

On Peterkin’s appeal, the Commonwealth asserted that the PCRA court should be affirmed on other, more fundamental grounds, <em>i.e., </em>because it had no jurisdiction .to hear the petition since it was not timely filed under the 1995 amendments to the PCRA. Peterkin, on the other hand, asserted that his request for statutory habeas corpus relief was constitutionally guaranteed and could not be suspended by the PCRA; that the legislature lacked the constitutional power to limit the availability of habeas corpus; and that by leaving the habeas corpus statute in place, the legislature acknowledged that habeas corpus cannot be abrogated by the PCRA. This Court held that “the PCRA subsumes the remedy of habeas corpus with respect to remedies offered under the PCRA.” Thus, while acknowledging that “the legislature intended that the writ would continue to exist as a separate remedy,” this Court recognized that “the writ continues to exist only in cases in which there is no remedy under the PCRA.” The Court noted that the state habeas corpus statute itself provides that explicit limitation. <em>See 42 </em>Pa.C.S. § 6503(b) (“Where a person is restrained by virtue of sentence after conviction for a criminal offense, the writ of habeas corpus shall not be available if a remedy may be had by post-conviction hearing proceedings.”) The Court then turned to the question of whether Peterkin, in fact, had had a remedy under the PCRA; <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>finding that his claims were cognizable under the PCRA’s statutory framework, we then held that statutory habeas corpus review was not available. <em>Peterkin, </em><a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d at 639-41</a>.</p>
