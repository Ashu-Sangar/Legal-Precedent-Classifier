Richards (“Claimant”) was employed by the Board of Supervisors of Franklin Township (“Employer”) as a laborer in the Recycling Center since February 21, 1990. On June 13, 1995, Claimant sustained an injury in the course of his employment, for which he received workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to a notice of compensation payable. Upon his return to a light duty position on August 18, 1995, Claimant’s benefits were evidently suspended. Claimant continued to work in a modified capacity until November 15, 1995, at which point his benefits were reinstated because of his inability to continue working in the light duty position.</p>

Employer also sought a supersedeas by application filed on April 22, 1996, which the Workers’ Compensation Judge (the “WCJ”) denied. Following hearings, the WCJ, in a decision issued on June 4, 1997, terminated Claimant’s benefits as of November 21, 1995, finding that he had fully recovered as of that date. The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (the “Board”) affirmed the termination of benefits, as did the Commonwealth Court in a memorandum decision. <em>See Richards v.

Claimant appealed this determination, citing to his receipt of workers’ compensation benefits and contending that his base year should run from November 15, 1994, to November 15, 1995, in apparent reliance upon Section 204(b) of the Workers’ Compensation Act (“WCA”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The Referee thus reversed the determination of the Job Center and directed it to calculate Claimant’s wages, credit weeks, and financial eligibility according to the specified moveable base year. Initially, the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (the “UCBR”) affirmed the Referee’s order in a one-page decision, from which Employer appealed to the Commonwealth Court. Upon agreement of the UCBR and Employer, the Commonwealth Court remanded the matter to the UCBR for an evidentiary hearing and the issuance of a new decision. In that subsequent decision, the UCBR reversed the award of benefits, citing to the determination in the workers’ compensation proceeding that Claimant had fully recovered from his injury as of November 21, 1995.

These provisions further the humanitarian purposes of the WCA by avoiding a cessation of benefits to which a claimant may be entitled and would suffer irreparable harm if denied, pending a final adjudication of a claimant’s continued eligibility.

      <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>While the legislative objective for conditioning the availability of a moveable base year upon the existence of a compensable injury cannot be determined with absolute certainty, it is not unreasonable for the Legislature to have drawn the distinction that we have discerned. As noted, the UC Law and the WCA manifest various legislative efforts to define and coordinate benefits and, correspondingly, to limit an employer’s overall liability. Although restricting application of Section 204(b) to compensable injuries may preclude certain claimants from receiving unemployment compensation benefits because of a protracted workers’ compensation proceeding, it is noteworthy that such claimants frequently will experience a period of benefits under the procedural protections of the WCA to which they were not substantively entitled and for which they will not be held accountable. It would thus appear that the Legislature may have made a policy decision to strike a balance between the respective interests involved.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[269,1282,1163,695]]]'>In the present matter, although Claimant received workers’ compensation benefits until June 4, 1997, the WCJ’s decision established that the work-related disability had ceased as of November 21, 1995, and that Claimant could have returned to work as of that date. As such, Claimant’s inability to establish a base year in the period immediately preceding his application for unemployment compensation benefits did not result from a compensable, work-related injury, although he received benefits during that time. Consistent with the statutory scheme of the WCA, we conclude that Claimant cannot rely upon Section 204(b) to establish a moveable base year that pre-dates his 1995 work injury and, thus, does not satisfy the eligibility requirements of Section 401(a) of the UC Law.</p>
