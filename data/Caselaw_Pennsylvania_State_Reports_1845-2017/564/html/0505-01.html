He left his apartment, opened the main door to the rooming house, and was knocked to the ground as Appellant rushed past him with a .22 caliber <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>rifle. Appellant ran to the top of the main staircase, where he encountered Annalisa Wodarski and asked her for the location of persons whom he did not name. When she failed to answer, Appellant approached a door at the end of the hallway, opened it quietly, and peered inside. Wodarski then witnessed Appellant cock his rifle and enter the room, before she ran down the stairs and out of the building.</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[185,730,1153,742]]]'>Appellant entered the room of Quentin Neal and Matthew Burse, which the two used as their principal place of business for their drug-dealing operations. Upon finding Neal asleep in a reclining chair, Appellant fired three shots at close range into Neal’s chest. The gunshots awakened Burse, who was lying in a bed just a few feet away from Neal. Burse saw Appellant standing in front of Neal with the rifle pointed at Neal’s chest. Appellant then turned to Burse, asking him for money. When Burse said that he did not have any money to give him, Appellant shot Burse in the shoulder and repeated the demand. Burse then produced sixty dollars; Appellant took the cash and fled the room. Burse raced after Appellant, attacked him, and wrestled the gun away from him, but Appellant was able to flee the scene.</p>

The paramedics arrived shortly thereafter and transported Neal to the hospital by helicopter. He was pronounced dead at 5:20 a.m. A subsequent autopsy revealed that Neal died when one of the bullets pierced his heart. At the scene, Burse, who appeared to police officers to be somewhat confused and shaken, stated that a man, whom he described as a six-foot-tall, light-skinned African-American male with freckles, had first shot him and then murdered Neal. Burse was taken to the hospital and treated for a gunshot wound to his shoulder. After he received treatment, Burse was again questioned by an officer, at which time he explained that <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>Appellant had fired upon Neal before he, Burse, had been injured.</p>

Appellant next called his girlfriend, Nyquallah Bey, telling her he was coming by her residence to retrieve some clothing. He then telephoned Genoa Tillman, the mother of one of his children, to ask for a ride. Tillman drove Appellant from his stepmother’s house to his girlfriend’s residence, where he retrieved his clothing, and then to Tillman’s home, where she allowed him to remain for a few days. Fearing apprehension, Appellant eventually fled to New Jersey.</p>

During transport to the holding facility, without prompting from law enforcement officials, Appellant made several statements, including, “I’m glad it’s over,” “I was tired of looking over my shoulder,” “I want to talk to someone about this,” and “How did you find me?” Appellant also asked if he could return to Pennsylvania to “get this over with.” The officers responded only by stating that Appellant would have to wait to speak with the detective in charge at the police station.</p>

Appellant signed the card with the name Rellie Chambers and stated that he would not talk to the police until he had spoken with his current girlfriend. The officers complied with Appellant’s request to telephone this woman, and when Appellant was unable to reach her using the police station telephone, an <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>officer offered Appellant the use of his cellular telephone. Appellant then unsuccessfully attempted to reach his girlfriend at home and at work and left a message instructing her to call him.</p>

A detective informed Appellant that the first card could not be destroyed, but that Appellant could execute a second card if he now wanted to waive his rights. Appellant agreed and was again given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; he then executed a written waiver of his rights, which he signed using the name Jonathan Fisher.</p>

In response, Appellant laid his head on the table and said, “I’m a mother f-g murderer and they said I did it.” When Appellant signed his statement at 7:29 p.m., the interrogation concluded.</p>

They successfully located a judge the next morning, and Appellant, before the New Jersey Superior Court, waived an extradition hearing on the afternoon of May 12, 1999. A detective with the Montgomery County Police Department arranged to assume custody of Appellant the following morning, May 13, and return him to Pennsylvania. The officer retrieved Appellant from New Jersey at approximately 9:00 a.m. the next morning, and Appellant was arraigned that afternoon in Montgomery County.</p>

Both identified Appellant as the man responsible for the shooting. In preparation for a traditional line-up, Appellant was led through the prison where he was being detained and was asked to select several men whom he thought resembled himself to be included in the line-up. Appellant’s trial counsel then reviewed Appellant’s choices, approved three of them, and made two substitutions. During this line-up, both Wodarski and Burse again identified Appellant as the shooter without hesitation. Following both of these identifications and immediately prior to Appellant’s preliminary hearing, Burse briefly witnessed Appellant in handcuffs being escorted by the police.</p>
    <p id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.4",644,[256,1008,1155,298]]]'>Appellant filed an omnibus pre-trial motion, seeking the suppression of the statements he made to the police while being transported to a holding facility following his arrest in New Jersey, his statement to the detective during his interrogation, and the identifications made by Burse and Wodarski.

Burse testified that it was Appellant who had shot him, and that he had ample opportunity to view his attacker when the two had struggled for the gun. Upon vigorous cross-examination, Burse also denied that his drug use affected his recollection and attributed the inconsistencies in his statements to police to the shock he was experiencing after witnessing the murder.</p>

Furthermore, Nyquallah Bey and Genoa Tillman provided evidence of their part in Appellant’s flight from the police. Appellant then sought to prevent Bey from testifying that, during a telephone conversation several months after the shooting, Appellant had told her that he had shot Neal because Neal had “burnt” him in a drug deal, claiming that this <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>impermissibly introduced evidence of his prior bad acts. The trial court denied the motion, allowing Bey to testify as to the conversation. A forensic pathologist testified that Neal had died as a result of a gunshot wound to the chest.

He was acquitted on the charges of the attempted murder of Burse and the robbery of Neal. During the penalty phase, the Commonwealth presented evidence of three aggravating factors: 1) Appellant committed the murder while in the perpetration of a felony; 2) Appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense; and 3) at the time of the killing, the victim was or had been involved, associated, or in competition with Appellant in the sale, manufacture, distribution, or delivery of any controlled substance in violation of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d). In mitigation, Appellant relied upon: 1) his age at the time of the crime (24); and 2) the catch-all factor. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e). The jury determined that Appellant’s age and his relationship with his family members and future responsibility to them were mitigating factors, but also found as aggravating circumstances that the murder occurred during the commission of a felony and that Appellant’s actions created a grave risk of death to another person. Concluding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, the jury imposed a sentence of death.</p>

The evidence is also sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Appellant who committed the killing.

In fact, the Commonwealth presented evidence that Appellant entered Neal’s apartment in the early hours of the morning and shot him three times in the chest at close range with a rifle while he slept.

The record simply does not support Appellant’s claim that the public, or Appellant himself, was privileged to enter the apartment where Neal resided. Rather, testimony established that the rooming house was private property, that Neal leased a room from the owner, and that Neal and Burse carefully controlled entry into the apartment. Before any party was allowed to enter to purchase cocaine, he was required to knock and receive permission to enter or be escorted by one of Neal’s associates in the drug business. The structure, thus, was not open to the public at large. Furthermore, both Neal and Burse were asleep at the time of Appellant’s entry and were unable to grant access to the room, negating any claim that <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>Appellant was authorized to enter the premises.
