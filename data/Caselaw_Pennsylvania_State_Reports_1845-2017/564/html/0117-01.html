    <p id="b249-9" data-blocks='[["BL_249.8",249,[183,1185,1153,1066]]]'>L.L. (Mother) and P.K.B. (Father) met in 1982 and began dating while Mother was a nurse and Father was a medical resident at a medical center in Houston, Texas. Mother moved to Lufkin, Texas to begin medical school in 1989 and on July 7, 1989, she gave birth to the couple’s daughter, N.M.B (the child). Soon after the birth of the child, the couple apparently separated for a time but reunited and lived together in Lufkin, Texas while Mother was in her second year of medical school. By January of 1991, the couple had separated permanently. On March 25, 1991, a Texas court in Lubbock County entered a “Decree Granting Voluntary Legitimation,” in which Father voluntarily acknowledged paternity and support was set at $736.00 per month (“Texas decree”). The Texas decree also set forth the custodial and visitation rights of Mother and Father regarding the child. In Texas, custody and visitation rights are delineated pursuant to a “Managing Conservatorship” and a “Possessory Conservatorship.” Mother was appointed as the Managing Conservator and given primary custody rights. Father was appointed Possessory Conservator and given visitation and “access” rights.</p>

Father stopped paying child support during the time that the child was in New York because, according to Father, Mother took the child from Texas without his knowledge or approval, which Mother disputes. Mother then sought the child support arrearage in the Texas court, which Father paid. Except for this ten month period, Father has consistently paid the child support obligation.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[264,767,1163,833]]]'>In February of 1992, Father married another woman, and, in March of 1992, Mother married another man (Stepfather). Following Mother’s marriage, the child lived in Texas with Mother and Stepfather. Mother completed medical school in 1993 and for a time did an internship in New York. During her various moves, the record indicates that Mother informed the Texas court of her change of address in order to continue to receive child support pursuant to the Texas decree. In or about June of 1994, Mother began a medical residency in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, again notifying the Texas court of her change of address. At all times, Father remained in Texas and paid child support pursuant to the Texas decree. In or about 1996, Father was divorced in Texas, and he testified that the Texas Court modified support governing the child, reducing it from $736.00 per month to $525.00 per month because of Father’s divorce.</p>

Father and Father’s ex-wife testified at the termination hearing that Mother initially prohibited contact with the child and then requested that Father not assert his custodial rights to the child. Mother denied these averments. In any event, the record shows that Father visited with the child only once or twice in 1993. He also sent cards and presents during 1993. In July of 1994, he spoke to the Mother, but not to the child. Father claims that Mother did not want contact between him and the child and that Mother prohibited him from letting the child know that he was the Father. Father testified that he sent Christmas cards and gifts in December of 1995 and 1996. Father and Father’s ex-wife claim that a gift was sent to the child in <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>December of 1996, an allegation Mother disputed. He also testified that he paid the child’s medical bills whenever Mother submitted them to him, including an emergency room visit in 1995 or 1996.</p>
    <p id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[181,533,1154,680]]]'>In or about April of 1996, Father visited with the child when she accompanied Mother to Dallas, Texas for a job interview. Apparently, in 1996 and 1997 Mother had planned to return to Texas for a permanent job following her residency in Pittsburgh, and in briefs to this Court, the parties concede that Mother returned to Texas. Mother and Stepfather had another child in late 1996. In January of 1997, Mother filed, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court), a Petition to Terminate Parental Rights of Father, who continued to live in Texas and continued to make child support payments pursuant to the Texas decree. Father stopped making child support payments after receiving notice of the Petition to Terminate Parental Rights.</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[180,1239,1156,1110]]]'>An evidentiary hearing was held in Pennsylvania on March 21, 1997. Father secured counsel and he and his ex-wife attended the hearing. At the conclusion of the matter, the trial court did not make a determination, but ordered that briefs be filed on April 21, 1997. Following the hearing, Father requested partial custody of the child for the weekend of March 28-31, 1997, in accordance with the Texas decree. The judge who held the termination hearing became ill while the matter was unsettled. Mother filed an emergency petition with another judge to prevent Father from having visitation of the child on the designated weekend, which the trial court granted. On April 14, 1997, Father then filed three motions: (1) Motion to Reopen the Record, (2) Motion to Enforce Texas Court Order, and (3) Motion to Apply the Law of Texas to the Dispute Regarding the Parental Rights Dispute. The focus of these motions was that Pennsylvania should decline jurisdiction because the Texas court had entered an initial order. Father also argued in these motions that if the Pennsylvania court exercised jurisdiction, the court should apply the law of Texas, which would not terminate a parent’s rights if that parent were current in his support payments.</p>

On that same date, in a separate Order, the trial court granted (1) the Petition to Terminate Parental Rights on the basis that Father “has refused or failed to perform his parental duties” and (2) also ordered that Mother and Stepfather were awarded “custody” of the child. The trial court wrote a separate Opinion, also dated October 27, 1997. Father filed Exceptions, which were denied by an en banc trial court. He then appealed to the Superior Court. The Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum opinion that essentially adopted the analysis of the trial court.</p>

In reaching our conclusion, we apply two statutes — Pennsylvania’s Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 5341-5366 (UCCJA) and the Federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.A. § 1783A (PKPA), which contain specific provisions governing the jurisdiction of courts to entertain custody determinations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

First, we find that Mother’s Petition to Terminate Parental Rights acted as a “modification” of a Texas custody and visitation decree and that the Texas decree was rendered in accordance with the PKPA. 28 U.S.C.A § 1783A(a). Our determination incorporates the following conclusions based upon the record of the trial court: 1) the Texas decree was a custody and visitation determination and incorporated paternity, support, primary physical custody (in Texas analyzed per a Managing Conservatorship) and visitation (in Texas designated in the Possessory Conservatorship); 2) the Texas decree was rendered in accordance with the PKPA because the record evidence showed that, at the time of the 1991 Texas decree, Texas was the child’s home state given that all parties had lived there since the child’s birth in 1989; and, 3) the Petition to Terminate Parental Rights modified the Texas decree. The PKPA defines a “custody determination” as “a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the custody of a child, and includes permanent and temporary orders, and initial orders and modifications.” 28 U.S.C.A. § 1783A(b)(3). It defines visitation determination as “a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the visitation of a child <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>and includes permanent and temporary orders and initial orders and modifications.” 28 U.S.C.A. § 1783A(b)(9). It then defines a modification of either determination as essentially anything “which modifies, <em>replaces, supersedes, </em>or otherwise is made subsequent to, a prior custody or visitation determination concerning the same child, whether made by the same court or not.” 28 U.S.C.A. § 1783A(b)(5) (emphasis added).</p>

According to these courts, the Texas Legislature has determined that “when the child has resided in another state for the six months prior to the proceeding,” the other state has become the new “home state” and Texas no longer has jurisdiction over “custody.” “Custody” is defined in the Texas Family Code as “managing Conservatorship of a child.” “Visitation” is separately defined as “possession of or access to a child.” The courts have noted that “the exception to continuing jurisdiction in the Family Code mentions only ‘custody’ and does not include ‘visitation.’ ” The courts have concluded that the Legislature has distinguished the term “custody” from the term “custody determination,” which is defined as “a court decision and court orders and instructions providing for the custody of a child, including visitation rights, but does not include a decision relating to child support or any other monetary obligation of any person.” Thus, had the Legislature intended to include visitation within the exception to Texas’s continuing jurisdiction, “it would have either used the term ‘custody determination’ or it would have included the word ‘visitation.’ ” <em>Therefore, Texas “retains power to modify all aspects of its decree </em>

We note that we reach this conclusion by looking to the time period of January of 1997, the time the Petition was filed and when Pennsylvania was the "home state” of the child. However, at the time of argument of this matter, the parties concede that Mother, the child and Stepfather are no longer within the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania and this Commonwealth is no longer the "home state” of the child. From the record and briefs before us, it appears that they have returned to Texas, and thus, Texas at some time after the Petition was filed, again became, and is currently, the "home state” of the child.</p>

The Oklahoma <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>Supreme Court ruled that the courts of Oklahoma did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the termination petition because it acted as a modification to a prior custody order entered in Texas after father and mother’s divorce. Oklahoma found Texas had exclusive continuing jurisdiction that ended only if the mother moved away from Texas.</p>
