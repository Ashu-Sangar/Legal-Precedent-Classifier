The class specification for this rank, as last revised in 1968, stated that Staff Inspectors conducted special and confidential investigations into complaints against police officers.

The FOP stated the nature of the dispute was that “[pjresently the Bargaining Unit contains two Staff Inspectors. This number represents a significant reduction in the number of Staff Inspectors over the past few years without the scheduling of the appropriate promotional examination.” Demand for Arbitration, dated 6/29/1992.

Yet, she opined that equitable considerations should limit the out-of-class pay award. She stated that since the FOP did not provide adequate notice of this claim until the first day of the hearings, then the City should be compelled to make out-of-class pay awards only from that date. <em>Id. </em>at 27. She therefore ordered that the City pay to those lower-ranking employees who had been performing Staff Inspector functions the difference between the salary they had been receiving and that of the first step of the job class of Staff Inspector from October 8, 1997 up through the date of the arbitrator’s decision. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, with respect to job assignments which would take place after the date of the arbitrator’s decision, the arbitrator ordered the City to either assign Staff Inspector functions to Staff Inspectors or to pay the applicable Staff Inspector pay rate to lower ranked individuals who were performing Staff Inspector functions. <em>Id.</em>

The historical underpinnings of Act 111, an act which applies to police and firefighting personnel only, are recounted at length in <em>Pennsylvania State Police v. Pennsylvania State Troopers’ Association (Betancourt), </em>540 Pa.66, <a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="656 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="472165,472201,7864289,7864395" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01,/pa/540/0065-01,/a2d/656/0083-01,/a2d/656/0083-02">656 A.2d 83</a> (1995). In brief, the legislature crafted Act 111 in the wake of a disturbing series of episodes of labor unrest within the police and firefighting forces. This unrest was attributed to the fact that police and firefighting personnel operated under a dual disadvantage: they were prohibited from striking and were denied the right to collectively bargain. <em>Betancourt, </em><a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="656 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="472165,472201,7864289,7864395" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01,/pa/540/0065-01,/a2d/656/0083-01,/a2d/656/0083-02">656 A.2d at 88-89</a>.</p>

While the legislature maintained the prohibition on <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>striking by police and fire personnel, 43 P.S. § 217.5, it granted to the workers the right to collectively bargain as well as the right to an arbitration of their disputes. These arbitration provisions were one of the key aspects of the legislature’s plan to ensure stability within the police and firefighting forces. The legislature designed Act 111 arbitration to be swift and final; it allowed judicial intervention in the Act 111 context in only the rarest of circumstances. <em>Betancourt, </em><a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="656 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="472165,472201,7864289,7864395" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01,/pa/540/0065-01,/a2d/656/0083-01,/a2d/656/0083-02">656 A.2d at 89</a>.

Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/562/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="562 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="225926" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0581-01">562 Pa. 581</a>, <a href="/a2d/757/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="757 A.2d 338" data-case-ids="11241823,225926" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0338-01,/pa/562/0581-01">757 A.2d 338</a>, 348 (2000). This doctrine applies in matters where the complaining party tenders a general prayer for relief, such as the FOP’s request in the matter <em>sub judice. </em>In these matters, a tribunal examines the complaining party’s statement of the harm which allegedly occurred. The tribunal may then award “any appropriate relief that conforms to the case made by the pleadings although it is not exactly the relief which has been asked for by the special prayer.” <em><a href="/a2d/757/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="757 A.2d 338" data-case-ids="11241823,225926" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0338-01,/pa/562/0581-01">Id.</a></em>

But a recognition of such broad power is not tantamount to a granting of carte blanche to the tribunal to render any award. Rather, such an award must, at bottom, redress the harm alleged to have occurred. In the matter presently before the court, we must therefore focus on the nature of the complaint as crafted by the FOP’s attorney. If the FOP’s statement of the dispute could be viewed as implying that officers were underpaid while performing Staff Inspector work, then we may conclude that an out-of-class pay claim was encompassed within the demand for arbitration. If, however, no such <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>implication can be drawn, then an out-of-class pay claim was not properly presented in the demand for arbitration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the FOP’s specific statement of the nature of the dispute was that the number of Staff Inspectors had dwindled over the years as the City had not scheduled the appropriate promotional examination. The FOP made no allegation that other, lower-ranked officers were performing Staff Inspector functions. To extrapolate from the FOP’s statement of the nature of the dispute, which focused on the diminution in the number of Staff Inspectors, the allegation that other officers were performing Staff Inspector work, that they were ranked lower than Staff Inspectors, and that they were underpaid for such work is simply too great a leap of logic.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[181,1168,1157,736]]]'>Therefore, in the context of the FOP’s demand for arbitration, the arbitrator could consider a number of different remedies to rectify the diminution in the number of Staff Inspectors. Yet an out-of-class pay award does nothing to increase the numbers of Staff Inspectors. Rather, it is a remedy to compensate those officers who were allegedly underpaid for performing work normally assigned to Staff Inspectors. The issue of whether certain officers had been underpaid for work performed, and what their remedy should be, is clearly one which is distinct from whether the City acted improperly when it unilaterally decided to let attrition reduce the number of Staff Inspectors.

The City contends that the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to resolve this issue as the FOP attorney did not raise it in the demand for arbitration and it could not be raised on the first day of arbitration. In support of this argument, it relies heavily on that portion of the CBA which states that arbitrations are to be conducted pursuant to the Rules for Voluntary Labor Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). CBA, dated 7/21/1986, at 26. The AAA Rules, in turn, specifically state that “[a]fter the arbitrator is appointed, no new or different claim may be submitted except with the consent of the arbitrator and all parties.” AAA Rules, Rule 7.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Such an argu<a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>ment, though, is not cognizable within the confines of the narrow certiorari scope of review’s definition of an excess of the arbitrator’s powers as it is, in effect, an argument that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law. <em>See Pennsylvania State Police, </em><a href="/a2d/741/1248-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="741 A.2d 1248" data-case-ids="11658168,837181" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1248-01,/pa/559/0586-01">741 A.2d at 1251</a>. We therefore decline the City’s invitation to disturb those portions of the arbitrator’s award which ordered that the City must in the future assign Staff Inspector functions to Staff Inspectors and that the City must bargain, upon request by the FOP, over the decision to eliminate the rank of Staff Inspector.</p>

The fact that the FOP made an out-of-class pay claim in similar, yet undeniably distinct, matters does not give rise to the presumption that this issue is for all times present in any other similar matter.
