Witherspoon also argued that his incarceration, and the fact that the City was on notice of his intention to file a claim, were factors to be considered.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[266,983,1161,946]]]'>Commonwealth Court rejected these arguments, relying on <em>Nagy v.

In that case, the court stated that lack of good faith could be found even where the plaintiff did not intentionally delay notifying the defendant of the institution of the lawsuit; simple neglect or mistake could support a finding of failure to comply with <em>Lamp. Nagy </em>also held that the notice of intention to file suit against a government unit required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 5522 had no bearing on the inquiry. Such notice does not itself commence an action, and a plaintiff could change his mind and elect not to sue after having given such notice. A government unit having received the initial notice of intention, but not having been served with a writ or complaint within the limitation period, might well be said to have a reasonable expectation that it would not be subject to litigation. Commonwealth Court further held that Witherspoon’s incarceration was of no moment, since he was at all times represented by counsel.</p>

He asserts that he would have been able to demonstrate that the neglect or mistake did not lie completely with him; his process server had attempted to serve the writ but it was not accepted because no authorized <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>agent was present at the Law Department to receive it. Witherspoon also asserts that he had obtained a deferral of a scheduled arbitration hearing due to his incarceration “with no recorded opposition on the part of the City.” Appellant’s Brief at 7. “Where such a waiting period was in effect and the City took no action,” he argues, “it cannot be alleged that the plaintiff has stalled at all.” <em><a href="/a2d/652/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="652 A.2d 428" data-case-ids="7868643" data-case-paths="/a2d/652/0428-01">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[178,706,1157,952]]]'>The latter argument can be readily dismissed. The application for stay of the arbitration proceeding was filed on May 7, 1997, the same day the complaint was filed. A letter from the assistant city solicitor to Witherspoon’s counsel dated May 6, 1997, which was attached to the application for stay in lieu of a response, indicated that the City “cannot agree to a deferment of the arbitration scheduled for May 14, 1997.” It further advised that the City had no record of being served with the writ of summons, suggested that the process server’s return of service was actually an affidavit of non-service, and stated that the assistant solicitor had “contacted the Prothonotary to clear-up the apparent discrepancy between the docket entries and the filings.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Thus, contrary to Witherspoon’s contention, the stay of the arbitration hearing was not “unopposed” and the City cannot be said to have acquiesced in any delay.

The filing of the praecipe within the statute of limitations commenced the action, and reissuance of the writ kept the action alive for another “equivalent period,” whether service was made or even attempted. The purpose of the rule identifying the filing of the praecipe as the commencement of the action, without regard to when the prothonotary actually issued the writ or the sheriff served it, was “to free the plaintiff from the risk that the statute of limitations may bar him if he acts in time, but someone else fails to act in time.” <em>Lamp, </em><a href="/pa/469/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="469 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1722159" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0465-01">366 A.2d at 887</a>, quoting <em>Salay v.

      <em>Lamp </em>represented a first step toward curbing the potential for abuse inherent in this rule. It had apparently become common for counsel to file a praecipe for writ of summons but instruct the prothonotary not to deliver the writ to the sheriff for service. Acknowledging that this practice was consistent with the letter of the rule stated in <em>Salay </em>but not with its purpose, we disapproved the practice and changed the rule prospectively pursuant to our supervisory power. We stated that in actions instituted after the date of the <em>Lamp </em>decision, “a writ of summons shall remain effective to commence an action only if the plaintiff refrains from a course of conduct which serves to stall in its tracks the legal machinery he has just set in motion.” <em>Id. </em>at 889.

The prothonotary issued the writ the following day, but plaintiffs’ counsel misplaced the file and thus did not request the sheriff to serve the writ or pay for such service. Although the file was found several days later, counsel forgot to take the necessary steps to effectuate service, and the original writ was never served. Approximately one week after the original writ expired, counsel had it reissued and all defendants were served within the next two weeks. We affirmed the common pleas court’s dismissal of the action. We determined that the plaintiffs “failed to provide an explanation for counsel’s inadvertence which could substantiate a finding that plaintiffs made a good-faith effort to effectuate service of the writ.” <a href="/pa/510/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="510 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1796971" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0589-01">511 A.2d at 760</a>.</p>

Unlike <em>Farinacci, </em>in this case counsel delivered the writ to a process server, who made an attempt to serve it in timely fashion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In <em>Farinacci, </em>we found no abuse of discretion in the conclusion that a good-faith effort was lacking where the delay was <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>attributable only to counsel’s inadvertence and faulty memory. In this case, the “inadvertence” which allowed the thirty days to lapse without service having been made is attributable to the process server’s failure to make additional attempts until service was made, his failure to make and file a return of no service “forthwith” as required by Rules 405(a) and (e), and/or counsel’s failure to promptly ascertain the results of the process server’s efforts. The question may thus be considered as whether the one attempt at service is a sufficient basis to distinguish this case from <em>Farinacci.</em>

    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[257,868,1164,944]]]'>To address this question, it is helpful to reflect again on the rationale underlying the <em>Lamp </em>rule, as reiterated and refined in <em>Farinacci. </em>Although an action may be “commenced” by filing a praecipe for writ of summons, until this original process is served the defendant remains unaware that he has been sued. It would be inherent^ unfair, as well as contrary to the purposes of statutes of limitation, to permit the limitation period to be tolled without the defendant being apprised that he might continue to be subject to liability. Thus in <em>Lamp </em>we gave added significance to the link between the praecipe for issuance of the writ and the requirement that the writ be served. In essence, we recognized service, or at least a good faith attempt at service, as a kind of condition subsequent that must be fulfilled to complete the commencement of the action begun by filing the praecipe. In <em>Farvnacci, </em>we pursued the reasoning a step further, finding no distinction between an intentional withholding of service and a lack of service due to counsel’s inadvertence.</p>

In this case, counsel elected to use <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>a private firm to make service rather than the sheriff. Witherspoon is bound by the actions of these agents (counsel and the process server) in the same way the plaintiff in <em>Farinacci </em>was bound by the actions (or inaction) of his attorney. Since the writ was not served within thirty days, the condition necessary to complete the timely commencement of the action was not fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[203,724,1157,745]]]'>At this juncture, it becomes appropriate to reassess the wisdom of the “equivalent period” doctrine. In light of the changes in practice and in application of the rules beginning with <em>Lamp, </em>we fail to see any justification for the continuation of this common' law doctrine in present circumstances. The notion that an action can be “kept alive” for the same period of time as the applicable limitations period although the defendant has not been made aware of the action, is inherently inconsistent with the requirement that the plaintiff make a good faith attempt to notify the defendant of the action. It is also contrary to the policy underlying limitations periods as a whole, as is particularly evident with respect to causes of action with limitation periods of four, five, and six years or more. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5525 <em>et seq.</em>

His first attorney filed a writ of summons on August 31, 1987 (within the applicable two-year limitations period) and attempted to serve the writ unsuccessfully on September 8, 1987. On October 15, 1987, Patterson’s attorney filed a praecipe for reissuance of the writ that he delivered to the sheriff on October 19, 1987, which resulted in another unsuccessful attempt to serve the defendant on November 5,1987. For the next seventeen months, there was no effort to reissue the writ or to serve the defendant. On May 1, 1989, Patterson hired a new attorney, who reissued the writ on May 5, 1989 and successfully served the defendant by mail on May 26, 1989. The defendant removed the action to federal court and moved to dismiss the action based on the expiration of the statute of limitation. The trial court accepted the defendant’s arguments that the seventeen-month delay between the last attempt to serve the writ and the eventual successful service “nullified the tolling effect of the filing of the praecipes in August and October of 1987.” <a href="/f2d/914/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="914 F.2d 384" data-case-ids="10534777" data-case-paths="/f2d/914/0384-01">914 F.2d at 387</a>.

The availability of a non pros dismissal serves two purposes: (1) it protects a defendant from having to defend a lawsuit in unfair circumstances where the plaintiffs delay has caused actual harm to the defense; (2) by requiring a showing of prejudice, it ensures that a plaintiffs action is not dismissed without an adjudication on the merits, thus denying a plaintiff his or her day in court, unless the plaintiffs own actions have deprived the defendant of a fair proceeding. The remedy of a non-pros dismissal, therefore, constitutes a more even-handed mechanism for policing a dilatory plaintiff than the standard now imposed by the lead opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

      <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>Finally, the lead opinion’s standard assumes that plaintiffs need the compulsion of another grounds for dismissal of their lawsuit in order to be encouraged to pursue service of the defendant vigorously. That assumption ignores the plaintiffs basic motivation in filing the action in the first place: obtaining a judgment. Of course, since service of process is necessary <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> to establish personal jurisdiction over a defendant, and because there can be no enforceable judgment from a court that lacks jurisdiction, it will always be in the plaintiffs interests to serve the defendant. The lead opinion’s new rule creates a punitive standard that fails to take into account these basic mechanics of the litigation process and will, in all probability, result in an increase in the dismissal of lawsuits without the plaintiffs having had the benefit of their “day in court.”</p>

Although Witherspoon used a private process server, rather than the sheriffs department, this practice is specifically permitted by our Rules of Civil Procedure for service within the City of Philadelphia. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 400.1(a)(1). According to the Affidavit of Service completed by the process server, there was an attempt to serve the City within the thirty days that the writ of summons remained valid process. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 401(a). Because the trial court ruled on the City’s preliminary objections without allowing the parties to present testimony, however, we have nothing in the record to show whether the process server <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>appeared at the proper location to serve the City, although Witherspoon claims that he complied with the rules governing service of a political subdivision. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 422(b). I believe the trial court should have permitted Witherspoon to have a hearing to support his contention that he believed service had been properly made and did not discover the failure to serve until a later time. At the very least, I would remand to the trial court to conduct a hearing regarding Witherspoon’s service efforts with respect to the writ of summons issued on September 12, 1996, and to determine whether those efforts qualified as a “good faith” attempt to serve the City.</p>

I reiterate my position that once the praecipe for a writ of summons, or complaint, is filed as original process within the limitations period, the statute of limitation no longer applies. Rather, it has been the "equivalent period" doctrine described in <em>Zarlinsky, </em>and the modification of that doctrine in <em>Lamp, </em>which have placed additional restraints on plaintiffs and given defendants the ability to dismiss an action where the plaintiff failed to effect service in a timely fashion. Strictly speaking, however, that ability to dismiss the action has not been based on the bar of the statute of limitation, but has been based on the failure to satisfy the <em>Lamp </em>rule. <em>Cf. Zarlinsky, </em><a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20317" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="167 A.2d 317">167 A.2d at 319</a> (“The [statute of limitation] is without direct bearing on the issue here involved since the plaintiffs filed their praecipe for writ of summons ...within two years of the happening of the accident. The statutory period of limitation becomes important, however, by <em>analogy </em>and furnishes the basis for the rule promulgated by the decision of this court with respect to the period of time within which a plaintiff must act to protect the efficiency of a writ of summons issued but not served.”) (emphasis added). Accord<a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>ingly, I find the lead opinion’s reliance on “the policy underlying limitations periods as a whole” inapposite, particularly where the legislature has not made actual service on the defendant a requirement for satisfaction of the statute of limitation.</p>

Rule 430 provides that ”[i]f service cannot be made under the applicable rule the plaintiff may move the court for a special order directing the method of service.” Pa.R.C.P. 430(a). As the rule plainly states, however, this is an option of last resort for a plaintiff who has exhausted all reasonable efforts to locate the defendant for service. I fear the lead opinion’s decision will encourage plaintiffs to apply for alternative service orders too hastily out of concern that any prolonged investigation into the whereabouts of a defendant will result in a failure to satisfy the lead opinion's "immediately and continuously” standard.</p>
