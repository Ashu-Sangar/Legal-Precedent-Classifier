The trooper immediately issued Blosser a speeding citation and a separate DUS citation. Both citations were filed in District Justice Day’s office. On December 2,1997, Blosser pled guilty to speeding. After accepting Blosser’s guilty plea, District Justice Day appointed an attorney to represent Blosser for the DUS charge.

The Court spoke to the broader principles of placing the burden of joinder on the Commonwealth and finding waiver only in those instances where the defendant affirmatively acts to separate the prosecutions pending against him. 493 Pa. at 30 31, 425 A.2d at 349-50.</p>

Rather, the Commonwealth brought the successive prosecutions against Appellants. In light of the policy reasons underlying Section 110, as well as our prior case law, the burden to consolidate trials must be placed on the Commonwealth. Mere silence by the defendant is insufficient to find that a defendant has affirmatively acted to block consolidation and therefore, waived a claim under Section 110. Thus, we find that the Superior Court erred in finding that Appellants waived their right to challenge the Commonwealth’s subsequent and separate prosecutions of their DUS charges once they pled guilty to their speeding charges.</p>
