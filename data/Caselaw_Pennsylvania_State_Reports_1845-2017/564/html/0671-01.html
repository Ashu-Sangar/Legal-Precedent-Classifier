Subsequently, on March 13, 2001, Appellant filed a petition to set aside Candidate’s nomination petition with the Commonwealth Court. In his petition, Appellant challenged the validity of numerous signatures collected by Candidate as well as the circulator affidavits on several signature petition pages signed by Candidate and her assistants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> . Based on these challenges, Appellant argued that Candidate’s nomination petition did not contain one thousand valid signatures from electors throughout the Commonwealth or one hundred valid signatures from electors in each of five counties of the Commonwealth, as required by Section 912.1(10) of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 2872.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In concluding that certification was proper, the Commonwealth Court first found that Candidate’s nomination petition met the quota of one thousand valid signatures because Appellant had not pursued sufficient challenges to the 1,910 signatures on Candidate’s petition to bring the total number of signatures below the 1,000 minimum requirement.</p>

Given that Candidate’s nomination petition had four counties with over one hundred uncontested signatures, the court observed that in order to prove that Candidate’s nomination petition should be set aside for failure to meet the five county requirement, Appellant had to establish that Candidate’s nomination petition did not actually contain one hundred valid signatures from electors residing in each of the counties of Erie, Philadelphia, and Montour, i.e., the three remaining counties out of the seven counties that Candidate claimed to have one hundred valid electors’ signatures listed in her nomination petition.</p>

Candidate further conceded that a significant number of signatures by electors in Erie and Philadelphia counties should be removed. After factoring in the signatures conceded by Candidate to be invalid, the Commonwealth Court then reviewed the contested signatures by electors residing in Erie and Philadelphia counties. The court agreed with Appellant that many of the signatures had to be struck from Candidate’s nomination petition for various reasons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Nevertheless, in spite of the signatures that were stricken, the court ultimately calculated that Candidate’s nomination petition contained 115 valid signatures by electors from Erie County and 110 valid signatures by electors from Philadelphia County. Thus, the court found that Candidate’s nomination petition satisfied the five county requirement of Section 912.1(10) of the Election <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>Code as it contained one hundred signatures from six counties.

While this may be the case, the fact remains that Mr. Droney’s printed signature on Candidate’s nomination petition did not match his name as signed on his voter registration card and therefore, his name must be removed from the petition. <em>See In re Cooper, </em>163 Pa.Commw. at 447, <a href="/pa-commw/163/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="643 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="1459879,7867016" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/163/0430-01,/a2d/643/0717-01">643 A.2d at 725</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Upon reviewing this testimony, we agree with Appellant that Candidate lacked the requisite knowledge prescribed by Section 909 to affirm the signatures on lines 11 through 29 on page 28 and on lines 13 through 20 on page 43. As Candidate could not recall whether she collected the signatures on lines 11 through 29 on page 28, Candidate did not have sufficient knowledge of the criteria in Section 909 to affirm those electors’ signatures. Therefore, the seven signatures on lines 11 through 29 listed on page 28 challenged by Appellant are struck.</p>

In fact, according to Candidate’s testimony, it was very likely that Mr. McGraw gathered those signatures and Candidate never even met those electors. Thus, based on Candidate’s inability to recollect whether she or Mr. McGraw obtained the signatures on lines 13 through 20 on page 43 and our finding that a candidate must be personally present at the time an elector signs a nomination petition, we likewise strike the two signatures on page 43 challenged by Appellant.</p>

In support of her claim, Candidate points to the fact that while the Commonwealth Court did not reach the issue of whether Appellant had standing based on the fact that it had reviewed the merits and found in favor of Candidate, the Commonwealth Court nonetheless noted that Appellant did not present the court with sufficient proof that he was a registered elector at his claimed address. <em>See In re Nomination Petition of Samms, </em><a href="/pa/543/0681-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="543 Pa. 681" data-case-ids="461612" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0681-01">543 Pa. 681</a>, <a href="/pa/543/0680-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="674 A.2d 240" data-case-ids="461608,461612,7859559,7859611" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0680-01,/pa/543/0681-01,/a2d/674/0240-01,/a2d/674/0240-02">674 A.2d 240</a> (1996) (to challenge a nomination petition, one must be registered to vote in the district holding the primary election and be a member of the political party to which the nomination pertains). Upon review, however, we find that the Commonwealth Court made this statement in response to the fact that Appellant provided the court with a poor copy of his registration record from the office of the Chief Registrar of Indiana County, which did not clearly discern his address. Although we agree that Appellant should have provided the court with a clearer copy, the copy offered by Appellant did indicate that he is a registered voter and a member of the Democratic Party. Given these circumstances, we find that Appellant has standing to challenge Candidate’s petition.</p>

Consequently, Candidate's petition contains 97 valid signatures by electors in Erie County and 99 valid signatures by electors in Philadelphia County.</p>
