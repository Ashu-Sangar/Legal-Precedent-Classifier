Although Stair prevailed in this action, her remedy was limited to injunctive relief — the employer/defendant prevailed on Stair’s claims for monetary damages. Stair, through Turtzo, Spry, then requested attorneys’ fees, pursuant to the Title VII provision vesting the court with discretion to award such fees “as part of costs” to certain prevailing parties. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k). The district court awarded fees in the amount of $74,040, although its order did not specifically direct that payment should be made to Stair. Apparently, the award was tendered to Turtzo, Spry, which asserted an interest in the total award.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Stair took the position that Turtzo, Spry’s retention of the award was contrary to the fee agreement, since the statutory fee award constituted a “recovery” under its terms, and, hence, Turtzo, Spry was entitled to only one-third of the award ($23,946). Accordingly, Stair commenced the present civil action in the common pleas court to recover the balance of the award ($50,094) pursuant to the fee agreement. Turtzo, Spry filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, asserting that Stair failed to state a cause of action, since the fee agreement did not apply to attorneys’ fees and costs awarded by the district court.</p>

The court referenced Congress’s reliance upon private enforcement to implement public policy and its provision for the award of attorneys’ fees to encourage such enforce<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>ment efforts, reasoning that permitting Stair to recover the fees awarded based upon Turtzo, Spry’s efforts would frustrate the salutary legislative aim.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[260,516,1161,894]]]'>On appeal, the Superior Court reversed in a memorandum opinion, finding that the standard of review applicable on consideration of a grant of preliminary objections prevented it from resolving the question of whether the parties intended fee awards to constitute “recovery” subject to percentage allocation. Although the Superior Court appeared to accept that attorneys may possess some inherent interest in statutory fee awards since such awards are provided to encourage private enforcement efforts, it reasoned that neither the statute nor the decisional law precluded the parties from contractually agreeing to divide such fees along with any other recovery. The court discerned sufficient ambiguity in the agreement to preclude the dismissal of Stair’s complaint for failure to state a claim. We allowed appeal to examine the differing conclusions of the trial court and the Superior Court, which are reflected in the parties’ arguments before this Court.</p>

According to Turtzo, Spry, this conclusion is compelled by an overarching Congressional policy of ensuring the provision of actual compensation to civil rights attorneys in individual cases in order to encourage their pursuit of meritorious claims on behalf of plaintiffs who otherwise might go unrepresented. Turtzo, Spry contends that the fee agreement was by no means intended to distribute two-thirds of <em>its </em>interest to Stair. On the other hand, Stair argues that statutory fee awards vest in the plaintiff, pursuant to federal policy supporting the conferral upon such persons of the means for obtaining representation. According to Stair, federal policy does not concern itself with the allocation to the attorney of funds conferred upon the client; therefore, such allocation may <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>occur solely pursuant to the contractual fee agreement underlying the attorney/client relationship.</p>

The intention of Congress was to encourage successful civil rights litigation, not to create a special incentive to prove damages and shortchange efforts to seek effective injunctive or declaratory relief. Affirming the decision below would create an artificial disincentive for an attorney who enters into a contingent-fee agreement, unsure of whether his client’s claim sounded in state tort law or in federal civil rights, from fully exploring all possible avenues of relief. Section 1988 makes no distinction between actions for damages and suits for equitable relief.

However, the reasoning applied in such decisions undermines Turtzo, Spry’s position that a clear Congressional policy requires that civil rights attorneys must always receive the direct and entire benefit of statutory fee awards in individual cases. Indeed, even those courts that have attempted to justify the preservation of a direct attorney interest in statutory fee awards have had substantial difficulty articulating a basis grounded in federal policy in light of <em>Evans </em>and <em>Venegas. See, e.g., Cambridge Trust, </em><a href="/citations/?q=721%20N.E.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="721 N.E.2d 1">721 N.E.2d at 7</a>.
