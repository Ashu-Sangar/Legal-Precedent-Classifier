Among the devices supplied are video poker and video slot machines, which are commonly placed in taverns, private clubs, service stations, and grocery and convenience stores. In January of 1991, the Pennsylvania State Police, Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement (“BLCE”), began investigating allegations of illegal gambling activities in Allegheny County. During the investigation, Appellees were identified as suppliers of particular electronic game machines that had been used for gambling. Specifically, it was alleged that video poker and slot machines were equipped by either Appellees or the machine’s distributors with a “knock-off’ feature, permitting the removal of credits or games accumulated by a player and thereby allowing the owner of the establishment to pay a dollar value per credit, typically 25 cents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In addition, the machines purportedly contained accounting devices (meters) that recorded the credits, enabling Appellees and the establishment owners to divide the profits.

Based upon the information gathered from the investigation and the searches, Appellees were charged with three counts of corrupt organizations, eight counts of gambling devices, criminal conspiracy <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>and dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities.

In particular, Appellees presented evidence that 10,000 video poker and slot machines existed within various establishments throughout Allegheny County, including ninety-nine percent of all private clubs, and that such machines were delivered openly, visibly displayed and played, and, more important, openly used for gambling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Municipal officials license these machines, and, in some instances, police departments affix permits or licenses on the machines themselves.

In addition, Appellee, George Kratsas, testified that officials within the communities indicated that there was nothing wrong with using such machines for gambling, and that based upon these conversations and the practice of licensing video poker and slot machines, he believed that gambling on the machines was legal.</p>
    <p id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[176,934,1156,1330]]]'>In response, the Commonwealth challenged the propriety of the pre-trial motion to dismiss, arguing that the due process issue required factual findings that would be more appropriately rendered by a jury. On the substantive points, the Commonwealth offered evidence that: most gambling prosecutions are initiated at the state level; it is difficult to enforce the gambling laws because some of the machines are legal, at least as manufactured; the machines seized in this case contained knock-off devices and meters, which rendered such devices illegal <em>per se; </em>and while local officials issued licenses, they did not authorize gambling. The Commonwealth also presented testimony that many of the video poker and slot machines contained warnings that the devices were for amusement only, and, similarly, the local ordinances and the amusement device permits did not authorize gambling. Furthermore, the Commonwealth offered the text of local ordinances indicating the official policy to follow state law, as well as testimony from local officials stating that they refused to license devices that contained clearing and recording features and that they were unaware that video poker and slot machines were used for gambling. Finally, the Commonwealth elicited from George Kratsas that no state official had ever advised him that gambling was legal. Following the hearings, Appellees submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the Commonwealth filed a brief in opposition.</p>

In relation to the merits of the motion, the trial court adopted, in full, Appellees’ proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, including but not limited to the findings that the deployment of illegally modified video poker and slot machines was prevalent, open and notorious throughout Allegheny County; local officials issued licenses or permits for such machines with knowledge that these devices were used for gambling; the fees for the licenses were higher when the device was a video poker or slot machine precisely because of the gambling function; the municipalities gained substantial revenue through such licensure; and, because of the licensing practices of the municipalities, the lack of enforcement of the gambling statute, and conversations with public officials, Appellees believed that their conduct was legal. In the application of due process principles to these findings, the trial <em>court </em>invoked a doctrine predicated upon reliance on misrepresentations of law by government officials, sometimes referred to in the decisional law and commentary as the “official statement mistake of law doctrine,” and “entrapment by estoppel.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In this regard, the trial court analogized the case to a trilogy of United States Supreme Court cases, <em>Raley v.

The clear, overriding evil sought to be remedied by the <em>Raley, Cox </em>and <em>PICCO </em>cases and their progeny is fundamental unfairness in the initiation of criminal prosecutions. Allowing prosecution of the defendants, under the facts of this case “would be to sanction an indefensible sort of entrapment by the State.” The prosecutions of [Appellees] fall squarely within the purview of these cases and this Court should “prevent the Government from proceeding with the prosecution.”</blockquote>

Thus, the trial court accepted Appellees’ position that the prosecution violated the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Commonwealth lodged an appeal, and a divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed in a one-page, memorandum decision, relying upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law that were adopted by the trial court, with Judge Ford Elliott concurring in the result.

Further, the Commonwealth contends that uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that Appellees fully apprehended that gambling (and distribution of gambling devices) was proscribed by law. In this regard, the Commonwealth emphasizes Appellees’ multi-generational experience in the game business, from which it argues that familiarity with applicable laws can be inferred. Even if in their general experience Appellees did not gain such awareness, the Commonwealth asserts, they would have necessarily obtained inquiry notice by virtue of the manufacture of the machines without clearing/recording devices necessary to permit gambling, and by encountering the label and manual warnings, as well as other admonitions in written ordinances and other documents pertinent to the licensing and permitting process. According to the Commonwealth, the <em>ad hoc </em>method by which machines are modified to permit gambling further evidences Appellees’ intent to evade enforcement. Additionally, the Commonwealth notes that the primary enforcement of the gambling laws is accomplished by state, rather than local, officials, and directs our attention to Appellees’ admitted awareness of particular law enforcement efforts. Centrally, the Commonwealth asks the Court to distinguish between reasonable reliance based upon a bona fide belief that one’s conduct truly complies with the written law, and mere reliance upon lax enforcement and nonfeasance by certain local officials, with a corresponding expectation of freedom from prosecution.

Further, they provide many citations to the portions of the record upon which the trial court based its conclusions that municipal authorities acceded to, and indeed, benefited from, the gambling activities in their communities. Appellees contend that this evidence amply supports the trial <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>court’s conclusion that government and law enforcement officials affirmatively misled them into believing that they would not be subject to criminal prosecution for distributing gaming devices. Although Appellees indicate that they received express assurances that their conduct was in fact legal, they also take the position that affirmative misrepresentations by a government official are not an essential prerequisite to the reliance doctrine. Rather, Appellees assert that a citizen may be misled by governmental conduct, and, in the present case, they view the conduct of local officials in licensing devices with the knowledge that they would be used for gambling as sufficient to render their prosecution fundamentally unfair. Defending against the Commonwealth’s evidence concerning Appellees’ awareness of illegality (or at least potential illegality), Appellees argue that their “belief that they would not be prosecuted, in the context of this case, is no different than a belief that their conduct was legal, especially in light of the identities of the persons creating that belief.”</p>
