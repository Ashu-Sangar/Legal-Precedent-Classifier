Later, on June 24, 1994, she filed a Complaint in Divorce. Personal service of the reinstated Complaint in Divorce was effected on Appellant in Alabama on September 28, 1995. Appellant did not file an answer to the Complaint in Divorce. Appellee served Appellant with written interrogatories relating to income and expenses. Appellant did not answer Appellee’s interrogatories. On February 16, 1996, Attorney Lee A. Montgomery filed a Praecipe for Appearance on Appellant’s behalf in the divorce action. Thereafter, Appellant’s attorney attended a hearing held by the trial court to decide whether Appellant should be held in contempt for failing to respond to Appellee’s discovery.

The trial court <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>scheduled a bifurcation hearing for May 8, 1998.

The court first found that § 1408(c)(4) addresses subject matter jurisdiction. Since the parties conceded that Appellant was neither a resident nor a domiciliary of the Commonwealth, the court turned to the question of Appellant’s consent. Based on its conclusion that the statute speaks to subject matter jurisdiction, the court reviewed the record to determine whether Appellant had consented to its jurisdiction over the retirement pay itself. The court found that no action Appellant had taken in the case amounted to such consent. Accordingly, the court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Act to decide the equitable distribution of Appellant’s retirement pay, and granted Appellant’s preliminary objections by order dated May 14,1998.</p>

Like the trial court, the first question the Superior Court determined was whether § 1408(c)(4)(C)’s consent provision implicates subject matter or personal jurisdiction. In the Superior Court’s view, since the residency and domicile alternatives in § 1408(c)(4)(A) and § 1408(c)(4)(B) respectively are traditional tests of personal jurisdiction, and because the legislative history of the Act shows that Congress sought to curtail a spouse’s forum shopping, it was logical to conclude that the consent alternative in § 1408(c)(4)(C) is a matter of personal jurisdiction. <em><a href="/a2d/731/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="731 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="11666921" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0632-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/731/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="731 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="11666921" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0632-01">at 636-37</a>.</p>

Noting that Appellant accepted service of the Complaint in Divorce, secured counsel who entered a written appearance on his behalf, was represented by counsel at a discovery dispute hearing, complied with a discovery order, answered interrogatories, and attended an ancillary support modification conference in Butler County, the court held that Appellant had consented to the court’s personal jurisdiction through his participation in the divorce proceedings. <em><a href="/a2d/731/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="731 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="11666921" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0632-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/731/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="731 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="11666921" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0632-01">at 637-38</a>.

Once the Superior Court characterized § 1408(c)(4)(C) as a personal jurisdiction provision, it assumed that the statute meant consent to the court’s personal jurisdiction in a divorce proceeding for all purposes. The court did not allow for the possibility that § 1408(c)(4)(C) is more limited, and refers to a military serviceperson’s consent to the court’s authority over him to distribute his pension.

It is also important to remember that the authority granted to state courts in the family law context in which § 1408(c)(4)(C) operates is comprehensive. In divorce actions, state courts are empowered to decide a variety of matters; they dissolve marriages, resolve property rights, and determine issues of child custody, alimony and support. <em>See, e.g., </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 3104(a)(l)-(5).

In the Act, Congress did not purport to regulate any other of the several issues that may arise in a military member’s divorce nor did it purport to speak to a member’s conduct in litigation with regard to any issue but the retirement pay. Section 1408(c)(4) preempts state long-arm statutes only in connection with a court’s authority to determine a military member’s retirement pay, and leaves all other rules by which state courts acquire personal jurisdiction over a military member for divorce and ancillary economic issues untouched. By its terms, § 1408(c)(4)(C) reflects Congress’ narrow aim. While the reference to jurisdiction in § 1408(c)(4)(C) is unqualified, § 1408(c)(4)(C) contains a reference to § 1408(c)(l)’s specific focus on the retirement pay. Reading the language of § 1408(c)(4)(C) in context and consistently with the Act’s scope and object, we believe that Congress intended for the consent requirement in § 1408(c)(4)(C) to relate, like the rest of the Act, specifically to a military member’s pension.</p>

The right to consent in § 1408(c)(4)(C) carries with it, of course, the right not to consent. Under the Superior Court’s construction of the statute, a military member who seeks § 1408(c)(4)(C)’s protection should withhold his consent to the trial court’s personal jurisdiction in general. Taken to its logical conclusion, however, the Superior Court’s construction would mean that Congress gave a military member, who succeeds in withholding his consent under the statute, the power to veto the personal jurisdiction a court might otherwise have to dissolve a marriage or to determine the various matters, including the partition of other marital assets, that divorce actions raise. Given the federal principle that family law is preeminently a local matter and the limited focus of the Act, this simply cannot be the case.</p>

In its opinion, the Superior Court suggested that a military member who does not consent under § 1408(c) to the trial court’s authority to distribute his retirement pay should file preliminary objections to the court’s personal jurisdiction. Typically, however, he will be subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction, no matter what he files or states. Thus, a general assertion that withholds consent to the court’s personal jurisdiction would be legally meaningless on its face. In this context then, the assertion that has legal meaning is one (like the assertion made by Appellant) that withholds consent specifically to the court’s jurisdiction -with respect to the retirement pay.</p>

Six general areas were marked as “[o]ther matters claimed”, including “Property Rights Between Spouses.” The complaint requested that the court issue a divorce decree and determine the other matters. It did not expressly refer to or even allude to any of the marital property, including appellant’s military retirement pay, that the court was to distribute.</p>

It was at this point that Appellant raised his objection to the court’s jurisdiction to distribute his retirement pay, having received notice that the trial court would determine his rights to that particular asset. In light of our construction of the Act, and considering the course this litigation took, we decline to find that Appellant’s failure to file preliminary objections to the Complaint in Divorce, specifically withholding his consent to the court’s distribution of the pay, was a waiver of his right to object to the court’s jurisdiction under § 1408(c)(4)(C).</p>

    <p id="b597-6" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[192,1175,1153,957]]]'>As reflected in the record, appellant accepted personal service of the reinstated divorce complaint, while stationed in Alabama. The divorce complaint did not specifically mention appellant’s military retirement pension; however, it did serve to place him on notice that his wife planned to seek equitable distribution of all their martial assets. <em>See Allen, <a href="/so2d/484/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="484 So. 2d 269" data-case-ids="7597661" data-case-paths="/so2d/484/0269-01">supra</a> </em>(military spouse, by answering divorce petition filed by wife in Louisiana, waived all objections to jurisdiction of Louisiana courts, and such waiver was sufficient to give court jurisdiction over wife’s subsequent petition to partition community property, including share of husband’s military retirement pay). Appellant then obtained counsel, who entered an appearance on his behalf in Butler County. While the entry of a written appearance alone does not constitute a waiver of the right to challenge the court’s jurisdiction, such activity is inconsistent with the intent to object to jurisdiction over the military retirement pension. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1012(a); <em>see also In re Booker, </em><a href="/p2d/833/0734-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="833 P.2d 734" data-case-ids="10364901" data-case-paths="/p2d/833/0734-01">833 P.2d 734</a>, 740 (Colo.1992).</p>

Appellant <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>even made a personal appearance at an ancillary support modification conference in Butler County.</p>
    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[259,447,1163,893]]]'>For almost three years, appellant participated, without objection, while the Butler County courts adjudicated the dissolution of the parties’ marriage. It was not 'until four days prior to the bifurcation hearing that appellant objected to the court’s jurisdiction over his military retirement pension. As the Superior Court noted, if appellant had wanted to object to Pennsylvania jurisdiction over his military retirement pension, he could have immediately filed a preliminary objection raising the question of personal jurisdiction concerning his pension. <em>See, e.g. Seeley v. Seeley, </em><a href="/sw2d/690/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="690 S.W.2d 626" data-case-ids="9978147" data-case-paths="/sw2d/690/0626-01">690 S.W.2d 626</a> (Tex.App.1985) (husband, who was professional soldier stationed in Germany, waived his special appearance and made general appearance in divorce proceeding by allowing trial to proceed without first obtaining ruling on his special appearance motion; thus, husband consented to jurisdiction and satisfied requirements of § 1408(c)(4), allowing the trial court to award wife a percentage of husband’s military retirement pension).</p>
    <p id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[259,1363,1166,1001]]]'>Instead, appellant argued that, although he generally consented to the divorce proceeding, the court lacked the specific jurisdiction to divide his military retirement pension because he did not specifically agree to it. Contrary to the majority’s finding, I find that argument not supported by the clear language of the statute. Subsection 1408(c)(4)(C) only requires consent to the jurisdiction of the court, not consent to the court’s authority to divide the pension. Had Congress intended <em>specific </em>consent for the military retirement pension to become subject to a court proceeding, it would have drafted the statute to do so. As it is, the statute curtails “forum shopping” by the nonmilitary spouse but does not confer absolute “veto power” to the military spouse. If it did, the military member could always invoke the jurisdiction of a court on matters ancillary to the divorce, such as visitation, custody, etc., but then refuse to give consent as to division of the military retirement pension. That surely was not the intent of Congress. Furthermore, there was no evidence of forum shopping here by the military member’s spouse.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.3",599,[202,328,1156,851]]]'>
      <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>Appellant’s contacts with Butler County lead inescapably to the conclusion that he submitted himself to the jurisdiction of Butler County to adjudicate his divorce, notwithstanding that he later objected to the state’s jurisdiction to handle the narrow question of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over his military retirement pension. As such, I would find that appellant had sufficient minimum contacts with the Commonwealth to establish his consent to the court’s jurisdiction, thereby allowing the trial court to equitably distribute his military retirement pension pursuant to the Act. It would defy logic to have this appelleeAvife go through support proceedings and divorce proceedings in Pennsylvania but have to invoke the jurisdiction of a court located wherever appellant’s residence or domicile happens to be. assuming that it would even be in the United States, in order to reach the military retirement pension. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>
