Additionally, an employer always has the opportunity to defend against an award of attorney’s fees by creating a record that demonstrates a reasonable contest. <em><a href="/a2d/734/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="734 A.2d 39" data-case-ids="11540774" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0039-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/734/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="734 A.2d 39" data-case-ids="11540774" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0039-01">at 48</a>. Thus, the request requirement is not necessary to provide an employer with notice or an opportunity to defend itself against an award of counsel fees because Section 440 itself serves such purposes.
