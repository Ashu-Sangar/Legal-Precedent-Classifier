After taking a tour with one of the rental agents, Andrews and Johnson left the building -without incident. On the same day, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Andrews and Johnson entered the rental office of the Brynfield Court apartment building and inquired about leasing an apartment. When the owner of the building asked Andrews and Johnson what type of apartment they desired and to whom it would be leased, she received vague answers. Feeling uncomfortable, the owner attempted to radio the building superintendent, at which point Johnson brandished a handgun and Andrews confronted the building’s general manager, who was also present. Andrews and Johnson directed the victims to a back office, ordered them to lie on the floor, and removed their jewelry. After repeatedly demanding the location of the safe, and being told that the office did not have one, Andrews and Johnson asked for the victims’ pocketbooks and bound the victims’ arms.</p>

Shortly after they were asked to complete a rental application, one of the individuals approached the property manager with his gun drawn. Andrews and Johnson forced the victim into a vault inside the office, demanded cash, and removed her watch and necklace. As was the case with the Brynfield Court robbery, the victim was told to lie on the floor and her hands were tied. Later the same day, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Andrews and Johnson inquired about rental possibilities at the Korman Suites apartment complex, where a leasing agent showed them a sample apartment. Upon returning to the rental office, Andrews and Johnson drew their guns, took jewelry and money from the agent and three office workers, forced them to lie on the floor, and then bound their legs.</p>

A police officer observed the infraction, and a chase ensued, with Andrews and Johnson eventually abandoning their vehicle and fleeing on foot. They were apprehended shortly thereafter and returned to the scene, where they were identified by one of the victims. A search of the perpetrators’ vehicle revealed evidence linking them to the Garden Court and Korman Suites robberies. In addition, police recovered a revolver and a semi-automatic pistol, which matched the description of the handguns used during those robberies.</p>

The informations treated the crimes not as a continuing event but as individual incidents; thus, each defendant was charged with three counts of criminal conspiracy and three counts of possessing an instrument of crime related to each of the incidents. Concerning the conspiracy counts, the Commonwealth alleged as criminal objectives, <em>inter alia, </em>robbery and possession of an instrument of crime, and both informations included as an overt act posses<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>sion of a gun.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Prior to trial, the Commonwealth petitioned to consolidate the offenses and to have Andrews and Johnson tried together. In its petition, the Commonwealth alleged that Andrews and Johnson were co-conspirators, who participated jointly in a continuing series of acts over a twenty-six-hour period, and that the same evidence was applicable to each defendant. In addition, the Commonwealth averred that the robberies were perpetrated in a similar manner, namely, that Andrews and Johnson entered apartment rental offices posing as potential tenants and, after making inquiries regarding the apartments, brandished handguns, ordered the workers to lie on the floor, bound them, and stole personal effects and money. This similarity was equated with a <em>modus operandi, </em>which tended to establish the identity of the perpetrators. The Commonwealth’s petition was granted, and the case proceeded to a jury trial.</p>

During his closing argument, counsel for Andrews argued that the robberies were not part of a common plan or scheme and were not connected. In response, the Commonwealth argued that the overlapping evidence from the robberies, in conjunction with the distinct manner in which the crimes were committed, constituted a <em>modus operandi </em>that was akin to a signature demonstrating the identity of the perpetrators. Notably, Andrews did not request a jury instruction as to whether the evidence supported a finding of multiple conspiracies or a single conspiracy with multiple objectives. The jury convicted Andrews and Johnson each of five counts of robbery, two counts of criminal conspiracy, and two counts of possessing an instrument of crime, relating to the Garden Court and Korman Suites robberies; they were acquitted of the offenses stemming from the Brynfield Court robbery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In addition, the crimes were not interdependent, as where one offense is a “necessary intermediate step” to committing a later offense. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
