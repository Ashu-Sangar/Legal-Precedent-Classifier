The case arose out of a lawsuit brought by Cynthia Herdrich against her treating physician, Dr. Lori Pegram, and the health maintenance organization (“HMO”) that Dr. Pegram and her partners owned and operated. The HMO had contracted with the company that employed Herdrich’s husband to provide prepaid medical services to its employees and their respective families. Dr. Pegram examined Herdrich for pain in the midline area of her groin, and discovered an inflamed mass in her abdomen. Dr. Pegram did not order an immediate ultrasound at the local hospital, but decided to wait some eight days for an ultrasound at a facility staffed by HMO physicians. Before the ultrasound could be performed, Herdrich’s appendix ruptured, causing peritonitis.</p>

Asserting that the fraud counts were preempted by ERISA, Pegram and the HMO removed the case to federal district court, and moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the defendants summary judgment on the first count, but granted Herdrich leave to amend the second. She did, alleging that the provision of medical services under the terms of the HMO, which rewarded its physician owners for limiting medical care, amounted to an inherent or anticipatory breach of ERISA’s fiduciary duties as set forth in <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 1109">29 U.S.C. § 1109</a>(a), to make decisions with the exclusive interest of plan participants in mind.

Dr. Dickter, the physician who first saw Pappas in the emergency room of Haverford on May 21, 1991, at about 11:00 a.m., received permission from Jefferson to admit Pappas to its spinal cord trauma center. Dr. Dickter chose Jefferson because it, unlike other hospitals, had designated space for spinal trauma cases and was able to determine immediately whether it was in a position to receive a new patient. When Dr. Dickter learned at 12:40 p.m. from ambulance personnel that Pappas’ transfer to Jefferson was not HMO approved, he telephoned U.S. Healthcare at 12:50 p.m. and asked that it reconsider its decision. Dr. Dickter spoke to Elaine Norman, a U.S. Healthcare representative, and told her that Pappas’ condition constituted a neurological emergency that needed immediate attention, and for which he had made arrangements with Jefferson. Ms. Norman advised Dr. Dickter that she was not authorized to take action one way or the other, but that she would consult with someone who was. At 1:05 p.m., Dr. Dickter spoke with Carol DeLark, another U.S. Healthcare representative. She told him that <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>Dr. Liebowitz, one of U.S. Healthcare’s physicians who had the authority to decide such matters, reviewed Pappas’ case; that the referral to Jefferson, a non-HMO hospital, continued to be denied; and that a referral to the facilities affiliated with Hahnemann, Temple University or MCP was approved.

This analysis, of course, continues to apply. It was the Supreme Court's request that we consider our decision in <em>Pappas </em>I, in light of its decision in <em>Pegram, </em>that necessitated our finding the conceptual relationship between a claim for breach of ERISA's fiduciary duties and the assertion that a state law claim for medical malpractice is preempted.</p>

We granted allocatur to consider U.S. Healthcare’s motion for summary judgment, in which it asserted that the third party state law medical malpractice claims brought against it are preempted by ERISA <em>per se. </em>Whether the element of duty or the standard of care to which U.S. Healthcare should be held when third party plaintiffs attempt to prove their case differs from the duty or standard of care that Pennsylvania law imposes on non-HMO physicians is an issue that may remain for another day.</p>

That is to say, any answer leads to ERISA preemption. On the one hand, according to the dissent, the application of a standard of care to an HMO’s mixed eligibility and treatment decision that does not take into account an HMO’s way of doing business arguably has more than a "tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection” with a covered plan, <em>Travelers, </em><a href="/us/514/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="514 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="1339053" data-case-paths="/us/514/0645-01">514 U.S. at 661</a>, <a href="/us/514/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="514 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="1339053" data-case-paths="/us/514/0645-01">115 </a><a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a><a href="/us/514/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="514 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="1339053" data-case-paths="/us/514/0645-01">S.Ct. 1671</a>, and thus, is preempted. On the other hand, however, if a special standard of care is articulated for evaluating those decisions in which the peculiar pressures of an HMO’s rationing decisions are considered, such a rule arguably regulates a plan’s administration, and is also preempted. Under either scenario, ERISA invariably preempts a state law claim for medical malpractice arising out of an HMO’s mixed eligibility and treatment decision. In our view, <em>Tróvelas </em>and <em>Pegram </em>do not contemplate such a result.</p>

Certainly, however, the preemption clause itself is more broadly phrased; further, ERISA’s civil enforcement provision, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 1132">29 U.S.C. § 1132</a>, would appear to have been designed to protect the interests of plan participants more generally. Thus, while it is clear that the United States Supreme Court now subscribes to a narrower concept of preemption than that reflected in its earlier decisions, I am not so certain that the question of whether a state law claim challenges a fiduciary act is the sole, remaining, pertinent inquiry relative to preemption, particularly where the defendant may otherwise perform servicing functions integral to plan administration.</p>

Such rejection should not be overlooked, since, although the United States Supreme Court was discussing the issue of duty according to the federal fiduciary standard embodied in ERISA, state law duties which operate similarly would be no less disruptive. Moreover, the persistence of multiple state law standards broadly affecting otherwise permissible “rationing” decisions of managed care organizations, to the extent that such entities are viewed as serving as an important tool of plan administration, would also operate contrary to a central purpose of ERISA preemption, namely, to “avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.” <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v.

But just as a state law negligence claim can be recast in the form of a claim under ERISA, so tlie form of claim that the Supreme Court rejected as a matter of ERISA fiduciary analysis can effectively be restyled as a state law claim, and it is not a difficult matter to include an allegation of proximate harm in a forum with general jurisdiction to redress such injury. Indeed, several circuit courts of appeals have viewed various efforts to craft state law causes of action in just such a manner. <em>See, e.g., Jass, </em><a href="/f3d/88/1482-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="88 F.3d 1482" data-case-ids="9051090" data-case-paths="/f3d/88/1482-01">88 F.3d at 1489</a>; <em>Schusteric, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201263581" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="2000 WL 1263581">2000 WL 1263581</a>.</p>

I recognize that various managed care strategies such as preventative care are designed to decrease costs by providing timely interventions which may obviate the need for more expensive treatment in the long term. Obviously, it would be ideal if such strategies sufficiently reduced the cost of health care to maintain profitability without other forms of more direct rationing. The Supreme Court’s opinion seemed to accept, however, that, at least in the short term, broader forms of rationing are necessary to the managed care concept.</p>

In contrast, when the doctrine of complete preemption is asserted pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA in order to invoke federal jurisdiction, the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint controls, since the analysis entails a comparison between a specific, federal cause of action and one asserted under state law. <em>See generally Bauman, </em><a href="/f3d/193/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="193 F.3d 151" data-case-ids="11561731" data-case-paths="/f3d/193/0151-01">193 F.3d at 160</a>.

A proper resolution of the duty question may depend upon a myriad of factors, including the nature and incentive structure of the managed care entity; the applicable legislative and regulatory requirements for services; the specific promises made at the outset of the contractual relationship; and whether and to what extent the policy and incentive structure operate to deprive patients of the option of making an informed decision as to whether to fund services themselves.

In Pennsylvania, the process of development and refinement of applicable duties as a matter of common law may be slow and cumbersome.
