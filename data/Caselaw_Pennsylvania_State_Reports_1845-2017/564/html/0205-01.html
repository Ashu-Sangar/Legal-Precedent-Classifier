It posits that this issue encompasses more than the limited question of the character of the individual attorney. (In fact, ODC conceded at oral argument that PBLE had correctly resolved the character issue.) A determination of reciprocal discipline focuses on the legitimate goals of the disciplinary systems in the original discipline state and the reciprocal state. The issue is whether disciplinary action is necessary in the reciprocal state to further the policy objectives of protecting the public from attorneys of questionable fitness, ensuring the integrity of the judicial system and deterrence of similar conduct by other similarly licensed attorneys in both jurisdictions.</p>

A current determination that respondent possesses the requisite character to apply for admission to the bar of Pennsylvania may be relevant to a determination of whether or not in this case reciprocal discipline is appropriate, but is not preclusive to the question itself. Accordingly, we find no merit to respondent’s claim that once his character was found sufficient to meet the general requirement of Pa.B.A.R. 203(b)(2), ODC was collaterally estopped or barred by res judicata from presenting a petition for reciprocal discipline.</p>

He completed his undergraduate studies at Fairley Dickinson University in 1968 and received his juris doctor from Loyola University School of Law in 1971. After his admission to the New Jersey Bar, he worked as a solo practitioner, undertaking all the tasks of running his office, including typing, filing and bookkeeping. During his years in practice, respondent engaged in significant pro bono work, particularly on behalf of the homeless population in New Jersey. Subsequent to his temporary suspension, respondent operated a business, Prestige Typing and Office Services. By typing for other attorneys respondent was able to support himself and his family through the years. After relocating to Pennsylvania, respondent continued working in community related programs. Through his church he participated in religious education for children and provided assistance to senior citizens.</p>

He realizes that using the funds of one client to pay the expenses of another client during a period of cash flow shortage was an error in judgment. He asserts, and we agree, that this error does not reveal a basic flaw in character, but rather a lack of maturity and fiscal responsibility. Over the years since his suspension from the practice of law, respondent has proven that he gained the wisdom and experience to learn from his misstep and overcome the shortcomings that caused it. Respondent’s rehabilitation in this regard is what prompted the PBLE to permit respondent to sit for the bar exam. Given the passage of time from the initial violation in 1981 and 1982, until the court’s present consideration of respondent’s status, we find no evidence that respondent would pose a threat to the public by engaging in the practice of law at this time.</p>

Pennsylvania will not tolerate a reputation for welcoming disbarred attorneys from other jurisdictions to practice law with impunity in our courtrooms. Although we have always favored a system of professional discipline that weighs each individual case on its merits, we acknowledge that sometimes a brightline rule must be drawn. The need to deter other similarly situated attorneys from swarming to our courts is cause to create such a brightline rule. To that end the Pa.R.B.A. 203 has been amended as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[314,1093,1123,527]]]'>(3) Presentation of a certificate of good standing from the highest court or the agency having jurisdiction over admission to the bar and the practice of law in every state or jurisdiction in which the applicant has been admitted to practice law, stating that the applicant is in good professional standing at the bar of such court or state. An applicant who is disbarred or suspended for disciplinary reasons from the practice of law in another jurisdiction at the time of filing an application for permission to sit for the bar exam shall not be eligible to sit for the bar exam.</blockquote>

Only after respondent was admitted to practice law in this Commonwealth could he be the subject of a rule to show cause why reciprocal discipline should not be imposed. Having now reviewed the entire record and giving due deference to the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court, we find that the imposition of reciprocal discipline in this instance would be a grave injustice. Accordingly, the rule is discharged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

I write separately, however, to disassociate myself from that portion of the majority’s analysis that reevaluates the facts underlying Respondent’s misconduct in New Jersey. It is not the role of our Court to look behind a foreign jurisdiction’s finding of attorney misconduct and second-guess the method and manner of discipline imposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Such an evaluation is precisely what our Court intended to prevent in disbarment cases by adopting Pennsylvania Rule of Bar Admission 203, which effectively precludes an attorney who is disbarred in another jurisdiction from seeking admission to practice law in this Commonwealth. As the majority properly notes, however, this rule is not applicable to the instant case as it had not yet been adopted at the time Respondent sought to gain admittance to the Pennsylvania bar.</p>

The majority not only looks behind the New Jersey Supreme Court’s disciplinary ruling, but also behind the criminal conviction which formed the basis of the disciplinary proceeding. In finding that Respondent’s misconduct “does not reveal a basic flaw in character, but rather a lack of maturity and fiscal responsibility,” Op. at 215, the majority overlooks the fact that an element of the offense for which Respondent was convicted is the unlawful disposition of prop<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>erty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Implicit in such finding is something far more serious than immaturity. Although our Court is by no means bound by the New Jersey rulings when imposing a disciplinary sanction in Pennsylvania, I find it unwise to discount them. The grave injustice that would occur upon imposition of reciprocal discipline does not arise from Respondent being wrongly convicted or disbarred in New Jersey, but rather would lie in the fact that Respondent was given every assurance that he would be permitted to practice law in Pennsylvania upon passage of the bar exam.</p>

The amendment of Pa.R.B.A. 203 ignores this long-standing dictate in disciplinary proceedings. Furthermore, two of our neighboring states, New Jersey and Ohio, offer no opportunity for anyone who has ever been disbarred to petition for reinstatement. Consequently, decisions to disbar attorneys in those states will permanently preclude those attorneys from applying to sit for the Pennsylvania bar, or from petitioning for reinstatement to the Pennsylvania bar, regardless of the circumstances surrounding their misconduct. For these reasons, Pa.R.B.A. 203 should not, in my view, have been amended.</p>
