Appellant Elijah Williams a/k/a Bob Torres (“Williams”) appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court reversing the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granting his motion to suppress evidence seized, pursuant to search warrants, from 5631 Rippey Street, Apartment C-5, and 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street, Apartment 305 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Because the police used the same affidavit of probable cause to support their applications for warrants to search Apartments C-2 and C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex, judicial economy is best served by disposing of Torres and Williams’ appeals in conjunction with one another. However, Williams’ appeal presents several distinct issues for this Court’s consideration.

Perhaps even more importantly, it is impossible to tell from the affidavit which of the anonymous source(s) provided each of the pieces of information included therein. Therefore, the mere fact that one or more of the anonymous sources provided a somewhat detailed account of the activities of the victims and their assailants preceding the murders does not, in and of itself, constitute a significant indicia of the reliability of that information.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In addition, the fact that the police verified the address, phone number and general age given to them lor Torres — whose address and phone number were listed in the phone book and were therefore freely available to the public — does not constitute a significant indicia of the reliability of the other information provided to the police by the anonymous sources.</p>

Accordingly, our disposition of Torres’ appeal does not necessarily control our disposition of Williams’ appeal, despite the fact that a practically identical affidavit of probable cause was used to obtain the warrants to search Apartments C-2 and C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex. First, Williams’ appeal requires <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>this Court to consider the propriety of the Superior Court’s decision reversing the suppression of the evidence found at Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street Apartment Complex.

Following the searches of the Rippey Street apartments, the police applied for and obtained a warrant to search Williams’ residence at 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street, Apartment 305. Upon executing the warrant, the police found tax records, personal telephone books, prison records, a digital scale, two pagers and numerous plastic bags. Williams was subsequently arrested and charged with three counts of homicide. Williams’ counsel filed an Omnibus Pre-Trial Motion seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>suppression of the evidence seized from Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex and Apartment 305 at 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street. Following a hearing, the suppression court granted Williams’ motion to suppress the evidence seized from both Apartment C-5 and Apartment 305, concluding that the affidavits filed in support of the applications for the warrants to search the apartments were insufficient to establish probable cause. The Commonwealth subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 311(d) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the Superior Court reversed the order of the suppression court by order and memorandum opinion dated June 12,1998.

    <p id="b246-8" data-blocks='[["BL_246.9",246,[263,1319,1164,798]]]'>Regarding the resolution by the majority of the appeal of Elijah Williams a/k/a Bob Torres (Williams), I concur. My dissent is with the majority’s disposition in the appeal of David M. Torres a/k/a Michael Williams (Torres). I would have affirmed the Superior Court’s conclusion that the search warrant affidavit demonstrated probable cause to search Torres’ apartment. <em>See Commonwealth v. Torres, </em><a href="/a2d/714/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="714 A.2d 416" data-case-ids="11712242" data-case-paths="/a2d/714/0416-01">714 A.2d 416</a>, 420-421 (Pa.Super.1998). I write separately because I believe that the factual details recited in the affidavit, and the corroboration of those details by the police, sufficiently established the reliability of the unnamed witnesses. Because the affidavit itself illustrated the trustworthiness of the witnesses, there is no need to presume their credibility. Accordingly, the issue of whether an unnamed witness is entitled to a presumption of reliability is best left for another day.</p>
