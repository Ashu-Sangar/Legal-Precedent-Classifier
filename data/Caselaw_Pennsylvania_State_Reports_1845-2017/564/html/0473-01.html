As to Rule 1002, it contends that the only requirement is the filing of <em>“a” </em>notice of appeal prescribed by the State Court Administrator along with a copy of the notice of judgment issued by the district justice. E.W. maintains that it satisfied this rule by attaching both notices of judgment to its single notice of appeal. It contends that Rule 1004.C is the only district justice rule that addresses appeals from multiple judgments. E.W. argues that Rule 1004. C clearly recognizes that an appellant may appeal <em>both a </em>judgment on a complaint and a judgment on a cross-complaint. It asserts that Rule 1004.C only requires a separate notice of appeal if the <em>appellee </em>wishes to appeal from judgment on the appellee’s complaint and the appellant has not appealed that judgment.

In <em>Burr, </em>the Superior Court held that a defendant who files a counterclaim <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>in a district justice action does not properly preserve issues raised therein when he files an appeal to common pleas court from only the adverse judgment rendered against him on the complaint filed by the plaintiff.</p>

The Superior Court, however, based its conclusion on the ground that the defendant failed to file a separate notice of appeal from the judgment on his counterclaim. It reasoned that Rule 1004 treats the judgments entered on the complaint and cross-complaints as “separate judgments” and “makes no mention of any circumstances where a separate notice of appeal is <em>not </em>required.” <a href="/pa-super/374/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="374 Pa.

Wagner filed a cross-complaint alleging that the borough’s collection of late charges and penalties was usurious and unconstitutional and sought damages for past late fees assessed. The district justice entered two separate judgments — one in favor of the borough on the complaint and one in favor of the borough on Wagner’s cross-complaint.</p>
    <p id="b609-6" data-blocks='[["BL_609.6",609,[187,1642,1153,577]]]'>Wagner filed a single notice of appeal which indicated that he was appealing from <em>Borough of Downingtoum v.

Wagner subsequently filed a complaint in common pleas court based upon his cross-complaint filed in district justice court. The common pleas court granted the borough’s petition to strike the appeal of the judgment entered on the borough’s complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>The Commonwealth Court affirmed. It held that, based on <em>Burr </em>and the plain language of Rule 1004, Wagner was required to file two separate notices of appeal if he wished to appeal from the adverse judgments entered against him on the borough’s complaint and his counterclaim. It held that because Wagner only appealed from the adverse judgment entered on his counterclaim, there was no obligation on the part of the borough to reassert its claim as a counterclaim because the judgment entered in its favor was final.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[270,828,1169,722]]]'>We find that the courts in <em>Burr </em>and <em>Borough of Downingtown </em>erroneously interpreted Rule 1004 as requiring separate notices of appeal when appealing district justice judgments on a complaint and cross-complaint. Rule 1004 implies that appeals may be filed from either the claim, counterclaim or both claims. There is no language, however, that expressly requires the filing of a <em>separate </em>notice of appeal when an appellant (as opposed to an appellee) appeals from judgments on a complaint and cross-complaint. E.W.’s attachment of notices of judgment from both the complaint and cross-complaint was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 1002 as to the method of appeal. Rule 1004 says nothing more about an appellant’s obligation regarding the filling of such a notice.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[270,1581,1161,778]]]'>Moreover, contrary to the lower courts’ holdings, the rules do <em>not </em>treat actions on claims and cross-claims independently. First, we note that complaints filed by a defendant take the same docket number as the plaintiffs complaints. Pa. R.C.P.D.J. 306. A defendant may raise a claim before the district justice that does not even arise from the same transaction or occurrence from which the plaintiffs claim arose, Pa.R.C.P.D.J. 315(A), and a single hearing is held on all claims raised. Pa.R.C.P.D.J. 315(B). Also, there are not two different types of notices of appeal. The terms of the notice are dictated by the State Court Administrator and apply to situations involving appeals from either complaints or cross-complaints. Pa.R.C.P.D.J. 1002. Finally, the proceeding on appeal to the common pleas court is conducted de novo. Pa. R.C.P.D.J. 1007.</p>

      <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>Additionally, we note that there are circumstances when only one judgment is entered on a complaint and cross-complaint. At the time of E.W.’s appeal, Pa.R.C.P.D. J. 315(C) provided that, “A money judgment for the plaintiff or for the defendant, <em>but not </em>/or <em>both, </em>may be entered with respect to such cross-complaints, any lesser amount found due on the claim asserted in one being deducted from the greater amount found due on the claim asserted in the other.” (Emphasis added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, had the district justice found in E.W.’s favor on the cross-complaint in any amount, only one judgment would have been entered. Under the lower court’s reasoning, presumably only one notice of appeal would have been necessary, even if E.W. was appealing both the determination that it was liable to American pursuant to American’s complaint and the amount of damages E.W. was entitled to from American on its cross-complaint. Our interpretation of the rules eliminates this inconsistent procedure.</p>
    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.4",611,[184,1242,1158,581]]]'>We further note that district justice courts are intended to be readily available to the public for the expeditious resolution of minor disputes, many involving claims of little monetary value. Interpreting the rule to require preparation of a separate notice of appeal, along with the payment of an additional filing fee, does not serve the intended simplicity of district justice proceedings. <em>See </em>Explanatory Note to Pa. R.C.P. 301 (guiding policy of district justice rules is to provide uncomplicated framework for small claims procedure, realizing that members of the public using the system would be largely unrepresented by legal counsel).</p>
