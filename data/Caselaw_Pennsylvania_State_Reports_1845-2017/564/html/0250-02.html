The Court’s order necessarily assumes that the allegation that Saranchak “changed his mind” about pursuing collateral relief after disposition of the Federal Defender’s appeal is a valid ground upon which to grant reargument. That assumption, I believe, is erroneous. Neither Saranchak’s alleged declaration nor his “present intention” to pursue post-conviction relief remotely call into question the propriety of this Court’s appeal dismissal order that is the exclusive subject of this reargument application. Furthermore, because the averments in the present application clearly do not otherwise warrant reargument, I would deny the Federal Defender’s application. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>

He stated that counsel’s filings were not on his behalf nor with his consent. He further stated that he had sufficient time to ponder the magnitude of his crimes, and he was in agreement with the sentence of death. At a subsequent hearing, the PCRA court conducted a colloquy during which Saranchak reiterated his desire to waive both counsel and all further review. The PCRA court concluded that Saranchak’s waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent and, accordingly, removed the Federal Defender as counsel and dismissed the PCRA petition. The Federal Defender appealed this decision. On October 3, 2000, the Governor signed a warrant of execution, scheduling Saranchak’s execution for November 8, 2000.

A court-appointed psychiatrist examined Saranchak, filed a report, and testified at a supplemental waiver proceeding that, in his opinion, Saranchak was competent to waive his right to counsel and to pursue collateral proceedings.

Judge Rambo found that the purported “next friends” — Alexandra Fensterer, Esquire, an attorney with the Federal Defender who previously represented Saranchak in related proceedings, and Dennis Troup, Saranchak’s step-father, who did not appear at the federal hearing — were not individuals “who are truly dedicated to the best interest of Mr. Saranchak.” Accordingly, Judge Rambo held that the movants lacked standing to seek a stay of execution.

The declaration states that Saranchak has changed his mind and now wishes to be represented by the Federal Defender and he desires to “withdraw” his prior waivers and to challenge his convictions through any appropriate means. The declaration also purports to authorize Assistant Defender Fensterer to act as Saranchak’s “next friend,” if necessary, in any future legal proceedings.

Saranchak’s declaration is dated November 16, 2000, ten days <em>after </em>this Court entered the challenged order. It is a “fact” that only came into existence <em>after </em>our ruling and <em>after </em>Saranchak’s credited desire of record to see his execution earned out, a desire rendered nugatory by the Third Circuit’s stay order.

      <em>Lonchar </em>involved a valid, first federal habeas petition filed at the eleventh hour by a death-sentenced state prisoner.

The Supreme Court noted that federal habeas review is governed by “complex procedural principles that regularize and thereby narrow the discretion of individual judges,” which are “embodied in statutes, rules, precedents, and practices that control the writ’s exercise.” <a href="/us/517/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="517 U.S. 314" data-case-ids="11744701" data-case-paths="/us/517/0314-01">517 U.S. at 322-23</a>, <a href="/us/517/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="517 U.S. 314" data-case-ids="11744701" data-case-paths="/us/517/0314-01">116 S.Ct. 1293</a>. “Within constitutional constraints!,]” the principles “reflect a balancing of objectives (sometimes controversial), which is normally for Congress to make, but which courts will make when Congress has not resolved the question.” <em><a href="/us/517/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="517 U.S. 314" data-case-ids="11744701" data-case-paths="/us/517/0314-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/517/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="517 U.S. 314" data-case-ids="11744701" data-case-paths="/us/517/0314-01">at 323</a>, <a href="/us/517/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="517 U.S. 314" data-case-ids="11744701" data-case-paths="/us/517/0314-01">116 S.Ct. 1293</a>.

Saranchak was not barred from filing a first federal habeas petition because he elected to waive his rights under the PCRA. Indeed, the Third Circuit’s grant of a stay, upon motion of Saranchak’s alleged “next friends,” illustrates this. Here, no less than in <em>Lonchar, </em>it will be for the federal court to determine, as a matter of federal habeas corpus law, whether Saranchak’s explicit waiver of further review in the PCRA hearings encompassed a waiver of federal habeas review and, if not, whether his state court <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>waiver, at a minimum, procedurally bars consideration of the merits of his PCRA claims on federal habeas corpus. But nothing in <em>Lonchar </em>remotely suggests that state courts lack the authority to rule upon issues of state waiver, including the question of the finality of those waivers for state collateral review purposes.</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[192,674,1153,744]]]'>In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>this Court determined, upon a review of the proceedings below, and in light of settled law, that Saranchak’s waiver of counsel and further review was competently and validly entered. Saranchak’s statutory right to PCRA review and his Criminal Rules-based right to PCRA counsel are no less waivable than more fundamental constitutional rights that are commonly waived in criminal cases, such as the right to a trial, the right to a jury, the right to testify, etc. I know of no case, and neither the Federal Defender nor the Court have cited any, that allows a waiver of rights to be automatically “withdrawn,” based upon a mere change of mind, after the highest appellate court in the Commonwealth has already ruled that it was knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily, and competently entered.</p>
    <p id="b389-5" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[190,1450,1154,688]]]'>If accepted, the position urged by the Federal Defender would seriously alter the salutary waiver doctrine and degrade the solemnity of the proceedings where waiver occurs. If a valid waiver is effective only until there is a change of mind then no waiver is ever final, no matter how clear and unequivocal the defendant’s record decision to forgo further proceedings. Any “waiver” can automatically be negated by a subsequent claim that the defendant merely has had a change of heart. A rational system of appellate jurisprudence cannot be based upon the whim and caprice of those who seek its benefits. Saranchak himself has closed the door to the collateral review process and has done so knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. The door should remain closed.</p>

The Federal Defender asserts that Saranchak's declaration establishes that his previous waiver was "related to the 'terrible and inhumane' conditions he has suffered on death row.” Although the declaration states a belief that the conditions on death row “have been terrible and inhumane,” Saranchak <em>never </em>alleges that this perception had <em>any </em>effect on his previous waiver.</p>
