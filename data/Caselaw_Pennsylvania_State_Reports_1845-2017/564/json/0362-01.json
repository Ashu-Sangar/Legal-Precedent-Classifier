        "text": "OPINION\nCASTILLE, Justice.\nThis Court granted allowance of appeal in this matter to consider whether the redaction of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession in a joint trial, which replaced any direct reference to the defendant with the words \u201cthe other man,\u201d when accompanied by an appropriate cautionary charge, was sufficient to protect the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation clause rights under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s more recent decision in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998). For the reasons that follow, we hold that it was.\nOn December 13, 1994, the victim, Charles Byrd, was working as an unlicensed cab driver. While parked outside a supermarket in Philadelphia, Byrd was advised by another unlicensed cab driver, Richard Jackson, to refuse to give appellant a ride because appellant had previously failed to pay Jackson for a ride. Overhearing this exchange, appellant became angry with Jackson and threatened to kill him. Appellant then walked away from the parking lot and vowed to return.\nA short time later, appellant returned to the supermarket parking lot with his cousin, David Thompson. With Jackson no longer present, appellant and Thompson began arguing with Byrd. Thompson attempted to strike Byrd, but Byrd blocked the blow. At that point, Thompson instructed appellant to shoot Byrd. Appellant withdrew a gun from his jacket and fatally shot Byrd once in the chest. Both men fled the scene and were later arrested.\nFollowing his arrest, Thompson gave a statement to the police in which he admitted that he had driven appellant to the supermarket for the express purpose of finding Jackson, and that he knew that appellant had taken the gun used in the killing from his car. Thompson also admitted that he had punched Byrd and that he had instructed appellant to shoot him.\nAppellant and Thompson were tried jointly by a jury. Prior to trial, appellant moved to sever his case from Thompson\u2019s on the ground that the introduction of Thompson\u2019s confession would violate appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him. The trial court denied severance, but ordered that Thompson\u2019s confession be redacted to replace any specific reference to appellant by name with the neutral term, \u201cthe other man.\u201d Furthermore, the trial court issued a cautionary instruction to the jury, informing the jury that Thompson\u2019s statement could only be considered as evidence against Thompson. The cautionary instruction was given to the jury twice \u2014 immediately after the police officer read Thompson\u2019s statement into the record, and during the trial court\u2019s final jury charge.\nOn October 26, 1995, the jury convicted appellant and Thompson of first degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime and criminal conspiracy. The two men were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder convictions with no further penalty imposed for the additional offenses. On appeal to the Superior Court, appellant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance because the admission of Thompson\u2019s confession at the joint trial, even as redacted and subject to a cautionary charge, violated his right to confrontation. The Superior Court rejected the claim on the basis of its recent decision in Commonwealth v. McGlone, 716 A.2d 1280 (Pa.Super.1998), and affirmed the judgment of sentence. This Court granted allocatur to address the question of whether the redaction here was adequate under Bruton and Gray.\nThe decision of whether to sever trials of co-defendants is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Commonwealth v. Lopez, 559 Pa. 131, 739 A.2d 485 (1999). Both this Court and the United States Supreme Court have recognized that joint trials of co-defendants play a crucial role in the criminal justice system. See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 209, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987); Commonwealth v. Wharton, 530 Pa. 127, 607 A.2d 710 (1992); Commonwealth v. Jackson, 451 Pa. 462, 303 A.2d 924 (1973); Commonwealth v. Kloiber, 378 Pa. 412, 106 A.2d 820 (1954).\nIt would impair both the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal justice system to require ... that prosecutors bring separate proceedings, presenting the same evidence again and again, requiring victims and witnesses to repeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying, and randomly favoring the last tried defendants who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution\u2019s case beforehand. Joint trials generally serve the interests of justice by avoiding inconsistent verdicts and enabling more accurate assessment of relative culpability.\nRichardson, 481 U.S. at 210, 107 S.Ct. at 1708-09. However, we have also recognized that there are potential difficulties arising from joint trials. A common problem arises in situations where evidence is admissible against one co-defendant but inadmissible against another. As a general matter, an instruction to the jury that it is to consider that evidence only with respect to the defendant against whom it is offered is sufficient to remove any potential prejudice:\nOrdinarily, a witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not considered to be a witness \u201cagainst\u201d a defendant if the jury is instructed to consider that testimony only against a co-defendant. This accords with the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions----\nId. at 206, 107 S.Ct. at 1707 (citing Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 325 n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 1976 n. 9, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985)). See also Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 127, 661 A.2d 352, 361 (1995) (\u201cThe presumption in our law is that the jury follows instructions.\u201d).\nIn Bruton, however, the Supreme Court recognized a narrow exception to the general rule that cautionary instructions are sufficient to eradicate any potential prejudice in joint trials. In Bruton, the trial court admitted into evidence at a joint trial the confession of Bruton\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant, which named and incriminated Bruton in the armed robbery on trial. The court instructed the jury that the confession \u201cif used, can only be used against [Bruton\u2019s co-defendant],\u201d and could not be considered in the case against Bruton. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 126 n. 2, 88 S.Ct. at 1622 n. 2. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the admission of the facially incriminating statement by the non-testifying co-defendant violated Bruton\u2019s right of cross-examination guaranteed by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, notwithstanding the jury charge. The Court reasoned that:\nThere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored ... Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial. Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect----The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination.\nId. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. at 1627-28 (citations and footnotes omitted).\nIn response to Bruton, courts approved the practice of redacting confessions of non-testifying co-defendants to remove references that expressly implicated the defendant. The Supreme Court considered this practice in Richardson, 481 U.S. at 200, 107 S.Ct. at 1702. In Richardson, the co-defendant\u2019s confession was redacted to remove all reference to the defendant, and the jury was specifically instructed to consider the confession only against the co-defendant. The defendant argued that, despite the redaction, admission of the co-defendant\u2019s confession violated her confrontation rights because it implicated her in the crime when linked with other evidence. The Court expressly rejected the theory of contextual implication, recognizing the important distinction between co-defendant confessions that expressly incriminate the defendant and those that become incriminating only when linked to other evidence properly introduced at trial. Id. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1707-08. When incrimination is merely inferential, the court noted, \u201cit is a less valid generalization that the jury will not likely obey the instruction to disregard the evidence.\u201d Id. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1708. Where such linkage was required to implicate the defendant, the Court held, a proper limiting instruction was sufficient to satisfy Bruton. See Gray, 523 U.S. at 195, 118 S.Ct. at 1156 (\u201cRichardson placed outside the scope of Bruton\u2019s rule those statements that incriminate inferentially.\u201d). But the Richardson Court was careful to express \u201cno opinion\u201d on the admissibility of a confession where the redaction consists of replacing the defendant\u2019s name \u201cwith a symbol or neutral pronoun.\u201d 481 U.S. at 211 n. 5,107 S.Ct. at 1713 n. 5.\nLike other courts interpreting Bruton, this Court has specifically approved of redaction and a limiting instruction as a means of eliminating any possible prejudice arising from the admission of a co-defendant\u2019s confession at a joint trial. Thus, in Commonwealth v. Johnson, 474 Pa. 410, 378 A.2d 859 (1977), we noted that, \u201c[t]he basic theory of redaction seems sound. If a confession can be edited so that it retains its narrative integrity and yet in no way refers to defendant, then use of it does not violate the principles of Bruton.\u201d Id. at 412, 378 A.2d at 860. See Commonwealth v. Uderra, 550 Pa. 389, 398-99, 706 A.2d 334, 339 (1998) (noting that Johnson \u201capproved redaction as an appropriate method of protecting a defendant\u2019s rights under Bruton \u201d): see also Commonwealth v. Lopez, 559 Pa. 131, 157-58, 739 A.2d 485, 499-500 (1999) (statement referring to \u201cother guys\u201d complied with Bruton ). In Commonwealth v. Chestnut, 511 Pa. 169, 512 A.2d 603 (1986), a case pre-dating Richardson, we reaffirmed this holding and explicitly rejected a blanket rule that would prohibit the introduction of redacted confessions that implicate the defendant by contextual implication, explaining that such a rule would have \u201cthe likely effect of making all statements by a co-defendant inadmissible, regardless of whether they could be properly redacted.\u201d Id. at 174, 512 A.2d at 605. Nevertheless, our Bruton jurisprudence occasionally suggested that even properly redacted statements may, in certain \u201cunique circumstances,\u201d id. at 174, 512 A.2d at 605, implicate Bruton where there is a \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201ccontextual implication\u201d or \u201cevidentiary linkage\u201d makes it obvious that the unnamed person in the redacted statement is the defendant. Wharton, 530 Pa. at 140-41, 607 A.2d at 716-17. Under our then-understanding of Bruton, that danger, however, merely required the trial court, and the reviewing court, to balance the interests, i.e., the potential prejudice to the defendant versus the probative value of the evidence, the possibility of minimizing the prejudice, and the benefits to the criminal justice system of conducting joint trials. Id.\nRecently, the United States Supreme Court revisited Bruton in Gray. Gray addressed one of the questions that Richardson had left open: i.e., \u201cwhether redaction that replaces a defendant\u2019s name with an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space, the word \u2018deleted\u2019 or a similar symbol, still falls within Bruton's protective rule.\u201d 523 U.S. at 192, 118 S.Ct. at 1155. In Gray, the confession of Gray\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant, Bell, was read into evidence at their joint trial. Whenever Gray\u2019s name, or the name of a third co-conspirator who had died prior to trial, Jacquin Vanlandingham, appeared in the confession, the police officer who read the statement into evidence substituted the word \u201cdeleted\u201d or \u201cdeletion.\u201d Immediately after the officer had finished reading the confession to the jury, the prosecutor asked him, \u201cafter he gave you that information, you subsequently were able to arrest Mr. Kevin Gray, is that correct?\u201d The police officer responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d thus reinforcing the implication that one of the deletions referred to Gray. The prosecution also introduced into evidence a written copy of the confession, which contained a blank space set off by commas appearing wherever Gray\u2019s name or Vanlandingham\u2019s name appeared. Thus, unlike the redaction in Richardson, which removed not only the defendant\u2019s name but any reference to her existence, the co-defendant\u2019s redacted confession in Gray \u201creferr[ed] directly to the existence of the non-confessing defendant.\u201d Id.\nThe Supreme Court held that the redaction of Bell\u2019s confession was insufficient under Bruton because \u201cLa] redaction that replaces a defendant\u2019s name with an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space, the word \u2018deleted\u2019 or a similar symbol ... leaves statements that, considered as a class, so closely resemble Bruton\u2019s unredacted statements that, in our view, the law must require the same result.\u201d Id. In so holding, the Court noted that a jury will often react similarly to an unredacted confession and a confession redacted in the manner of Bell\u2019s confession in Gray because the jury will \u201coften realize that the confession refers specifically to the defendant.\u201d Id. at 193, 118 S.Ct. at 1155. The Court gave an example in which the statement \u201cI, Bob Smith, along with Sam Jones, robbed the bank\u201d was redacted to read, \u201cI, Bob Smith, along with \u2014\u2014-, robbed the bank.\u201d The Court explained that, \u201c[a] juror who does not know the law and who therefore wonders to whom the blank might refer need only lift his eyes to Jones, sitting at counsel table, to find what will seem the obvious answer, at least if the juror hears the judge\u2019s instruction not to consider the confession as evidence against Jones, for that instruction will provide an obvious reason for the blank.\u201d Id. at 193, 118 S.Ct. at 1155. The Court also noted that the obvious deletion may well call the juror\u2019s attention to the omitted name: \u201cBy encouraging the jury to speculate about the reference, the redaction may overemphasize the importance of the confession\u2019s accusation once the jurors work out the reference.\u201d Id. at 193, 118 S.Ct. at 1155-56. Finally, the Court noted that, like the statements in Bruton, the statements in Gray were directly accusatory: \u201cThe blank space in an obviously redacted confession also points directly to the defendant and it accuses the defendant in a manner similar to Evans\u2019 use of Bruton\u2019s name or to a testifying co-defendant\u2019s accusatory finger.\u201d Id. at 194, 118 S.Ct. at 1156. Thus, the Court concluded that the Gray redaction presented the same confrontation problem as the non-redaction in Bruton: the defendant was expressly implicated in the confession of the non-testifying co-defendant. Although the defendant in Gray was not specifically named in the confession, the Court concluded that it was nonetheless clear, from the face of the confession itself, that he was the other man.\nThis was not the end of the Gray Court\u2019s analysis, however. The Court \u201cconcede[d]\u201d that Richardson had placed outside the scope of the Bruton rule statements that incriminate inferentially, and that the jury in Gray had to employ an inference to connect the blanks in that redacted confession to the defendant. Id. But the Court refined Richardson, concluding that inference \u201cpure and simple\u201d could not make the critical difference in a Bruton analysis, since that would exclude shortened first names, nicknames, unique descriptions and the like from Bruton\u2019s sweep, while the Court, in other cases, had already at least assumed that the rule would cover those circumstances. Id. at 195,118 S.Ct. at 1156. The Court therefore concluded that, in cases requiring an inference to connect the redacted statement to the defendant, it was the \u201ckind of\u2019 inference involved that mattered in the Bruton analysis. Id. at 196, 118 S.Ct. at 1157. The Court then contrasted the inference in Richardson with the inference in Gray. In Richardson, the inference involved statements that did not directly refer to the defendant himself and \u201cwhich became incriminating \u2018only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Richardson, 481 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1707. In contrast, Gray involved statements that, despite redaction, \u201cobviously refer directly to someone, often obviously the defendant, and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.\u201d 523 U.S. at 196, 118 S.Ct. at 1157. In such an instance, the Court noted, the redacted confession, though not naming the defendant, nevertheless \u201cfacially incriminates\u201d him, and \u201c \u2018is more vivid than inferential incrimination, and hence more difficult to thrust out of mind.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Richardson, 481 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1707. See also United States v. Logan, 210 F.3d 820, 823 (8th Cir.2000) (obvious redaction in Gray was a circumstance that \u201cpointed a finger directly at the defendant\u201d).\nThe Court further distinguished Richardson by noting that the policy reasons animating that decision did not require a conclusion that a redaction consisting of obvious deletions comported with Bruton. Richardson had expressed concern that Bruton should not bar co-defendant\u2019s confessions where a successful redaction of \u201cconfessions incriminating by connection\u201d would not be possible, thus forcing prosecutors \u201ctoo often to abandon use either of the confession or of a joint trial.\u201d Gray, 523 U.S. at 196, 118 S.Ct. at 1157. The Gray Court noted that Richardson\u2019s concern in that regard did not exist by a redaction involving obvious deletions because \u201cadditional redaction\u201d of such \u201csymbols\u201d \u201cnormally is possible.\u201d Id. Tellingly, for our purposes, the Court then offered the following example of an \u201cadditional\u201d redaction that could have been employed in Gray that, it strongly suggested, would survive Sixth Amendment scrutiny under Bruton and its progeny:\nConsider as an example a portion of the confession before us: The witness who read the confession told the jury that the confession (among other things) said:\n\u201cQuestion: Who was in the group that beat Stacey? Answer: Me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys.\u201d\nWhy could the witness not, instead, have said:\n\u201cQuestion: Who was in the group that beat Stacey? Answer: Me and a few other guys.\u201d\nId. (emphasis added).\nThis case, of course, involves the second half of the unanswered question posed in Richardson: the viability of a redaction that substitutes a neutral pronoun, rather than a symbol of deletion, for the defendant\u2019s name. Specifically, the co-defendant\u2019s statement here was redacted to replace references to appellant by name with the term \u201cthe other man.\u201d Although this was not the type of redaction at issue in Gray, the Gray Court\u2019s reasoning, including its distinction of Richardson, leaves little question that this sort of redaction is appropriate under the Sixth Amendment. At a minimum, as one Circuit Court has noted, the Supreme Court \u201cstrongly implied\u201d in Gray that a redaction employing a neutral pronoun such as \u201cthe other guy\u201d does not offend the Sixth Amendment. See United States v. Akinkoye, 185 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999).\nThe rationale employed in Gray makes clear that the \u201ckind of\u2019 redaction employed here does not implicate Bruton concerns in the same way as a statement that incriminates the defendant on its face, either by actually naming him or by an obvious method of deletion that no less certainly points the finger at him. The redacted statement here neither referred to appellant by name (the Bruton proscription) nor did it contain an obvious indication of a deletion or an alteration that was the functional equivalent of naming him (the Gray proscription). Indeed, use of a neutral pronoun is not an obvious alteration at all: \u201cFor all the jury knew, these were [the non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s] actual words, not a modified version of them.\u201d Logan, 210 F.3d at 823. The \u201cother man\u201d reference employed here was certainly not the sort of reference which, \u201ceven were the confession the very first item introduced at trial,\u201d obviously referred to the defendant. Gray, 523 U.S. at 196, 118 S.Ct. at 1157. See also McGlone, 716 A.2d at 1286 (use of term \u201cother man\u201d does not have same powerfully incriminating impact as an obvious deletion, for the term not only eliminates the name of the defendant, it also eliminates a suggestion of alteration: \u201cThe powerfully incriminating nature of an obvious and glaring \u2018hole\u2019 in the statement simply is not present when a generic term like \u2018other man\u2019 is used\u201d). Instead, as in Richardson, the redacted statement could become incriminating only through independent evidence introduced at trial which established the defendant\u2019s complicity and, even then, only if it is assumed that the jury ignored the court\u2019s charge.\nIn light of the governing principles in this area, as most recently elucidated in Gray, the redaction here, combined with the trial court\u2019s accurate and repeated cautionary charge, sufficed to protect appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Since the statement was not powerfully incriminating on its face, the general rule to which Bruton and Gray are a limited exception, ie., the \u201calmost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions,\u201d Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206, 107 S.Ct. at 1707; Commonwealth v. Travaglia, supra, applies and controls.\nWe note that our decision today is consistent with the Superior Court\u2019s construction of Gray, see McGlone, supra, as well as the decisions of other courts that have had occasion to interpret Gray. See United States v. Taylor, 186 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir.1999) (redacted statement which replaced defendant\u2019s name with \u201cthey\u201d and \u201ccaptain\u201d did not violate right of confrontation); United States v. Verduzco-Martinez, 186 F.3d 1208, 1214 (10th Cir.1999) (redaction of co-defendant\u2019s statement with \u201cthe neutral pronoun/phrase \u2018another person\u2019 did not identify [the defendant] or direct the jury\u2019s attention to him, nor did it obviously indicate to the jury that the statement had been altered\u201d); Akinkoye, supra (4th Cir.1999) (motion to sever properly denied where references to defendant in co-defendant\u2019s statement replaced with \u201canother person\u201d); United States v. Vejar-Urias, 165 F.3d 337, 340 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cwhere a defendant\u2019s name is replaced with a neutral pronoun, as long as identification of the defendant is clear or inculpatory only by reference to evidence other than the redacted confession, and a limiting instruction is given to the jury, there is no Bruton violation\u201d) (dicta); United States v. Stockheimer, 157 F.3d 1082, 1086-87 (7th Cir.1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1184, 119 S.Ct. 1127, 143 L.Ed.2d 121 (1999) (statements of co-defendants that incriminate other defendants only when viewed \u201cin conjunction with other evidence introduced at the trial\u201d do not warrant severance under Gray), United States v. Valdez, 146 F.3d 547, 551-52 (8th Cir.1998), cert. denied, 119 S.Ct. 355 (1998) (reference in confessing defendant\u2019s statement to his \u201caccomplice\u201d did not violate Gray because it did not suggest that a proper name was purposefully omitted, confession on its face did not implicate co-defendant, and only by linking confession to other evidence could jury infer accomplice\u2019s identity).\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nZAPPALA and NIGRO, JJ., concur in the result.\n. Notwithstanding the limited nature of our allocatur grant, appellant also attempts to challenge the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. These claims were neither raised in the allocatur petition, nor the subject of our grant of review. Accordingly, they will not be considered. Commonwealth v. Davis, 543 Pa. 628, 632 n. 6, 674 A.2d 214, 216 n. 6 (1996), citing Pa.R.A.P. 1115(a)(3); Commonwealth v. Rush, 522 Pa. 379, 386-87, 562 A.2d 285, 288 (1989).\n. As noted above, prior to Gray, this Court had suggested that redacted statements that implicated the defendant only through linkage with other evidence at trial could nevertheless trigger confrontation clause concerns under Bmton. See Commonwealth v. Washington, 547 Pa. 550, 556, 692 A.2d 1018, 1021 (1997); Commonwealth v. Marinelli, 547 Pa. 294, 328, 690 A.2d 203, 220 (1997); Wharton, 530 Pa. at 143, 607 A.2d at 718; Chestnut, 511 Pa. at 174, 512 A.2d at 605. It is apparent now, after Gray, that the Sixth Amendment is only implicated where the implication arises from the face of tire redacted statement and not from linkage to other evidence.\n. Appellant argues that, during deliberations, the jury made an inquiry concerning the co-defendant\u2019s statement which proves that it considered the co-defendant's confession in assessing his guilt. The jury's question was as follows:\nWhen David Thompson in his statement to the police stated the other man shot Charles Byrd, who was the other man? What is his name? Would it be possible to see his statement?\nAppellant\u2019s argument, of course, is mere speculation. Indeed, contrary to appellant\u2019s interpretation, the question seems to suggest the opposite inference, i.e., that the jurors did not know the identity of the other man and wanted to be told who it was \u2014 thus, the redaction and the court\u2019s charge served their purpose. Furthermore, the jury rendered its verdict before the court resporrded to its inquiry. This also suggests that the jurors followed the court\u2019s instructions to consider Thompson\u2019s confession only as evidence against Thompson.",
