This claim is based on the. fourth section of the act of April 11, 1862. This section provides substantially as follows: That whenever a teacher is appointed or dismissed by any school board, it must appear that it was by the affirmative votes of a majority of the whole number of directors or controllers; and in such case the names of the members voting both in the affirmative and negative shall <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>be so entered on the minutes of the board by the secretary. Now, it has been repeatedly held by the Supreme Court that in the appointment and dismissal of teachers in a school district, the provisions of the act of assembly must be strictly complied with. These minutes, therefore, in order to comply with this act of assembly, ought to show either the names of the members voting both in the affirmative and negative of the question of dismissal, or that all the school directors were present, and that the vote was unanimous upon that question. But these minutes do not show either the names of those voting upon the affirmative or negative of the question, nor do they show that the whole board was present and that the vote was unanimous. Nor was it competent, we now think, to introduce parol evidence to show that the whole board was present and that the vote was unanimous. The minutes ought to disclose this fact, if fact it be, upon their face.</p>

The plaintiff is controlled by it as well as the defendant, and before the plaintiff can recover he must show that he was legally employed. Exhibiting a contract signed by himself and the president and secretary of the school board, is not such an employment as is required by this act of 1862. He fails to bring himself within the requirements of this statute, and this is the foundation of his claim. The able counsel who represent the plaintiff, contend that technically, if not actually, they have shown the existence of a legal employment or contract with the defendant township. In this contention we do not agree. It is alleged that the plaintiff’s narr sets forth such employment, but the plea here is non assumpsit, which denies any such employment. It is further alleged, however, that under provisions of a Rule of Court which we have, the affidavit of claim sets forth that the employment was legally made, and that this averment in the affidavit of claim is not denied in the affidavit of defence which is filed in the case. The only way in which advantage can be taken of this Rule of Court, however, is by making a formal offer so as to bring the matter in evidence before the court and jury; a formal offer of the affidavit of claim in so far as it is not contradicted by the affidavit of defence. That was not done in this case; so that the matter is not before the court and the <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>jury; and we have no evidence whatever of any employment in accordance with the provisions of this act of 1862, unless it be the mere contract which is signed by the president and secretary of the board, and which is in evidence. This we regard as insufficient. We think, therefore, that the plaintiff has failed to make out such a case as will justify a recovery upon his part. The court, therefore, assumes the responsibility of this case, with this view of the law, and we therefore direct you to return a verdict in favor of the defendant.] 4.....</p>

Mercer, <a href="/pa/115/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="115 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="551631" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0559-01">115 Pa. 559</a>. But the appellant complains that his employment was not denied in the affidavit of defence. Certainly it was not, for it had never been properly averred by the plaintiff. However, the plea of non assumpsit was a denial of all liability, and a complete denial of employment, if alleged by the plaintiff, notwithstanding the Rules of Court cited by appellant: Fisher v. Ball, <a href="/pa/93/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="93 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="442130" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0390-01">93 Pa. 390</a> ; Gaw v.

Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20Pa.%2048" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="102 Pa. 48">102 Pa. 48</a>. The court below further ruled that, even if the employment had been admitted by the pleadings, it was not a matter of evidence before the jury, because the alleged admission in the pleadings had not been put in evidence. This is good law and disposes of the plaintiff’s case in any event. The construction of its own rules has always been peculiarly a question for the lower court: Bair v. Hubartt, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20Pa.%2099" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="139 Pa. 99">139 Pa. 99</a>.</p>

The agreement was signed by her and by the president of the board, and was countersigned by the secretary. She taught and received pay for two months, when, for neglect and refusal to obey the instructions of the board she was by formal resolution dismissed. It was held that a contract between the president and secretary of the board, and a teacher, without the concurrence of the board, was invalid and could not be enforced. “By the act of April 11, 1862,” says Mr. Justice Gordon, in the opinion filed, “ teachers can only be selected by the school board; and so specific is this act, upon this subject, that it requires the names of the members voting, both in the affirmative and negative, to be recorded upon ihe minutes. This is the only manner in which teachers can be selected, and from the very nature of things, this power cannot be delegated. Before effect could be given to the contract exhibited by the plaintiff, it was necessary to show, not only that O’Dea was the regularly constituted agent of the board, but that Miss Padden had been selected as a teacher by the previous action of the directors.” The case^last cited was also an action by a school teacher against the school district, to recover damages for refusing to permit her to teach during the term for which she alleged she was employed. Although it appeared that she had actually taught four months, and received payment there<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>for, and from the declarations of the members of the school board, that she was to teach three months more, it was held that, in the absence of evidence of her appointment by the minnt.es of the school board, according to the requirements of the statute, she could not recover. To the same effect, also, is Cascade School D. v. Lewis School D., <a href="/pa/43/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="43 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="483214" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0318-01">43 Pa. 318</a>.</p>
    <p id="b447-5" data-blocks='[["BL_447.4",447,[187,677,1179,1626]]]'>In the case at bar, however, the due execution of the contract in suit was admitted. By the nineteenth section of the act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 620, it is provided that all deeds and other contracts in writing, made by a school district, shall be signed and sealed by the president of the board of directors or controllers, and countersigned by the secretary. The contract in suit was executed in this form. The suit was founded upon the contract, and a copy thereof was filed with the statement and affidavit of claim. The. contract was set forth in the statement to be what it purported to be, the contract of the school district, and binding upon the district as such. In the affidavit of defence the validity of the contract is admitted; the defence set up is based upon its terms and conditions. It is not pretended, or in any way intimated or suggested, that it was not executed by authority of the board, in accordance with the requirements of the statute. The facts affecting its execution were peculiarly within the knowledge of the board, and if it was invalid upon that ground, the affidavit of defence should-have set forth the fact. On the contrary, the defence set forth in the affidavit was that the plaintiff, whilst in charge of the Byerly school No. 4 as teacher of said school, had perpetrated acts of cruelty upon a certain child in his care and custody as a teacher; and that, upon a full and fair investigation, he had by resolution of the board been requested “ to resign as teacher of said school; ” that he had refused to resign, and thereupon, “ for the cause of cruelty, as above set forth, he was, by the unanimous resolution of the board of directors, afterwards dismissed and discharged from his employment as teacher ” on the last day of November, of which the plaintiff had due notice; and that, if the plaintiff continued to teach after that date, “ he did so in violation of the action of the board of directors, and contrary to the notice to cease the employment as aforesaid.”</p>

    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[253,1097,1165,591]]]'>Thus, it will be seen that the original employment of -, the plaintiff as a teacher, and the due execution of the contract, are facts actually or impliedly admitted,• and if they were not, as they are not traversed or denied in the affidavit of defence, they must, under the sixth and eighth rules of practice in the Common Pleas of the county, be taken as admitted. In the cases above cited, the employment of the teacher was explicitly and flatly denied, and the minutes of the board sustained the denial. In this case, however, the regular employment was admitted, and the minutes of the board in respect of his employment were not material to the issue tried, and were not in evidence.</p>

In this he was clearly mistaken. The affidavits of claim and defence, respectively, are not proper evidence to be considered in behalf of those who make them, and ordinarily they are not intended for the jury. Under the rules of practice referred to, they constitute, as it were, part of the pleadings, their object being to reduce the contest at the trial to the points actually in dispute: Bair v. Hubartt, <a href="/pa/139/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="139 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="11250598" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0096-01">139 Pa. 96</a>; and the court should take notice of these admissions as disclosed by the record, and confine the contest to the matters in issue. As we said in Neely v. Bair, <a href="/pa/144/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="144 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="823806" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0250-01">144 Pa. 250</a>: “The object of this and similar rules of court, obviously, is to dispense with the formal proof, <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>on trial, of all such facts and circumstances, material to the plaintiff’s case, as the defendant shall be required to deny under oath, which facts, if not so denied as required by the rule, shall, for the purposes of the trial, be taken as admitted. A proper system of practice under such rules, greatly facilitates and expedites tñe trial of causes, and often relieves the jury from the consideration of a heterogeneous mass of testimony bearing upon facts which the defendant cannot deny, but which the plaintiff would otherwise be required to establish by formal proof. The controversy is thus narrowed down to such items of claim aud material matters of fact as are really disputed. In such cases, it is the province of the court to examine the respective affidavits, and thus ascertain what items of claim, and averments of fact in support thereof, are not denied by the defendant, and then confine the testimony to such items of claim and material averments of fact as are denied.” The plea of non assumpsit is a broad plea, but it is plain that it does not deny what is thus admitted of record.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[184,1296,1167,1059]],["BL_450.1",450,[246,383,1154,85]]]'>The board of school directors had the power to dismiss this teacher for incompetency, cruelty, negligence, or immorality. This power is expressly given in paragraph V., § 23, act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 622, and was reserved in the contract. As a deliberative body, a board of school directors is intrusted with the government of the schools, and by the statute is empowered both to employ teachers, and for the causes stated to dismiss them. The board, therefore, had jurisdiction under the statute to pass upon any charge of this character, and in its determinations was held merely to the exercise of good faith, and was answerable only for an abuse of its powers. By the mere fact of his employment as a teacher, the plaintiff submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the board in respect of the matters mentioned in the statute, and the action of the board, if it be entered upon the minutes in the form required by the statute, is conclusive. But the action of the board in effecting the dismissal of a teacher must be set forth upon the minutes, as required by the statute. The minutes are therefore the best evidence of the teacher’s dismissal, and are conclusive, unless the board may be shown to have acted corruptly or in bad faith, and to have clearly abused its powers. The admission of evidence on the <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>part of the defendant as to the circumstances of cruelty alleged, was therefore erroneous.</p>
