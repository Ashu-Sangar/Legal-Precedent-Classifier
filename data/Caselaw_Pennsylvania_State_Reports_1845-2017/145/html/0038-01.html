    <p class="summary" id="b63-8" data-blocks='[["BL_63.8",63,[144,888,1162,94]]]'>Two other questions are also involved, and will be afterwards briefly considered.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b63-9" data-blocks='[["BL_63.9",63,[144,990,1176,1369]]]'>1. Section 7 of the revenue act of 1879, P. L. 112, declares “That every railroad company, canal company, etc., .... owning, operating or leasing .... any railroad, canal .... or other device for transportation of freight or passengers, or in any way engaged in the business of transporting freight or passengers.....shall pay a.....tax of eight tenths of one per centum upon the gross receipts of said company for tolls and transportation.” Are the receipts in question embraced by this language ? Clearly, they are not receipts for “ transportation,” as that word is here used, because the defendant does not itself carry these particular goods and passengers; but, just as clearly, they must be said to be receipts for “ tolls.” This word has been defined by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and we quote Mr. Justice Strong’s definition in Boyle v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Pa.%20314" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="54 Pa. 314">54 Pa. 314</a>: “ (Toll) is a tribute or custom paid for passage, not for carriage ; always something taken for a liberty or privilege, not for a service; and such is the common understanding of the word. Nobody supposes that tolls taken by a turnpike or canal company include charges for transportation, or that they are anything more than an excise demanded and paid for the privilege of using the way.” This definition was recognized in Cumberland Y. R. Co.’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20228" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 Pa. 228">62 Pa. 228</a>, and was expressly approved in Penna. R. Co. v.

Its terms include the payments made to the defendant under the two contracts above referred to, and determine that these payments are “ tolls.” Calling them “ rentals ” does not change their true nature as thus authoritatively defined.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b63-12" data-blocks='[["BL_63.10",63,[200,2367,1119,46]],["BL_64.1",64,[281,388,1162,194]]]'>2. As no argument was made by either party to this appeal, <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>we do not know upon what grounds a tax upon such tolls is supposed to violate § 1, article IX. of the Pennsylvania constitution, and, for the present at least, will content ourselves with simply overruling the objection.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b64-5" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[276,590,1169,1053]]]'>The other objection, viz., the alleged violation of the commerce clause of the federal constitution, we also believe to be untenable. The tax before us is not laid upon receipts for transportation, either inter-state or of any other kind, but on receipts for tolls, the sum paid by another corporation for the use of defendant’s road; and we do not clearly see that this tax lays any unconstitutional burden upon commerce between the states. Indeed, it is rather the toll itself than the tax upon the toll which is the real burden ; but, as this is not imposed by the state, but by the voluntary act of the parties themselves, it furnishes no constitutional ground for complaint. As we look upon it, the situation is this : The defendant has a certain piece of railroad, wholly within the state of Pennsylvania, and therefore subject to its taxing power under certain limitations. This piece of railroad is used by another corporation, which pays to the defendant a stipulated price for such use. The state, thereupon, requires the defendant to pay a tax upon the price thus paid. Is this a burden upon the business done by the corporation which pays the toll? If it be, it is so indirect that we do not believe it to be in violation of the commerce clause of the federal constitution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b64-6" data-blocks='[["BL_64.5",64,[268,1661,1170,752]],["BL_65.1",65,[140,379,1167,400]]]'>It is certainly not a tax, direct or indirect, upon the toll-paying corporation, for the state demands nothing from it on this account. The demand is solely upon the toll-receiving corporation ; and if it be a burden at all upon the toll-paying corporation, it must be because the price which it may be asked to pay, as such toll, may be increased by reason of the tax imposed upon the receiving corporation. But the latter has no power of itself to shift the burden upon the other. This may of course be done by agreement; but the making of such agreement is optional with two corporations, and otherwise the tax lies where it first falls. It seems to us, therefore, that as the tax upon the toll does not, either by force of the statute itself or by the necessity of the case, reach the toll-paying corporation, it cannot be said to lay a burden upon the business done by that corporation. So far as this business is concerned be<a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>tween the states, no attempt is made to tax it, even when the state is dealing directly with the transporting corporation ; and the tax in question is paid upon a different subject and upon a corporation which does not even aid in the transportation. It merely furnishes the road over which the transportation is done; it takes no active part in the business, and has no claim upon the shippers or passengers for any part of the money to be paid therefor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b65-4" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[140,788,1168,960]]]'>Prima facie, the state may tax all the defendant’s receipts for toll received by a branch lying wholly in this state; and before an exemption as to any part thereof ought to be allowed upon the ground now taken, it should clearly appear that the tax would be a burden on inter-state commerce as carried on by the defendant. This at least, it clearly is not; for the actual transportation is done, not by the defendant, but by another corporation for its own benefit, unless the defendant is to be considered as carrying on inter-state commerce in respect of these particular goods and passengers, merely because it allows another corporation to use its road for such transportation and itself receives a stipulated price for such use. At the best, this qualification is of doubtful soundness, and the rule then, is that “ a case of simple doubt should be resolved favorably to the state law, leaving the correction of the error, if it be one, to the federal judiciary.....When convinced that the state law, is really repugnant to the federal constitution, we must yield to the supreme authority of the latter: ” Commonwealth v.

It may be fixed at a gross amount irrespective of the business done by the actual carrier, or it may be a specified sum per ton or per passenger. In either case, it is payment for “ trackage,” as one of the agreements calls it; or a “ toll,” as the statute calls it; and if the transportation itself is not taxed, or necessarily burdened by taxing the toll, it can make no difference whether the business done by the actual, untaxed carrier is inter-state, or is wholly within the state; or how the payment is to be made.</p>

Neither does it arise as to toll paid in respect of the canal company’s receipts for transportation entirely within the state; for these receipts are taxable against it as receipts for “ transportation,” while the sum it pays to the defendant is taxable against the latter as receipts for “ tolls.” These are distinct subjects of taxation and not the same subject, are taxed in the hands of distinct and separate taxpayers, and therefore the taxation is not double. In Penna. Co. v. Commonwealth,' 22 W. N. 340, it was held to be double taxation to tax the capital stock of a corporation and also the shares in the hands of individual stockholders; but this result was reached either by considering the capital stock and the shares as the same subject, or by considering the' corporation and the collective shareholders as the. same person.
