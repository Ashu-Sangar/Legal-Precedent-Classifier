But the reason of this is, not that the act is unconstitutional, but that it gives no authority to take private property excepting as above, and that, therefore, this cannot be done. In other words, the act is constitutional so far as it applies ; but, as the legislature have failed to provide in it for the taking of private property, and for ascertaining and making compensation therefor, the railway companies have no right, under the act, to take such property, and cons <em>y </em>have no right to construct and <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>operate a railway on and over such property. Where the location of their road does not involve the taking of private property, the act applies, and where it does apply it is constitutional. [If, then, defendant’s road can be located and constructed on the roadbed of the turnpike in question, where it passes through the land of plaintiffs, without taking, injuring or destroying plaintiffs’ property, it has a right to construct it under the provisions of this act.] 8</p>

And it is too late to say that such use and occupation of the streets imposes such an additional burden or servitude thereon, as renders it necessary to provide for compensation therefor to the owners of abutting property.” In that case, it was further held that the same principle would' apply to a street railway operated by electricity, by means of iron posts, eighteen feet high, permanently fixed at the side of the street, with an overhead wire in the centre of the street.</p>

We do not think, however, that the principle upon which that case was decided applies here. The laying of a gas pipe under the soil of the street could not, in any sense, be considered a use of the surface of the street for the purpose of travel, but was in effect taking part of the soil under the street for a new use, and for this reason the owner was held to be entitled to compensation therefor. But, as was said in one of the cases above cited, “ the operation of street railways is a legitimate use of the streets, and an exercise of the public right to travel upon them; ” and it would seem that this must be the case, whether it be upon a street within the limits of a city, or upon a turnpike road without but adjacent to the city limits.
