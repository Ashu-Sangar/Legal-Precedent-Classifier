Mr. Buch said that he had telegraphed, or would telegraph to Mr. Siple, for permission to draw on him to meet it, but the cashier did not see, or ask to see the telegram which was actually sent. The message was in these words: “Lititz, Pa. November 23, 1888. W. H. Siple: (Can I draw for note due to-day; will mail check; cannot get ■discount before Monday; answer quick. Jacob A.

This was accordingly done in the afternoon, and the bank thereupon charged the note to Mr. Bueh’s account, credited him with the amount of the draft, and forwarded the latter for collection. The cashier did not ask for any explanation of the difference in amount between the note and the draft, and no explanation was offered then, or is now offered. As testified by the cashier, he supposed the draft would be accepted, although it was in excess of the note, “ simply because I had confidence in Mr. Buch and Mr. Siple.”</p>

Was the defendant bound to accept and pay the draft which was actually drawn ?
