When Samuel Foreman accepted the real estate of his father at the valuation, <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>and entered into the recognizance we have recited, his share or interest in that recognizance, though by its terms not payable until the death of the widow, was by operation of law at once paid; and so much of that recognizance as was his was absolutely extinguished. And so, when he conveyed all his estate in the land to his assignee, Mr. Gehr, it was no longer subject to the payment of the whole principal sum of $4,812.87 at the death of the widow, but of that sum, reduced by Samuel’s share, which was a one eighth. And so with respect to the subdivisions; the dower being apportioned among them, the whole principal sum charged upon each, for the securing of the widow’s dower, would not be payable at the widow’s death, but in each case seven eighths of the principal sum so reserved.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-6" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[253,1041,1165,854]]]'>Now, the return made by the assignee to the court of this particular purpart, shows that of the purchase money $1,798 was to be deducted as dower, the interest of which was to be paid to the widow of Jonathan Foreman during her life, and the principal sum of $1,798 at her death to the heirs of Jonathan Foreman, “ less Samuel Foreman’s share, who was one of the heirs.” The meaning here is plain and unmistakable. It was the same thing as saying that Samuel Foreman’s share, whatever that would have been, was to be deducted from the principal sum when it became payable, and that the purchaser would be required to pay only the balance or the difference. The fact that the words “sold to John Hollenberger” follow immediately after the words “less Samuel Foreman’s share, who was one of the heirs,” does not and cannot change this interpretation; for it is manifest that they apply, not to- the share of Samuel, but to the land which the assignee has returned as sold to Hollenberger.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[255,1903,1163,542]]]'>This interpretation accords not only with the plain, manifest meaning of the words employed, but makes the assignee’s return consistent with law. Had the return been silent upon the.subject, that is to say, had it merely returned a sale of Samuel Foreman’s interest in the land, subject to the recognizance, or a given and fixed portion of it, there could have been no question in regard to what would have been payable at the widow’s death; for Samuel’s interest or share in the recognizance, as we have seen, was extinguished. And so, I say, the interpretation we give to the return accords with the result which the law if left alone would have worked out.</p>

It is in these words: “ The principal sum at her death to the heirs of Jonathan Foreman, except the share of Samuel, which goes to J. Hollenberger.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[191,802,1166,1119]]]'>Now the plaintiff says that by the very terms of this deed he was made one of the parties entitled to share in this recognizance at the death of the widow, and that this charge is in the very tifie under which the defendant holds the land to-day, and that a one eighth is payable to him, because in the deed to him it is provided that the share of Samuel goes to him. What I said with reference to the language used in the return to the order of sale, is equally applicable here. The manifest meaning of the expression, “except the share of Samuel, which goes to J. Hollenberger,” is that Hollenberger got that share in the conveyance of the land to him, and that he was not to he called on to pay it at the death of the widow; in other words it had been extinguished, and was not to be a charge on Hollenberger’s land. And this construction comports with the law, and it is the only one that would. Neither the assignee nor the court itself could, under the circumstances of this case, resuscitate Samuel’s extinguished part of that recognizance; neither could,' under the circumstances which led up to the sale, impose any such condition as one of the terms of sale. If a sheriff is bound to sell the debtor’s interest in real estate levied on, whatever it may be, without terms or conditions affecting the title, why not an assignee who sells under an order of the court.</p>

This order, and the proceedings under it, passed the title of Foreman to the purchaser free of such encumbrances as would have been divested by a sheriff’s sale founded on a judgment against him prior to his conveyance in trust for creditors. The portion of the dower fund charged upon the land purchased by Hollenberger was $1,798; the interest on it was payable to Mary Foreman during her life, and at her death seven'eighths of the principal sum was payable to the brothers and sisters of Samuel Foreman, whose share, as we have seen, was merged in the title to which Hollenberger succeeded. In the assignee’s return to the order of sale it was stipulated that the sum charged on the land sold to Hollenberger should be paid at the death of Mary Foreman “to the heirs of Jonathan Foreman, less Samuel Foreman’s share, who was one of the heirs.” This was in accordance with the terms and conditions published at and prior to the sale. It is evident from these <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>that the parties comprehended the legal effect of Samuel Foreman’s acceptance of the land and his subsequent conveyance of it in trust for his creditors, and that they did not intend to qualify it. It follows that Hollenberger received Foreman’s title, with the encumbrance represented by the recognizance neither enlarged nor diminished by the sale, or any agreement or condition connected therewith.</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[268,755,1167,1312]]]'>Did he pass this title to Kellar subject to the same encumbrance ? He conveyed it “ subject to the payment of the interest on $1,798, annually, to Mary Foreman, to be computed from the first of April, 1886, and at the death of said Mary the money to be paid to those entitled to receive it.” We fail to discover in this language any purpose to increase the charge upon the land, or to confer upon the grantor any rights under the recognizance which he did not before possess; nor can we see in it any reservation of a fraction of the title which the grantor acquired at the assignee’s sale. The money to be paid at the death of Mary Foreman was seven eighths of the sum on which she received interest, and the parties entitled to receive it were the brothers and sisters of Samuel Foreman, or their legal representatives. The share of Samuel in that sum was merged in his title, which passed by an assignment and a sale thereunder, to the appellant, who conveyed it to Keller, and he in his deed to the appellee described the encumbrance thereon in the language we have quoted from Hollenberger’s deed to him. We agree, therefore, with the learned judge of the court below, that Samuel Foreman’s share of the valuation money was not a charge on this land while Hollenberger owned it, and that the subsequent conveyances have not converted it into a lien on the land in favor of the appellant. The deeds mentioned recognize and continue the encumbrance that was existing when he held the title, but they do not enlarge or add anything to it.</p>

L. 205, which declares that the “ grantee of real estate which is subject to ground-rent, or bound by mortgage or other encumbrance, shall not be personally liable for the payment of such ground-rent, mortgage, or other encumbrance, unless he shall, by an <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>agreement' in writing, have expressly assumed a personal liability therefor, or there shall be express words in the deed of conveyance, stating that the grant is made on condition of the grantee assuming such personal liability: provided, that the use of the words, ‘ under and subject to the payment of such ground-rent, mortgage, or other encumbrance,’ shall not be so construed as to make such grantee personally liable as aforesaid.”</p>
