Rush, <a href="/pa/14/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="405963" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0186-01">14 Pa. 186</a>, that it was sometimes held in the earlier cases, many of which are cited, that an injunction would not be granted to restrain a public nuisance until after a trial at law; but that the law now is, as stated in Georgetown v. Canal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pet.%2098" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="12 Pet. 98">12 Pet. 98</a>, that “ courts of equity may take jurisdiction of a case of public nuisance by an information filed by the attorney general; ” and that “ the principle appears to be that when the bill is filed by the attorney general, and the right is clear and the threatened injury irreparable, an injunction will be awarded, although the right has not been established at law; ” and that “ whilst it is admitted by all that it (the jurisdiction) is confessedly one of delicacy, and, accordingly, the instances of its exercise are rare, yet it may be exercised in those cases in which there is danger of irreparable mischief before the tardiness of the law could reach it. ” In Rowe v. Granite Bridge Co., <a href="/mass/38/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="21 Pick. 344" data-case-ids="2047973" data-case-paths="/mass/38/0344-01">21 Pick. 344</a>, the court, after stating that the appropriate remedy for a nuisance in a common highway would be an indictment, adds: “ It may <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>be worth while to consider how far the court ought to interfere by way of injunction, in case of a common nuisance. Perhaps, where there is immediate danger to the health or safety of a community, and where it is obviously necessary that a nuisance should be immediately suppressed, as in the case of a powder-house or a slaughter-house in a populous neighborhood, equity might interfere, until the slower process of indictment could be put in motion. ” In Morris &amp; Essex R. Co. v. Pruden, <a href="/nj-eq/20/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="20 N.J. Eq. 530" data-case-ids="526214" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/20/0530-01">20 N. J. Eq. 530</a>, the Court of Errors and Appeals say: “ The remedy by indictment being so efficacious, courts of equity entertain jurisdiction over public nuisances with great reluctance, whether their intervention is invoked at the instance of the attorney general, or of a private individual who suffers some injury therefrom distinct from that of the public. ” And in Attorney General v. Railroad Co., <a href="/nj-eq/3/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 N.J. Eq. 136" data-case-ids="499133" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/3/0136-01">3 N. J. Eq. 136</a>, the chancellor says: “ In cases of public nuisances, there is an undisputed jurisdiction in the common law courts by indictment, and a court of equity ought not to interfere in a case of misdemeanor, where the object sought can be as well obtained in the ordinary tribunals. ” And in Attorney General v. Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Johns.%20Ch.%20378" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Johns. Ch. 378">2 Johns. Ch. 378</a>, it is said, by Chancellor Kent: “ If a charge be of a criminal nature, or an offence against the public, and does not touch the enjoyment of property, it ought not to be brought into the direct jurisdiction of this court, which was intended to deal only in matters of civil right resting in equity, or where the remedy at law was not sufficiently adequate; nor ought the process of injunction to be applied but with the utmost caution.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b180-6" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[263,1757,1164,654]]]'>It thus appears that the question in courts of equity has been whether they would také jurisdiction at all, in cases of alleged public nuisance, or would leave the commonwealth to the remedy by indictment; and that the furthest they have gone, where the right was not established at law, is to exercise the jurisdiction where the right was clear and the danger of irreparable injury imminent. But we are asked, by the commonwealth, in this case, to go much further, and to take jurisdiction and decree the removal of the bridge in question as a public nuisance, in the face of a verdict of not guilty rendered by a jury, on the trial of an indictment against the defendant in this bill, prosecuted by the commonwealth, the plaintiff here, charging him with maintaining it.</p>

It is true, where the right is clear, and the injury irreparable, a court will not always await the tardy action of a court of law. In this case it appears the right has been settled at law, and it was settled in favor of the defendant. An indictment had been found against him for maintaining this nuisance, No. 63 August Term 1888, in the Quarter Sessions of Westmoreland county, upon which indictment he was acquitted by the verdict of the jury. It may be, as is suggested in appellant’s paper-book, that the fact that the bridge in question had been allowed to remain for nearly twenty years without objection, may have had some weight with the jury. We cannot say they would not be entitled to consider it, and we are quite sure it is a circumstance a chancellor would not wholly overlook, while it is by no means conclusive; but, when we couple this fact with the verdict of a jury in a trial at law in favor of the defendant, we can readily see why the court below refused the injunction.</p>
