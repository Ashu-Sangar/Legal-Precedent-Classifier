A corporation is limited as to its existence of right, and its power to transact business, to the territorial limits of the sovereigntj’' creating it. This arises from the very nature of sovereignty, which alone can create an artificial person, and is duly limited by its own territorial boundaries: Bank of Augusta v.

This being the case, when a corporation exercises power in the transaction of business outside the territorial limits of the sovereignty creating it, such exercise is a matter of comity only: Paul v.

It results from this, that where a condition of doing business has been ordained by a state arid has not been complied with by a foreign corporation, such corporation is, as to such state, without power to do business, and is non-existent: In re Comstock, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Sawy.%20219" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 Sawy. 219">3 Sawy. 219</a>; Semple v.

L. 108, in the most positive terms forbids any foreign corporation to do any business whatever within the state, until it has complied with the act. And it will not do to argue that because the third section of the act imposes a penalty upon agents or employees of the corporation for transacting business for it, therefore the act is to be confined in effect to the imposition of the penalty: Ætna Ins. Co. v. Harvey, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wis.%20395" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="11 Wis. 395">11 Wis. 395</a>. And so held in our own state: Mitchell v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dall.%20269" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="4 Dall. 269">4 Dall. 269</a>. The state can enforce a penalty against the agent, because he is within her reach. She cannot punish the corporation itself, because, until it has complied with the law, she does not recognize its existence within the commonwealth, and it is not within her jurisdiction; but she can prevent it from carrying on business, by simply <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>declining to recognize actions nominally brought on the part of the corporation.</p>

It follows, also, that as the Sudsena company had not complied with the statute, it was as to this state non-existent, and the defendant, in this case, although assuming to contract as an agent, was an agent who had no principal, or was exercising an authority which he assumed he had, but in reality had not. Wherefore, the plaintiff, having dealt with him and furnished goods to him on his order, can recover from him personally ; and this, irrespective of whether the defendant made any specific fraudulent representation as to his authority or not. In either case, he was not legally an authorized agent, and, not being an agent, and having made purchases, he is liable for the purchase money: Smout v. Ilbery, 10 M. &amp; W. 1; Randall v. Trimen, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.B.%20786" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="18 C.B. 786">18 C. B. 786</a>; West London Bank v. Kitson, L. R. 12 Q. B. 157; McConn v. Lady, 10 W.

It cannot, by virtue of its charter, exercise its functions beyond the territorial limits of the sovereignty which created it. It cannot transact business in other states or sovereignties without their consent expressed or implied. Any person who assumes to act for it must be considered as having knowledge of its powers and their limitations, and whether it has conformed to the requirements of the jurisdiction in which he proposes to represent it.

There is nothing oppressive or unreasonable in our statute relating to this subject. In the first section thereof it is provided that, “ no foreign corporation shall do any business in this commonwealth, until said corporation shall have established an office or offices and appointed an agent or agents for the transaction of its business therein.” In the second section of the act it is declared that, “ it shall not be lawful for any such corporation to do any business in the commonwealth, until it shall have filed in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth a statement, under the seal of said corporation, signed by the president and secretary thereof, showing the title and object of said corporation, the location of its office or offices, and the name or names of its authorized agent or agents therein; and the certificate of the secretary of the commonwealth, under the seal of the commonwealth, of the filing of such statement, shall be preserved for public inspection by each of said agents in each and every of said offices.” These terms are not onerous, or in conflict with any constitutional provision or rule of public policy. But they are clearly prohibitory, and they indelibly stamp as unlawful any business transaction within the state, by a foreign corporation which has not complied with them. It is only by its observance of them that it can have a legal existence for business purposes within this jurisdiction, or acquire contractual rights which our courts will recognize : Thorne v.

This doctrine is so familiar and well established that citation of authority for it is unnecessary. We think the case before us falls clearly within this principle. The appellant was not charged with the duty of inquiring whether the Sudsena company was a foreign corporation, and if so, whether it had complied with the laws which allowed it to transact business here, when, as the special verdict finds, he did not know “ that it was a corporation at all. ” A citizen of this state who has a business transaction with another as agent of a foreign corporation, may rely on the representation of the agent as to his authority, without releasing him from his common-law liability as principal, if it turns out that his action was unauthorized. In other words, his failure to make search in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth, for the statement which the corporation ought to file there, will not inure to the .benefit of the person who falsely pretended that he was its duly constituted agent. We think that as the appellee acted without authority from the Sudsena company, and it was non-existent as to Pennsylvania, he is clearly liable to the appellant for the work done and goods furnished on his order while professedly acting in its behalf.</p>
