A grist-mill stood upon that land, and was operated by water power supplied by said stream. About 1853, a written agreement was entered into between the widow and the Pennsylvania Railroad Co., by which the widow granted to the defendant the privilege of taking water from the run by means of a pipe three inches in diameter, until the youngest child should become of age. Under this agreement, the defendant laid a three-inch pipe to the run, at a point on property of Tobias Hull, higher up the stream than the Clark property, and pumped water through the pipe to its station at New Florence, for use in supplying its locomotives. The agreement came to an end by its own terms in 1868, when the youngest child of Paul Clark, deceased, arrived at full age, but the defendant still continued to pump water from the run. About 1870, the three-inch pipe was replaced by one four inches in diameter, and for this a six-inch pipe was substituted about 1883. The latter was still in use at the time of the trial.</p>

Then, as to the other clause of the point. We could refuse this point, because it ought to have been separate ; but we will answer this second clause. While the plaintiffs were not the absolute owners of the water itself, yet they are entitled to the reasonable use and enjoyment of it going through their premises. In further answer, we say no damage can be recovered here for damage to any mill, or alleged damage to any mill, or improvement, that was not there, or for any permanent injury to the mill seat, or water, as that has not been shown or alleged by the plaintiffs on the trial. Only such damage can be recovered for the injury to the use and the enjoyment of the water and water right, with the property in the situation it was during the period from 1881 to 1887 ; and such damage can be recovered for such period, by <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>reason of the diversion, as may be found by the jury from the evidence, under the rules we have given you in our general charge, of what is the measure of actual damage here.

The defendant injected into the case the idea that the plaintiffs must put their mill in repair and put machinery in it, thus spending a large sum of money, before they could call upon the defendant for damages. This is in the face of the fact that the defendant surreptitiously took and used the water, thereby compelling the abandonment of the mill and destroying the value of the plaintiffs’ mill site and water power. If it be the law that the defendant can thus take advantage of its own wrong, the poor and weak are at the mercy of the rich and strong.

A small stream of water ran through this land, with such a fall as to form the site for a water power for a mill, and a grist-mill had many years ago been erected, which, by an overshot wheel, was propelled by the water of this stream until about the year 1872, when the mill was abandoned, and has since that time been suffered to go to decay and ruin. At the institution of this suit, and for six years prior to that time, it is conceded there was no mill or other structure erected on this site, suitable for operation for any useful or profitable purpose; nor, during that period was there any effort to operate a mill, or use the water power for any purpose whatsoever.</p>

About the year 1870 it increased the capacity of the pipe to four inches, and in 1883 to six inches. ■ This suit was brought in 1887, not to recover for any injury to the mill, or to the operation of the mill, for, within the period of the statute of limitations, there was no mill to operate, but for damages to the mill site or water power caused by the defendant’s diversion of the water.</p>

The principle is well established that a diversion of the water of a stream, even without actual injury to a lower riparian owner, legally imports damage, because it is an infringement of a right: Angelí on Water-courses, 185. Every injury imports damage, and if no other damage be established, the party is entitled to nominal damages. “ This principle, moreover, applies more strongly,” says the same author, page 591, M where there is a violation of the plaintiff’s right; but the defendant’s act, if continued, may become the foundation, by lapse of time, of an adverse right, and hence actual, perceptible damage is not indispensable as the foundation of an action. ” Any trespass or nuisance which infringes upon the rights of the plaintiff, or which would abridge his present or potential use of his property, will justify an action, although it cause no present actual damage: Gould on Waters, 401-404, and cases there cited. There is an obvious distinction between the proper use of a stream by a riparian owner, which, although it necessarily modifies the flow, infringes no right of other proprietors, and one which infringes their rights, although it may cause no damage: Miller v.

The plaintiffs, as we have said, had no mill' or other means of using or applying the water power. They had an abundance of water in the stream for all the purposes to which they applied it, or sought to apply it; and it is difficult, in this view of the case, to see how they could have suffered any special damage. If they had it in contemplation to erect a mill, they could have vindicated their right by successive actions of trespass; or, after establishing their right at law, if it were at all disputed they might have enjoined its invasion by <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>proceedings in equity.

    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[174,548,1162,1774]]]'>The plaintiffs’ theory as to special damages goes upon the apparent assumption that the defendant has appropriated something which was theirs, and for which he should pay the price. But the plaintiffs did not own the water which ran through the defendant’s pipe; indeed, it was diverted from its course before it reached the plaintiffs’ land, and the plaintiffs could in no sense be said to have any title to the water. As riparian owners, they had the right, as we have said, to have the water of this stream run through their land in its natural channel, without any material impairment of its flow. They had a right to the use of the stream as an incident to the land for ordinary purposes, and also for any extraordinary purpose to which they might choose to apply it, provided such extraordinary use did not materially diminish its quantity or impair its quality. They might have chosen to erect a mill, or to lease the site to some other person to erect a mill; and in either case, upon notice from the plaintiffs, the railroad company would have been obliged to cease the diversion of the water or be subject to a claim for special damage; but, as long as the diversion of the water did not do them any actual injury, they had no claim for special damages. The company was of course at all times liable to an action in vindication of the plaintiffs’ right, but not for the recovery of actual damage until an actual injury was done. The mill site was of no use to the plaintiffs, or to a lessee, or to any other person in the absence of a mill, or other useful mechanical construction to which the water might be applied; and until such a structure was erected, or proposed to be erected, how could the diversion of the water cause actual injury ? Had the diversion ceased, and the full flow of the water been restored, how could that have profited the plaintiffs ? They had no means of utilizing the water, and therefore they suffered no actual loss from its diversion. If the plaintiffs had owned the water, they would be entitled to recover its value, but they were only entitled to the use of it as it passed through their property.</p>

The estimated annual value of the mill site, as such, and independent of the land,’ is fanciful, conjectural, and speculative, for it is based upon its value as applied to some sort of a mill. It was variously spoken of by the witnesses as a suitable site for a grist-mill, or a saw-mill, for a sash and door factory, for a coach or wagon factory, or for a woolen factory; but all these suggestions of annual rental value are made upon the assumption that a mill, factory, or other structure would be built, in order to utilize the advantages which the site offers. The true rule in such a case is to estimate the damages sustained from the diversion of the water, in the use of the land for the purposes for which for the time the land was used, or for which it would have been used, but for the refusal of the defendent on due notice to remove the pipe. The injury received, if any, was not to the mill site, for there was no mill, and the site was useless without a mill. It was to the tract as a whole. It was competent, therefore, for the plaintiffs to introduce evidence to show any actual injury they suffered, within the period of the statute, in the enjoyment of their land from the diversion of the water; and, as a means of computation, they might show that the annual rental value of the land was from this cause reduced, but the annual rental value of the mill site is necessarily speculative, and therefore inadmissible. Nor was' it competent to admit any estimate of annual rental value, made upon the basis of a sale or diversion of the water, for the water does not belong to the plaintiffs. As riparian owners, they were entitled merely to the use of it, as it passed through their property.</p>
