    <p class="summary" id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[549,953,372,24]]]'>FINDINGS OF FACT.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-7" data-blocks='[["BL_163.6",163,[150,996,1169,351]]]'>1. The defendant is a Pennsylvania corporation. Its charter was not given in evidence, and we are not able, therefore, to find specifically what are its corporate powers. It appears, however, that its principal place of business is in the county of Allegheny; that it is engaged in the business of furnishing natural gas to those who may desire it, and that it was organized as a corporation before July, 1885.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-8" data-blocks='[["BL_163.7",163,[149,1355,1168,300]]]'>2. Its capital stock is $7,500,000, and of this amount two fifteenths,- or $1,000,000 thereof, was issued in payment for certain rights under letters patent granted by the United States, which rights were transferred to it by three several agreements dated July 81, 1885, October 8, 1888, and October 10, 1888.1 These agreements are made part of this finding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-9" data-blocks='[["BL_163.8",163,[146,1662,1168,390]]]'>8. At the time of their purchase, the rights under said patents were, and still are, necessary for the actual corporate purposes of said company, to enable it to successfully conduct the said business of furnishing natural gas to those who may desire it. They were, and are, fairly worth the said price paid for them; and constitute in actual value not less than two fifteenths of all the property and assets represented by the entire capital stock of the defendant.8</p>

During the tax year ending the first Monday of November, 1889, the defendant declared dividends amounting to ten per cent upon the capital stock of $7,500,000.

George Westinghouse, Jr., was the inventor of certain appliances to regulate and facilitate the transportation, supply, and combustion of gas, which the appellee desired to make use of in its business. It accordingly entered into an agreement with Mr. Westinghouse for what is described in the agreement as a “ grant of license ” for the exclusive use of his patents in the county of Allegheny, in consideration for which it agreed to give him shares of its capital stock amounting, at the face value, to one million dollars. This exclusive “ grant of license ” was upon certain conditions that limited the operation of the grant. Among these faas one prohibiting the grant under it of any right outside of Allegheny county. Another reserved to Mr. Westinghouse, his representatives and assigns, the right to “ make, or procure the making, of any or all the patented apparatus <em>” </em>to be used under the grant. Stripped of its verbiage, the agreement required Mr. Westinghouse to furnish the Philadelphia Co. his inventions, enumerated therein, for use in their business to whatsoever extent the company might require them. It required him to refuse them to all other persons or companies doing business in Allegheny county. The company thus secured the exclusive use of the manufactured apparatus or machines in that county. Mr. Westinghouse retained his patents, the right to manufacture or control the manufacture of the machines used by the Philadelphia Co., and his original exclusive right to make, sell, or use outside of Allegheny county.</p>

It will be seen, by reference to the contract and the findings of the court below, that the subject-matter of the sale or license by Westinghouse was not his patents, but his machines or apparatus, manufactured and ready for the trade. He did not sell his right as an inventor, but his goods as a manufacturer and owner, finished and ready for use. True, he agreed to sell <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>to no one else in the county, and to allow the company to control the sale within the county lines, just as a manufacturer of a particular brand of cloth or leather might agree to do with a customer in the same county, who wished to control the trade therein; but this was an agreemónt about goods, and nothing more. This case is ruled by Commonwealth v. D. &amp; P. Teleg. Co., ante, 121, in which an opinion is this day filed. It is unnecessary to repeat what was then said upon the questions involved. We adopt the reasons given for the decision in that case as part of this opinion.</p>
