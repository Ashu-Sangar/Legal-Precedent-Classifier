That the agreement made for the purchase of the property at the sheriff’s sale, as set forth in paragraph third, was a family arrangement, all the parties to it being closely related; and the said Gabriel Shaffner, being the owner of the one undivided half of the premises, was desirous that his daughter, the <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>said Mary C., should be the owner of the other half, she being the occupant of the premises, and as before stated, the party who paid the taxes and repairs upon the whole. If this agreement had not been made, the defendant would not have been allowed to purchase the property at the price named, its value being greater, and the arrangement being made solely for the use and benefit of the said Mary C. Shaffner. With this express understanding, the defendant agreed to bid in the property for her use, loaning her the amount of the purchase money and the $300 paid the execution creditor, she paying him the interest thereon, until the principal should be paid and the deed delivered to her. But, in violation of this trust, the defendant fraudulently took and retained the title in himself, thus becoming a trustee ex maleficio for the said Mary C. Shaffner.”</p>

But the fraud which will create such a trust must be fraud at the time of sale; and we fail to find anything stated in the bill which tends to show that any fraud was then practiced by the defendant. The only allegation that even hints at it is, that if the agreement to convey to Mary C. Shaffner had not been made by defendant, “ he would not have been allowed to purchase the property at the price named, its value being greater.” But neither of the plaintiffs had any control of the sale, and there is not a word in the bill to show that it was within the power of either to purchase the property, or to make any other arrangement in regard to it; or that there was any other person present prepared to purchase or even to bid. The fact that Mary “has ever since the sale paid all the taxes assessed on said property and made repairs and improvements thereon,” only tends to show that the agreement was as stated in the bill, but not that <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>there was fraud in making it.
