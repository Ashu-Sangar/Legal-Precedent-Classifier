Dunn, was about to commence the construction of said sewer and outlet, claiming the right to do so by virtue of the act of May 15, 1889, P. L. 220; that the population, within the corporate limits of said borough, was over seven thousand persons, and it was intended to discharge all the sewage from the borough into the said stream upon the land of the plaintiffs, the consequence.of which would be to do great, irreparable and unnecessary damage to the plaintiffs’ property, to endanger life and health in the neighborhood of the sewer outlet and along the stream, to prevent the use of said stream as 'a water supply, and to create a permanent nuisance and a continuing trespass; that the act of May 15, 1889, under which the right to make such entry on the plaint<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>iff s’ land was claimed, was in violation of § 3, article III. of the constitution, in that it contained more than one subject, and no subject was clearly expressed in' its title; it violated § 6 of the same article, by attempting to extend the provisions of existing laws by reference to their title only; and was in violation of § 8, article XVI., in that it attempted to invest municipal corporations with the right of eminent domain, without providing a method of securing just compensation for property taken, injured, or destroyed; that the Court of Common Pleas of Washington county had decided, upon a bill in equity filed against the same defendants by the owner of other land, that said act of assembly was constitutional; and for the plaintiffs to be compelled to seek relief through the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, would be productive of great and harmful delay, as the plaintiffs were informed and believed that the credit of the defendant borough was uncertain.</p>

An appeal therefrom would be productive of great delay, by which the health of a populous community would be endangered, and the financial credit of the borough of Washington disturbed.</p>

Our appellate jurisdiction is more than sufficient to occupy our time ; and it is only in extreme cases, which are not only important in their character but where a special reason is shown why we should take jurisdiction, that we consent to do so. Indeed, since the organization of the court under the present constitution, we have taken such jurisdiction in but two cases, and those under exceptional circumstances. In the present case, no such condition of things has been shown, nor is any good reason apparent why it could not have been disposed of in the Common Pleas of Washington county.</p>

It is further averred that the act of May 15,1889, under which the borough claims this right, is unconstitutional, and the ninth paragraph of said bill sets forth:</p>

In the absence of a more specific allegation, we may assume that the borough of Washington will be fully able to compensate the plaintiffs for any damages they may sustain. As regards the alleged delay, we have only to say that this rule was granted on July 7, 1891. Had this bill been filed in the court below on that day, we see no reason why we could not have heard the cause upon appeal on the same day we heard the rule.
