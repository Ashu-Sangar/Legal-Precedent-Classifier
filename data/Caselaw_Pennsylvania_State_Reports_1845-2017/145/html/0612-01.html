The defendants, in 1871, erected the coke works described in Robb v. Carnegie, ante, 324, at a point about one mile further up the creek, and subsequently enlarged them by erecting additional ovens. The works were operated with coal slack, brought by rail from various mines in the neighborhood. Before using it in the ovens, the defendants washed it to remove impurities. The slate, sulphur, horseback, etc., washed out of the slack, as well as the ashes left in the ovens after the drawing of the coke, were carried to and dumped into the creek.

He relies upon an ancient maxim of the law, that one must enjoy his own property in such manner as not to injure that of another. This rule gave to the plaintiff a right to the enjoyment of the stream flowing in its natural course over the surface of the land. Each proprietor of the land along Brush creek had an equal right to the advantage of the stream flowing in its natural channel; to the use of the water so as not to diminish its flow upon the other owners along the banks, and so as not to pollute the water and thus render it unfit for use by others; but no proprietor along this stream had any right to deposit foreign and injurious materials in the creek, in such a way that the ordinary current of the water or the usual rises following an ordinary rain would carry the same upon his neighbor below; and if such deposits were made, and substantial injury resulted, an action would lie to recover compensation for such injury.</p>

They contend, however, very earnestly, that their position is exceptional; that they are engaged in a lawful business; that the manufacture of coke is a necessary and important industry ; that all that was done by them was necessary and proper in such manufacture; that they were not guilty of negligence, and that there is no evidence of malice on their part. Now, all these admissions may be made without necessarily arriving at the conclusion to which the defendants direct us. If the coal were mined by the defendants at their plant on Brush creek, and the water of the mine naturally and necessarily flowed into the creek, without negligence or malice on the part of the defendants, those who suffered along the stream below would be without remedy by action. Such a rule, or rather, such an exception to the general rule, is made necessary in this state, in order not to hamper or destroy the industries engaged in the development of the natural resources of the country. But, the exception must not be carried beyond the exigencies of each particular case.</p>

But, [in principle, we can see no difference between the manufacture of coke and any other offensive or injurious trade or manufacture. In other words, there is nothing in the nature of the coke industry to give it exceptional privileges over other industries, necessarily offensive or dangerous. It is true that it is a necessary and useful industry. If manufactured at the point where the coal is mined, it may be admitted, for the purposes of this case, that the slack could be washed, streams polluted, deposits made; and if done without negligence or malice, any injury done thereby would be damnum absque injuria. But such is not this case. The plaintiff bought his land, according to the testimony, in 1862, about twenty-eight years ago. Eleven years afterwards, or in 1871, according to the testimony, the defendants located their plant on the waters of Brush creek, about a mile up the stream from the land of the plaintiff. The raw material from which the coke is manufactured is not mined at this point, but is shipped from other places at various distances from the coke plant; the product also, is shipped away to market. The place selected for the manufacture is distant, therefore, both from the place of production of the raw material and from the market where the product is sold. Selecting such a location, as we view the law, the defendants are not in a position to claim exemption from the rule which requires ’them to use their own property so as to cause no injury to another; and if they did so use it, they would be liable for whatever injury they caused to plaintiff’s land for six years prior to the commencement of this suit.]9.....</p>

There seems to be no serious contention but that some injury was done to the plaintiff’s property by some person at some time. The plaintiff alleges that six or eight acres, as we have alreadj^ indicated, were absolutely ie<a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>stroyed; that these acres were out of the very centre or heart of the farm, and that the destruction of these six acres depreciated the market value of the entire farm. On the other hand, it is contended by the defence that this injury was not nearly so great; that there was but a slight deposit of coke or other foreign material upon the north side of the tract, which we understand to be larger; and upon the south side thereof, there was not more than an acre and a half of the land that was rendered unfit for cultivation. There has been a great deal of testimony taken upon this question of fact, as well as some other questions that are present in the case, and we will refer very briefly, bjr way of refreshing your recollection, to the general run of the testimony upon the one side and upon the other.....</p>

He claims for a permanent injury to his farm. To illustrate the damage, he has shown an orchard injured by sulphur or coke killing the trees, and by the waters washing trees away; that his fences have been swept away. The injury to the fences, however, was more than eight years ago. Wé have tried to recall some testimony to fix precisely when the trees were injured or swept away, but we have not been able to discover the precise time ; but that is a matter for you. The real injury complained of is the permanent and substantial injury to his premises. He claims for a depreciation in the market value of his property; <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>that from six to eight acres in the heart of his farm have been ruined, and that the value of the whole has depreciated in the market. This is a question to which you will particularly direct your attention. What is the difference in the value of this land with and without the deposit caused by the defendants within six years prior to the bringing of the suit ? This is the true measure of damages in this case, unless the cost of removing the deposit, and placing the premises in the same position as before the injury, would be less than the difference in the value of the land. If less, this would be the measure; this would be, the amount that ought to be awarded to the plaintiff. As we have already indicated, compensation is the rule. The plaintiff, if entitled to any damage, is entitled only to such damage as will compensate him for the injury he has suffered. If the deposit can be removed and the plaintiff placed in the position he was in'on the eighth of March, 1882, for less than the land has depreciated in value, he ought to be awarded only sufficient to place him in such position.....</p>

The defendants had a right to such use of the water of the creek as they could make, without materially diminishing its quantity, or corrupting its quality; but no greater right.

It is mainly upland. The flat along the stream is quite narrow, and covers not more than seven or eight acres, including the bed of the stream. The defendants own and operate an extensive coke works, situated on the bank of the stream a little more than one mile above the plaintiff’s farm, at which the slack is collected from several coal mines in the region, and used for making coke. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants habitually <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>put the ashes from their ovens and their refuse slate and slack into the stream, using it as a dumping ground, and depending on the current and the floods to carry it away. By this means the water is polluted, and rendered unfit for use; the channel is choked up, the water is crowded out of its original bed, and the flat cut up and covered with a deposit of ashes, slate, and refuse from the coke works, so that it is unfit for cultivation. For the injury thus sustained, as the result of the unlawful use made of the stream by the defendants, the plaintiff seeks to recover in this action. The defendants reply that the pollution of the stream began before their works were erected, as the result of mining operations on Brush creek and its tributaries, which were in progress more than twenty years before this suit was brought. They say that their own works were erected in 1871, and have been in operation since that time without objection or complaint until now; that the condition of the stream and the plaintiff’s land has undergone no material change for many years, and if their present condition is to any extent chargeable to the acts of defendants or their employees, no recovery can be had in this case except for injury done within six years before suit was brought.</p>

Was the water then polluted? Was the channel choked with refuse and the flat cut by the water, and covered with the deposit complained of ? Having ascertained what the situation then was, they were next to inquire whether the situation had been made worse during the six years. If so, in what respect, and to what extent ? In this way they would be able to reach a correct conclusion as to the extent of the injury done the plaintiff, for which he could recover in this action. The method adopted on the trial was quite different. The plaintiff &gt;vas permitted to show, and the jury was instructed to consider, what the plaintiff’s farm would be worth as a whole, including the buildings and improvements, with the creek and the flat land in the original condition as it was before the work of pollution began, and what it was now worth, with the stream and the flat in their present condition; so that the difference between these estimates became the measure of damages.</p>

      <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>We held in Robb v. Carnegie, supra, that this mode of estimating damages, which is properly applicable to cases where an entry is made under the power of eminent domain, is not ordinarily applicable to actions of trespass. It is not necessary to repeat the reasons which were given in support of that conclusion. It is enough to say that we adhere to them. In case of a taking, the natural inquiry is, how is that which is left affected by the taking? Where nothing is taken, but an injurious trespass is alleged, the question is, what will be the cost of restoring the thing injured to its former condition ? If the cost of restoration will equal or exceed the value of the thing' injured, then the value becomes the measure of the plaintiff’s damages. But there is still another reason why the measure of damages adopted in the court below was inapplicable to this ease. The defendants had pleaded the statute of limitations, and the inquiry was thereby limited to six years. The comparison which the testimony placed before the jury carried them back to a time when the stream was not polluted, and the slate and slack had not been deposited on the plaintiff’s land. It brought to their notice, not the injury done in six years, but the changes made from the beginning of operations on Brush creek, which was nearly or quite a quarter of a century before the trial. While the learned judge told the jury that the plaintiff could not recover for an injury sustained more than six years before his action was begun, he permitted testimony to be given which brought the entire change in the situation of the plaintiff’s flat land to their attention, and which contrasted its value, if in its original condition, with its value in its present condition. This evidence was admitted after objection, and for the purpose of providing the jury with a measure of damages in this case.</p>

The witness had put a value upon the plaintiff’s farm. The defendants had a right to test his knowledge and his fairness as a witness, upon cross-examination. For this purpose it was proper to ask him if he did not know of sales of farm lands in the same vicinity, at a much less price than he had put upon the farm of the plaintiff. If he did know of such sales, but disregarded them in fixing the price of the plaintiff’s land, <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>that circumstance was calculated to affect his credibility, unless it was explained to the satisfaction of the jury.</p>
