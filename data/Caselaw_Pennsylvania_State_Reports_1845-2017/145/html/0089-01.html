    <p class="summary" id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[282,680,1166,403]]]'>1. The defendant is a corporation of this state, chartered December 30, 1862, under the act of April 7, 1849, P. L. 563. Under subsequent legislation, its authorized capital stock was increased to $2,200,000. Owing however to the fraudulent over-issue of shares by one of its officers, for which the company was responsible, the number of its shares on the first Monday of November, 1886, was 46,949, with a par value of $50. Its chief office is^in the city of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[278,1089,1166,389]]]'>2. The defendant’s business was the manufacture of sleeping cars under certain patents owned by it, and the leasing of said cars to railway companies under written contracts. In furtherance thereof, its entire capital stock, on February 17, 1870, was invested in one hundred and nineteen cars, in seventeen patent-rights, and in contracts with sixteen railway companies. These patents and contracts would all expire before August 1, 1887.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b110-7" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[275,1496,1163,400]]]'>3. On February 17, 1870, the defendant, by written contract with the Pullman’s Palace-Car Company, transferred to the latter the said cars with their furniture, etc., and.the said patents and contracts; in consideration whereof the defendant was to receive the annual sum of $264,000. The terms of this contract were somewhat altered by a second agreement made February 27, 1885. Both contracts are made a part of this finding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b110-8" data-blocks='[["BL_110.7",110,[272,1903,1165,500]],["BL_111.1",111,[166,374,1173,506]]]'>4. For several years, this annual sum of $264,000 was paid to the defendant’s stockholders as a dividend of twelve per cent, and tax was paid to the state upon this basis. [But in 1877 it was feared that the contract with the Pennsylvania Railroad Co., which was to expire in 1885, could not be renewed by Pullman’s Palace-Car Co., or could not be renewed upon as favorable terms as were originally granted; and, as it was certain that the patents formerly owned by the defendant would soon expire, it became apparent to defendant’s board of directors, that as the annual payments made by Pullman’s <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>Palace-Car Co., represented capital as well as profits, it would be prudent to set apart a portion of these payments to represent the expiring patents and railway contracts, and thus to provide a fund to enable the defendant to resume its original operations, if this should become necessary. Otherwise, if the railway contracts could not be renewed at all, or could not be favorably renewed, the defendant’s assets would be simply one hundred and nineteen cars, with no contracts under which they could be profitably used, and with no existing patents to protect them.] 3</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b111-3" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[164,888,1173,561]]]'>5. Accordingly, the defendant’s board of directors in June', 1877, proposed to the stockholders, that four per cent of the annual payment made by the Pullman’s Palace-Car Co., beginning in October of that year, should be set apart for three years, to enable the defendant to resume its original operations in the event above stated. This proposition was agreed to by the stockholders, and thereupon the defendant, on October 11, 1877, made an agreement with the Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit &amp; Insurance Co., whereby the latter was to receive and hold in trust the securities bought with the said four per cent. This agreement also is made a part of this finding.</p>

[The securities thus accumulated and deposited with the trust company amounted, in 1887, to about #626,900 of United States bonds, worth about #713,000.

    <p class="summary" id="b114-8" data-blocks='[["BL_114.6",114,[248,790,1169,387]]]'>This case presents one question only, viz., whether the sum of twelve dollars per share paid to the defendant’s stockholders in 1887, was a dividend or a reduction of capital stock; and this is as much a question of fact as of law. We have already found as a fact that the transaction complained of, was not the declaration of a dividend, but a reduction of capital stock, and if this finding is supported by the evidence little more need be said.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="A3q" data-blocks='[["BL_114.7",114,[242,1195,1169,1006]]]'>It is not necessary to repeat the facts above set out. There is no contradiction in the testimony, and we do not see how it is possible to reach the conclusion that a dividend, in the sense given to that word by our statutes and decisions, was either declared or intended to be declared. [The fund in question plainly represented capital, was expressly and consciously accumulated as capital, was intended to be used as capital, and, when this intention was abandoned, was expressly divided as capital. It is true, that it was sometimes loosely spoken of as a “ surplus,” and the reduction as a “ dividend,” but the transaction is to be regarded as it really was, and not as it may have been incorrectly named.] 7 Its truth and substance were as we have found above, and further discussion would not make the subject plainer. Several opinions of the Supreme Court clearly and exhaustively describe what a dividend is, under our taxing system; and we can add nothing to what is there said. See Lehigh- Crane Iron Co. v.
