The law of this state, in regard to pleadings in cases of this kind, is thus stated: “ The attorney general may disclose in his information the specific ground of forfeiture, or he may merely set forth the franchises, alleged to have been illegally exercised, and call upon the defendant to show by what authority they are held. The plea should either deny the facts, of set forth the authority. The replication may then allege the acts relied on as working a forfeiture. This may be denied or admitted by the defendant: ” Lewis, C. J., in Commonwealth v.

In the case at bar, had the attorney general so chosen, he might undoubtedly have stated in his suggestion merely that the defendant was exercising the office of recorder in the city of Williamsport, and called upon him to show by what authority. Upon answer, however, the attorney general must have alleged the grounds of the alleged illegal exercise of the duties of the office. But the only ground urged was that defendant was not authorized to exercise the duties of the office created by the acts.</p>

The suggestion alleged that, without any warrant or lawful authority, the defendant was exercising an office provided by certain acts of assembly. The answer set up certain facts showing him to be duly authorized to exercise the office under the acts. The replication joined issue only as to matters alleged in the answer. All the facts therein alleged, necessary to show the authority of defendant under the acts, were formally admitted by the commonwealth upon the trial. The instruction to the jury, therefore, should have been in favor of the defendant. The pleadings raised no question as to the constitutionality of the act of 1877, and its supplements, <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>or any of them; and upon the trial, the attorney general did not call attention to any particular in which said acts, or any of them, violated or were believed to violate any provision of the federal or state constitutions; nor did the learned court in its charge or in its decree.</p>

It is obvious, from an inspection of the record, that the only question for the consideration of the court below was the constitutionality of these statutes. In the information, on which the writ of quo warranto was issued, it was charged that the appellant used and exercised the office of recorder under color of them, and in his <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>answer thereto it was averred that, by their terms, he became and was entitled to hold the said office. The regularity of the proceedings under them was conceded upon the trial, subject to objection as to their relevancy. It is not possible, in the presence of the information, answer, and concession, to discover any dispute concerning the facts in the case. These were admitted, and the inquiry related to their legal effect. This inquiry necessarily involved a consideration of the validity of the statutes under which the appellant claimed he was entitled to hold the office, and which the commonwealth alleged gave him no more than color of title to it. It is plain from the pleadings, the developments on the trial, and the charge of the learned judge, that the question of the constitutionality of these statutes was presented, considered, and passed upon in the court below; and whether the argument made there by the counsel for the commonwealth was sufficiently specific to satisfy the appellant is a matter with which we have no concern. We may add that, if greater precision in the pleadings was deemed necessary, it could have been secured by an amendment.</p>

Whether they shall apply to a city of the class described depends on the action of its municipal officers; and in consequence thereof, one city of the class may be subject to their provisions, and other cities of the same class be exempt from them.
