The popular sense of the word heirs, especially in a Pennsylvania German community like this, is children. Though the average Pennsylvania German never heard of the maxim, nemo est hieres viventis, he does know that he must die before he has heirs; and he also knows that one can, and most men do, have children before they die.</p>

As no contrary intention appears in this will, and the common sense of the word heirs, as in popular use among Pennsylvania Germans, is children, one would naturally conclude, in the light of the will and the statutes, that the words “ dying without heirs,” as used in the will, imported a definite failure of issue. And, if construed to mean children, then, as the limitation must take effect, if at all, within a life in being, it must take effect at the death of Albert, the devisee ; for at that moment it will be definitely known whether he died before he had children, and in such case the report would be wrong. .....</p>
