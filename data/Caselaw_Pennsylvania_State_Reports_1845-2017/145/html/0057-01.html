    <p class="summary" id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[145,1187,1168,859]]]'>As we have stated in the findings of fact, the settlement appealed from charges defendant with tax upon the nominal value of its whole indebtedness. We do not, however, understand the learned attorney general to claim that defendant should be held for tax upon the whole amount. His argument, if we rightly apprehend it, is that in some sense the burden of proof is upon the defendant, to this extent at least: That as the register of voters shows that out of $28,562,700 in nominal value of bonds, $338,100 in value are owned by residents of Pennsylvania, the court ought to presume that if all were registered for voting the same proportion would hold, and therefore that defendant should be charged with tax upon the resulting proportion of the whole amount of its indebtedness. And further, that as the record of registered bonds shows that of $11,124,300 in nominal value, $2,054,000 are held by residents of Pennsylvania, the result of the same process of apportionment should be applied.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.7",81,[149,2052,1164,249]]]'>It is to be noted, however, that of the $2,054,000 shown by the record of registered bonds to be held by residents of Pennsylvania, $1,551,000 are held by Pennsylvania corporations, and are therefore not taxable, so that this registry shows only a taxable Pennsylvania ownership of $503,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-8" data-blocks='[["BL_81.8",81,[152,2310,1162,95]],["BL_82.1",82,[276,370,1164,744]]]'>But the question of the existence of taxable property is not a question- of proportion. Only bonds held in Pennsylvania <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>are taxable. The act of 1885, under which this tax is claimed, makes it the duty of the treasurer of defendant to assess and retain the tax when payment of interest is made on all such bonds, and to report the amount thereof “ as nearly as the same can be ascertained,” and if he fails to perform this duty, the defendant is liable for the tax which he has thus failed to retain ; but the act nowhere makes the defendant liable to tax on bonds not held or owned in the state, because it has failed in its duty with respect to those so held. The utmost liability it can incur is to pay the tax on such bonds as are owned in the state, with the penalty for failure to retain and report, where this is charged in the settlement. And, therefore, before this liability can be imposed, the particular bonds, and not merely the amount of bonds so held, must be in some legal manner ascertained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[272,1133,1164,651]]]'>The argument of the learned attorney general leaves wholly out of view this most important element of the case, that the duty and the right to retain the amount of the tax, on payment of the interest, is a duty and a right which attaches to each individual bond and its coupons, and not to the bonds and coupons in the mass. That is to say, it is not the duty of the treasurer, and he has not the right, to deduct the tax from any given coupon, unless the bond, with the corresponding number to which the coupon belonged, is held in Pennsylvania. Hence, even if he knew that say $100,000 in amount of the bonds were held within the state, he could not legally deduct the tax from any of the coupons presented for payment, unless they belonged to the particular bonds so held.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[270,1793,1162,448]]]'>Therefore, if we were to hold the defendant liable to any part of the tax claimed in this settlement, on the inference or presumption that some of the bonds are held in Pennsylvania, without proof which particular bonds are so held, we should require it to pay to the state a tax which it could not possibly retain or collect from the bondholders, upon whom, and not upon the defendant, the tax is imposed. This would be such a monstrous injustice, and so entirely unwarranted by any fair construction of the act, that we cannot possibly so hold.</p>

There the defendant’s bonds had all been issued and sold in Pennsylvania; here they were all issued and sold outside of the state of Pennsylvania, and some of them in London, England. There the defendant had not, up to the time of the trial, made any effort to ascertain the residence of any one of the holders of its bonds; here defendant had made such effort, and has shown upon the trial that nearly one million dollars in nominal value thereof are held in Pennsylvania. We do not see how, on these facts, we can presume the ownership of bonds within the state, and hold defendant liable to tax upon them ; and, especially, when there is not a scintilla of evidence on which we could base the presumption that any particular bonds are so owned, or that the treasurer of defendant, when paying the tax, could or ought to have known that any given coupons presented to him for payment belonged to bonds so owned.</p>

But, while this would be a reasonable construction of the language of the act, it is fair to assume that the intent was to tax all the bonds actually owned and held within the state, whether issued to residents or not, and it must be so construed. If, however, we are to give any force whatever to the phrase “ issued by said corporation to residents of the state,” it must, at least, have the effect of suggesting that the fact, whether the bonds were issued to residents or non-residents, furnishes a starting point in the inquiry whether they are held within the state or not, and that where they were issued out of the state to non-residents and have not-<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>been shown, by either the commonwealth or defendant, to be owned by residents, we cannot presume it in order to hold defendant liable for tax in respect of them; while, at the same time, if thej'' had been originally issued in the state to residents, it might be fair to presume, in the absence of proof, that the ownership had not changed and that they were still held by them. And when the presumption applies to all the bonds, the difficulty or inability to fix the situs of the ownership of any particular bond would not arise ; and this was the fact in the case of the Commonwealth v.

It is as unreasonable to sound a charge upon it as an enemy to individual and popular rights, as it is to seek for sophistical reasons for grasping and holding by its authority every subject of taxation which the drag net of the official force has brought within its supposed compass.
