And it is by that means that the electric force, or electricity, or electric power, is generated; and generated, you see, in consequence of the operation of those instrumentalities, the source being the coal burned under the boiler, and the result being those various transformations by which we finally reach the current which passes into the lamp, and is then again transformed into light.</p>

The revolution of the armature brings into being something that did not exist before; that is, this electric energy, or energy in this electric form. When the motion begins in most machines it begins by development from a minute quantity. From that minute and insignificant quantity the revolution of the apparatus causes a development and the accumulation of the fluid, and accumulating as the result of that, and developing the current of electricity; and then this passes out and on to the wires, and there is the moment of creation—we may say, its creation. But its source, in the philosophic sense, is the latent energy of the coal. If the coal is not burned we cannot have the engine moved, nor the dynamo, and therefore we cannot get the electricity; and the electricity is derived, as its prime origin, from the coal; but not, however, extracted from the coal,—it was not there, but created by utilizing the latent energy of the coal.</p>

Being in connection, the electricity begins to flow. Having established this flow, the points are slowly separated by a slight interval. As they are separated, the distance being infinitesimal, and very slowly, the energy of the current enables it to spring across the minute interval, and when it does so it produces a great heat, both at the point which it leaps from, and which it leaps to, and it vaporizes the carbon, and also, by special electric action through the points, and tearing through the particles of carbon, it evolves gas; and so the space between the poles, as they are slowly drawn apart, is filled with an amount of gas vapor, and the vapor be<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>comes intensely hot by the action of the current upon it, and also the carbon, a very combustible body in the presence of air, burns; and that is the true flame of gas, different only in degree in the candle; the solid matter of the gas is first burned in the vapor, and this burns, and that is the burning of the candle.”</p>

And it is equally well settled that when a tax is clearly imposed by general act, any one claiming exemption must show clearly that such exemption exists. The principle, as stated in Cooley on Taxation, 146, is this: “ The intention to exempt must in any case be expressed in clear and unambiguous terms; taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. All exemptions are to be strictly construed. They embrace only what is within their terms.” To the same effect is Academy of Fine Arts v. Philadelphia Co., <a href="/pa/22/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="413783" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0496-01">22 Pa. 496</a>, where it is said: “No interests, falling within the general description of taxable property, can claim exemption from bearing, their just proportion of public charges, unless the exemption be so clearly expressed in the statute as to admit of no other construction. It is never to be presumed that the legislature intend to lay unequal burdens upon the people ; and their enactments are not to be construed so as to produce that result, unless the intent is so plainly expressed as to render it unavoidable.” Defendant is clearly included in § 4 of the act of 1879; it must therefore, to be relieved, show that it is unmistakably included in the exemption provided for in § 20 of the act of 1885. In other words, it must show clearly that it is a manufacturing corporation.</p>

Brit., 569, in the article “Ether,” it is said: “That light is not itself a substance, may be proved from the phenomenon of interference. A beam of light from a single source is <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>divided by certain optical methods into two parts, and these, after traveling by different paths, are made to reunite and fall upon a screen.

Another analogy is the undulations in the air, which produce the “ effect on the sense of hearing ” which we call sound. These undulations with the telephone by electricity produce the effect of sound at great distances; and if we might judge by analogy, we should be inclined to say that it is the undulations of the “ luminiferous ether,” which, by the use of electricity, by means of electric wires, are induced and extended to the lamps and “produce the effect of light;” and that it might, with the same reason, be said, that in the use of the telephone sound is manufactured, as that in the use of the electric lighting apparatus there is a manufacture of light.</p>

The facts found by the court clearly show that the electricity employed is not a natural product, but is the result of man’s invention and industry, and the light in which the company deals is produced by additional processes and is wholly artificial. Notwithstanding this, the court found that the defendant is not engaged in manufacturing, the decision proceeding upon the assumption that the word manufacture properly refers only to material substances, and that electricity and light are without substance. A reference to authorities upon the subject shows that electricity is not universally, if at all, conceded to be without substance, and that there are conflicting theories as to the nature of light. The correctness of the court’s conclusions as to the immateriality of these things is, at least, uncertain.</p>

These exhibit not only the view of the state’s executive officers, but also the understanding of hundreds of incorporators as to the meaning and scope of the term. And there is no reason to suppose that the legislature, in 1885, intended to discriminate against any manufacturing corporations, except certain ones specifically enumerated. It was desirable to encourage the investment of capital in electric lighting within the cities of this state, and its taxation might lead capitalists to select cities in other states, in preference.</p>

We submit that the question, whether the defendant is a manufacturing corporation, is one of fact, and that the finding of the court against it is not revie wable as a question of law. If, however, the question is still open, then we claim that the definitions which the various authorities give of the word manufacture, all agree substantially in excluding a business such as that of the defendant, its result not being an article, or substance, or commodity, or a form of material, or wares, in the sense of any of the definitions. It will not do to say that we do not know whether electricity is a substance or not. This simply leaves the defendant’s case unproved. A company like the defendant, producing light by electricity, is no more a manufacturing company than is a telegraph, or telephone company, which produces sound for the use of its customers by the same means.</p>

The reasons for exempting manufacturing corporations from taxation do not apply to electric light companies. They stand on the same plane with water companies and like corporations. The argument for the defendant, based upon the language of § 34, act of April 29,1874, P. L. 73, and act of June 2, 1887, P. L. 310, is well answered by the court below. And the effort to import into § 20, act of June 30,1885, P.

One of these, which was based upon the opinion and largely expressed in the words of an expert electrician, who was called as a witness, asserts that the electricity sold by the company was created by the process adopted by the company. The learned judge says : “ The electricity which furnishes the light does not exist until the armature revolves. The revolution of the armature brings into being something that did not exist before; that is, this electric energy, or energy in this electric form.” In the same finding, he describes the process by which this product is evolved or created as follows: Coal is burned under the boilers, producing heat. The heat generates steam in the boilers, which moves the engine. The engine supplies the power by which the armature is made to revolve. The revolution of the armature produces electric currents where they did not exist before. The electricity thus generated is carried over wires provided' by the company, and delivered to its customers, where it is used to produce light. The process by which electricity is made to furnish light is found to consist of the movement of an electric current from one carbon point to another which are made part of its circuit. In leaping from one point to another great heat is developed by the energy of the current. This heat liberates or evolves from the carbons a gas which it burns. The light is thus found to <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>be due partly to the passage of the electric current between the carbon points, and partly to the combustion of the gas furnished by the heated carbons. Notwithstanding these findings, which showed a creation, or “ bringing into being where it did not exist before,” of the electricity sold by the company, the learned judge held as matter of law that the process was not one of manufacture, because the product was not a material substance. Conceding that the thing sold was “ brought into being,” made, “ manufactured,” in the common use of that word, he denied that such making was in a legal sense a manufacture, because it did not appear affirmatively of what the mysterious product was made, and that it was material, as matter is now defined. This conclusion appears to have been drawn from the derivation and definition of the word manufacture, and is forcibly presented in a learned opinion, in which lexicons and books of reference are largely drawn upon. It is very clear that the word originally meant hand-made. It is equally clear, in the light of the definitions collated by the learned judge, that its meaning has expanded with the advance of the arts and sciences, until it has come to mean, as a verb, the making of anything by human art or skill: Burrill’s Law Diet.; and, as a noun, anything made by art or skill: Rap. &amp; L. Law Dict.</p>

Thus the liberation of natural gas or oil from the earth, and its transportation to consumers, is not a manufacture, but the production of illuminating gas is: Nassau Gas Light Co. v. Brooklyn, <a href="/ny/89/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="89 N.Y. 409" data-case-ids="2184370" data-case-paths="/ny/89/0409-01">89 N. Y. 409</a>; also, Emerson v.

A telegraph company produces electricity by artificial means, but it uses it in its own business as a carrier of messages for the public; so does a telephone company. Both receive messages for carriage, and deliver them at the point of destination. They transport for their customers. This company whose character we are considering sells the electricity it makes, or “brings into being,” as a commodity. It provides the lamps or appliances for the use of its customers, by means of which the light is produced; it sells them the <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>electricity, measures it as it is delivered, and is paid according to the quantity furnished. Whatever electricity may be, it seems to be absolutely within the power and under the control of the company that brings it into being. It is compelled by the process employed, to come into being. It is secured, stored, poured out, or liberated at will. Its manifestations are both seen and felt. It moves with incredible velocity and power. It carries the tones and inflections of, the human voice, or moves loaded cars, depending on the volume of the current and the manner of its application. It may be, in the hands of the physician, a soothing remedial agent, and, in the hands of the law, an instrument of execution swifter and surer than the headsman’s axe. It may be too early to say just Avhat it is. The scientists whose views the learned judge adopted may be right or wrong. We have no need to decide that question. Laws are written ordinarily in the language of the people, and not in that of science; and if this case depended on the question on which it turned in the court below, we should be led by the findings of fact to a different conclusion of law from that which was there reached, and hold that this company was a manufacturing company.</p>
    <p id="b138-6" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[253,1442,1165,593]]]'>But we think the controlling question in this case is that of the sense in which the words “ manufacturing companies ” are used in the statute under consideration. It provides that the taxes laid on corporations by the revenue laws of the commonwealth, are repealed or abolished as to manufacturing corporations. Now, if there were a class of corporations existing at that date known by the name of manufacturing companies or corporations, we must assume that the legislature intended that class, when it used the name by which the class had been known in previous legislation; and we need go no farther than the statute book to determine the legislative intent in the act of 1885.</p>

Looking back to the laws under which corporations have been created, we find that in 1836 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> an act was passed providing for the organization of corporations for the manufacture of iron from the ores, with <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>coke or mineral coal, which was subsequently extended so as to include companies using charcoal. This was followed in 1849<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> by a law which provided for the organization of “ manufacturing companies ” as a class of corporations. It included the manufacture of woolen, cotton, flax, or silk goods; of iron, paper, lumber, or salt. In 1850, it was extended so as to include the manufacture of glass. In 1851, printing and publishing were taken into the class. In 1852, the making of mineral paints and artificial slate was included. In 1853, quarrying and mining. In 1859, the manufacture of leather and leather goods. Mineral and carbon oils were included by a series of acts passed in 1856,1859, and 1860. It will thus be seen that the words “ manufacturing corporations ” had been employed as the name of a definite class of corporations for many years, and that the kinds of manufacture embraced within the class were not left to be settled by conjecture, or by reasoning built upon definitions, but had been settled by actual enumeration in the statutes referred to and some others. When the constitution of 1873 was adopted,' and when the general corporation act of 1874 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">†</a> was passed in obedience to its requirements, manufacturing corporations as a class were provided for, and the kinds of manufacture included made certain by a long series of statutes. The act of 1874 provided a uniform mode for the incorporation of companies formed for profit, describing them as corporations of the second class; while corporations not for profit composed the first class. In the second class were included, among others, companies formed for “ carrying on any mechanical, <em>mining, </em>quarrying, or manufacturing business, including all the purposes covered by the provisions of the act of general assembly entitled ‘An act to encourage manufacturing operations in this commonwealth, approved April 7,1849,’ ” and its several supplements. Thereafter any company formed for the prosecution of the objects enumerated in the act of 1849 and its supplements, entered the class of manufacturing corporations through the gate opened by the act of 1874, instead of through previous legislation. But, whether they came in the one*way or the other, if they were within the class as the <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>legislature had made it, the act of 1885 relieved them from the tax imposed by the act of 1879. A company supplying illuminating gas is, in the general sense of the word, a manufacturing company: Nassau Gas-Light Co. v. Brooklyn, supra; but it is not a member of the statutory class built up under the act of 1849, nor is any corporation engaged in the service of its customers in a quasi public capacity. A municipality may furnish water and light to its citizens. A company performing this service may be said to perform a quasi public or municipal function, which the municipality may disturb at its pleasure, or supersede altogether. Such companies have never been included in any of the legislation provided for the encouragement and protection of manufacturing corporations, and have no right to share in the benefits of such legislation. They really form a class by themselves. When the act of 1885 was passed, laws had been made in adjoining states which gave encouragement to the establishment of factories by exempting them from certain forms of taxation. The mischief to be remedied was the danger that such legislation might lead to the removal of capital and labor from this state to others, to the detriment of the business and prosperity of our own. The remedy provided was the removal of the tax imposed by the act of 1879, so as to remove the inducement to leave the state. It was as broad as the mischief which it was intended to meet, and made applicable to the class which since 1836 it had been the policy of the state to encourage, viz., “ manufacturing corporations.” It did not reach financial corporations like banks and insurance companies, nor transportation companies, nor companies performing functions partaking of a municipal character, but that class of productive industries which the legislature had sought to encourage as a means of bringing and keeping within our borders capital and labor, to be employed in the development of our mineral wealth, and in the production of the staples of commerce.</p>
