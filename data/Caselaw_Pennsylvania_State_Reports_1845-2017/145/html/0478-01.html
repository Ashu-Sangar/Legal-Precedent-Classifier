On the part of the defendant, it is alleged that that is not a correct statement of that matter. They allege that it was paid to him for some other cause or purpose. This thousand dollars I speak of now, is a thousand dollars which Mr. Townsend says a check attached to the voucher shows was charged up to expense account, and which he cannot account for or explain. In the absence of any explanation, we .cannot tell just how that one thousand dollars was paid. Mr. Townsend is unable to explain it, he says ; but he admits that on the corner of that check there was attached a lead-pencil memorandum of the treasurer and general secretary of the company which directed him to charge that up to expense account.

The plaintiff’s case, as set up by himself in the statement of claim, exhibits no contract with the defendant relating to the steel department. His averments clearly state a contract with Mr. Morrell as the representative of the Gautier Steel Co., Limited; and it is expressly averred that no contract was made with the defendant, when it acquired and merged into its own business the business of the steel company. It would be useless to cite authorities to the effect that the defendant did not become liable upon such a contract of the steel company, by purchasing its business, or by reason of having been a large stockholder in the concern, and as such having “ controlled and managed” it. We submit, therefore, that the court erred, under the pleadings and evidence, in submitting to the jury the question whether the plaintiff had a contract with the defendant for a salary of ten thousand dollars as superintendent of the steel department.</p>

The plaintiff was bound to know that, under the limited partnership law, such a contract as he sets up was required to be put in a certain form, and be made by certain officials, to be valid; and if he did not himself communicate with the association for the purpose, of having the contract confirmed and put in proper shape, but intrusted the doing of this to Mr. Morrell, any communication in regard to the matter, made by Mr. Morrell, would be evidence: Mercantile N.

The voucher of January 31,1884, has every element of a written contract. It is just as distinct as if the plaintiff had written, “ My salary as superintendent of the Gautier Steel department is seven thousand dollars,” and had signed this. It is unquestionably a stated account, which cannot be set aside without alleging mistake or fraud. There could be no mistake. The plaintiff says he told Mr. Townsend in 1883 that the contract was for ten thousand dollars, but he continued on and received his salary after that at the rate of seven thousand dollars, and acknowledged that to be the rate in writing. Mr. Townsend, however, denies that such notice was given him; and therefore that fact is unproved, the testimony being simply oath against oath: Sower v.

The contract would seem to have been made with special reference to a future event, which occurred precisely as anticipated. The foundation of the action is therefore, not upon the allegations that Chapin was employed by the Gautier Steel Co., Limited, but by the Cambria Iron Co., for which the services were in fact rendered.</p>

Morrell, the manager of the company at the time of his original employment, of which the board of directors had notice; and that this agreement was according to the practice of the company with reference to a certain class of its employees. The company does not deny that to some extent this practice did prevail with respect to certain of the officers and employees of the company, especially those drawing the highest salaries; but it is denied that this practice was at any time applied to the plaintiff. Mr. Chapin’s testimony, however, is to the effeet <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>that such was the agreement with Mr. Morrell, and that, in pursuance of that agreement, one thousand or two thousand dollars was actually paid to him from the Philadelphia office. He further testified that after Mr. Morrell’s decease, when he called the matter to the attention of Mr. Townsend, the president of the board, Mr. Townsend admitted that Mr. Morrell had told him of the agreement, and that he promised payment would be made in accordance with its terms. He says: “ I saw Mr. Townsend, in the spring of 1883, with reference to the balance due me as general superintendent of the Gautier department. It was the first time I brought the matter to his attention,—in the spring of 1883, after my second year had expired. I told him what my agreement was with Mr. Morrell in Cleveland, what Mr. Morrell had agreed to pay me, and he said it should be all right; and he also said at that time that he understood it, Mr. Morrell had informed him, although Mr. Morrell didn’t advise him in his letter, when he wrote him of my coming, of the amount of my salary.” In another part of his examination, speaking of the same conversation, he says: “ He (Mr. Townsend) admitted the agreement perfectly, and said that the amount would be paid. He gave me a thousand dollars on that account on the 31st May, 1882. He had a memorandum, at the time I called attention to it, of the amount.”</p>

They undoubtedly furnished strong proof of a contract to serve as superintendent at a salary of seven thousand dollars, but there was other proof to a different effect, which the jury was not at liberty to disregard. In determining what the contract was, the jury were bound to consider, not a part of the evidence, but all the evidence on that subject. If Mr. Chapin’s testimony is believed, especially in view of the admitted practice of the company, these book-entries, <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>vouchers, letters, etc., were in great measure' consistent with his theory of the case, for doubtless the accounts, vouchers, etc., covering the salaries of all those who received additional sums from the Philadelphia office, were in the same condition. The exact nature of the contract between the parties, and the amount of the plaintiff’s annual salary, upon, a consideration of the -accounts as they were kept, the vouchers, receipts, letters, and generally upon a consideration of all the evidence in the cause, oral or written, bearing upon that question, was for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[252,891,1167,1305]]]'>That the negotiations between the Cambria Iron Co. and the Gautier Steel Co., Limited, were incomplete at the time of the contract between Morrell and Chapin, is immaterial, if the employment was in view of the consummation of that event, and to provide a superintendent when it should occur. Besides, it is clear that no sérvices of any character were at any time rendered by Chapin for the Gautier Steel Co., Limited, nor does it seem to have been in contemplation that he would' render service to that company; for, as we have said, on the 'veiy day he entered into his employment the Gautier company was merged in the Cambria Iron Co., and thereafter, except as a mere matter of book-keeping, had no existence. It is true that the employment of a superintendent by the manager- was subject to the approval of the board of directors, but if, in recognition of the terms alleged, a portion of this extra salary was actually paid to Mr Chapin from the Philadelphia office, and Mr. Townsend, the president, to whom frequent statements showing the balance of salary due are said to have been rendered, “ admitted the agreement perfectly,” saying the “ amount would be paid,” the jury might, under the admitted practice of the company in this respect, readily infer that Mr. Morrell’s contract had been approved. Of course, all these statements of Mr. Chapin were strongly denied, but the mere denial was not enough to withdraw that question from the jury. It is the peculiar province of the jury to determine the veracity of the witnesses, and settle the conflicts in the evidence.</p>

The questions of fact involved were fully, fairly, and impartially submitted; and if the plaintiff has any <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>right to complain, it is of the jury, and not of the court. Nor was there any error in excluding the letter of Daniel J. Morrell to Dr. Wurtz, dated May 4, 1881. It was written long after the contract was complete, and after Chapin had actually entered upon his employment. It was no part of the res gestee. The transaction was complete, and the negotiations ended. The contract had been closed, and the rights of the parties fixed, for two months and more before the letter was written.</p>
