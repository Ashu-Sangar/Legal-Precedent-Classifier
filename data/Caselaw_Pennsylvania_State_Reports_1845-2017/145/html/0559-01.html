    <p class="summary" id="b579-12" data-blocks='[["BL_579.11",579,[140,1702,1163,549]]]'>“ 1. The annealing-box bottom, for the price of which the suit is brought, was ordered by the defendants’ manager, Mr. Goodsell. The order was written, but the instructions were oral and were given to Mr. Cochrane, who was then superintendent of the plaintiff’s works. He came and took the measure in person, and was told to make the bottom of the same material as those which had formerly been furnished by the plaintiff to the defendants. When the bottom was delivered, it was examined by Mr. Goodsell and deponent, and found to be unfit for the purpose for which it was intended, and of improper materials, and unlike those formerly furnished by the plaintiff.</p>

It is then removed and allowed to cool gradually; and the bottom must be of proper material to stand the expansion and contraction without cracking.</p>

Upon discovering the character of the material in this box bottom, deponent .notified Mr. Cochrane, the superintendent of plaintiff, who was present, that it was not right and that it would not be accepted. During the conversation with Mr. Cochrane, the men had allowed the bottom to drop from the car upon the ground, without deponent’s knowledge, and he immediately gave notice to Mr. Cochrane that the firm would not accept it, and it was there subject to their order.”</p>
