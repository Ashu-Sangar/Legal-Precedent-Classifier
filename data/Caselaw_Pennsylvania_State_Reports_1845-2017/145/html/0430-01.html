It is alleged that Hannah Springer, “ who assumed to act for all the parties,” insisted on having the forfeiture clause inserted in the lease, and that “ the oral explanation and agreement between the parties was, that a failure to perform any one of the covenants forfeited the lease immediately.” It will at once be observed that it is not asserted that Hannah Springer <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>was, in fact, the agent of the other lessors, or had any authority to act for them. Furthermore, she could not act for any one save herself, as her co-lessors were minors, and their contract, in effect, was made for them by the Orphans’ Court. It is not pretended that the court knew of any agreement except the one in writing. Again; the alleged oral agreement is, in reality, nothing more or less than the written forfeiture clause put in different words, and must therefore receive a like construction. It may be added that, so far as the affidavits of defence show, the defendant company, when it took an assignment of the written lease, knew nothing of the oral agreement, and therefore could not have been misled by it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b455-6" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[139,1097,1163,1009]]]'>3. To begin with, the third defence is too vaguely stated. The “ defendant’s agent ” calling on James Springer “ in relation to said lease,” is rather an indefinite sort of proceeding. Who was the defendant’s agent ? What was he authorized to do or say in relation to the lease ? Was James Springer visited in his capacity as guardian ? Was he still guardian of Arsula Springer, or had she arrived at full age ? These things are all left to surmise. Moreover, what he is alleged to have said may be more easily understood as a mere expression of opinion as to the legal status of the parties under the forfeiture clause, than as a declaration of forfeiture. It must be borne in mind, too, that even if James Springer could, as to his ward or wards, without leave of the Orphans’ Court, annul the contract, he could hardly do so without the consent of Hannah Springer, The subject matter of the contract is not divisible. Leaving out of view the effect of an actual exclusion of the defendant from the leased premises by one of the lessors, it may be doubted (but need not be decided) that a mere oral declaration of forfeiture, made by one lessor without the assent or contrary to the wish of the other or others, would suffice to annul the lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-7" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[140,2119,1161,83]]]'>4. The fourth defence is simply a general denial of liability, and hence need not be further considered.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-8" data-blocks='[["BL_455.7",455,[142,2220,1160,93]]]'>5. The fifth defence was held insufficient in Ray v. Nat. Gas Company, above cited.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-9" data-blocks='[["BL_455.8",455,[141,2323,1163,85]],["BL_456.1",456,[310,387,1160,552]]]'>6. The last matter of defence is contained in the allegation that “ soon ” after the lease was made it was “ discovered that <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the territory was worthless, for either oil or gas.” Here is another indefinite allegation. How soon was the discovery made ? “ Soon” is a relative term. The period it is intended to indicate is and can be known only to him who uses it. Does it in the present case mean weeks, months or years ? Certainly, so long as the existence of gas or oil in the premises was a matter of doubt, the lessors were entitled to have a test well drilled, or to receive the compensation agreed on for the delay. It is impossible to learn from the affidavit of defence when the discovery, therein alleged, was made. Therefore, this branch of the defence may be dismissed as too vague for consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[305,947,1164,897]]]'>I do not think, however, that the fact of there being no oil or gas in the land, no matter how soon found out, could avail the defendant. The lessors were entitled to insist that this fact should be made manifest in the very manner agreed upon, or to demand the sums stipulated to be paid for delay. The covenant on this subject is absolute and unqualified, and provides for the doing of nothing that is illegal or impossible. If a clear, positive covenant, like the one before us, to do a lawful thing or pay a certain sum of money for not doing it, can be evaded by showing that the performance of the act would not benefit the covenantee, it is hard to tell where we could properly stop in applying the rule. <em>We </em>might presently reach a point where an action for liquidated damages for breach of an agreement not to engage in a certain business within designated limits, might be defeated by proving that every one conducting the same business in the neighborhood had been losing money and, for reasons shown, would probably continue to do so.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[304,1860,1162,550]],["BL_457.1",457,[135,382,1171,1056]]]'>The rule adopted by this court in Holmes v. Nat. Gas Co., No. 123 June Term 1890, is not applicable here. In that case, the lessor was to be paid only for oil or gas actually found and used. While there was a covenant that the lessee should drill a second well, it was not stipulated that anything should be paid for failure to do so; hence, the only way in which the plaintiff could possibly prove any damages, was by showing that there was oil or gas in his land which could and would have been obtained and utilized by putting down another well. In the case at bar, however, the damages for delaying to drill are fixed and liquidated by the parties themselves in their <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>agreement. Only in this way, or by reserving a rent, can the landowner make himself sure of any compensation whatever, for allowing an oil or gas lease to become and remain an encumbrance on his property. Such an encumbrance may often prove a source of annoyance and loss, and notwithstanding provisions for forfeiture, is generally more easy to create than to get rid of. There was nothing morally or legally wrong in the lessors, here, insisting on a covenant which might, although in a manner not contemplated by the lessee, bring them some return for giving the lease. We must remember that everything in this covenant was intended for their benefit, and that therefore, they have a right to get what they can out of it. We are not justified in assuming that they did not, when the lease was made, look forward to the certain semi-annual gain that would result to them, if the lessee, despairing of finding either oil or gas, would elect to pay each and all of the sums to he paid for delay, rather than expend even a greater sum than their aggregate in drilling a well which would be useless to him. In brief, the lessors had a possibility of large profit if the well were put down, and a certainty of some profit if it were not.</p>
