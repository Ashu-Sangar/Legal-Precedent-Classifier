It was shown also, that in May, 1871, the plaintiff’s father called in a surveyor and had one half the farm run off; and that he subsequently made a deed therefor to the plaintiff, but never delivered it, and died in 1888 without having paid for the plaintiff’s services, either in money or land. On the part of the defendant, testimony was introduced tending to show that the plaintiff was intemperate; that he frequently became intoxicated and went away, remaining absent for months at a time,—in one instance for two years; and that when absent he worked for others, and on his return home worked for his father for wages, or on the shares.</p>

    <p id="b605-10" data-blocks='[["BL_605.9",605,[142,1184,1170,692]]]'>The single specification of error is that the learned judge refused to instruct the jury that “ on the whole evidence, the verdict must be for the defendant.” Without discussing the evidence in detail, it is sufficient to say there was ample to go to the jury. There was direct evidence of a contract between the plaintiff and his father, to the effect that, if the former would come home and work his father’s farm until the latter could get out of debt, he would compensate him with money or land; that the plaintiff fulfilled his part of the contract, and that his father had never so compensated him, either with money or land, although at one time he had the farm surveyed, and a portion of it run off for the plaintiff. There whs not only evidence enough to submit to the jury, but to sustain the verdict.</p>
