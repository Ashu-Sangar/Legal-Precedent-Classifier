    <p class="summary" id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[280,641,1163,893]]]'>At the trial on August 27, 1891, the case presented was to the effect that, on the morning of November 21,1890, between 1 and 2.80 A. M., three masked men entered the house of the prosecutor in Oil City, occupied by himself, his wife, and a niece, Miss Turk. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson occupied a bedroom on the second floor, connected with the room occupied by Miss Turk. Mrs. Anderson, being aroused by a noise made below, went down stairs without a light, when she was seized by one of the burglars. The other two entered the room occupied by Mr. Anderson, where the latter was attacked and beaten to insensibility. They then entered the room occupied by Miss Turk, who had also been aroused, had raised the window, and was screaming for help. She was seized, tied upon the bed, and the window blinds pulled down. Mrs. Anderson was then brought up from below and tied on the bed with her. The burglars ransacked the house, conversed with each other, obtained some plunder, and left. Afterwards, Mr. Anderson revived, and released Mrs. Anderson and Miss Turk.</p>

He was identified at the time of the burglary by his voice, flashes of light upon him from a dark lantern carried by one of the men, and in the moonlight, in Miss Turk’s room, before the blinds were pulled down. An alibi, however, was set up as a defence. The defendant testified, in substance, and adduced corroborative testimony, that, in company with Charles Miller, he was in Oil City until about 10 o’clock on the evening of November 20th, when he boarded a freight train and rode in a box ear to Corry, Pa., where he was, forty-nine miles from Oil City, at the hour of the burglary ; that he was seen at Corry at the time referred to ; that thence he went to Brocton, New York, on the same train, reaching Brocton between 6 and 7 in the morning. The theory of the commonwealth, however, with some evidence tending to support it, was that after the defendant boarded the <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>freight train, he jumped off and returned, staid awhile at a Mrs. Brown’s, until 11 o’clock as testified to by a witness named McComb, and left, afterward taking part in the burglary; that, after the burglary was committed, the parties got upon an express train passing through the city at 3 o’clock, and changed subsequently from the express to the freight train at Prospect, before reaching Brocton. There was also evidence that the defendant was not about Oil City for some time prior to November 20th, and that when he arrived at Brocton he went to Buffalo, thence to Chicago, and thence to Indianapolis, staying out of Pennsylvania until June following, when he was arrested on his return.</p>

An alibi is that a man <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>was not at the place where an offence was committed, at the time it is proven to have been done. The defendant asks you to find from the evidence that at that time, to wit, between one and two o’clock, he was on a freight train at or near Corry, some forty miles from the scene of the burglary. If that was true he ought not to be convicted. In this defence of an alibi, the burden of proof is upon the defendant. He must satisfy you from the weight of the evidence, which you deem credible, that his theory is the correct one, and that that defence is true. To be successful, it must cover the whole period of time within' which the offence might reasonably have been committed, and the witnesses by whom it is sought to be established must, in your opinion, be credible. So, if you so find, the prisoner should be acquitted. [But, upon the other hand, if you should find that this defence of an alibi, as claimed by the commonwealth, was false, and manufactured by the defence, it should go for nothing, and should have some weight against the defendant.] 8.....</p>

It is a recognized rule of law, that, so far as personal identity is concerned, it is possible for witnesses to be easily misled and mistaken; therefore, in considering the evidence of the witnesses on the part of the commonwealth, it is the duty of the jury to scan with great care and caution their opportunities for observation and identification; and if they were made in the dark, with only an occasional gleam from a dark lantern, under circumstances of fear, pain or suffering, and where the witness could only judge of the person from the size, and eyes, and a small part of the lower forehead, such state of facts would present a case where, giving the defendant the benefit of a reasonable doubt, it would or might be extremely dangerous to convict.</p>
