The general language of the first clause of the quoted portion, is subject to the exception contained in the second clause; and the two together will be read that he may appoint during the recess of the senate to vacancies by granting commissions which expire at the end of their next session, except in the case of certain enumerated officers, to wit, auditor general, state treasurer, secretary of internal affairs, and superintendent of public instruction, judicial offices, etc. If a vacancy happens in any of these offices in a recess, no vote of the senate is necessary, and no limitation is placed upon the commission, except in case of elective offices, in which case provision is made according as the vacancy happens within, or more than three months before the next election. The superintendent of public instruction not being an elective office and no limitation being placed upon ,the commission, the power is conferred, in case of a vacancy happening during a recess of the senate, to- appoint for the full vacancy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.7",258,[247,1944,1159,346]]]'>“ There is absolutely no power to fill for less than the period of such vacancy, nor can he make two appointments which in succession may fill such vacancy; the superintendent being irremovable at the pleasure of the governor, according to § 4, article YI. of the constitution. He can exercise the power of appointment to a vacancy but once, and then only for the full constitutional period.</p>

The earlier part of the section provides for the filling of appointive offices until the expiration of the next session of the senate. In the succeeding clause, one appointive office is expressly named, to which the appointment in case of vacancy is made to fill the vacancy without any limitation or restriction to a less period of time than would be covered by the full extent of the vacancy.

The second clause ordains: “He (the governor) shall have power to fill any vacancy that may happen during the recess of the senate in the office of.....superintendent of public instruction.” This gives absolute power to the governor to fill any vacancy in the office of superintendent of public instruction occurring during the recess of the senate, without limitation as to time. But the first clause ordains: “ He shall have power to fill all vacancies that may happen in offices to which he may appoint, during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session; ” thus limiting the time for which an appointment <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>made during the recess of the senate shall continue, in the same office of superintendent of public instruction, as it is an office to which “ he may appoint ” and is therefore included in the phrase “ all vacancies.”' If full force and effect be given to the language of the first clause, the term of an appointment to fill a vacancy made during the recess must be limited to the end of the next session ; while, if the second clause be taken literally and given full effect, the whole vacancy is to be filled. And if the second is not taken literally, it is, so far as the office of superintendent of public instruction is concerned, entirely superfluous and must be whofiy disregarded, as it does not add anything whatever to the provision made in the first clause for filling a vacancy in the office.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[260,1037,1165,752]]]'>It will be observed that all the offices mentioned in the second clause, except that of superintendent of public instruction, are elective offices; and it has been suggested that the office of superintendent of public instruction was inserted in the second clause, because, and at a time in the course of the proceedings in the constitutional convention when it was intended to make that office an elective office, and that the failure after-wards to strike it out was a mere inadvertence; and some color is given to this suggestion by the contents of the journal and the debates of the convention. [Be that as it may, it is there, and the question remains, whether it can be ignored ?

In answer to this position, and as tending to show that the power of appointment was in the governor alone, Merctje, C. J., delivering the opinion of the court, said:</p>

The facts in that case were that during the recess of the senate, the president, as he had the right to do, suspended a United States marshall named Osborn, and appointed one Strobach to fill the vacancy caused by this suspension until the end of the next session of the senate. After the senate met, he nominated Strobach for permanent appointment to the office, but the senate rejected the nomination. Thereupon, it was claimed on behalf of Osborn that this rejection annulled his suspension and the temporary appointment of Strobach, and therefore that he (Osborn) was entitled to retake possession of the office. But the court held that the nomination and rejection of Strobach by the senate, had no relation whatever to Stobach’s temporary appointment by virtue of which he was entitled to hold the office until the end of the current session of the senate. The court said: “ The statute authorizes the president to suspend and make a temporary.appointment until the end of the next session of the senate, and he has done so, Mr. Strobach being that appointee, and he holds the office now under such appointment. The senate has not acted upon that temporary appointment, nor does it ap<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>pear that the senate has any power or authority under existing law to act directly upon such temporary appointment or designation.”</p>

It plainly provides that the governor shall have the power to fill any vacancy which may happen in that office, for the full period of the vacancy.

The superintendent being made irremovable at the pleasure of the governor, by § 4, article VI. of the constitution, he can exercise the power of appointment to a vacancy but once, and then only for the full constitutional period.

If the construction contended for b3f the appellant were to prevail, it would follow that the senate could be deprived continuously of the exercise of its constitutional right to consent to or dissent from executive nominations for the office in question. The incumbent could resign and create a vacancy during a recess, and then his successor could be commissioned for four years, so that vacancies would thereafter regularly occur during recesses. The contention that the defendant can still hold his office, because the governor has commissioned Dr. Snyder whose nomination the senate previously refused to confirm, hardly admits of serious discussion.

He shall have power to fill any vacancy that may happen during the recess of the senate in the office of auditor general, state treasurer, secretary of internal affairs, or superintendent of public instruction, in a judicial office, or in any other elective office which he is or may be authorized to fill; if the vacancy shall happen during the session of the senate, the governor shall nominate to the senate before their final adjournment a proper person to fill said vacancy, but in any such case of vacancy in an elective -office a person <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>shall be chosen to said office at the next general election, unless the vacancy shall happen within three calendar months immediately preceding such election, in which case the election for said office shall be held at the second succeeding general election.”</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[160,638,1169,1216]]]'>This clause of the constitution is by no means clear. It will be noticed, however, that there are two classes of vacancies to be filled by appointment by the governor, viz., those that relate to elective offices, and those that are non-elective. In the former, the governor can only fill a vacancy until such time as the people can fill it by an election as provided by law. Hence the commission of the governor can run no further. In the other case, non-elective offices, no time is designated during which his appointee can hold, except the single provision that, if a vacancy shall occur during the recess of the senate, he shall be commissioned until the expiration of the next session. This simply means that his appointee to this class of offices shall be confirmed by the senate; otherwise his incumbency expires with its adjournment. But if confirmed, he is entitled to hold for the balance of the unexpired term. He appoints to fill the vacancy. What is the vacancy ? Clearly the term of office left' unfilled when not otherwise provided for. Governor Beaver exercised this power; he filled the vacancy occasioned by the death of Higbee, and his appointee having been confirmed by the senate, the respondent is in office by virtue of an appointment properly made under the constitution and laws of the state. The confirmation of respondent by the senate necessarily extends his original appointment for the balance of the unexpired term.</p>
