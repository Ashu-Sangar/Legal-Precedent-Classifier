The rule does not apply when the slayer is himself the attacking party.

I take it, then, that it is useless to consider that question further. But still, the great question presents itself, was there evidence to justify the jury in finding defendants guilty of murder of the first degree ? Assuming that Rusnok was at the riot, of which more hereafter, we have Toth, Sabol and Rusnok engaged in such acts of riotous violence as clearly shows a bold and determined attempt to execute a breach of the peace, in a tumultuous and dangerous manner, by such means and in a way that indicated a determination to use all the force necessary to compel those peaceably engaged in their usual occupation, to quit, work and leave the works.</p>

Upon this point I said to the jury: “ Each can be held only for his particular and individual purpose and intent to take life, which the jury must find established beyond a reasonable doubt. If there were evidence sufficiently establishing the fact that the rioters, including defendants, had combined together to engage in this riotous proceeding, with an understanding or agreement to overcome all opposers, to the extent of taking life if necessary to accomplish <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>their purpose, then they would all be held liable to have harbored an individual intent to take life.

The point was therefore refused, and attention called to the general charge upon the law involved in the point. To have affirmed it would have been to say to the jury that although defendants were all rioters and all committed acts of violence upon Quinn from some of which he died, they were all to be acquitted of felonious homicide, because the jury might not be clear as to which particular blow of one or the other caused his death.</p>

In this I think that there was no error, and I may add if there ever was a time in the history of this state when such a principle should be enforced it is now.
