The old lady was to be kept, and I think she was to have kept for her two cows and a few sheep, six maybe, or something like that. That is all I can recollect. There may have been other things in the agreement, but I can’t tell you what they were. Q. You don’t say that there were any others ?• A. No sir, I don’t say that there were any others. Q.

You have not seen that agreement from the time you wrote it ? A. I never have seen the inside of it, and never the outside but once that I recollect..... Q. Are you able to state positively that this agreement that Robert should have the farm was in that agreement or not ? A. Yes sir, I feel pretty positive on that. I have other things that impress that on my mind. I believe that was there. Unless I would see the agreement and see that it was not there, would be the only thing that would convince me that it was not there. Q. Then you might be mistaken? A. O, well, every man is liable to be mistaken, but I feel very sure that was there. The more I think about it the more impressed I am that it was there.....Q. You have stated that you were not sure whether it was in or out? A. Well, I have stated it just in that way, that of course it is possible for a man twenty years ago not to recollect perfectly, but I feel, as far as I can possibly recollect, I feel very positive that it is as I stated. Q. This is longer than twenty years isn’t it ? A. It is longer than twenty years; I can’t state how much over. Q. Haven’t you stated that you would not be positive whether this was in the agreement or outside of it; that you might be mistaken? A. Of course, I would say that much about it, that it is possible for a man to be deceived. It is possible, but I don’t think it is; I feel very sure that that was in the agreement. Q. Didn’t you say to Mr. James S. Munnell that you might be mistaken ; <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>that you might have got the idea from some other conversation ? A. Yes sir, and I say so to you now, that such a thing is possible, but nothing would convince me of it but seeing the paper and seeing it was not there; then I would say I was mistaken. Q. You made the remark, that Robert was to get the farm if he stayed? A. Yes. Well, that was the understanding. That was the understanding all the time, that he was to stay and do all the work on the farm. Q. Was that in the agreement? A. That was in the agreement. Q. Was there anything at all said, in the case he went away or left ? A. No sir, there was nothing said about that at all. .There was no provision for anything of that kind. The understanding was that he was to farm the place as long as the old man lived and on those terms. These bequests that I heard read here, I don’t recollect any of them. There may have been something of the kind. Q. Do you know whether there were any bequests in that agreement? A. I don’t recollect that there were. There might possibly have been, because that was the immaterial part of it to me. Q. You have no recollection that there were any bequests in it ? A. No sir, I have told you all that I can recollect that I think was there. There may have been some other things there. It is the principal points only that were left on my mind. It is so very many years ago that it is hard for a man to say positively, and the court will please to give me the advantage of that fact.”</p>

For specific performance in such cases, it is indispensable to prove, by the most clear and indisputable evidence, the precise terms of the agreement: Sage v.

He says : “ I never saw it after I wrote it, except the outside, just that once I gave it to him. I put it away, and never looked at it again. Never refreshed my memory, or pretended to, anything about it.” This, of course, bears only upon the credibility of the evidence as regards its probable accuracy, but it emphasizes the uncertainty of the testimony which follows. When asked to state the contents of the agreement, he answered: “ Well, it is so long ago that I can’t say that I can do so, only I will state to the best of my recollection, that is all; the details I cannot recollect. There are some things that I know, and some things that I do not recollect. What I recollect I will give, and what I don’t know or don’t recollect I wont give.

The old man was to provide the other half of the seed, and get the other half of the pasture ; and at the old man’s death,—provided it continued until that time, of course,—at the old man’s death Robert was to get the place. The old lady was to be kept, and I think she was <em>to </em>
      <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>have kept for her two cows- and a few sheep, six maybe, or something like that. That is all I can recollect. There may have been other things in the agreement, but I can’t tell you what they were. Q. You don’t say that there were any others? A. No, sir; I don’t say that there were any others. Q. That is the wh'ole of the agreement ? A. Yes, sir ; as far as my impression will serve me.” And then, upon cross-examination, he said, further: “ These bequests that I heard read here, I don’t recollect any of them. There may have been something of the kind. Q. Do you know whether there were any bequests in that agreement? A. I don’t recollect that there were. There might possibly have been, because that was the immaterial part of it to me. Q. You have no recollection that there were any bequests in it ? A.

    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[159,1241,1167,452]]]'>Upon this testimony, it is perfectly clear that the witness did not undertake to recall the whole of the agreement, only what he considered the principal points. This, by the settled rules of evidence, was insufficient. In Dennis v. Barber, 6 S. &amp; R. 420, an extract from a letter was held inadmissible, though the witness who made the copy, a member of the bar and counsel in the case, offered to prove that there was nothing else in the letter relative to the business in question. And to the same effect is Coxe v. England, <a href="/pa/65/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="65 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="430691" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0212-01">65 Pa. 212</a>, 223.</p>

The witness says, “ at the old man’s death,—provided that it continued until that time, of course,—at the old man’s death Robert was to get the place.” On the face of this testimony, it looks as if the proviso as to continuance till the old man’s death was an inference of the witness rather than a term of the contract, but, taking it as the latter, how can it be told with any certainty what was the present interest acquired by Robert? At most, it could be only an executory and inchoate equity, depending on fulfilment of the conditions during the father’s life. But suppose Robert died first, had he an interest that descended to his heirs, and could they step in and fill out the rest of the consideration, or did it lapse, and leave the old man free to contract <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>with another ? At the old man’s death Robert was to get the place. How was he to get it ? By will, by conveyance under order of court founded on this contract, or by an action like the present, on proof of performance of the consideration? Without more precise terms of the contract than the witness gives us, none of these questions can be answered except by conjecture. Again: “ The old lady was to be kept, and I think she was to have kept for her two cows and a few sheep, six maybe, or something like that.” How vague this is, and how important may be the “ other things ” which the witness says may have been in the agreement but he does not recollect, may be judged by the testimony of A. W. VanHorn, son of the plaintiff and called by him to prove performance, who testified that his grandfather told him the terms of the agreement, his father being present, and that “ there was four hundred and fifty dollars to go to my grandmother; it was what she had in the place;.....and Rachel was to get two hundred dollars, and the rest of them, Henry one hundred dollars, and Catharine one hundred dollars.”</p>
    <p id="b524-7" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[284,1340,1169,398]]]'>As already said, the contract rests upon the testimony of Burton. The corroborative testimony of Thompson and A. W. VanHorn, as to the existence of an agreement of some kind, adds nothing to the precision of its terms ; while that of A. W. VanHorn gives a convincing illustration of the radical deficiency of Burton’s. The defendants’ sixth point should have been affirmed, and a verdict directed in their favor. As this ends the case, it is not necessary to notice the other points.</p>
