L. 441, to build a turnpike road fifty feet in width. The company constructed its road over land adjacent to the city of Harrisburg, which afterwards became the property of the defendants, laying it across a small stream running through the land. Some years before the defendants purchased the property, a former owner built a dam across the stream, north of the turnpike, forming a pond used to obtain ice for the supply of residents of Harrisburg. The breast of the dam was fifteen feet from the edge of the road, and twenty-seven feet from the traveled portion thereof. The top of the embankment was 'eight feet above the level of the roadway, and about twelve to thirteen feet above the bottom of that part of the pond next to the dam breast. The road was separated from the ground lying between it and the dam by a fence. On the southern edge of the road stood an ice house, in which the ice gathered from the pond was stored.</p>

Under such license, they filled it up eight feet in front of their dam, so as to bring its surface to about or slightly above the level of the top of the embankment forming the dam. They also filled up the intervening space, so as to make a practically level surface over the whole distance between the traveled roadway and the top of the dam. In doing so, they removed the fence which had stood on the northern edge of the road, and this was not replaced. In making the fill in the road, they reduced its width upon the southern side, to the extent of the space occupied by the slope, and, in addition to this, by leaving a space fifteen to twenty feet in width between the bottom of the slope and the southern edge of the road. Upon that side of the fill made in the road, a fence was constructed. The defendants properly macadamized the surface of the roadway, as filled up by them, making a smooth and level wagon way twenty to twenty-five feet in width, along the northern edge of which, twenty-seven feet from the dam, stood a line of telegraph poles.</p>

He was appointed for the purpose of taking into his hands the income or earnings of the road, in order that it might be applied to the debts of the corporation. But he gave this permission, and we 'will assume that they were not, in the strict sense of the word at least, trespassers when they raised the grade, and that the obligation resting upon them was simply to do what they did do in a careful and prudent manner, without negligence. It is a question then for you, using your sound judgment, and applying it to the facts of the case as they have been developed in the testimony, and which no doubt are entirely clear and distinct in your recollection, so that it is not necessary for us to review them, to determine whether, as persons of ordinary prudence, care and judgment, it was the duty of these defendants to put any protection, between the road and the pond, in order to prevent an accident of this kind. If it was their duty, if failure to do it was negligence as defined to you, then they would be liable for the consequence of not doing it, and then you would have to determine whether the accident in this case was a consequence of their failure to do it.</p>

That, however, is not important in the case. As a matter of fact, the horse did frighten and he did run into this pond; and, as we have already said, you will have to consider whether the accident was occasioned by the defendants’ negligence. Use your judgment, then, on that point; apply it to the facts, and determine whether, under the circumstances of the case as appears from the evidence, it was negligence on the part of the defendants not to put some barrier or protection there. If you find that it was not negligence, <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>then, of course, there would be no recovery. In determining that point, you will have to consider the relative location of the road and the pond. To illustrate ; suppose that pond had been five hundred yards away; it might be very clear that, under those circumstances, they would not have been bound to put up any barrier. Suppose it had been two feet from the edge of the road, it might be easy to determine whether they ought or ought not to put up a barrier. In this case, I believe the testimony is that it was some fifteeen feet from the edge of the road, and some distance, twenty-seven feet, I believe, from the part of the road used as a driveway. You will have to take those distances into consideration, in determining whether it was negligent to fail to put any barrier in the way of a horse passing'from the road to the pond. You ought to consider in that connection, also the question as to the nature of the pond itself, whether it was dangerous, more or less, to get into it. The greater the danger to be apprehended from animals getting into it, the greater would be the necessity of guarding against it. The greater the danger to be guarded against, the greater degree of care is required of those who have any duty at all in the matter; and, therefore, you ought to consider how great the danger was, resulting from the conformation of the pond and the bank, etc.] 1 . . . .</p>

From these cases, it appears that the plaintiff could not recover against the turnpike company, unless the defect which caused his injury was in the highway, or so immediately contiguous to it as to render travel on the highway itself dangerous; or, at least, the place of danger must be in such proximity to the highway, as traveled, that the danger is practically the same as if it were contiguous.</p>

The distance was only one of the elements entering into the situation ; and in order to determine the question of negligence fairly, it was necessary to consider, also, all that was done by the defendants in changing -the grade, in narrowing the road, and in subsequently erecting a fence for the purpose of preventing such accidents as happened to the plaintiff.</p>

On the admitted facts of this case, the defendants would not have been liable merely as owners of the pond.

It is conceded that our cases hold the township authorities to a more exacting rule than obtains in some other states, but none of them go so far as to say that they must make the roads safe for runaway horses. The subject was carefully considered in the recent case of Jackson Tp. v.

If it was, then the plaintiff ought to recover, and the fright of her horse, the breaking of her wagon, and her inability to guide her frightened animal, should not stand in the way of her recovery. These circumstances do not confer on her any rights she would not have possessed without them, nor give her any higher claim on the care of the township officers. On the other hand, they do not take from her any right to which she, in common with other travelers, was entitled in the use of the highway. It is the condition of the highway, therefore, and not the succession of accidents that befell the plaintiff, to which the attention of the jury should have been held. Was the road on that day and at that place in a condition that made it a suitable and sufficient road for public travel conducted in the ordinary manner ? ”</p>

There was no defect in the roadbed. It was level, and safe for ordinary travel. The edge of the pond was fifteen feet outside the line of the turnpike, and twenty-seven feet from the traveled part of the road, which was to some extent separated and distinguished from the part adjoining the pond by a line of telegraph poles. The cause of the horse’s fright is unknown, but there was no evidence that it was from anything on or connected with the road or with the pond. Apart from the fright of the horse, there was nothing to show any danger to travel from the existence of the pond and the absence of a fence between it and the road. It is in this respect that the present differs from the line of cases of which Plymouth Tp. v. Graver, <a href="/pa/125/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="125 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="563945" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0024-01">125 Pa. 24</a>, is the exemplar.

The road, therefore, as it existed, contained the elements of danger to ordinary travel; and this court held that it was the duty of the township to anticipate and provide against such danger. The element of danger to ordinary travel is wanting in the present case; and therefore the jury should have been instructed that there was no sufficient evidence on which to hold the defendants liable.</p>

About fifteen years ago, the then owner of the land constructed an embankment or dam about eight feet high across the stream, on the northerly side of the turnpike and about fifteen feet therefrom, for the purpose of collecting the water, and thus forming an ice pond. On the south side of the road there was an ice house, and on the north a fence separating the road from the dam. While the embankment or dam remained thus about eight feet higher than the road, and separated from it by the fence, an accident, such as is the subject of this controversy, was practically impossible. In 1888, after defendants purchased the land, they obtained permission from the sequestrator of the turnpike company to raise the grade of the road at the point referred to, and in pursuance thereof they filled in about eight feet, turn-piked the new surface, constructed a culvert for the subterranean passage of the stream, and thus raised the road and their own land between it and the dam, to the level of the latter. The fence was of course removed. It was never rebuilt, nor was there any guard-rail put upon that side of the road. On the opposite side, the width of the road was somewhat contracted by the slope of the filling in, etc. In brief, the situation at the time of the accident was a somewhat narrower roadway <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>for travel; the ice pond, on defendants’ land, about fifteen feet from the turnpike, and nearly level therewith; and a line of telegraph poles, about twelve feet within the line of the road on same side.

His contention is that the cause of his injury was the negligence of the defendants, which consisted not so much in their removing the natural and artificial barriers by which travelers on the turnpike were previously protected, and in so changing the situation that they were exposed to danger, as in their o'1 fission to make any provision for guarding against the dangfcx that was created by their acts.</p>

It was further emphasized in the refusal to charge, as requested by defendants, that they “ were not bound to protect travelers from injury, by erecting a guard along or in front of said embankment ” or dam, and saying to the jury in <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>lieu thereof: “ It is your province and duty, under all the circumstances, to determine the question whether or not the defendants were bound to put up some protection.” If, under all the circumstances disclosed by the testimony, that question was one of fact for the jury, and not a question of law for the court, there was no error in the instructions complained of, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>

Under some circumstances, a higher degree of care is demanded than under others; and when the standard shifts with the circumstances, it is in its very nature incapable of being determined as matter of law, and must be submitted to the jury, to determine what it is, and whether it has been complied with. But when the standard is fixed, when the measure of duty is fixed by law, and is the same under all circumstances, its omission is negligence, and may be so declared by the court; and so, when there is such an obvious disregard of duty and safety as amounts to misconduct, the court may declare it to be negligence as matter of law.

The question is whether the dangerous place is in such close proximity to the highway, as traveled and used, as to render the use of it unsafe. The decision of such a question is most appropriately made by the submission of it to the practical judgment and experience of a jury, upon a consideration of all the proofs respecting it.”</p>

Whether, in consequence of the local changes made by defendants, the pond, of considerable depth, etc., formerly elevated about eight feet above the turnpike, but now on a level therewith, was dangerous, and if so, whether it was in such close proximity to the public road as to render travel thereon dangerous, etc., were, according to all well-considered authorities, questions of fact for the jury. If the changes referred to had been made by the turnpike company, and suit had been brought against it for neglect of duty in not providing a guard-rail or other suitable protection against danger, the same questions would have arisen. By permission of the sequestrator, the changes were made by defendants, for their own convenience and benefit, and it thereby became their duty to provide such protection as the changed condition required, if any. The affirmance of defendants’ third, fourth, and fifth points would have had the effect of taking the case from the jury, and holding as matter of law that the defendants, who, for their own convenience and benefit, raised the grade of the turnpike to the level of their pond, and left it in that dangerous condition, without providing any protection whatever as a substitute for the embankment and the fence which they removed, were not guilty of any negligence. This would have been a wide and dangerous departure from well-settled principles. The question of negligence, of which there was an abundance of evidence, was clearly for the jury.</p>
