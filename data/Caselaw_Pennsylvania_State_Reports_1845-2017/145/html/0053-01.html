The treasurer of defendant did not, before making said report, make any effort to learn what amount of said indebtedness, if any, was held by non-residents of Pennsylvania, although, by proper effort, he could in many instances have so learned; nor did he deduct any tax or amount from the interest due on any part of said indebtedness. The funds for the payment of the coupons thereof were deposited by defendant in the South<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>wark National Bank of Philadelphia, and the coupons which were the evidences of the interest due, were paid by said bank upon their presentation; and it was not instructed to make any inquiries, or to endeavor to ascertain from the persons presenting said coupons for payment, or in any other way, whether the owners and holders of the bonds from which said coupons were detached, were residents or non-residents of Pennsylvania. If such inquiry and efforts had been made, the residences of such owners and holders could, in many instances, have been ascertained. The whole amount of interest due upon said coupons was paid without any deduction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-4" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[174,933,1163,298]]]'>5. After the report upon which the settlement appealed from is based was made, it was ascertained by the defendant and proved on the trial, and we therefore find, that the fifteen thousand dollars of said indebtedness was, during the period included in said settlement, owned and held by Pennsylvania corporations.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[177,1240,1164,501]]]'>Defendant’s counsel contends that, on these facts, defendant is not liable to any tax, because it does not sufficiently appear that any of its indebtedness is due to or held by residents of Pennsylvania. We are unable to assent to this proposition. The treasurer is required by § 4 of the act of 1885, P. L. 194, to report, on oath, the amount of indebtedness of the corporation owned by residents of Pennsylvania, “ as nearly as the same can be ascertained,” “ to assess the tax on the nominal value of each and every evidence of debt,” and to deduct the tax from the interest paid thereon.</p>
