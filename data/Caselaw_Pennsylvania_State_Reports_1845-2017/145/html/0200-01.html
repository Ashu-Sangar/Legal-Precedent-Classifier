This section, however, was specifically repealed by § 36 of the revenue act of June 1, 1889, P.

It first appears in § 1 of the act of August 25, 1864, P. L. 988, in reference to the tonnage tax, in which it is declared that all companies shall pay the tax “ upon whose works freight may be transported, whether by such company or by individuals, and whether such company shall receive compensation for transportation, for transportation and toll, or shall receive tolls only.” What the legislature meant by “ tolls,” appears in a later sentence of the same section, which provides that “ corporations whose lines of improvement are used by others for the transportation of freight, and whose only earnings arise from tolls charged for such use, are authorized to add the tax hereby imposed to said tolls and collect the same therewith.” This is in accord with a definition of the same word given by the Supreme Court, in 1867, in Boyle v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Pa.%20314" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="54 Pa. 314">54 Pa. 314</a>: “ (Toll) is a tribute or custom paid for passage, not for carriage; always something taken for a liberty or privilege, not for a service; and such is the common understanding of the word.

L. 82, the tax upon gross receipts was first laid, and this was upon <em>all </em>receipts. In 1868, by § 7 of the act of May 1, 1868, P. L. 108, the tonnage tax was continued, the identical language above quoted from the act of 1864 being repeated; and by § 8 thereof the tax on gross receipts was also re-imposed. Both these taxes were repealed by § 11 of the act of April 24, 1874, P. L. 68, and the tonnage tax never has been revived. In 1877, the tax on gross receipts was again imposed by § 5 of the act of March 20, 1877, P. L. 6, but it was now restricted to receipts “ for tolls and transportation, telegraph business or express business; ” and in this form, also, it was laid by § 7 of the act of June 7,1879, P.

Its meaning there was so free from doubt that, as far as we know, no question was ever raised upon it, until the present defendant took the appeal above referred to, No. 141 January Term 1890. As already stated, it was then decided that the sums of money received by the defendant from the canal company and from the Buffalo, Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Railway Co., were receipts for tolls; and, as the facts now are in all respects similar, we will repeat that decision.

In our opinion, they are an expansion of the word “ transportation ” as used in the earlier statutes, and are only intended to embrace money received for carriage done by the particular corporation taxed. As may be <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>seen above, this is the clear meaning of receipts for “transportation ” in the former acts, just as “ toll ” denotes money received in respect of carriage done by some other agency; and thus these two words were broad enough to cover receipts from all actual carriage of every sort. Therefore, when one of these long-used words is deliberately given up, we think the clearly defined idea for which it stood must go also, unless it is otherwise plainly seen to be retained. Instead of this retention being evident, however, the probabilities are decidedly the other way; the only doubt arises from the use of a new phrase which has not yet been construed. Considering the legislative history above referred to, however, we regard this phrase as equivalent to the old word “transportation,” and as still meaning transportation done by the particular corporation taxed.</p>

L. 431, repealed § 7, act of 1879, and reenacted the tax upon transportation companies, limiting it, however, to the receipts of such companies “ from passengers and freight traffic transported wholly within this state.” This language shows conclusively that it was intended to tax only such receipts as, under the decisions cited, were lawfully taxable. If the act of 1889 does attempt to tax the receipts now in controversy, it is subject to the same constitutional objection that applied to the former act. With the exception of two items, aggregating 11,543.16, all the receipts now in controversy were derived from inter-state transportation. And, as to the excepted items, the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co. has already paid the tax. To make the New York, Lake Erie and Western R. Co. liable in respect of them, would be to impose double taxation upon the same receipts, which is never presumed to have been intended, and is actually prohibited by the last proviso to § 23, act of 1889.</p>

L. 431. The constitutional questions involved were very recently settled in a case arising under the act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112: Commonwealth v. Railroad Co., ante, 38.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[258,918,1171,1510]]]'>The commonwealth’s counsel contend that gross receipts “ from passengers and freight traffic ” is comprehensive enough to include what under previous legislation was taxed as tolls, and under that designation. The opinion of the court below contains a concise, but correct, history of the legislation on this subject. By the first section of the act of August 25, 1864, P. L. 988, a tonnage tax was imposed upon all companies, “ upon whose works freight may be transported, whether by such company or by individuals, and whether such company shall receive compensation for transportation, for transportation and tolls, or shall receive tolls only; ” and corporations whose lines were used by others for transportation of freight, and whose only earnings arose from tolls charged for such use, were authorized to add the tax thereby imposed to the tolls, and collect the same therewith. In 1866, by § 2 of the act of February 23d, P. L. 82, the tax upon gross receipts was first laid, and this was upon <em>all </em>receipts. In 1868, by § 7 of the act of May 1, P. L. 108, the tonnage tax was continued, the identical language above quoted from the act of 1864 being repeated ; and by § 8 the tax on gross receipts was also re-imposed. Both these taxes were repealed by § 11 of the act of April 24, 1874, P. L. 68; but it was now restricted to receipts “for tolls and transportation, telegraph business, or express business; ” and in this form also it was laid by § 7 of the act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112. But, by the twenty-third section of the act of 1889, the tax is. upon the gross receipts “received from passengers and freight traffic transported wholly within this state,” etc. It is certainly a matter of some significance, if it was intended to tax all sums received as tolls or rents, that these or other apt words were not employed to express that intention.</p>

      <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>It will be observed that in the case of railroads, etc., which are operated under a lease for a proportion of the gross receipts, the tax is imposed, not only upon the company leasing to, but upon the company leasing from another. The tax is imposed upon every railroad company, etc., owning, operating, or leasing to or from another. Both the lessors and the lessees, in such cases, are liable to this tax. The tax is upon the gross receipts received from passengers and’freight traffic, transportation, etc.; that is to say, transportation upon the railroad in question under the lease; the lessor and the lessee, being liable upon the amount of the gross receipts received by each, respectively, according to the contract of lease. Provision is therefore made in the last clause of the section that the taxes shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the agreement or lease, and that the commonwealth shall first look to the company operating the road, and, upon payment of the tax by that company, the company from which the said works are leased shall not be held liable, under this section, for any of the tax upon the portion of said receipts received by it as rental for the use of said works.</p>

The lessees, with the exception stated, are entitled to the entire gross receipts; the lessors receive nothing but the trackage, which is computed, not from the amount of the gross receipts, but at a certain rate per ton or per passenger. The trackage, therefore, is not a rent, for the lessors are themselves in possession of the road ; it is a toll paid for passage or for the privilege of using the way, not for carriage or transportation : Boyle v.
