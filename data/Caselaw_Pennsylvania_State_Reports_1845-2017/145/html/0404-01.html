The bridge company was empowered to erect a bridge over the same stream, at or near the mouth of Brady’s run, and were empowered to transport passengers, etc., and also to take and receive tolls.</p>

Said ferry was operated with a wire rope, and ran from about April 1st to December 15th in the years 1886 and 1887. In the winter months the ferry boat was laid up on the beach, and no ferrying was done, in consequence of the stream being frozen and gorged with ice. It is admitted, as charged in the bill, that the bridge company has commenced the erection of a bridge over Beaver creek, within the distance of five hundred feet of the said ferry, and that the terminal points of the bridge are almost identical with those of the ferry.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b427-7" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[196,1184,1165,504]]]'>Under these acts of assembly, the plaintiff company contends that it has an exclusive right to carry passengers, etc., across the Big Beaver creek, and take tolls for the same, within three thousand feet of the ferry buildings, and that the ferry charter is in the nature of a contract between the public and the corporation. This position cannot be maintained unless the ferry company can show a property in the line of travel at their ferry. The act of April 17, 1876, as above quoted, clearly intended to remove the restriction, as to distance, between incorporated ferries: Braddock Ferry Co.’s App., <a href="/pennyp/3/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Pennyp. 32" data-case-ids="220801" data-case-paths="/pennyp/3/0032-01">3 Penny. 32</a>.</p>

The act, under which the company derives its power, being a public grant, must be strictly construed. A corporation is strictly limited to the exercise of those powers which are specifically conferred on it: Commonwealth v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20351" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="27 Pa. 351">27 Pa. 351</a>. The ferry company, then, by this route possesses the right to maintain a ferry across the Big Beaver, operated with suitable boats, for the passage of the traveling public, and to receive tolls for the same. But tolls from whom ? From those alone that cross the ferry. This ferry company certainly has no right in the line of travel, because there can be no property in what one neither has in possession nor any right to reduce to possession. The plaintiff can compel no one to cross its ferry, and it has no property <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>in the tolls until they are deposited in the toll dish of the ferryman. How the erection of the defendant’s bridge, which in no way interferes with the ferry landings, changes no roads, or makes the approach to the ferry less easy, can be an invasion of plaintiff’s rights, the master cannot comprehend.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[268,635,1166,1105]]]'>The master is of the opinion that under the acts above quoted, as between a ferry and bridge there was no limit or restriction whatever as to distance, and that a bridge company might erect its bridge within any distance of a ferry company, without violating the act of 1874, or the rights of the ferry company, provided it did not interfere with the ferry landings or with the boat in crossing from one landing to another. The words “ bridge or ferry ” are connected by the disjunctive particle “ or,” and the legislature intended to compare each corporation with others of the same kind; bridge company with bridge company, and ferry with ferry. The act might be properly read: “No bridge company shall have the right to exercise its corporate franchises within three thousand feet of any other bridge company, and no ferry company shall exercise,” etc. This is a reasonable and natural construction of the language. The master is confirmed in this view from the fact that the act of March 14, 1876, extended to and affected “ bridges ” only; and the amendatory act of April 17, 1876, after introducing wharf companies, removes the restriction as between ferry companies only; the legislature evidently intending and considering bridges, ferries, and wharves as of a separate and distinct class.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[272,1749,1165,600]]]'>The plaintiff ferry company was incorporated after the passage of the act of April 17, 1876, and had notice that the exclusive feature of the act of 1874, limiting the distance to three thousand feet, was entirely abrogated as to ferries. It was also incorporated subsequent to the decision of the Braddock Ferry Co. case, made in 1882, in which it was held that the right to keep and maintain a public ferry belonged to every riparian owner: Braddock Ferry Co.’s App., <a href="/pennyp/3/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Pennyp. 32" data-case-ids="220801" data-case-paths="/pennyp/3/0032-01">3 Penny. 32</a>, and cases there cited. This ferry company may be just as much injured by other kinds of competition as by the bridge, and the objection to the erection of the bridge goes only to the kind or degree of competition.</p>

This is admitted in the. answer, and assumed in the argument. The ferry' company having no property in the tolls, except those collected, the loss is an incidental or consequential one ; and for such losses compensation has never been made in Pennsylvania : Shrunk v. Navigation Co., 14 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 71, 83. The old turnpike and canal companies were seriously affected by the creation of rival lines; and both were seriously crippled, if not ruined, by the incorporation and construction of railroads ; yet no claim was ever successfully made that they were entitled to compensation for the loss. It was the result of the growth of population and the demand for new modes of travel. Our own neighborhood affords a striking illustration in what manner one corporation may affect another. The Pittsb. &amp; L. E. railway was built at the west end of Fallston bridge, and greatly diverted the travel and traffic on said bridge, and also the travel through the town of Fallston. The travel was thrown on the east side of the Big Beaver creek, and the plaintiff’s ferry was created by and reaped the benefit of this state of things. But, neither the stockholders of the bridge, nor the property owners of Fallston, ever supposed that they had any remedy against either the railroad or the ferry company.</p>

The amendment to the old law is introduced by the words, “ Amend section thirty-one so as to read as follows.” This is equivalent to saying “ Section thirty-one shall hereafter read as follows, and not otherwise.” He who reads is told to look no further.

L. 73. By § 31 of that act, “ no bridge or ferry company shall have the right to exercise its corporate franchises within three thousand feet of any other bridge or ferry in actual use at the date of issuing letters patent to the new corporation; ” and by § 32 “ any ferry company .....shall have the right to erect and maintain a ferry.....subject to the rights óf prior occupants within three thousand feet of the point at which the proposed ferry is to be located.” It may well be doubted if these provisions were meant to apply except as between bridge company and bridge company, or ferry company and ferry company; but it is unnecessary to determine the exact construction of the lan<a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>guage of this clause, as the limitation of distance has, so far as respects the present case, been repealed.</p>
    <p id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[272,485,1164,859]]]'>The act of April 17, 1876, P. L. 30, is a supplement to the act of 1874, and § 7 reads, “ Amend section 31 so as to read as follows, namely; ” then giving the amended section, numbered 31, as if in its regular place in the act, introducing wharf companies, making some other changes, and entirely omitting the restriction as to other companies within three thousand feet. Then follows the re-enactment of § 32, as to the right of a ferry company to erect and maintain a ferry “ subject to the right of prior occupants,” but again with the significant omission of the words, “within three thousand feet of the point at which the proposed ferry is to be erected.” These new sections are substantial reconstructions of the old ones. They are complete in themselves, and leave no doubt whatever that they were intended as substitutes for the others which were thereby repealed. This was also the conclusion reached by the learned master in Braddock Ferry Co.’s App., approved by this court, <a href="/pennyp/3/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="3 Pennyp. 32" data-case-ids="220801" data-case-paths="/pennyp/3/0032-01">3 Penny. 32</a>.</p>
    <p id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[269,1350,1163,604]]]'>There was another supplement to the act of 1874 passed March 14, 1876, P. L. 6, which repealed the limitation of three thousand feet as to bridge companies under certain circumstances, and it is argued that this statute, which retained the limitation as to ferries, is still in force. But it is a conclusive answer, as well suggested by the learned judge below, that the act of March 14th had become a part of the act of 1874; and it was the latter, as thus amended, that was again amended by the act of April 17, 1876. In fact, it would seem that the legislature, having had its attention called to the inconveniences of the restriction as to bridges, concluded, when the subject again came before it, to repeal the restriction altogether.</p>

All its rights as the first or prior occupant of its ferry are preserved to it by the terms of that act, but they do not include any monopoly or exclusive right within three thousand feet, or any other prescribed distance ; and, this claim thus failing, there is no evidence that any of its rights have been infringed, or that the loss which it is likely to suffer is other than the inevitable result of business competition and improved facilities of public travel.</p>

      <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>The learned master finds that the appellant’s ferry “ was not in actual use at the time of granting letters patent to the bridge company, to wit, 11th February, 1888; ” but he also finds that it was operated during 1886 and 1887, from about April 1st to December 15th, and that in the winter months “ no ferrying was done in consequence of the stream being frozen and gorged with ice.” We could not concur with this conclusion. The temporary interruption in the winter by vis major would not be such a going out of actual use as to forfeit the company’s rights under the statute. This point does not affect the present case, and we notice it only to avoid the implication of approval, should it arise in a case where it would be material.</p>
