    <p id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[258,987,1164,1043]]]'>At the time of their alleged cancellation, these notes seem to have constituted the sole remaining estate in Mr. Iams’s possession, and if he then parted with them, he parted with his only independent means of support. That this defendant stood towards him in a special, confidential relation is not denied; and there was evidence which, if believed, would have justified the jury in finding that Mr. lams was in a condition of extreme weakness. In these circumstances, the alleged cancellation would naturally excite grave suspicions of undue influence exerted on the part of this defendant. Assuming the existence of such confidential relation and extreme weakness, at the time when the cancellation is alleged to have been made, the burden would have been upon defendant to show, not only that the transaction was “righteous and conscientious,” but that Mr. lams had acted “ intelligently, deliberately, and freely: ” Miskey’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="8858996" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0611-01">107 Pa. 611</a>.

Rice, <a href="/pa/127/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="127 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="565730" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0181-01">127 Pa. 181</a>. The defence was an alleged voluntary donation, and not a contract. There is no pretence that defendant gave a substantial consideration. From necessity, the plaintiffs must resort to sur<a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>rounding circumstances for evidence of undue influence, for it is obvious that it is rarely susceptible of direct proof; and the declarations of the alleged donor, when he was not subject to such influence, may have an important bearing on the question.</p>
