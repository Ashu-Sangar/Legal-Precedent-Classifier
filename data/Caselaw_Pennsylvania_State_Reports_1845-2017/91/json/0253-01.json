It is an acknowledgment that he has received full consideration. It is indeed most usual to execute such writings when no consideration has been received, and the sole object of the mortgage is to raise money by the sale of it. It would be in the highest degree inequitable to allow the mortgagor to set up that there was fraud in obtaining the mortgage, or in a misappropriation by the mortgagee of the money raised by the sale. It is unnecessary to say what would be the effect of actual fraud in procuring the \u201c no defence\u201d paper. In this case there was no evidence of such fraud.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Hutchison versus Gill.\n\"Where a mortgagor, at the same time that he executes a mortgage, delivers to the mortgagee a writing, certifying that he had no defence, he cannot set up, as against a purchaser of the mortgage, that there was fraud in obtaining the mortgage, or a misappropriation by the mortgagee of the money raised by the sale.\nOctober 9th 1879.\nBefore Sharswood, C. J., Merour, Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey and Sterrett, JJ. Green, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 2, of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term 1879, No. 73.\nScire facias sur municipal claim, by S. B. W. Gill, for use of Mrs. Eliza Lewis and William W- Lewis, against John Hutchison.\nThe defendant filed the following special pleas:\u2014\n\u201c That the mortgage sued on was given by him to the said Gill, as collateral security for the payment of defendant\u2019s \u2018 written obligation\u2019 to said Gill for $8000, and that the said written obligation is not in the possession, ownership or control of these equitable plaintiffs.\n\u201cAnd further, that the said \u2018written obligation,\u2019 and also the mortgage sued on in this case, were given to the said Gill to secure him for a loan which he was to make to this defendant, when required in the future, and this defendant has never yet required him to lend any money; and neither the said Gill, nor any person for him, has ever loaned any money to this defendant, or to any person for him, on account of the said \u2018written obligation,\u2019 or on account of the mortgage sued on.\u201d\nIt appeared on the trial that on February 5th 1877, Hutchison gave to Gill his promissory note for $8000, and to secure said note executed to Gill the mortgage in suit, on certain property in Allegheny City. He also delivered to Gill, at the same time, a bond and the following certificate of no defence:\u2014\n\u201cI, John Hutchison, hereby certify and acknowledge that a mortgage made by me to S. B. W. Gill, dated February 5th, A. D. 1877, for $8000, payable in two years, with interest payable semiannually, together with the bond of myself accompanying the same, is justly, fully and entirely owing and payable according to the terms and conditions thereof. And I hereby also further certify to' any person or persons who may desire to purchase the same, that I have no drawback, claim, set-off or other defence of any kind whatever to the payment of any part of Said mortgage, either principal, interest or commissions, when due and payable or collectible by the terms and conditions therein recited as aforesaid.\nWitness my hand and seal, this February 27th 1877.\nS. B. W. Gill [seal].\nAttest, W. A. Ridge.\u2019\"\nIt seems these instruments were given to Gill to enable him to raise money for Hutchison, when needed by the latter. While Hutchison admitted that his signature was attached to the certificate of no defence, he alleged that it was no part of the agreement between himself and Gill that he should execute such a paper; that he had no knowledge of ever having signed it, and that it was obtained from him by fraud. There was no direct evidence to show that a fraud had been practised upon him in obtaining the certificate. It appeared by the testimony of Hutchison that he received no consideration from Gill for these instruments; that they were given to Gill to raise funds to enable Hutchison to carry out a contract, but that Gill never gave him any money whatever therefor.\nBeing in possession of these three instruments, Gill, on February 27th 1877, sold the bond and mortgage to the equitable plaintiffs below, Mrs. Eliza Lewis and her son, W. W. Lewis, for the cash consideration of $7360, which they then paid Gill, who thereupon assigned them the bond and mortgage. The assignment of the mortgage was immediately entered upon the record.\nBefore the purchase was made or the money paid to Gill, he exhibited to W. W. Lewis, who was acting also for his mother, the certificate of no defence; and after the assignment was made of record, the certificate was delivered to Mr. Lewis.\nGill also negotiated the $8000'note in the Bank of Commerce of Pittsburgh, and in September 1877 absconded. The bank brought suit against Hutchison on the note and recovered judgment. Hutchison never received anything whatever from Gill for the note.\nThe court, White, J., affirmed the following points of plaintiff:\u2014\n1. That if the jury find from the evidence that at or immediately before the assignment of the mortgage in suit to the beneficial plaintiffs, W. W. Lewis paid therefor to Gill the amount of the mortgage, less the discount, and that at the time of such payment Gill had in his possession the mortgage and bond and \u201cno defence\u201d paper, and exhibited them to said Lewis, who, on the faith thereof, paid Gill the money, the equitable plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\n- 2. The defendant has failed successfully to impeach the \u201cno defence\u201d paper, as against the equitable plaintiffs.\nAnd further charged:\u2014\n\u201c I do not think the evidence is sufficient to justify the jury in finding the certificate of \u2018 no defence\u2019 was obtained from the defendant by fraud; and if the case was submitted to them on that question, and they so found, I should feel constrained to set aside their verdict.\u201d\nVerdict for plaintiff, and after judgment defendant took this writ, and alleged that the court erred in the refusal of the foregoing points and in charging as above.\nRobert Pollock and Thomas M. Marshall, for plaintiff in error.\n\u2014Hutchison asserted that his signature to the-bond and certificate of no defence was procured by Gill without his knowledge or\u2019 consent, and therefore it was a fraud on him, and should invalidate the instruments. The certificate was not competent evidence unless it was first invested with all the qualities that constituted it an estoppel. The proof of the signature of Hutchison to it was the first step in that direction. But the equitable plaintiffs must go a step further, and show that they relied on it and acted on it. They must show that by reason of the statements contained in it they were induced to pay to Gill the sum agreed on for the mortgage. Unless this certificate, and it alone, produced this force and effect on the mind of W. W. Lewis, the qualities of an estoppel were not imparted to it, and if not, it served no purpose in the trial of the issue, and was irrelevant: Bispham\u2019s Equity, sect. 291; State v. Laies, 52 Mo. 396; Weaver v. Lynch, 1 Casey 449; Eldred v. Hazlett, 9 Id. 307; Wilcox v. Howell, 44 N. Y. 398.\nM. W. Acheson, for defendants in error. \u2014\nThe mortgagor having given a certificate that he has no defence, is estopped from setting up a defence against an assignee: Ashton\u2019s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 153; McMullen v. Wenner, 16 S. & R. 18; Weaver v. Lynch, supra; Scott v. Sadler, 2 P. F. Smith 211. Accepting Hutchison\u2019s own testimony, the utmost that can he said is that he signed the paper without understanding its contents and without inquiry in respect thereto. But if this be so, upon what just principle can he throw the loss resulting from his misplaced confidence in his unfaithful agent upon the innocent assignees, who invested their money on the faith of the certificate ?\nWhere the fraud consists in the misapplication of the proceeds received for the paper, it will not affect it in the hands of the holder, as he is not in any manner bound to look to their application, nor responsible for a misappropriation of them: Gray\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. Bank of Kentucky, 5 Casey 365; Pennsylvania Railroad Co.\u2019s Appeal, 5 Norris 80. (See Robertson v. Hay, ante, p. 242.)\nOctober 20th 1879,"
