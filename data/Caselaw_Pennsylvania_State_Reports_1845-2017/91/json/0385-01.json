They evidently looked forward to legal proceedings on the note \u201c if not paid at maturity.\u201d One of these proceedings would be a claim for exemption, and another an inquisition to condemn real estate. What then did \u201cappeals\u201d mean? Evidently it could only mean appeals from an award of arbitration. Compulsory arbitration is so ordinary a step in the collection of debts, that it is plain the parties must have meant to agree that there should be no appeal from an award if one was made in the progress of the proceeding. We think that the agreement is clear and express within all the cases. The court below were therefore right in striking off the appeal. Order affirmed.",

On the 11th of November 1878, plaintiff moved the court to strike off and quash the appeal from the award of arbitrators, for the reason that \u201c the right of appeal was waived by defendants in note on which award was made, a copy of said note being filed along with declaration, according to rule of court, which has not been controverted by affidavit.\u201d\nThe court, Jenks, P.
