The Act of 13th June 1874, Pamph. L. 283, was intended to give effect to this constitutional provision. By that act an appeal is given to the Court of Common Pleas, to be taken “ within thirty days from the ascertainment of the damr ages or the filing a report thereof in court, pursuant to any general or special act, and not afterwards.” The 2d sect, of said act requires that the appeal shall be signed by the party taking the same, or his agent or attorney; and that it shall be accompanied by an affidavit that it was not intended for delay, &amp;c.

The question of notice is one of fact, and we may well presume the court below decided it correctly. In the tenth assignment, which refers to the supplemental report, the averment is made directly that in point of fact no notice was given by the viewers of the time and place of meeting to prepare their supplemental report. There was no necessity of giving notice as to that, and it is referred to merely to show that the omission of such an averment in the exception to the original report was not an accident.

If material, it should be cited in such manner as to be found without a search • through thirty volumes of the Pamphlet Laws; if not material, it should not be cited at all.
