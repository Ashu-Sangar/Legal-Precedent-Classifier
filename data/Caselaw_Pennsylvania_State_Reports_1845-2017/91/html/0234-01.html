The defendant entered no plea, but filed an affidavit of defence wherein he denied the lease and the occupancy of the premises. A compulsory arbitration was had, and it was mutually agreed that the arbitration “ shall be final and without exception or appeal.” The award was for defendant and it was duly entered. An action was subsequently brought for the second quarter’s rent on the same alleged lease, and defendant again denied the lease, or the occupancy of the premises, and pleaded in bar the award in the previous action. <em>Held, </em>that it was a good plea in bar.</p>

Danziger to recover the second quarter’s rent claimed to be due on an alleged parol lease. A suit had been previously brought against Danziger to recover the first quarter’s rent on this alleged parol lease. In that case the defendant entered no plea, but filed an affidavit of defence denying the agreement for a lease or the occupancy of the premises. A rule for arbitration was taken, and by an agreement filed the “arbitration shall be final without exception or appeal.” The award was for defendant, which was duly entered." See Williams <em>v. </em>Danziger, <em>ante </em>232. In this suit the defendant again denied the lease and occupancy of the premises, and pleaded in bar the former suit. The case was submitted, without a jury, to the court, Bailey, J., who refused to consider the testimony of one of the arbitrators called by defendant “ to show that the sole question tried by the arbitrators was as to the existence of the alleged lease and who declined also to consider the affidavit of defence in the former suit. And as a matter of law the court found that the plaintiff was not estopped by the award in the former suit, and entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant took this writ and assigned this action for error.</p>

    <p id="b235-8" data-blocks='[["BL_235.10",235,[137,1151,1162,215]]]'>The defendant pleaded in bar a former action between the same parties, in the same court (see preceding case), for which a prior quarter’s rent, under the same lease, had been demanded, and in which there was an award of arbitrators in his favor, unappealed from.</p>
    <p id="b235-9" data-blocks='[["BL_235.11",235,[137,1367,1162,343]]]'>A failure to recover one quarter’s rent would not necessarily preclude a recovery for a subsequent quarter. As an illustration, the defence of payment might be a good defence to an action for the first quarter, and yet fail as to the second. But if the first action was defeated exclusively upon a ground which denied the right of action, it would be a good plea in bar to a suit brought to recover subsequent rent under the same lease. No authorities are needed for so plain a proposition.</p>
    <p id="b235-10" data-blocks='[["BL_235.12",235,[135,1711,1164,377]]]'>We are of opinion that the defendant was entitled to. a judgment in his favor upon this plea. The record of the first suit shows that the only defence set up was that the defendant did not lease or occupy the premises, as claimed by the plaintiff. It is true, there was no plea filed; but there was an afiidavit of defence, in which this single ground of defence was taken. The affidavit is a part of the record, and is entitled to be considered when we examine the record of the first suit to ascertain just what was claimed and denied.</p>
    <p id="b235-11" data-blocks='[["BL_235.13",235,[135,2099,1163,258]]]'>The award having been in favor of the defendant, and no appeal therefrom, it becomes a judgment, and is as conclusive upon the parties as any other form of judgment.
