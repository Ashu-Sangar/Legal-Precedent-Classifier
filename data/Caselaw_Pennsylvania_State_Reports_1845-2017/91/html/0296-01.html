Ruple was a stair-builder; Amos Lewis was the proprietor of a planing-mill and lumber yard in the city of Pittsburgh; John C. Bindley was a builder and contractor. In June 1877, Bindley was erecting a building in Pittsburgh, and Ruple made a bid to Bindley to put up the stairs for him. Bindley agreed to accept his bid at $133, provided Ruple would allow credit .for $28.12, the amount of a hardware bill, which Ruple owed to England &amp; Bindley, balance to be paid when the stairs were finished. Ruple, not having the means to provide the materials and support himself while he was doing the job, applied to Amos Lewis to assist him. Lewis then agreed to furnish to Ruple the necessary materials and advance money, as the work proceeded, to the amount of $104.85, the balance of the contract price for the stairs, after deducting the England &amp; Bindley bill for hardware, which balance it was agreed should be paid to Lewis, and to secure Lewis an order was drawn up and signed by Ruple, in the following words, viz.:</p>

Jermyn’s name was not in the instrument; Leslie, the assignor, had no contract with him, was not then in -his employ, and, consequently, there was neither a present nor expectant fund on which the assignment could attach. On the trial, the point that <em>“ </em>an assignment can only be made of moneys due or owing, and not <em>in futuro </em>of moneys to be earned,” was refused, with answer that “a party is competent to assign wages to come due if the vested rights of third parties are in nowise prejudiced thereby;” and this court said there was no error in that.</p>
