It was in evidence that the dead horse had fallen on the street about twenty-four hours before the accident to Mrs. Eritsch, and that word had been sent to the board of health, mayor’s office and the fallmaster (an officer who is required to remove such carcasses), to notify them of this obstruction and nuisance, but that no attention was paid to the notification until several hours thereafter, when the dead animal was removed. Offensive and sickening odors had arisen from the carcass, and several horses had been frightened thereby, previous to the accident. The <em>narr. </em>did not allege notice to the authorities, but charged neglect of duty. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs’ testimony, the defendant moved for a nonsuit, which the court, Stowe, P. J., granted, and entered judgment for defendant. The court in banc subsequently refused <em>to </em>take off this nonsuit, when plaintiffs took this writ and assigned this action for error.</p>

There was no actual notice in this case. The street commissioner is the officer who has the general charge of streets in all cities. There was no notice to him. It is true that notice was left at the fallmaster’s house, with his son, about 6 o’clock on the evening of the 12th. The fallmaster is an officer whose duty it is to remove carcasses prejudicial to the public health. The owner Las twelve hours to remove the carcass; on his failure to do so, then the fallmaster removes the same within twelve hours thereafter, at the expense of the owner, or if unfit for use, at the expense of the city, upon the order of the health officer. The accident happened before the expiration of twenty-four hours from the time the horse fell. The horse had not laid on the street a sufficient length of time to charge the city with constructive notice, and make it in default for not removing it. To charge the city with constructive notice the obstruction must have been of such long duration as to be generally observable, and sufficient time allowed for its removal: McLaughlin <em>v. </em>Corry, 27 P.

    <p id="b228-7" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[214,1208,1166,993]]]'>In the present case, the obstruction complained of was not on a county road in a rural district, but in an avenue in a city, which, in population, ranks third in this Commonwealth. The subject-matter of -the obstruction was an undoubted nuisance. A horse fell and died in this public avenue, about nine o’clock on the morning of the 12th of August. The body was suffered to lie there through all of that midsummer day. One of the witnesses testifies, “ there was such a bad smell” that about nine o’clock in the evening, she sent to the mayor’s office to notify him. At eight or nine o’clock the next morning the carcass remained there, and the injury complained of occurred. That it was well calculated to frighten a horse being driven along the avenue, does not appear to be questioned. The same witness who testified as to the offensive odor says: “many men went back again; couldn’t go past; all the horses got frightened there.” The main ground of the defendant is, that the carcass had not remained there for such an unreasonable time as to create a presumption of negligence on the part of the city in not removing it, especially if not notified. It may be conceded that a dead animal might lie in a public street for so short a time, that it would be the duty of the court to say, as matter of law, the municipality was guilty of no implied negligence in not removing it. We do not, however, think the facts proven here present such a case.</p>
    <p id="b228-8" data-blocks='[["BL_228.7",228,[215,2198,1164,218]],["BL_229.1",229,[199,375,1169,694]]]'>Negligence is the absence of proper care, caution and diligence; of such care, caution and diligence, as under the circumstances, reasonable and ordinary prudence would require to be exercised. It may consist as well in not doing the thing which ought to be done, as in doing that which ought not to be done, when in either <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>case it has caused loss and damage to another: Turnpike Co. <em>v. </em>Rutter, 4 S. &amp; R. 6; Erie City <em>v. </em>Schwingle, 10 Harris 384; McCully <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20399" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="4 Wright 399">4 Wright 399</a>. Hence, in this case one question to be determined is, whether the municipality, acting through its officials, failed to exercise such reasonable care and diligence in not ascertaining the existence of this nuisance, and in not removing it prior to the injury sustained by the pláintiff. The evidence indicates this nuisance to have been lying in the immediate vicinity of several dwelling-houses. If this be so, it will be a fact for the jury to consider, as well as the extent of travel on the avenue. If it be one on which there is but little travel, and not compactly built upon, no such prompt duty to discover it would be imposed on the public officials as if it were in the heart of the city. Dense population and continuous travel on a street call for more care and watchfulness on the part of the authorities, than over streets not thus populated and used.</p>

    <p id="b229-7" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[199,1330,1170,390]]]'>The evidence discloses an active effort, by one living near the nuisance, to notify several officials on the afternoon and evening of the first day; but it appears to have been difficult to find any one to heed the complaint. The plaintiff was guilty of no negligence in not giving notice, for she had no knowledge of the nuisance until the moment at which she sustained the'injury. It is true the declaration does not aver notice to the defendant, which prudence may have dictated should have been done, and which may still be done by amendment; yet it does expressly charge negligence.</p>
