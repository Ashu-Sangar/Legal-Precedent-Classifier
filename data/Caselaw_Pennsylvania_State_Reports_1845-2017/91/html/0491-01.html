The exercise of this power is not forbidden in Pennsylvania, either by policy or statute, and the right to sue here becomes undoubted by the comity of nations, and especially by the comity of the states of the union. As well might the plaintiff in error contest the right of a citizen of Maine to recover a just debt as to attempt to avoid this mortgage. The morality of the one is as obnoxious as the other. “ One who has enjoyed the fruits of his contract with a corporation cannot set up that it was <em>ultra vires:" </em>Oil Creek &amp; Allegheny Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Transportation Co., 2 Norris 160.</p>

By the common law, alien friends could always sue, and there is no distinction in this respect between natural and artificial persons. Why, then, may not the performance of such a contract be secured by a mortgage as well as a judgment ? Both are merely liens. It is true that a mortgagee can bring ejectment and recover possession of the land. Should a foreign corporation resort to this remedy, or become the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, a different question would arise. But that even could not release the debt or destroy the validity of the title, except as against the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth indeed might enforce its claim by virtue of the Statutes of Mortmain: Leazure <em>v. </em>Hillegas, 7 S. &amp; R. 320; but the grantor or mortgagor could not set up that as a defence against his own conveyance or mortgage.</p>
