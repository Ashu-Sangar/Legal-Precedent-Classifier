A bill for an account filed by the widow of a deceased partner against the surviving partner of a firm, after setting forth a former partnership deed and its terms, averred that in the year 1867 the said partners commenced the jewelry business, investing therein $12,000 of the funds of said.partnership, and carried on the same, in like manner as the said former business until the death of the deceased partner. The defendant in his answer averred that there were no funds of said partnership to invest in the jewelry business ; that the purchase was made by the assignment of a bond and mortgage belonging to defendant’s brother, the deceased partner; that they agreed to enter into the partnership in the jewelry business, and as the deceased was blind and could not give any personal attention to the business, it was agreed that defendant should receive for his services thirty dollars per week, and that the profits, after the payment of all expenses, including said salary, should be equally divided; that said salary had been regularly drawn and no profits were ever taken out of the business by either partner. In a subsequent paragraph of the answer, the defendant further averred, “ I deny that I never accounted to the deceased for the assets of the partnership aforesaid. He was thoroughly well aware of,the disposition and appropriation that were made of the receipts of the sale of the former business and property and approved of the same. He was also aware that I was drawing $30 per week as compensation for my services as manager of the jewelry business, in addition to my share of the profits, and approved of my doing so.” <em>Seld, </em>that the answer was responsive to the bill.</p>

He conducted the business and had sole charge of the same, William Cresson being blind. In 1865 this business ceased, and during that year and the year 1866 Walter Cresson received from the sale of the saw factory, &amp;c., about $27,000, which he invested in various securities, among which -was a $12,000 mortgage. In October 1867, Walter Cresson purchased the stock in trade of a jewelry business of one Fries, and made use of the $12,000 mortgage to make the purchase. He and William then carried on the jewelry business under the name of Walter Cresson, until it was dissolved by the death of William, February 24th 1874. The capital originally invested in the jewelry business was $12,000. To this were added subsequently various sums, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $7658.91 (from which $362.42 were afterwards withdrawn), which were derived from the sales of other real estate made in 1871, and from the sales of some of the stocks before mentioned. The whole capital then in the jewelry business was $19,296.49. Walter Cresson kept the books of the concern. Among the entries in these books the firm is charged each week with a sum of money as paid to Walter Cresson. Aggregating these sums they are found to amount to $30 each week. For a large part of the time the entries are exactly $30 each week. There is nothing on the books to show what these entries are meant for; but they appear just like all the other entries of expenses charged; they amount in all to $11,093.10. No settlement of any kind was ever made of the partnership. The books were never examined by William Cresson nor by any one on his behalf in his lifetime. There was no agreement between the partners so far as disclosed by the testimony.</p>

In 1867, Walter Cresson bought $7000 additional bonds of the Susquehanna Canal Company, with funds of the partners or on joint account, thus making $13,000 in all. After’ William’s death he sold $5000 of these bonds. These were sold at 73. The balance, to wit, $8000, he claimed to account for at the same price, by either paying or assuming upon himself certain debts due by the partners.

It will not do for the defendant by an admission of a fact, or by making an allegation to place himself in the position he might occupy had the bill contained an assertion of that fact or made that allegation. The allegation of the bill that the jewelry business was carried on in like manner as the saw-manufacturing business did not refer to the terms of the. copartnership, or to the respective interest therein, but to the partnership itself, and the answer setting up a compensation to Walter Cresson was not responsive, and cannot be received. Nor is the answer responsive as showing an account or appropriation of the assets of the firm to the extent of $30 per week.

It involves the claim of the defendant to extra compensation, at the rate of $30 per week, during the continuance of the partnership in the jewelry business. It is true beyond all question, that each partner is bound to give his services to the firm without extra compensation, unless there be an express agreement to pay him for his services. This is well settled by authority: Story on Partnership, § 182. This being true, the next question is whether such an agreement existed in this copartnership. To determine this, we must ascertain the terms upon which this firm was established. There were no written articles.

This case was properly ruled upon the pleadings, and the point decided is fully sustained by the English and American cases; and I feel bound to follow it. It is due to the learned and accurate master to say, that Eaton’s Appeal was cited to him ; and I am without the aid of his views and analysis. Yet acting with the best light I can derive from the authorities, I am reluctantly constrained to receive the answer of the defendant .as responsive to the bill in this particular. I agree with the conclusions of the master as to amounts. I think the account he has stated equitable and just between the parties and most merciful to the defendant, whose varying attitudes are not suggestive of the highest rectitude in his dealings with his brother’s widow.

As William was blind, and could not give any personal attention to the business, it was agreed that I should receive for my services $30 per week, and that the profits remaining after payment of all expenses, including the said payment to myself, should be equally divided.

It is considered indeed as a test whether as a witness on examination he could be cross-examined as to the matter which he states in anticipation of his defence on a trial at law:’ Hoffman Ch. Rep. 185. Now whether this rule be unwise or wise (I refer to this testing criterion) it is the test adopted by our court of last resort, and we are bound to follow it; after all, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is the only safe rule for courts, especially those of inferior jurisdiction. But before adopting this as the controlling test, I have patiently examined the authorities, and I think the rule is sustained by unquestioned authority, though so broad an application of it has never been made until Eaton’s Appeal in this state. <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>Its first trace appears in Amb. 589.

The samé thing is true in Thompson <em>v. </em>Lambe, 7 Ves. 587, in which the first case is cited and the same doctrine declared. In 19 Vesey 582, the same doctrine is declared, where the answer was held to be only responsive in part, and the residue being rejected as in confession and avoidance. This is a case of great hardship to the defendant, but Sir William Grant, the Master of the Rolls, draws the line with a steady hand. Other English and American cases might be cited, but they are fully quoted in the principal case (Eaton’s Appeal).</p>

But in paragraph seven of the answer, it is alleged that the decedent <em>‘ </em>was also aware that I was drawing $80 per week as compensation for my services as manager in the jewelry business, in addition to my share of the profits, and approved of my doing so.’ This is a mere averment of a subsequent license, and not being part of the original contract but something subsequently alleged in avoidance of liability, is not responsive. Now- which is true Y If the former the answer must prevail. If the latter the master was right. Upon the proof as it stands, a chancellor cannot say. An answer possessing the weight which the practice in the equitable forum gives it is to be strictly construed. Where conflicting, contradictory, or evasive, it loses its force. In the last case upon the subject, Smith <em>v. </em>Spencer, New-bold’s Appeal, 2 Weekly Notes of Cases 472, it was ruled ‘ that where a party was permitted to testify, and does testify in compliance with his answer, it will not do to hold that his testimony shall be disregarded and his answer stand wholly unimpeached.’</p>

We do not contend that matter set up by way of confession and avoidance, can be held responsive; but simply that which is necessary to be stated, in full reply to what has been charged. It is the duty of the defendant, under the equity rules, to answer, not by a simple yes or no, but fully. The bill charged that the jewellery business was carried on “in a similar manner” to that of the saw-manufacturing, which had been conducted upon the terms of an equal division of the receipts. This was an averment as to the terms of the new partnership, and compelled the appellant to set up what they really were. If he had been silent, he would have admitted that the agreement was correctly averred in the bill. The law implies, from the fact of a contract to enter into a partnership, that there was an agreement that nothing should be received by either partner, as compensation for his services. In averring that a partnership was entered into, the complainant averred all that was therein implied, and it was the appellant’s duty to answer her, and to set up what the terms actually were: Hart <em>v. </em>Ten Eyck, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Johns.%20Ch.%2089" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Johns.

Was it no response to the bill to say that $11,000 had been accounted for in this way ? Did it lessen the force of .the averment to say that this had been approved of? It appeared, by this response, that in addition to the contemporaneous agreement, it was known to the decedent until his death, that it was being acted upon, and that he approved of such contract, acting thereunder. There is not in this any inconsistency or contradiction of the former averment of a contemporaneous agreement.</p>

    <p id="b178-9" data-blocks='[["BL_178.11",178,[234,1466,1166,638]]]'>_ This was a bill for an account filed against the surviving partner by the widow and administratrix of the deceased partner. The parties were two brothers, Walter Cresson, the appellant, and William Cresson, now deceased. Erom about the year 1850 until 1865, they carried on the business of manufacturing saws at Conshohocken, Montgomery county. This business was discontinued, and about the year 1867, they commenced the jewelry business in the city of Philadelphia. In both places it appears to have been carried on in the name of Walter Cresson. William was blind, and while he paid some attention to the business at Conshohocken, he gave it none whatever in Philadelphia. His visits to the jewelry store were infrequent. The most perfect confidence appears to have existed between the brothers. Walter kept the books, and William evidently had little, if any, knowledge of their contents.</p>
    <p id="b178-10" data-blocks='[["BL_178.12",178,[236,2111,1166,304]],["BL_179.1",179,[180,371,1170,1816]]]'>The main contention was whether Walter was entitled, upon the adjustment of their partnership accounts, to a credit of $&gt;30 per week as compensation over and above any share of the profits, for his services in attending to the jewelry business. This question is raised by the pleadings. There appears no written evidence of the partnership or of the terms upon which it was entered into. The bill, after setting forth the partnership in Conshohocken and <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>its termination, avers: “ That in the year 1867 the said partners commenced the jewellery business in the city of Philadelphia, investing therein $12,000 of the funds of said partnership, and carried the same on, in like manner as the said former business, till the decease of the said William Cresson as aforesaid.” To this general allegation of a partnership the appellant answered: “ There were no ‘funds of said partnership’ to be invested in the said jewelry business, for all were exhausted'in the purchases aforesaid. In October 1867, at the request of my brother, and with his approval, I purchased the stock in trade, &amp;c., of the jewelry business, which had been carried on by one John Fries, by assigning to him the bond and mortgage of Joseph Lea &amp; Co., for $12,000, belonging to my brother and myself. We then agreed to enter into a partnership for carrying on said business, at first as J. B. Powell &amp; Co., and afterwards under the.firm name of Walter Cresson. As William "was blind and could not give any personal attention to the business, it was agreed that I should receive for my services $80 per -week, and that the profits remaining after the payment of all expenses, including the said payment to myself, should be equally divided. Said salary has been regularly drawn by me. Neither my brother nor I have ever drawn out of the business any sums on account of profits.” In a subsequent paragraph (7) the defendant further answered: “ I deny that I never accounted to William Cresson for the assets of the partnerships aforesaid. He was ‘thoroughly well aware of the disposition and appropriation that was made of the receipts of the sale of the saw-manufacturing business and property, and approved of such disposition and appropriation. He was also aware that I was drawing $30 per week as compensation for my services as manager of the jewelry business, in addition to my share o.f the profits, and approved of my doing so.” And in a supplemental answmr the defendant further said: “ The agreement between my brother William and myself, by which I was to receive out of the partnership fund before division of profits and losses, the sum of $80 per week as compensation for my services, was contemporaneous with the commencement of the partnership and its operations. My allusion in my answer to my brother’s approval of my drawing of that sum per week was merely to state that in the explanation of our affairs, which from time to time I gave, the deduction of that sum was known and approved by him. I did not mean that such approval was by way of any new agreement, for the agreement was made, as I have stated, at the begining of the partnership operations in the jewelry business.”</p>

This is the turning point of the case. If the answer is responsive, it must stand until overthrown by the testimony of two witnesses, or of one witness with corroborating circumstances. The court below reversed the master upon this point, and held the answer to be responsive. In this the learned judge was right. The case comes within the principle of Eaton’s Appeal, 16 P. F. Smith 483, where this subject was fully discussed, by the present chief justice, and the authorities referred to. It was attempted, however, to distinguish this case from Eaton’s Appeal, upon the ground that in the latter the interest of the parties in .the partnership was set forth in the bill, and that therefore an averment in the answer of one of the defendants, that he had four-ninths interest instead of three-ninths, as alleged by plaintiffs, was responsive. This is a distinction without a difference. In Eaton’s Appeal the bill charged a partnership between three, and that their interests were equal. Here the bill avers generally a partnership between two. The effect of this averment, if established, is to make them equal partners, for the law presumes that a partnership is for the equal benefit of all concerned, until the contrary appears. So that the legal effect of the bill is the same as if it had charged that the partners were to share the profits equally. Under such circumstances it would be an inequitable rule that would prevent the defendants denying the equality of the partnership, and yet compel him to admit the partnership itself.</p>
    <p id="b180-6" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[214,1499,1166,902]]]'>While the learned judge held the answer to be responsive, he also ruled that it was guilty of duplicity, because of that portion of paragraph'7, which avers, that the decedent “was also aware that I was drawing $30 per week, as compensation for my services as manager in the jewelry business, in addition to my share of the profits, and approved of my doing sothat this is an averment of a subsequent license, not part of the original contract, but something subsequently alleged in avoidance of liability, and therefore not responsive. In this the learned judge fell into error. The answer avers with sufficient distinctness that the agreement for the additional compensation was a part of the originalmontract of partnership. If any doubt existed upon this point it is removed by the supplemental answer which asserts it unequivocally. If then the agreement for compensation was a part of the original contract, the averment in the answer that the defendant had, from the day of its formation, drawn the amount thereof with the knowledge and approval of the plaintiff, furnishes no room for the allegation that it was setting up a subsequent license to draw the $30 per week; a new contract inconsistent with that already alleged. It is not duplicity to allege that the contract for compensation set up in the answer had been carried out' by the parties.</p>

      <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>The answer being responsive and not open to the charge of duplicity, was there sufficient testimony in the case to overcome it ? That is to say, was there the testimony of two witnesses for the plaintiff upon this point, or the testimony of one witness with corroborating circumstances? The master concedes there is no countervailing testimony as to the agreement for compensation, and that it would be conclusive upon the point were the answer entirely consistent. I quote from his report: “ But inasmuch as the answer, while averring an agreement, also avers a license or permission on the part of the now deceased partner, by which the compensation in question was drawn by the defendant in this case, the whole matter has been referred back in order to determine which of these conflicting statements is correct.” The master thereupon proceeded to consider the case and took some additional testimony. As a result he finds that the answer is overcome by the other proofs in the case, and his finding was confirmed by the court below. Herein was error. The finding of the master was without testimony to support it. His report admits, as before stated, that there is “ no countervailing testimony as to the agreement for compensation.” His conclusions are merely deductions from certain facts in the cause, and whether accurate or not, lack the essential aid of another witness. The facts to which the master refers might, in case his deductions from them are correct, be valuable as corroborating circumstances, but as independent proof they are not sufficient. The master deduces his opinion that there was no agreement for compensation as set forth in the answer, from the following: 1. That Walter Cresson was entirely ignorant of the jewelry business, and that as a practical man had to be employed, Walter’s services could not have been worth the large sum demanded for them. 2. That the knowledge of William Cresson’s membership in the firm, and of said alleged agreement between the brothers, was withheld from Mr. Powell, who appears to have been interested in the business for a short period at its commencement; and 3. That Walter Cresson had given instructions to Powell to withhold from William any knowledge of the business in case he asked about it. “ These facts,” says the master, “together with the inconsistency of the answer which has been already referred to, force the conclusion that there was no such agreement ever made as that averred in the answer.” Had the existence of the agreement been denied by a competent witness, the matters upon which the master relies might, if his deductions from the facts are sound, have been sufficient to overcome the answer. But no witness has said there was not such an agreement. That Mr. Powell did not know of it is no more remarkable than is the fact that he did not know that Walter and William were partners.</p>
