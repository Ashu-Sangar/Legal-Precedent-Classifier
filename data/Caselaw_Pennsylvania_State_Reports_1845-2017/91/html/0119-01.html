    <p class="summary" id="b121-6" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[168,442,1170,1125]]]'>“ I think a correct statement of the law on the facts found to be this: the bond was a contingent liability, but notwithstanding there was no suit to fix the executor with a <em>devastavit </em>and it was not judicially ascertained that the assets were no longer to be reached by an execution (Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Evans, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20439" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts 439">1 Watts 439</a>), yet when the Orphans’ Court, on the 5th of August 1873, approved the sixteenth account which distributed the sum of $2000 to the legatees, awarding a definite sum to each of them, thereby fixing the amount of the executor’s personal responsibility, that was all that was necessary as a pre-requisite to a suit on the bond. For such is our law, and since it does not appear in evidence what the law of Maryland is, I am to assume that it is the same as our own. See Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Stub, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20157" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Jones 157">1 Jones 157</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wenrick, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20161" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Watts 161">8 Watts 161</a>. A judgment or decree against the principal will authorize an action against the surety on the bond; nothing more is needed. And where the right of the legatee to demand payment from the executer is determined by due course of law, then it becomes an <em>absolute </em>debt, for which the surety is <em>liable </em>on his bond. Furthermore, here the executor resided in Pennsylvania, and suit would lie on the bond against the surety without previous recourse to the principal: Commonwealth <em>y. </em>Wenwick, <em>supra. </em>Smith and Kausler, the sureties on Harry’s bond, were therefore liable to suit on the bond, at the instance of the legatees, for the sums due them on this distribution, immediately on the passing of the sixteenth account. And the observations are correct with regard to the seventeenth account.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The payments by Kausler therefore were not voluntary in the sense that they were made before the debt became an absolute one, and before the sureties became liable to suit on the bond.

For the mortgage is an instrument of mere indemnity to save the sureties harmless, not from <em>liability </em>on account of their suretyship, but from ‘ any and all loss, cost, damage and expense’ by reason thereof. Now although, as I have shown, the sureties were <em>liable </em>at the time of the payment by Kausler, to be called on and compelled to pay, yet it did not appear with legal certainty that they would be called on, in the absence of any demand by those entitled to compel payment; for <em>non constat </em>that such demand would ever be made, and if not there would be no loss or damage.

That decree established the executor’s personal responsibility and it was his duty to make immediate payment.

Both on its face and in its circumstances it was a security to the sureties against “all loss, cost, damage and expense which they could or might be put to by reason of their being sureties on said bond.” Upon the executor’s default in complying with the said decree, they could have been put to damage and expense; they were legally bound to pay the debt, and had a right to discharge it and avail themselves of the security. The mortgagor has no color of defence. Was not that recorded mortgage notice to a subsequent purchaser or creditor ? He could see that the land was pledged to save harmless the sureties on an executor’s bond fully recited in the mortgage. He is presumed to have known the extent of their liability, and that, upon the executor’s default, it would become the sureties’ duty to pay the money according to the adjudication of the Orphans’ Court.

Crippen, deceased, dated on or about the 3d day of March 1840, the said Crippen giving the said Thompson notice of any proceedings át law <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>oi' otherwise thereon.” That bond was to pay the debts of Crippen, Sr., the plaintiff’s father. After it was given and before the defendants gave their bond, the plaintiff agreed with Dayton to pay him a debt owing by the father, making himself directly liable for it and thereby precluding all examination and defence as to that debt. The court, in the opinion, said: “ The question in this case, as we shall see, is -whether the plaintiff can pay the debt of his father, voluntarily and without notice, and then recover upon the bond, against him and his surety?” It was held he could not. Here the mortgagor was the principal debtor, had his day in court, with opportunity to test the legality of the claim ; and after final decree and his default, his sureties, the mortgagees, actually paid the debt, before commencing proceedings on the mortgage. The doctrine in Crippen <em>v. </em>Thompson, if sound, does not apply.</p>
