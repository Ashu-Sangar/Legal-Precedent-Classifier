Cummings for $1360, and issued this attachment-execution against several judgments in defendant’s favor, which were entered upon the docket as follows: A. S. Cummings, agent, <em>v. </em>H. &amp; S.

At the trial, before junkin, P. J., the defendants offered to prove by Mrs. Cummings that her husband had loaned <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>money .to the Troutmans, as her agent, that the money belonged to her, and that these judgments were given therefor. Also, to prove that she had a large sum of money, which was her eparate estate, and that it had been invested by her husband, as her agent. The court overruled the objections to both of these offers and admitted the evidence. The court left it to the jury to determine what was the amonnt of Mrs. Cummings’s separate estate, and whether it had been invested by her husband as her agent. The verdict was for defendants, and after judgment plaintiff took this writ and alleged, inter alia, that the court erred in admitting the above evidence and in submitting the foregoing questions to the jury.</p>

We find nothing of which the plaintiff in error has any just ground to complain. That the married woman had a separate estate was not seriously denied. The only question was, whether it had been invested by her husband as her agent, in the obligations attached. This question was fairly submitted to the jury by the learned court below, upon the evidence, and upon no established principle of law could it have been taken from them.</p>
