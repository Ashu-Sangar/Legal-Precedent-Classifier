The defendants claim a part of it to be applied in part payment of their assessments.” We do not question the verity of these statements — the plaintiff excepted and assigns them for error — the misfortune is, they are not of record, and there is nothing by which to amend. The record shows an active resistance by the plaintiff, the city, and the assent of nobody, except the defendant. The Act of 1864, which authorizes the councils to improve the streets and assess the costs of improvements upon lot owners, gives no specific property in the assessments to contractors. They are paid by the city; assessments are paid into the city treasury, as are other taxes. In no sense does the statute make the city a stakeholder of uncollected, assessments and taxes, nor is it apparent that one who does work for the city has a right to assign the whole or any part of an unpaid assessment. Whether the city is legally bound to pay assignments of parts of money due a contractor, is a question not now before us. Appeals of Philadelphia, 5 Norris 179. But if the city was a mere stakeholder of the money sued for, and the claimants were in court and heard, the records should support the procedure. When equitable claims are adjudicated they should appear in some form, in the pleadings.</p>
