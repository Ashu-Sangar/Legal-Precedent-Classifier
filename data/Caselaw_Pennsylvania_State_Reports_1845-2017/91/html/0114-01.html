In that case, money had been paid and a note given to procure the reconveyance of land, the title to which had been vested in a stranger by the wrongful act of an agent. After stating that the defendant was forced to pay his faithless agent money and give him the note in suit, in order to procure a transfer to himself of what was in reality his own, the court proceeded to say: “Neither the payment of the cash nor the giving of the note was voluntary, but both were extorted from the defendant and come within that class of cases in which money illegally claimed and paid has been recovered back, where goods, deeds, or papers have been wrongfully detained until the money has been paid.”</p>

Smith 486, it is said that in civil cases, the rule as to duress <em>per minas </em>has a broader application at the present day than formerly. Where a party has the property of another in his power, so as to enable him to exert his control over it to the prejudice of the owner, a threat to use this control may be in the nature of the common-law <em>duress per </em>minas, and enable the person threatened with this pernicious control to avoid a bond or note obtained without consideration, by means of such threats. The constraint that takes away free agency and destroys the power of withholding assent to a contract must be one that is imminent and without immediate means of protection, and such as would operate on the mind of a person of reasonable firmness. As it is expressed in Astley <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 1 Strange 915, the rule <em>voluntó non fit injuria </em>is applied only “ where the party had his freedom of exercising his will.” The same general principle is also recognised in Colwell <em>v. </em>Peden, <a href="/watts/3/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 327" data-case-ids="1841263" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0327-01">3 Watts 327</a>; Foshay <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 5 Hill (N.

    <p id="b118-7" data-blocks='[["BL_118.6",118,[215,742,1165,690]]]'>Standing alone the testimony proposed in this offer was insufficient to show an involuntary payment, and there was, therefore, no error in excluding it; but we think the learned judge was not quite accurate in saying that the defendant, by virtue of the sheriff’s sale had acquired no special property in the deed. In a certain sense this may be true, but in another it is not strictly so. He had an interest in the deed. It was an important link in the chain of the title which he was defending in the action of ejectment. This interest is recognised by the Act of 1863, which provides a mode in which, after six months’ notice, he might have compelled Weidensaul to either record the deed or deliver it to him. As an instrument of evidence, he was deeply interested in the preservation and production of the deed. Without it, he might have failed to procure such secondary evidence as would enable him to successfully defend his title to the undivided moiety of the property in dispute.</p>

The learned judge in excluding the testimony assigns as a reason therefor that there was no offer to prove that the plaintiff threatened to destroy the deed as an instrument of evidence if he was not paid the money. As Ave understand the offer, this was substantially what the defendant proposed to prove. If he was prepared to show that the plaintiff in express terms, or by reasonable implication, threatened to destroy the deed, or otherwise deprive him of the use of it as an instrument of evidence, he should have been permitted to do so. Of course, it was impossible for the court to know whether the defendant was prepared to sustain his offer or not, but when he proposed to prove among other things that he paid the money “not voluntarily, but under <em>duress minas </em>of withholding and destroying the evidence,” it Avas bound to assume that the offer was made in good faith. Nor was it necessary to show that the hopes and fears of the defendant Avere communicated to the plaintiff. If the latter acted as it is claimed he did, the natural inference would be that he intended to operate on the mind of defendant, and so excite his fears and apprehensions as to insure the accomplishment of his purpose, whether that was to obtain the money as the naked price of preserving the deed and <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>permitting defendant to use it in defending Ms title, or as compensation, so called, for professional services coupled with permission to use the deed.</p>
