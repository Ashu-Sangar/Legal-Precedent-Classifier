They are not contemporaneous in date or in fact. The <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>deed does not refer to tbe obligation. Although the obligation is given in consideration of a contemplated marriage, or at least recites the expectation of marriage in the preamble to the condition, it makes no conveyance of real estate, which indeed Frederick Morgenthal did not then own, nor does it purport to provide for the conveyance of any real estate to Margaret Morgenthal after his death. It speaks only of ‘ money’ which she is to receive after his death, should certain conditions then exist, from his heirs, executors or administrators, and it is possible that her right then to receive that would depend upon whether or not there were anything left after the payment of his debts. The plaintiffs could not recover under paper A alone. In fact they gave paper B in evidence; it was essential to the maintenance of their case; and I apprehend that it must be construed by its own terms, without reference or regard to any <em>independent </em>instrument.</p>

The deed may have created an estate in trust for Frederick Morgenthal for life, as he paid the consideration, and the limitations to Margaret, the children, and Elizabeth Wire, are expressed to be to them and their heirs for ever after his decease. Had the declaration in trust stopped with the clause, ‘ to the use and benefit of Margaret Morgenthal and her heirs for ever,’ it would have created a fee-simple in her. These words are followed immediately by- the clause, ‘ that is, the children, if any, begotten by Frederick Morgenthal, and her daughter, Elizabeth Wire, is to be made equal.’ The <em>habendum </em>expresses it, ‘for the use and benefit of the said Margaret Morgenthal, and her daughter, Elizabeth Wire, and the children begotten by Frederick Morgenthal, if any, upon the body of the said Margaret Morgenthal, his wife,’ which it declares to be ‘the trust aforesaid.’ In Wager <em>v. </em>Wager, 1 S. &amp; R. 373, the words ‘heirs and children’ were used together, and the estate was decided to be an estate for life in the parents, and a vested remainder in fee in the children born at time of the execution of the deed, which opened to let in after-born children, as their births respectively took place. In this case there were no children born to Frederick Morgenthal and Margaret his wife, at the time of the execution of the deed; but Elizabeth Wire was born and living, and being ‘ made equal,’ in the language of the deed, the result would be the same as in Wager <em>v. </em>Wager. In that case, however, the limitation was by the <em>habendum, </em>to Philip Wager and <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>Hannah, his wife, during the term of their joint lives and the life of the survivors of them, and from and immediately after the decease of the survivors of them, to and for the use, benefit and behoof of the legally begotten heirs of Hannah, &amp;c. There is no such <em>express </em>1'imitation for life to Margaret Morgenthal in the deed in this case. What is then the effect of ‘ the very general terms,’ which do not ‘ very clearly express’ whether she should take the whole during her life, or jointly with the children? The word children in a deed is a word of purchase, and ordinarily indicates the commencement of a new line of succession. Its use limits the meaning of the word ‘heirs,’ and it comes in as a <em>desiynatio personarum </em>— as the grantor’s definition of what he means by heirs; and as the late Chief Justice Woodward asked in Huss <em>v. </em>Stephens, 1 P. F. Smith 288-9, ‘ where is there room to doubt either upon reason or authority, that we ought to construe heirs a word of purchase, and thus serve the intent?’ In Coursey <em>v. </em>Davis, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%2025" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Wright 25">10 Wright 25</a>, the limitation in the deed was to ‘ Mildred Ann Davis and her children exclusively, and their heirs and assigns.’ The Supreme Court said that ‘ the rule in Wild’s Case, by which lands are devised to a person and his children, and he has no child at the time of the devise, the parent takes an estate tail, has no application to the present case (Coursey <em>v. </em>Davis), in which there was a child or children of the mother living at the time of the execution of the deed. The word children is therefore not a word of limitation but of purchase, and the question is what is the estate taken by the mother and children respectively ? ’ In this case I apprehend that the fact that Elizabeth Wire, a daughter of Margaret Morgenthal, was living at the time of the date of the conveyance, and was ‘ to be made equal’ — that is, as I understand the untechnical term to be, treated and regarded as if she was a child of Frederick and Margaret — has the same effect as the fact that Mrs. Davis had children living at the execution of the deed in Coursey <em>v. </em>Davis, had in tha case, in which Mrs. Davis was decided to have a life-estate, with remainder to her children as a class. The cases of White <em>v. </em>Williamson, <a href="/grant/2/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Grant 249" data-case-ids="227688" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0249-01">2 Grant 249</a>; Cote <em>v. </em>Von Bonnhorst, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20243" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Wright 243">5 Wright 243</a>; Curtis <em>v. </em>Longstreth, 8 <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20243" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Wright 243">Id. 297</a>, and List <em>v. </em>Rodney, 2 Norris 483, support the same view; and Shirlock <em>v. </em>Shirlock, 5 Barr 367, which would indicate that Margaret Morgenthal might have taken an estate in fee in land as tenant in common with her children is treated as overruled in this report in both Coursey <em>v. </em>Davis and List <em>v. </em>Rodney. In Melsheimer <em>v. </em>Gross, 8 P. F. Smith 412, Judge Strong, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, said, ‘ children, issue of their or either of their bodies, are necessarily words of purchase in a deed.’ The case of Rogers <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 Barr 93, as interpreted in Jones’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 369, is authority for the position, that the words ‘heirs-at-law then in existence’ may mean <em>the children of the marriage, </em>and in such <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>case the children take the remainder, in the event of the wife’s death as purchasers, and have an estate under the deed of which they cannot be despoiled. I conclude, as the result of my examination of the cases referred to, and many other authorities to which my attention was called by the counsel for the plaintiffs and defendants respectively, during the copious and able arguments which they presented, that the deed marked B, from John Trimmer, Jr., and wife, to Barnet and William Trimmer, Jr., in trust, as already stated, created an estate for life in Margaret Morgenthal, and an estate in remainder in the children of herself and Frederick Morgenthal, including her daughter, Elizabeth Wire, and they took as purchasers and not by descent.</p>

Asper, deceased, who during his lifetime went into possession of part of the land in dispute, by virtue of sundry mesne conveyances, from George Oberlin, after Oberlin’s purchase from Frederick Morgenthal and wife, and also in his lifetime, sold the same by deed containing a covenant of general warranty, to Ananias Wolford, one of the defendants, raised the point that the deed B from John Trimmer, Jr., and wife to Barnet and William Trimmer, Jr., purporting to be a conveyance to them as trustees, as the limitations to Margaret Morgenthal and the children were only to take effect after the death of Frederick Morgenthal, was a testamentary disposition, and, therefore; revocable by him, and actually revoked by the deed of himself and Margaret, his wdfe, to George O'berlin in fee.

It is, however, pertinent to remark that Frederick Morganthal was not a party to deed B, and the estate was put in trust by that deed, creating an immediate legal estate in the trustees. It was decided in Ritter’s Appeal, 9 P. F. Smith 9, that where land was conveyed in trust to be farmed, and the proceeds to be paid to the grantor during life, the land to be sold after his death, and the proceeds of sale to be distributed as directed in the deed, it was not revocable nor testamentary. I cannot, therefore, sustain the point taken on behalf of Frederick L. Asper’s executor.</p>

Was that section constitutional, and did it avail to authorize Barnet and William Trimmer, Jr., to effectually convey the trust estate to Margaret Morgenthal, the <em>cestui que trust </em>for life in fee-simple; and thus to destroy the estates in remainder of the children ? If I could have concurred with the counsel for the defendants, in the opinion that the estate created by the deed of trust was an estate tail in her, or an estate in common to her and the children of her marriage with Frederick Morganthal, including Elizabeth Wire, I might also agree with <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>them in holding this Act of Assembly to be constitutional. It has been intimated in early cases, that it did not fall within the province of inferior tribunals, even of a Court of Common Pleas, to declare a statute of the legislature to be unconstitutional or void; but in Jones’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 369, already referred to, a master in chancery did so, and although his action was overruled by the supreme court, it was not rebuked as having been an unauthorized assumption of power, or an indecorous attempt to overrule a co-ordinate branch of the government. In declaring the act constitutional in that case, the Supreme Court in effect admits that an act which would assume to confer an authority on a wife to divest the estate of her heirs, would be contrary to common right and Magna Charta. In Rogers <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 Barr 93, an Act of Assembly which assumed to give a person who had only a life-estate authority to convey in fee, was not supported. The court said: <em>‘ </em>The children whose rights are materially affected are not before us except indirectly, nor were they represented before the legislature. They are not concluded, for although their rights are not expressly saved, the act binds none but the parties.’ If this were a case of authorized conversion of real estate, the remainder-men being minors, and the principal of the fund raised by the sale preserved for their benefit, the constitutionality of the Act of Assembly might be supported on the principle of Norris <em>v. </em>Clymer, 2 Barr 285, and other cases of that class. Judge Sharswood says, in Palairet’s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith 479, ‘The cases in which such conversion may be authorized, seem well enumerated in Mr. Price’s valuable act of April 18th 1853, Pamph. L. 503.’ It is characteristic of that act, that it carefully guards the interests of all parties concerned, and preserves to them the same interest in the proceeds of the sale, which they had in the land itself. The Act of 1846, however, strikes down the estate of the persons in remainder absolutely, and takes their property to make an estate in fee for the tenant for life. It comes under the principles and decisions in Ervine’s Appeal, 4 Harris 246; Bumburger <em>v. </em>Clippinger, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 311" data-case-ids="477844" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0311-01">5 W. &amp; S. 311</a>; Norman <em>v. </em>Heist, 5 Id. 171; and without citing others of the same class, largely referred to in Palairet’s Appeal, <em>supra ; </em>Schafer <em>v. </em>Eneu, 4 P. F. Smith 304, in which an estate was devised to a woman and her children, and it was contended that children, adopted in conformity to the Act of May 4th 1855, sect. 7, Pamph. L. 431, were entitled under the devise. Judge Strong said, ‘ If the act were construed as it is claimed by the plaintiff in error, as applied to the present case, it would work a result which it is notin the power of the legislature to effect. The will of James Eneu took effect in 1851. It gave a life-estate in the rent to Mrs. Clark, with a contingent remainder to her children, and the residue of the estate to his children, naming them, in fee. The children thus named (and the children <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>of such as are deceased) are the defendants in error. They had a vested interest in the rent when the Act of 1855 was passed. It was not in the power of the legislature to take away that vested interest, and give it to such person as Mrs. Clark might adopt.’ Believing that the children took by purchase, and not by descent, under the deed of trust in this ease, and they had a vested remainder in the land in dispute, I cannot believe that the legislature had a right to authorize the trustees to violate their trust, and convey the land to the tenant in life in fee. I must, therefore, hold the 19th section of the Act of April 21st 1846, Pamph. L. 440, to be unconstitutional and void as to any effect or operation upon the land in dispute, and the estate of the plaintiffs in this case therein.</p>

It was unquestionably ruled in Baldridge <em>v. </em>McFarland, 2 Casey 338, that an adverse possession of twenty-one years during the life of the tenant in tail, will bar a recovery by the issue in tail, and it would no doubt bar the right of entry of tenants in common, who, after removal of disabilities provided by the statute, had permitted the defendants to remain in possession without entry or suit. It was also intimated, though the case was not decided on that ground, that in the case of a contingent remainder, the extinguishment of a life-estate, by adverse possession of twenty-one years, destroys the remainder that depends on it. There ^as no trust in that case, which would protect contingent remainders during the term for life, and in that respect Baldridge <em>v. </em>McFarland differs from the case at bar. In Smilie <em>v. </em>Biffle, 2 Barr 52, it was decided that where a purchaser from several trustees for A. for life, remainder in trust to sell and pay to B. entered under his deed, the Statute of Limitations commenced to run against the whole estate, and twenty-one years’ adverse possession bars as well the trustees as the <em>cestui que </em>trust, tenant for life, and those in remainder. There the trust continued to be active as well after the death as during the life of the life-tenant, for the trustees were after his death to convert and distribute. Smilie <em>v. </em>Biffle, as well as Crow <em>v. </em>Kightlinger, 1 Casey 343; Marple <em>v. </em>Myers, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20122" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Jones 122">2 Jones 122</a>; and Miltenberger <em>v. </em>Croyle, 3 Casey 170, are all referred to by Mr. Price in his Treatise on Liens and Limitations, pages 124-25, where he says, ‘From the preceding decisions, it becomes important carefully to distinguish when, under limitations, trusts expire; for it seems, since <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>the estate of the trustee and <em>cestui que trust </em>are one, if the trust ends with the life of <em>cestui que trust, </em>the case is to he considered as regards those in remainder or reversion as that of an absolute limitation for life, with a remainder over; in which case, the latter would have twenty-one years from the time his rights of entry accrued before he could be barred by the Statute of Limitations ; whereas, if the trustees held for the remainder-men also, adverse possession commenced against the trustee would run against the successive <em>cestui que trust.’ </em>The same writer on p. 129 of his Treatise, says: ‘ Every <em>new </em>right of entry that accrues confers an additional period, within which it may be exercised: Hawk <em>v. </em>Jones, 12 Harris 127, 128; Hunt <em>v. </em>Bowine, 1 Salk. 339. During the continuance of the particular precedent estate, the statute can have no effect upon the expectant estate, because there is no right of entry for it: Id.’ The act does not run against remainder-men till the preceding estate is ended: Jackson <em>v. </em>Schoomaker, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Johns.%20398" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Johns. 398">4 Johns. 398</a>; Jackson <em>v. </em>Sellick, 8 Id. 263; Hall <em>v. </em>Vandegrift, <a href="/binn/3/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Binn. 374" data-case-ids="1791075" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0374-01">3 Binn. 374</a>. And if the preceding estate be for the life of A., who incurs a forfeiture, yet the remainder-man has twenty-one years from the death of A. to bring his ejectment: Lielia <em>v. </em>Airey, 1 Ves. 278; <em>vide </em>Taylor <em>v. </em>Horde, 1 Burr. 60; Commonplace-Book of Chief Justice Tilghman. What is said, therefore, in Baldridge <em>v. </em>McFarland, 2 Casey 339, would seem to require further consideration, to wit: ‘ If the principle of Findley <em>v. </em>Riddle, <a href="/binn/3/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Binn. 139" data-case-ids="1791096" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0139-01">3 Binn. 139</a>, Stump <em>v. </em>Findlay, <a href="/rawle/2/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Rawle 168" data-case-ids="1820551" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0168-01">2 Rawle 168</a>, rules this case, then it is such a life-estate, and remainder, and then it follows that the extinguishment of the life-estate, by adverse possession of twenty-one years, destroyed the remainder that depended on it.’ This would be to give to the possession adverse to ’the tenant for life, the effect of a feoffment by him, or of a common recovery suffered by him, instead of that of an innocent conveyance by deed or will, under the Statute of Uses; to mere supineness the effect of a disseisin by wrong, or the high assurance by matter of record and entry made. It would be to visit upon him in remainder a penalty without his own default, and destroy the rule that he has twenty-one years to enter after his right or title ‘ first descended or accrued.’</p>

In the case in hand, there is a trust-estate, and the real question seems to be whether or riot the trustees held for the remainder-men, as well as for the tenant or tenants for life. Was the estate all in trust, or was it in trust for the tenants for life, and an executed legal estate in the children and Elizabeth Wire at the death of Margaret Morgenthal ? The trustees had no active duties to perform after the death of Margaret Morgenthal, and the estate became a dry trust as to them, and an executed legal estate in the <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>children. Had the limitation in the deed been to her and her <em>heirs, </em>then under the principle of Steacy <em>v. </em>Rice, 3 Casey 75, it would have become a life estate in Margaret Morgenthal at the death of her husband, and a fee in her heirs taking by descent, and under the rule in Shelley’s Case, or without that, as contended by Judge Lowrie in Whichcote <em>v. </em>Lyle’s Executors, 4 Casey 73, it would have become an executed estate in fee in Margaret Morgenthal, and her conveyance would have barred her heirs. In our case, however, we have <em>children </em>taking by <em>purchase, </em>and a trust which ended at least at the death of Margaret Morgenthal, until when they had no right of entry, and the Statute of Limitations did not begin to run against them. Smilie <em>v. </em>Biffle, <em>supra, </em>is affirmed in Maus <em>v. </em>Maus, 30 P. F. Smith 194; but in that case it was decided that the Statute of Limitations commenced to run against the remainder-men only at the death of the life-tenant. The Statute of Limitations, therefore, does not, in my judgment, interpose a bar to the recovery of the land in dispute by the plaintiffs in this suit.</p>

It is pertinent to remark that the deed of trust, on which the plaintiff’s title was founded, was placed on record on the day after its execution and delivery. The Act of 1846 contained a reference to that deed— the deed of Barnet and William Trimmer to Margaret Morgenthal recited the Act of. Assembly <em>in hcec verba, </em>and the deed from Frederick Morgenthal and wife to George Oberlin recited in part the deed from B. and W. Trimmer to Margaret Morgenthal. Thus notice came to the. defendants "in the direct line of their title. It is not alleged — certainly not proved — that the plaintiffs gave the defendants any active encouragement to make improvements, or disclaimed their own title. In Knouff <em>v. </em>Thompson, 4 Harris 357, Judge Chambers, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, said: “ The party who has placed his written title on record has given the notice which every person is bound to know and respect. The law does not require him to go further. But if he speaks or acts it must he consistent with his recorded title. The law distinguishes between silence and encouragement. While silence may be innocent and lawful, to encourage and mislead another into expenditures on a bad or doubtful title would be a positive fraud that should bar and estop the party, the author of that encouragement and deception, from disturbing the title of the person whom he misled, by claim of title in himself.</p>

The same estate vested in Elizabeth as if she had been begotten in lawful wedlock, by Frederick upon the body of Margaret. It therefore-follows, that the word children is not a word of limitation but of purchase : Melsheimer <em>v. </em>Gross, 8 P. F. Smith 412. What then <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>is the estate taken by Margaret, and by the children respectively, including Elizabeth ? The answer is, the mother took a life-estate, with remainder in fee to the children as a class. It was a vested remainder in fee in Elizabeth, who was living at the time of the execution of the deed, and opened to let in the after-born children, as their births respectively took place: Wager et al. <em>v. </em>Wager et al., 1 S. &amp; R. 374; White <em>v. </em>Williamson, <a href="/grant/2/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="2 Grant 249" data-case-ids="227688" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0249-01">2 Grant 249</a>; Haskins <em>v. </em>Tate, 1 Casey 249 ; Gernet <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 Id. 94; Coursey <em>v. </em>Davis, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%2025" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="10 Wright 25">10 Wright 25</a>.</p>

    <p id="b46-7" data-blocks='[["BL_46.6",46,[223,1131,1162,1246]]]'>The remaining question is whether the right of the defendants in error was barred by the Statute of Limitations ? If it began to run against them during the life of Margaret their title was barred, otherwise not. They did not derive title from her. They took the fee under and by virtue of the same deed that gave her a life-estate. They held a distinct title in succession, and had no right of possession until that succession took effect. They were not precluded from sustaining an action, during the life of Margaret, to recover possession by reason of their minority. They labored under no personal disability. Regardless of minority or coverture, their right of entry or of action did not accrue until her death. The cases of Hunt <em>v. </em>Wall, 25 P. F. Smith 413, and Hogg et al. <em>v. </em>Ashman et al., 2 Norris 80, are not applicable. They rest on personal disability. No such obstacle existed in the present case. Nor did the statute begin to run against them as heirs of Margaret during her life, as in Maus <em>v. </em>Maus, 30 P. F. Smith 194. They did not take as heirs but as purchasers. The authority of Baldridge <em>v. </em>McEarland does not control this case. There the tenant in tail might have barred the remainder, and it was said the freehold merged in the inheritance, and the two were united and executed in possession in the ancestor and formed one estate of inheritance. Therefore it was held that an adverse possession during the life of the tenant in tail would bar a recovery by the issue in tail. Here there was no merger. The two estates were not united. They were separate and distinct. The life-tenant could not bar the-vested remainder created by the deed; nor had she any estate to transmit to her heirs. The court committed no error in confirming the able, report of the referee and in entering judgment thereon. Judgment affirmed.</p>
