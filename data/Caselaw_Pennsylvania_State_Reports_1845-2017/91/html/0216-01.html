The bridge company filed a remonstrance, which was overruled without prejudice, and on the same date six viewers were appointed, and five days notice of the time and place of their meeting was directed to be given to the president of said company and to the county commissioners. On the 5th of May 1879, the viewers filed a report which set forth the manner in which their duties had been performed; that they had examined the bridge; that all were present at the view, and were severally sworn that the bridge was necessary as a free bridge for public accommodation; that the payment of tolls thereon was an unjust burden on the travelling public, and that by reason of taking said bridge the company would sustain damages to the amount of $20,000.</p>

The mode adopted in this act is substantially that which has always prevailed in regard to taking property for roads, &amp;c., and is sustained by decisions of the Supreme Court: Pocopson Road, 4 Harris 15. The result of the authorities appears to be, that the only conditions to the exercise of the right of the state to take private property is that the public good requires it, and that adequate compensation be made therefor. The fact that the public good does require it is to be ascertained by legislative authority, which authority may be delegated to a corporation, or even to an individual, where the purpose is of public utility.</p>

It is not in conflict with any clause of the federal or state constitution. The third exception to the report may be dismissed, with the single remark, that there is nothing in the law which requires that a bridge, to be taken for public use, shall be in the line of a public improvement or a part thereof. The fourth exception cannot be sustained. The law provides that proceedings under the statute may be begun and carried on upon the petition of twenty residents and tax-payers of the county. The fifth exception asserts that the bridge proposed to be taken and appropriated is not situated where a public highway is crossed by a river or other stream. No evidence in regard to this exception was taken, but the exceptants content themselves with a simple denial of the facts alleged in the petition. The petition alleges that the bridge in question is over the Susquehanna river, between the borough of Towanda and the township of Wysox, in the county of Bradford, where said river crosses a road or highway; that said road in Wysox township is known as the <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>New East Towanda road, and that the said road in Towanda borough is known as Bridge street.</p>

If this causeway is maintained by the bridge company, and is necessary to reach their bridge, it is part of the bridge itself, and would pass by a sale of its franchises. If it is kept in repair by the public, it is a public highway. Ever since the bridge was erected, more than forty years ago, there has been a way open to each end ■ of the bridge. The bridge itself is a highway, and forms the connecting lines between the highways on opposite sides of the'"river. It is surely not necessary, to bring a case within the Act of Assembly, that the petitioners should show that a highway had been laid out not only <em>to </em>but <em>across </em>the river. I apprehend that, except in the case of state roads, laid out by the commissioners appointed for that purpose, no case can be found where a public road has been laid out by course and distance across the Susquehanna river; and yet, within the meaning of the law, where there is a highway to the river on each side, the river may be said to cross a highway; and although there may be nó record of a laying out of the road, yet if it. has been used by the public as a highway for twenty-one years, it has become a highway by prescription. Many highways throughout the Commonwealth stand upon no other title. The Act of Assembly under consideration applies to highways, without regard to the manner of their becoming such.

Under the general road law of the state for the laying out of roads or erecting county bridges, a petition of citizens is required, as in the Act of 1876, but it has never been the practice to require them to be sworn to.

The opinion of Judge Elwell, and the authorities cited by him, are conclusive upon that subject. The proposition to have the question as to the necessity of taking the bridge heard in open court before the judge and grand jury was certainly a novel one, and if it was in the sound discretion of the court to grant or. refuse it, their decision cannot be reviewed here. The question whether, under the provision of art. 16, sect. 8, of the constitution, the county can take actual possession of the bridge without paying or securring the damages awarded, does not arise on this record. There is no order of court to the county commissioners to take possession. The county, as well as the bridge company, had the right to appeal from the award of damages to the Court of Common Pleas and to a trial by jury. No time is fixed in the Act of 1878 for taking the appeal.
