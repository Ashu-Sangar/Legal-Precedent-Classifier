The Act of March 20th 1877, provided that when less than six per cent, dividend was declared then there should be imposed a tax of three mills only on each dollar of valuation of stock. This act further declared that it should go into effect immediately, and reserved to the Commonwealth the right to collect any taxes accrued or accruing under the Act of 1874. The Act of 1877 also required the said corporations to report to the auditor-general in November. On the 12th of said month, in 1877, a coal company reported that on the 1st of March 1877 it had declared a dividend of five per cent, on its capital stock of $500,000. The court below held the company liable to the tax of one half mill on its capital stock, valued at $500,000, for .each one per cent, of dividend made March 1st 1877, under the Act of 1874, and also a pro rata tax on the part of the year from the passage of 'the Act of March 20th 1877 to the first Monday of November 1877, on the valuation of the capital stock, $120,000, under the provisions of said act. <em>Held, </em>that these taxes were properly imposed.</p>

On the 12th of November 1877, a report was made to the state department that on the 1st day of March 1877, the company had declared a dividend of five per cent, on its capital stock of $500,000. This, according to the fifth section of the act of the 24th of March 1874, was subject to a tax of one half mill of its capital stock for each one per cent, of dividend made or' declared by such company. Although this dividend was made and declared on the 1st day of March, yet as the tax is to be assessed on the dividend made or declared annually, it is possible that if nothing else existed in the case that would have been the annual tax, yet that is by no means certain, as it is quite possible that as this dividend was made and declared as early as the 1st day of March, the department could have required a statement of the subsequent profits of the business for that year, and assessed a tax thereon. It is not to be presumed that the dividend was declared before it was earned. But there is another feature in the case. On the 20th day of March 1877 a new tax law was enacted, to go into effect immediately, providing that where less than six per eentum of dividend on the par value of the stock is declared, the stock shall be appraised by the treasurer and secretary of the company, according to the average price at which it sold during the year, and a tax of three mills on each dollar of valuation so made is required to be paid by the corporation. The same statute reserves a*nd secures to the state any taxes accrued and accruing under any laws or parts of laws prior to the date of the approval of that act. Pursuant to this last enactment the officers of the company, on the 2d day of May 1878, appraised the stock at $120,000, on which the officers of the government assessed a tax of $283,57, for two hundred and thirty days of the <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>year 1877, being the unexpired period from the former assessment to the end of the fiscal year, the first Monday in November.</p>

From thenceforward it acted under the later statute, which relieved it of a very large portion of its taxes. It is urged that this construction subjects the company to double taxation. There is certainly nothing in the evidence which shows it. We must either presume that the dividend was declared before it was earned, or that by the end of the year the company would have earned and been able i'o divide a much larger sum. It is, however, more probable that on the cessation of the law it made its dividend, and started to operate under the new law. The company under the statute of 1877 was not charged with what it had done under the act of 1874, but only until the expiration of the year — for two hundred and thirty days. Even if this were double taxation we are not prepared to say that it is illegal.. The Supreme Court has said that the legislature has the same right to impose a double as a single tax, though we are unwilling to infer, in the absence of very clear language, that it was so intended. We are of the opinion that the tax was properly charged by the accounting department as to both items.</p>

It was never intended that they should be imposed in such cases.</p>

As a general rule, the failure to pay money justly due subjects the delinquent to the payment of interest. Yet to have that effect, there should be some dereliction of duty by neglecting where the amount was fixed and known. In the present case it was extremely difficult for the company to ascertain what was due. The taxes arose under new statutes. There was an honest dispute as to how -much should be paid to the state treasury, and under such circumstances a settlement of the amount should be ascertained by the public officers, and the defendant have reasonable notice of the claim. The settlement in this case was consummated on the 17th of June 1878, and bears interest at twelve per centum after sixty days from that time.

The tax did not become due when the dividend was made, nor could it be told until the end of the tax year how much would be due,-because other dividends might be made. But the Act of March 20th 1877 was passed during the year. It does not introduce a new subject of the tax, nor does it impose a new tax; it merely changes the mode of assessing the tax formerly imposed. And this tax is an annual tax, and the Act of 1877 says, the corporation on which it is imposed “shall be subject to and pay into the treasury of the Commonwealth, annually, a tax to be <em>computed </em>as followsand it merely changes the mode of computation, as above recited. Hence, when the date arrived when a report was due from the plaintiff in error, for the year 1877, it was made; and, as the dividends made during the year did not amount, in the aggregate, to six per cent., the stock was appraised at its actual value in cash, and not less than the average price for which it sold during the year. And we contend that this appraisement fixed the tax due for said year at three mills on such appraised value — the rate fixed by the Act of 1877, when the dividends amounted to less than six per cent, during the whole year.</p>

L. 68, and of 20th March 1877, Pamph. L. 6. The act first named required the company to make report to the auditor-general, annually, in the month of November, stating the' amount of capital paid in, the date, amount and rate per centum of each and every dividend declared by it during the year, ending with the first Monday of said month; and provided it should be subject to and pay a tax annually, at the rate of one-half mill upon its capital stock for each one per cent, of dividend made or declared by the company; and in case no dividend was made or declared by it, upon either its commón or preferred stock, then three mills upon a true valuation of its capital stock, on which no dividend was made or declared. * Thus, this act imposed a tax of one-half mill upon the capital stock, for each one per cent, of dividend declared. Regardless of the size of the dividend, the one-half mill tax was imposed on the capital stock. The Act of 20th March 1877 changed the former act in several respects. It provides, inter alia, when less than six per cent, dividend on the par value of the stock is declared, there shall be imposed a tax of three mills only on each dollar of valuation of stock. It further declares, “ this act shall go into effect immediately,” and it repeals all those parts of the Act of 24th April 1874 inconsistent therewith, saving, reserving and excepting unto the Commonwealth, “the right to collect any taxes accrued or accruing” thereunder. This Act of 1877 also required the company to'make report to the auditor-general in the month of November. On the 13th November 1877 it reported, that on the 1st of March 1877, it had declared a dividend of five per cent, on its capital stock of $500,000. It reported no subsequent dividend. The dividend reported was declared while the whole Act of 24th April 1874 was in full force. It was, then, made under and subject to all of its provisions. It must be presumed to have been earned before it was declared. No reason can be given for not subjecting the company to a tax, consequent on that dividend. Although the act did not require immediate notice to the Commonwealth that this dividend had been made, yet the liability of the company to subsequently pay a tax based thereon existed. The learned judge therefore held the company liable to the tax of one-<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>half mill on its capital stock, valued at $500,000, for each one per cent, of the dividend made the 1st of March 1877, under the Act of 1874. This tax was, therefore, $1250. To this tax no serious objection is made. The capital stock was afterwards, under the Act of 1877, valued at $120,000, and a pro rata tax, on the part of the year from the passage of the act to the first Monday of November 1877, laid thereon. It amounted to $283.57. This tax is the great subject of complaint.</p>

Before any such additional dividend was earned or made, the Act of 20th March 1877 took effect and from its date relieved the company from future taxation, under the Act of 1874. So much only of the Act of 1874 was retained as was necessary for the collection of the tax accrued or accruing under it; but from the day of the enactment of the statute of 1877, a different rate óf taxation was established. The dividend of the 1st of March 1877 had not then been reported. The accounting officers of the Commonwealth had no information that it had been made. The object of the act was to establish a line of separation between the two statutes. To declare that all taxes accrued or accruing at that date, from the corporation, should be collected under the laws then in force; but all accruing thereafter should be subject to another law. It is complained that this view of the act imposes double taxation, within the year. If this be the case, yet it is clearly within legislative power to so enact: Saving Fund <em>v. </em>Yard, 9 Barr 359; West Chester Gas Co. <em>v. </em>County of Chester, 6 Casey 232; Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne and Chicago Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 16 P. F. Smith 73. What then did the Act of 1877 intend ? When it was passed the legislature could not foresee whether the company would be liable to further taxation, under the Act of 1874, by reason of any dividend being thereafter made within the year. To clearly relieve the company from such contingent liability, immediate effect was given to the Act of 1877, in express terms. This immediate effect undoubtedly negatives the idea that its operation was to be postponed until the end of the year named in the Act of 1874. The manifest design was to relieve the company from taxation, under the Act of 1874, consequent on future profits or future valuation, and in all respects to subject it to the Act of 1877. In case of a dividend, it imposed on the company a lesser rate of taxation, and gave immediate effect to the law. The fact that by its terms the'company might be subject to taxation for a portion of time which it would have avoided,» under the Act' of 1874, does not impair the effect of the later act, nor postpone the time of its going into operation. Judgment affirmed.</p>

    <p id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[178,476,1166,649]]]'>An application is made for a re-argument of this case, by reason of an omission to duly consider the objection made to that portion of the tax imposed under the Act of 1874. It must be admitted that certain language in the opinion might well lead to that inference. Such, however, was not the fact; it did receive a careful consideration. We were clearly of the opinion that the dividend, made and declared on the 1st of March 1877, subjected the company to taxation, under the laws then in force. We did not think the Act of 20th March, either by its letter or its spirit, relieved the company from a liability which had attached by reason of that dividend. This last act expressly saved and reserved out of its repealing clause, unto the Commonwealth, the right to collect any taxes “accrued or accruing” under any laws prior to its passage. If this tax had not fully “accrued” it was clearly “accruing,” although the time for its payment had not then arrived.</p>
