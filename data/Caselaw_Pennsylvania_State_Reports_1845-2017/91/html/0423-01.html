The fences were frequently moved by the land-owners in or out of the road as suited their convenience. The plaintiff, Dawley, about four years before the act complained of, moved his fences back into his fields on both sides of the road, he being the owner on both sides. If he had removed them back into his fields on the east side of the road only, to a line fifty feet east of where the west line fence then stood, the centre of this fifty feet would have been the true centre of the road, or nearly so. But as the fences were placed by him in moving them, the greater part of the road was thrown into Girard township. The wagon track, at that time, was mostly in Girard township.</p>

Immediately after this the road commissioners caused a written notice to be served upon all the owners whose fences were found to be in the road, requesting them to remove the same out of the bounds of the fifty feet. This was done by all such land-owners excepting the plaintiff. In 1875, the commissioners again personally notified Dawley to remove his fence, which he refused to do.</p>

Its boundaries are straight lines upon the cardinal points of compass. It has a system of roads running from north to south, one mile apart, six in number. One of these public roads forms the eastern boundary of the township, and one the western. This latter was the one in controversy. All these roads are laid upon the tract lines,’ these tracts being the original surveys’ of the' Population Land Company. The township has a very level surface, and the straight lines of these roads are carefully maintained in working the roads, except at the deep gulf cut through this level surface by the waters of a small creek. These six parallel roads are one mile apart, rendering it impossible for any one to be mistaken as to the true location of the roads. These straight lines upon this level surface the inhabitants have been anxious to maintain, both for utility, uniformity and beauty. Every obtruding fence, tree or other structure, interferes with the view of the traveller for miles.</p>
