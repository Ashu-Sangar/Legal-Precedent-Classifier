The jury in said court assessed Reymer’s damages at $18,980, and a motion for a new trial having been overruled, judgment was entered against the city for that amount, and the record was certified back to the Quarter Sessions. On March 23d 1878, upon the petition of Reymer, viewers were appointed by the Quarter Séssions “ to appraise and assess the damages caused by the opening of Beech and Page streets, so far as the same have not been ascertained by jury, on the issue formed and tried in the Court of Common Pleas, and to assess the amounts so ascertained and found by jury as aforesaid, upon property benefited, and make a report to this court in accordance with law.”</p>

The ordinance purports to authorize the opening of a single street from Allegheny avenue to Eulton street; while as a matter of fact it provides for <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>the extension of Beech street <em>from </em>Allegheny avenue to Bidwell street, thus providing by a single ordinance and one board of viewers, for the extension of two entirely distinct streets located many hundred feet distant from each other. 2.

The costs and damages necessarily attending the proposed improvements greatly exceed th.e benefits which are likely to result therefrom; thus making the improvements impossible without imposing illegal assessments upon property not benefited nor likely to be benefited thereby.</p>
