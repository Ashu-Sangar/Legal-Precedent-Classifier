On the 1st of October 1863, Barnhart executed and delivered to David Caldwell, as trustee for his wife, a mortgage upon the property, to secure the sum of $7000. This mortgage was duly recorded, on the 3d of November in the same year.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b141-7" data-blocks='[["BL_141.6",141,[183,708,1174,1170]]]'>In April 1868, David A. Harris purchased from Barnhart and wife fifty acres of this land, for the sum of $6250. Before concluding the bargain, Harris heard through some one of the existence of this mortgage, and he inquired of Barnhart concerning it. Barnhart told him there was such a mortgage, but it did not amount to anything, for the reason that it had never been recorded, and that even though it was recorded, it would be satisfied by his wife joining in the deed for the property. Harris, not satisfied with the statement of Barnhart, went to see the wife, in company with her husband. In the presence of Harris, Barnhart told his wife that Harris had heard of her mortgage and was afraid to buy the property on account of it, and that he had told him that it was not recorded. Mrs. Barnhart then said that it was not recorded, and Barnhart repeated what he had said to Harris about the effect of his wife joining in the deed, and Mrs. Barnhart said she had signed the deed. The business connected with the transfer of the property was to be done by an attorney living in Shippensburg, but since dead. He represented both parties in the transaction. Harris went to the attorney about the mortgage, told him what Barnhart and wife had said about the effect of the wife joining in the deed, and he expressed the same opinion. Thus assured, Harris paid the purchase-money, and accepted the deed without requiring the mortgage to be surrendered or satisfied. Harris did not discover that the mortgage was on record until 1873, when Mrs. Barnhart for the first time made a demand for it. He had previously, in June 1870, sold and conveyed the property to Charles G. Klein, the defendant, by deed of general warranty.</p>

Of the purchase-money, $449.66 remained after paying the prior lien, and was appropriated to the mortgage of the wife. In April 1877, Mrs. Barnhart, through Caldwell, the trustee in the mortgage, sued out this scire facias on the same, and sought to enforce its payment out of the land conveyed to Harris, in 1868.</p>

They very clearly assert the doctrine that an estoppel may not be set up against a married woman, where the effect would be to give validity to a sale of real estate not made by her in the only way appointed by the statute. Nor are we in conflict with the authority of Haffey <em>v. </em>Carey, 23 P. F.

We are not seeking to give validity to a conveyance of land or an assignment of the mortgage, and no such effect would follow the estoppel. What we would accomplish through the estoppel, would be the satisfaction of the mortgage; either this, or a gift of it to her husband, in whose hands the law would hold it to be satisfied. The distinction we think clear and unquestionable. Our purpose is to prevent the plaintiff from now asserting the existence of a fact, which she previously asserted did not exist, and thereby induced us to do what we otherwise would not have done.</p>

She was a married woman. The mortgage was on the lands of her husband and held by Caldwell in trust for her use. The trustee did not in any manner, participate in the transaction, from which the estoppel is claimed to have arisen. Having no knowledge of it, his rights were unaffected thereby. It is however urged by the plaintiff that as the legal title to the mortgage was held solely for the use and benefit of Mrs. Barnhart, her conduct was sufficient to estop her and thereby extinguish the lien of the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>mortgage. It is true, as a general rule, the declarations of a person will operate as an estoppel against him, in favor of a purchaser, who has bought for value after such declarations and upon the faith of them; yet many acts and declarations sufficient to estop one <em>sui juris, </em>have been held insufficient to estop a <em>feme covert. </em>Hence in case of the conveyance by a wife of her real estate, although she may have expressed her satisfaction with the sale, and received the purchase-money, yet if she has not acknowledged the deed in the manner directed by Act of Assembly, she is not estopped from asserting her previous title. McClure <em>v. </em>Douthitt, 6 Barr 414; Thorndell <em>v. </em>Morrison, 1 Casey 326 ; Richards <em>v. </em>McClelland, 5 Id. 385; Keen <em>v. </em>Hartman, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20497" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="12 Wright 497">12 Wright 497</a>. So in Glidden v. Strupler, <em>supra, </em>where a married woman had contracted to sell her real estate, adjoining the lot on which she lived, received a part of the purchase-money, suffered the purchaser to erect a dwelling-house thereon, and even expressed a wish that no windows should be put in the side of the house next to hers, which wish was acted on and adopted by the purchaser, yet it was held all these facts did not estop the wife from recovering the land, she having omitted to duly acknowledge the contract.-</p>

As in fact the mortgage was recorded, the plaintiff' ’s vendor had constructive notice of it; but his own evidence shows he had actual notice of its existence. Having this full knowledge, he took the land covered by the mortgage, with like effect as if he had known it was recorded: Stroud <em>v. </em>Lockart, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dallas%20153" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Dallas 153">4 Dallas 153</a>; Jacques <em>v. </em>Weeks, <a href="/watts/7/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 Watts 261" data-case-ids="1846900" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0261-01">7 Watts 261</a>; McLanahan <em>v. </em>Reeside, 9 Id. 508; Uhler <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 11 Harris 110; Britton’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20172" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Wright 172">9 Wright 172</a>.

Suppose she did say that she was satisfied with the sale her husband had agreed to make, this is no more than she asserted in writing by uniting with her husband in the deed and acknowledging it according to law.

All the <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>parties to the deed appear to have been under the impression that by her uniting therein, the lien of the mortgage would be divested.

She executed no writing which released or satisfied the mortgage. The whole evidence was manifestly insufficient to divest its lien.
