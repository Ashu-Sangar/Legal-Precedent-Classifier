In an indictment for a criminal offence the court charged the jury, “ the only safe course for you to pursue, as to the law regarding offences' which you may have given you in charge, is to receive your instructions from the court, for the reason you are not supposed to be learned in the law, and if you should commit an error therein, or counsel should be mistaken in stating the law to you, and you, relying upon their version or your own ideas, in either case should you commit an error, there is no remedy.” Held, that this was not error. The court had an undoubted right to instruct the jury as to the law, and to warn them, as they did, against finding contrary to it.</p>

This is a distinct statutory offence, and under an indictment therefor the minor offence of fornication is, of course, included, and the jury might convict therefor. But the offence of fornication and bastardy is not included; this is a distinct substantive offence, made so by a separate and independent statute, to wit, the 52d section of the penal code: 1 Purd. Dig. 325. The latter offence partakes, essentially, of the character of civil process : 2 Whart. Am. Cr.

F. Smith 30; Rowand <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Norris 405; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Maloy, 7 P. F. Smith 298. Neither of the above requirements were complied with as to the second and third counts of'the indictment herein.

This was done in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McCarty, the first reported case under the seduction law of 1843. In that case the defendant was acquitted of the charge of seduction and found guilty upon the count charging fornication and bastardy. Lewis’s United States Criminal Law, pages 51 to 53.

They are not restricted to any one of these methods by binding instructions, but what in the opinion of the court is the “safe course” is pointed out to them. 1. They may take the law from the court; or 2. They may take it from the counsel; or 3. They may rely upon their “ own ideas.” The first course is recommended as “the only safe” one, and a very good reason given therefor, viz.: that if they should err in that choice, there is a remedy for such error. All 'this leaves the jury the judges of what the law is.</p>

They are offences of the same nature. If the Commonwealth had failed to prove the promise of marriage, the defendant might have been convicted on the other counts. A party indicted for seduction and acquitted may plead such acquittal in bar of a subsequent indictment for fornication and bastardy, founded on the same act. Dinkey <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Harris 126. The third, fourth and fifth errors are not assigned <em>secundum regulas, </em>and there were no ex<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>ceptions below to the rulings of offers of evidence complained of, except to the letter of November 22d 1875, which was clearly admissible to show the previous relation between the parties. The other assignments of error to the rulings of the court below on questions of evidence, are not sustained by bills of exception, and must fall for that reason; but if they had been they would not have availed the plaintiff in error. As to the exceptions to the charge, we think there was nothing in it of which the plaintiff can rightfully complain.</p>

This is very different from telling them that they must find the defendant guilty, which is what is meant by a binding instruction in criminal cases. Judgment affirmed.</p>
