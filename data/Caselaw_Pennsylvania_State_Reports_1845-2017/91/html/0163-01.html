This conveyance was expressly made subject to the payment by Nichols of the balance of the debt and interest due upon both of the aforesaid mortgages, and the fact that part or all of the bonds thereby secured had been assigned to third parties was <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>distinctly recognised. This deed also contained a covenant by Nichols “ to assume and pay the balance of the debt and interest owing upon said two mortgages and bonds secured thereby, and to save harmless the said Wonderly from any liability for the same,” and it was moreover expressed that the performance of said covenant by said Nichols was a part of the consideration of said deed, and the deed Was executed by Nichols, as well as the grantors. Mrs. Catharine J. Packer issued a scire facias upon the Hall mortgage, obtained a judgment, and issued a levari facias to May term 1878, and then assigned the judgment to Oliver Watson.

To this report exceptions were filed on the 31st day of December 1878, by the City National Bank and the York County National Bank, and the case referred back to the auditor to make a new distribution on the principles indicated in the opinion pf the court, to wit, that Nichols, by virtue of his .succession to Wonderly’s half interest in the property, and having paid off the mortgage, was entitled to subrogation as against Potter, but confirming the distribution so far as applied to the Hall mortgage. The auditor made a second report, distributing the $4500, pro rated upon the whole of the Porter bond and the one-half of the amount of the bonds held by said banks. To this report Oliver Watson and Oliver Watson, Jr., and the banks filed exceptions on the 18th of April 1879, alleging as error that the auditor erred in not distributing the whole balance of $4475 to the Porter bond; that the distribution was not in accordance with the law and the facts, and that there was error in the court refusing to confirm the first report and referring the same back to the auditor.</p>

Smith 183, “ It would be a novelty for a purchaser of land to keep on foot his own mortgage against his own estate.” Granted that Potter was not a party to the transaction, still surely in a scire facias by Nichols, if he still held the bond Potter could make defence that the mortgage had been paid in full by Wonderly, in any way Nichols would be estopped from recovery on the mortgage by the covenant in the deed from Wonderly, by which he agreed as part of the consideration to satisfy the mortgage and cancel the bonds, and his assignees can stand in this respect in no better position than himself.</p>

The main contention arises under the first assignment. It involves the question of precedence between claimants under two separate mortgages on the same land, both executed at one time, and recorded on the same day. It appears that Hall owned the land, and by articles of agreement sold it to Nichols. Before the latter had fully paid therefor, he sold to Porter and Wonderly. To avoid the expense of an intermediate conveyance, it was agreed that Hall should convey directly to Porter and Wonderly, and they should execute a mortgage to him to secure residue of the purchase-money due him; and also execute to Nichols another mortgage to secure the payment of the remainder of the sum which they had agreed to pay for the whole title. In pursuance of this agreement, the deed and mortgages were made of one date, and they were executed, delivered and recorded on the same day. Thus, substantially and in effect, the mortgage to Hall was for the purchase-money due him on the legal title, and the mortgage to Nichols was for the value of his equitable interest in the land. The mortgage to Hall having thus been recorded on the day of its execution and delivery, and on the day of the delivery of the deed, is clearly entitled to a preference over the other mortgage. Hall was guilty of no laches whereby his prior lien was defeated. It is not essentially necessary for the mortgage to show on its face, that it -was given for purchase-money, in order to give it a preferred lien. The fact that it was so given was known to mortgagors and mortgagees. Nichols could not assert any equity to defeat the superior right of the mortgage given to Hall. <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>The record showed the deed from Hall, and the mortgage to him, on the same land; both to bear the same date, and that they were both recorded on the same day. These facts were sufficient to put a' purchaser of the mortgage from Nichols on inquiry. Hue inquiry would readily have resulted in full notice of the preferred lien of the Hall mortgage. The learned judge was therefore right in holding that the mortgage given to Hall for the purchase-money created a preferred lien.</p>
    <p id="b168-6" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[199,687,1168,505]]]'>The fifth assignment involves the existence of a fact which does not appear to have been questioned in the court below. No exception was there filed against the right to collect more than the sum for which the(bond was originally pledged in 1867 or 1868. The right to collect the whole bond, having there passed unquestioned, we will not now assume that right not to exist. Besides, it is shown, that in 1876, Nichols, formally in writing, did assign to Porter the whole bond and a proportionate part of the mortgage, and Porter assigned them to the appellee. No further consideration of the other questions is necessary. They have been sufficiently discusssed in the opinion just filed in Watson’s Appeal from the same decree.</p>
