Heine,_ for conspiracy to cheat and defraud his creditors. In 1876, Heine owned a store in Blossburg, which contained a quantity of goods. On the 17th of August these goods were assigned by Heine to Henry Weill, a young man who had been a clerk in his store. At this time Heine owed a <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>large sum of money to Claflin &amp; Co., of New York, and E. S. Jaffrey &amp; Co., of the same city, for goods purchased of said firms. <em>It </em>was not disputed that about the time of the assignment, Heine owed about $24,000, and that his assets were only $4488. The Commonwealth alleged that this assignment was fraudulent, not a bona fide or absolute sale to Weill, but was intended to defraud Heine’s creditors. The questions passed upon by this court do not make it necessary to enter into the details of the alleged conspiracy. The defendant was convicted, and after judgment he took this writ and. made the following assignments of error:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[241,794,1167,769]]]'>The court, Wilson, J., erred in admitting, as evidence, the testimony of Edward C. Holmes, who was offered by the Commonwealth to prove: That he had a conversation with Henry Weill, on or about the 12th of September 1876, at Blossburg, in relation to the previous transfer of the stock of goods of Heine to himself; that in that conversation Weill stated to the witness that at the time the transfer was made to him, he understood its purpose; that he paid nothing for the goods and did not expect to pay anything; that he received them without consideration, for the purpose of assisting Heine to keep them from his creditors; that the money stated in the bill of sale, was paid by Heine to Weill himself but a few moments before it was paid over by Weill to Heine in the presence of E. E. Smith, on the day the bill of sale was signed; that further, he had given two signatures to Heine on a blank piece of paper, Heine stating to him that he wanted them so that in case there was trouble in relation to the goods, instruments in writing might be filled out over them of a proper kind to conceal the true state of the transaction between Weill and Heine.</p>

Holmes and others, made, as they appear to have been, after the relations between himself and Heine had been dissolved, were improperly admitted. The declarations of a conspirator are, of course, always evidence against himself, and they are also evidence against his associates when they are made during the performance of the fraudulent transactions which constitute the crime charged, for they then form part of such transactions and as such may properly be admitted; but when not made during the progress of the fraudulent scheme but afterwards, and, as in this case, in a mere rehearsal to a third party of what has previously been done, they are not evidence: <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Chit.%20Cr.%20Law%201143" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Chit.

    <p id="b148-10" data-blocks='[["BL_148.12",148,[226,1539,1165,517]]]'>Furthermore, the learned judge of the court below committed an error in saying to the jury: “ If a man is guilty, his previous good character has nothing to do with the case; but if you have doubt as to his guilt, then character steps in and aids in determining that doubt.” The effect of this was to give the evidence of good character no weight whatever, for if the other testimony left, in the minds of the jury, a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt, this of itself] without more, entitled him to an acquittal. Evidence of good character is not a mere makeweight thrown in to assist in the production of a result that would happen at all events, but it is positive evidence, and may, of itself, by the creation of a reasonable doubt, produce an acquittal: Whart. Crim. Law, sect. 643.</p>
    <p id="b148-11" data-blocks='[["BL_148.13",148,[227,2055,1164,346]]]'>We next turn to the exceptions taken to the indictment. That instrument, in substance, charges as follows: that the defendant, Arnold B. Heine, intending to cheat and defraud H. B. Olaflin &amp; Co. and S. F. Jaffrey &amp; Co. of their money, goods, &amp;c., and prevent them from obtaining payment of their just claims, together with one Henry Weill, wickedly and deceitfully, did then and there falsely and maliciously conspire, combine, confederate and agree, to and with the said Henry Weill, to cheat, defraud, &amp;c.</p>

      <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>The objection is that Heine alone is charged; that a fraudulent conspiracy is in its nature joint, and that one alone cannot be guilty of this offence. This is strictly true; nevertheless, one of two or more conspirators may be separately indicted, tried and convicted: 3 Chit. Crim. Law, v. 1141. Therefore, that Weill has not been indicted with Heine can make no difference if it sufficiently appears, from the record, that he was a confederate. If, however, one can be separately indicted, how could he be charged other than the defendant has been charged in the bill before us ? To say that Arnold B. Heine, together with Henry Weill, did conspire, combine, confederate and agree to and with the said Henry Weill, to cheat, &amp;c., is certainly a most direct and positive implication of two persons in the same crime. There surely can be no mistake, from the reading of this instrument, but that, in the commission of the misdemeanor charged, Weill was a fellow conspirator with Heine. It follows that this exception cannot be sustained.</p>
