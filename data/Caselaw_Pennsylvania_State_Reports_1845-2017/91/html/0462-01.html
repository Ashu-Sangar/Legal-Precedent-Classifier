Both parties claimed under sheriff’s deeds. On "he 3d of May 1861, a judgment in favor of J. E. Willis was entered against William McLaughlin, who then owned the land in dispute. An execution issued thereon to June Term 1861, a levy was made or. the land, and the writ returned “ stayed by plaintiff’s attorney.” No written order of said attorney was attached to the writ, and no date was mentioned at which said order to stay was given. On the 30th of January 1862, pursuant to the praecipe of Willis’s attorney, a certified copy of this fieri facias was issued to the sheriff, upon which he held an inquisition, and the property was condemned, and upon the same day a vend. ex. issued, and the property was sold to Willis, the plaintiff in the writ. At the time of the sale William McLaughlin was in possession of the land, and by a written lease thereafter became the tenant of Willis until the death of McLaughlin in 1864. After his death his wife, the defendant in "his action, became the tenant of Willis, until 1869, when with her own means she purchased the land and received from Willis a deed therefor. On the 21st of March 1861, a judgment was e itered against William McLaughlin in favor of John Hildenger, :.bf use of Thomas McLaughlin. Upon this judgment a fi. fa. issued, and the sheriff levied on the land in dispute. An inquisilion was held, the property condemned, a vend. ex. issued, and the land sold to Thomas McLaughlin, the plaintiff in this action. At this sale, and before the same, Willis gave notice <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>of his title. Thomas McLaughlin brought a former action for this land, and in April 1877, obtained a verdict therefor. A new trial was awarded, and plaintiff secured a second verdict in his favor. Judgment was entered on this verdict, and the land delivered to plaintiff by the sheriff. The defendant sued out a writ of error, and in 1878 the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the court below,'and awarded a <em>venire facias de novo. </em>(See report of case in 4 Norris 317.) In February 1878, a writ of restitution was awarded, and the property returned by the 'sheriff to defendant.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.7",464,[238,658,1156,511]]]'>It will not be doubted that it was competent for Thomas McLaughlin to show that after Willis had purchased the land in dispute it had been repurchased by William McLaughlin, the original defendant, before the entry of the judgment under which the plaintiff in error claims. This for two purposes: 1. To show that the lien of the plaintiff’s judgment attached to the equity residing in William McLaughlin, in virtue of his purchase from Willis. 2. To show that the conveyance made to Mary McLaughlin was simply held in trust for the purchase of William McLaughlin’s title. And 3. That the conveyance thus made, if done to defeat the creditors of William McLaughlin and the purchaser of his estate, was fraudulent and void.</p>

This was the very question in dispute.</p>

There was no proof or offer to prove by any competent evidence that Willis ever sold the land to any one prior to 1865, when he articled with this defendant. The .purchase by the wife could not be in trust for her husband, William McLaughlin, for he was then in his grave.</p>

Willis afterwards sold and conveyed to Mary McLaughlin, the defendant, the premises; and the contention in the court below was that this deed was fraudulent because intended to hinder and delay the creditors of her husband, William McLaughlin. But the deed to Willis was not contested on that ground, and if the title was in him absolutely, he had a perfect right to make a gift to Mary McLaughlin, and the creditors of her husband could not attack her title. All the title of William McLaughlin was divested by the first sheriff’s sale. The proceedings upon the judgment against William McLaughlin, and the sale upon that subsequent to the deed to Willis, could vest no title in the plaintiff. We find no error in the rulings of the learned court below upon questions of evidence. Surely the declarations of a vendor, after he has parted with the land, cannot be received to impeach the title of his vendee.</p>
