He was a stout, fleshy and healthy man, fifty-seven years old. In the month of December 1874 he was employed in the capacity of night watchman, at what is called the Hickory Swamp coal breaker, about one mile from his residence. He was in the habit of going to his work about six o’clock in the evening, and returning about seven o’clock in the morning. On the 18th of December 1874 he was alive and in good health. About six o’clock in the evening of that day he left his home, and was last seen on his way to his place of employment. The next morning, at about six o’clock, whilst it was yet dark, his dead body was found, lying upon the floor near the stove, in the engine-house of the breaker, partly on his face and shoulder. He wore a black soldier overcoat, the cape of which partly covered his head. A club three and a half to four feet long was found near him and partly under the stove; a hammer that had been used at the breaker was found by his right hip. Both these instruments had blood and hair on them. There was a dinge upon the clock which hung against the wall or post, the face of which was injured, and the glass broken and strewn over the floor. The lower hinge of the door that led into the room was broken, and there were marks upon it. An examination of the body showed eight wounds in the' scalp, apparently produced by some blunt instrument, and a fracture of the right forearm.</p>

O’Neil and the stranger went away, McManus, the prisoner, accompanying them for some distance. He returned, and some time after took his gun and dog and told the family he was going hunting, and if any person asked for him, to say that they did not know how soon he would return. He returned late in the day, went up to his room and went to bed about eight or nine o’clock. He was there in the morning.

Davis, a witness for the Commonwealth, in substance, testified to two different conversations that he heard between the prisoner at the bar and John O’Neil, and also a conversation between himself and the prisoner. The conversation between the prisoner and O’Neil took place at the mines at Hickory Ridge Colliery, in the month of May or June 1876. The witness said that at the time he heard the first conversation between the prisoner and O’Neil, “that McManus came out from his shutes and headings. This was in the gangway, and asked me if I had seen Jack O’Neil, and I said I had, he was up in his breast. So McManus jumped right on to the ladder, as we call it, that we had to go up. McManus went up the breast forty-five or fifty yards and seen O’Neil. I went up to my own place. I had two shutes, and I went up the inside shute, the next but one to O’Neil’s. When I went up I creeped over through the pillars until I got in the next pillar of the inside shute where O’Neil was working. There I heard a conversation in regard to this Hesser case. Jack O’Neil said to Peter McManus, I was awful afraid last night, 'hearing that the coal and iron police was around after the Mollies. I was awful afraid I would be taken for the Hesser murder case. McManus said, no danger, never fear, Jack. O’Neil said, some of the rest of them may squeal. Then McManus says, no danger Jack, repeating it. If you are taken, die grit, like a goat, and I will do the same. Then McManus talked to him again, and told him, never fear, again. Then Jack said, look how little Kerrigan squealed [referring to the evidence of Kerrigan in Campbell <em>11. </em>Commonwealth, 3 Nórris 187 Rep.]. Then McManus said to Jack O’ Neil, Michael J. Doyle and Edward Kelley were damned fools for shooting Jo'hn P. Jones in open daylight. If they had taken the dead hour of the night at it, like we did; and <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>it was the deathly blow I give old Hesser on the side of the head what fetched him. Then they moved over a little distance to the outside shute. Then O’Neil says, I am very sorry for it. Then Peter McManus says, I ain’t a God damned bit; it would be death if we didn’t do it, and before I would violate my oath I would die and do it again; and it wouldn’t be no worse anyway. That was all I heard at that time.” The witness stated that he heard another conversation between O’Neil and Peter McManus and another person, in reference to this Hesser murder. “ That was a few days afterwards, in Hickory Ridge Colliery, in the mines, just above the battery, what we call the stoppings for ventilation, to turn it up. They were about eight yards from the gangway, O’Neil, McManus and Pickey Donnelly were together. O’Neií said, I wonder if them fellows that passed us heard our conversation whén we were planning the Hesser murder case ? we were rather full, and talked rather loud. McManus said to Jack O’Neil, keep quiet, mouth shut; it is all dark only to our own party. I wasn’t more than about twelve feet from them.” The witness then related a conversation between himself and the prisoner. “Him and me was going to work in the morning; we were going from Henry Long’s to Hickory Ridge Colliery; only us two were together. He asked me what was the news in the “ Shenandoah Herald” last night. I said that Tom Foster is hunting up those things fast, those Mollie Maguire cases; and the murderers of Hesser ain’t very far from here, I said to him. Then he got excited in a minute, and asked me what did I know about it, and I told him he need not get mad, I was only tilling him what was in the paper. He told me to keep my God damn mouth shut. I kept my mouth shut; I said no more.”</p>

It does not charge that the prisoner was a member of any secret or open society or organization, or that he conspired, contrived or colluded, with the members of any secret or open society or organization to commit the crime charged in the indictment; nor that he was counselled, directed or commanded by any society or organization having authority over him, to commit the crime of which he stands charged. The prisoner is without notice through the indictment or otherwise that he would be called to defend himself against such charges and allegations as are contained in the Commonwealth’s offer.

The only effect of the evidence proposed by the offer, would be to show the character of the prisoner, by inferences drawn from his membership with such criminal society. The character of the prisoner cannot be attacked by the Commonwealth; the prisoner alone may deal with that question, in the first instance by availing himself of his good character as a circumstance of defence; and not until this is done by the prisoner can the Commonwealth enter upon the question of character by direct inquiry, or by indirect means tending to that purpose.</p>

It is true it was offered to prove that the crimes were committed-through the instrumentality of the ‘Mollie Maguire’ organization, but in the case of Hester et al. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 4 Norris 139, counsel made the objection that the testimony showed that the society in question had no agency in the alleged conspiracy, but that the prisoners acted on their own individual responsibility; that evidence, therefore, as to the nature of the society and the relations prisoners sustained to it, was incompetent and irrelevant. The court below admitted the evidence, confining it to facts that existed in October 1868, and declined to admit proof of specific acts of other members of the society, either before or since that time. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Judge Woodward, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: ‘Was this testimony relevant? It was not designed to be used to establish the commission of any independent crime, nor was its object to affect general character or to repel inferences from adversary facts. Its purpose was to <em>explain the relations existing </em>between the conspirators. The' reason, motive and opportunity of their combined action and the nature of the tie that bound them together.’ In that case, ten men, including the three prisoners, met in a saloon on <em>the </em>evening of the 16th of October 1868, and openly arranged the details of their plan to attack and-rob Mr. Rea on the following day. Hester was the body-master of the Locust Gap division, and the nine others were members of the order. A motive, that is to rob and obtain money, had been proved, and there was no real necessity for proving any other motive; but the evidence was proper, in my opinion, for the purpose of explaining the relations that existed between the conspirators, the reason and opportunity of their combined action, and the tie that bound them together. In the present case, the Commonwealth relies on the confessions, o“r rather what may be more properly termed, the self-criminating statements of the prisoner, in connection with circumstances and facts tending to show that they were true, made to the witness and also to one or more of the alleged conspirators, at a time when they thought no one was present. It is proposed to prove that the prisoner was the body-master of Shamokin division at that time, and John O’Neil was a member of the society. That the witness was county delegate of the same order at the time, and that the declarations and admissions of the prisoner referred to, were made to the witness, and the declarations had with and made to- John O’Neil, <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>were made and had as a fellow-member of said organization. This being in the offer, I do not see how the evidence can be rejected. The evidence already in, clearly tends to show that both the prisoner and O’Neil were some of the parties connected with the murder of Hesser. On the occasion when Pickey Donnelly was present, it would seem plain that they talked of a previous planning of the Hesser murder. O’Neil expressed his fear that some persons who had passed, the night they had planned the Hesser murder, had heard them, as they had talked rather loud, when McManus told him to keep quiet, that it was all dark only to their own party. This evidence, if believed, clearly tends to show that there had been a previous conspiracy, a planning of the Hesser murder, and that these parties were the conspirators. If the kind of testimony received in the case of Hester, was proper to explain the relations, reason and motive, and opportunity of combined action, and the nature of the tie that bound them together; that is, ten men who had conspired to murder Rea, why is it not proper to show the relations, &amp;c., of two or more men who had done the same thing with regard to the murder of Hesser ? The statement of the conversation between the prisoner and O’Neil, as detailed by Morgan P. Davis, tends to show that they were talking together as members of the society. McManus was the body-master and O’Neil a member. O’Neil expressed his fear of being taken for the Hesser murder, as the police were up after the Mollies, and the reply of McManus tends to show that they were acting under some secret oath or obligation. It is not shown that the object was to rob Hesser, and without some. evidence of the kind offered, the act is perfectly inexplicable. With it, perhaps, the declaration and evidence already in, may be understood. The Commonwealth cannot expect to convict the prisoner, on his own confessions and declarations alone, and must show some facts or circumstances independent of them, tending to show that they were true. I have come to the conclusion to admit the evidence, confining the testimony to facts that existed in the month of December 1874, at the alleged time of the Hesser murder, but it is not permitted to prove specific acts of others, members of the society, either before or since that time. *A11 specific acts of others than those charged with complicity in the murder of Hesser, are excluded.”</p>

The offer, without suggesting that Peter McManus was induced by the society to commit the crime, or in any way to connect the society with it, simply proposes to make the prisoner responsible for lawless and criminal acts of men said to belong to a secret society of which he was a member, men with whom he is not brought in connection and did not know. The offer does not hint that O’Neil, the “strange man,” or McManus, or either of the other persons who were in company with them, committed this or any other crime, nor is there an attempt made to show that the society of Mollie Maguires planned the murder of Hesser. Upon what principle of law or rule of evidence then, was this testimony admitted-? Members of the Ancient and Honorable order of Free and Accepted Masons, Odd Fellows, of every secret order, and of the Christian chúreh, have, from time to time, committed crimes, but will it be pretended that, therefore it would be admissible to put in evidence the fact that a man, on trial for murder, belonged to either of these institutions, for the purpose of charging him with the responsibility of the criminal acts of others; or that there was a tendency to commit crime in these societies.</p>

The admission of this evidence is justified by recent decisions: Carroll et al. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 Norris 107; Campbell <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, Id. 187; Hester et al. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 4 Id. 139. The facts contained in this offer and admitted in evidence were relevant, direct and essential. Without them the conduct of the prisoner and his associates would be explicable on no recognised or rational theory regarding the motives and modes of human action. With them a jury was enabled to understand how the brutal and cold-blooded conversation in the house of Henry Long could have been had without scarcely any concealment or reserve; how a horrible murder could have been committed the following night, and how the killing could be talked over so fully among themselves in the recesses of the mine.</p>

The offer of evidence contained in the first assignment of error is almost identical with that in Hester <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 4 Norris 139, and comes clearly within the ruling of that case. The fact that the prisoner was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, commonly known as Mollie Maguires, and the character and purposes of the order, were competent for the purposes for which the evidence was offered, viz., to show motive for the commission of the murder, and to explain the relations existing between the witness, Dennis E. Canning, the prisoner and John O’Neil, who was jointly indicted with the prisoner for this murder, and why the admissions, declarations and conversations referred to in the offer and already in evidence, were made and had. There was the same mystery about this murder that has marked so many similar crimes in the mining regions for some years past. There was nothing to indicate that robbery was the object, and without some evidence to throw light upon it, the act was inexplicable. There is the same mystery in the conversations between the prisoner and O’Neil, as detailed by the witness Morgan P. Davis. The prisoner was a body-master and O’Neil a member of the order. Their conversation tended to show that they were both members of a secret, oath-bound organization. The witness Canning was county delegate of the order at the time; the declarations and admissions of the prisoner referred to were made to the witness, and to John O’Neil, as fellow members <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>of said organization. This accounts for the making of statements and declarations, which under other circumstances would seem almost incredible; but under the light of this evidence the jury were enabled to understand why the confidences were made. It is also to be observed that when the offer was made the evidence already in tended strongly to connect the prisoner and O’Neil with the crime. On the occasion when Pickey Donnelly was present, it is evident their conversation referred to a previous planning of the murder. O’Neil expressed his fear that some persons who had passed them upon the night when they planned the murder of Mr. Hesser, had heard them, as they “were rather full and talked rather loud,” when McManus replied, “keep quiet and mouth shut; it is all dark only to our party.” The evidence tends to show a conspiracy; that the murder was carefully planned beforehand, and that the defendant was one of the conspirators. I need not pursue this branch of the case further. I have said enough to show that the evidence was competent under Hester <em>v. </em>Commonwealth and prior cases.</p>
