F. Smith 202. Gray, agent, received money belonging to Frankish, principal. He deposited it in the Penn Bank and took its promissory note for the amount. That note or certified check, call it what you please, belonged to Frankish, and the bank could not pay Gray after being informed of Frankish’s superior right. The facts in this case are stronger even than those in the case cited. Here, after being informed of the plaintiff’s superior right, the bank promised' not only not to pay the agent, but not to pay either one of two other parties, who, it was informed, were in collusion with the defaulting agent. A payment to Gray himself would not have been a good payment. But it is alleged that the payment to Howells was a good payment, because he was a bona fide holder of the bank’s obligation without notice of any defence. If the bank expected to defend on that ground it should have made proof of the necessary facts. Having agreed not to pay Howells, it could justify a payment to him only by showing such facts as would have disclosed his unanswerable right to recover against the bank. The presumption of his hona fide ownership of the check had already <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>been overthrown by explicit notice that the check was fraudulently issued, and had Howells been making claim against Frankish, the burden would have been on him undoubtedly to show title: Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Boggs &amp; Kirk, 4 Casey 294. The bank had no better title than Howells had. If Howells had no defence against Frankish, how could the bank have any? That the burden of showing Howells’s ownership under the circumstances was on the defendant seems clear from the ruling of this court in Robinson <em>v. </em>Hodgson, 23 P. F. Smith 210-11.</p>

    <p id="b344-7" data-blocks='[["BL_344.9",344,[220,876,1165,1288]]]'>But for a single error this judgment might have been affirmed. The learned judge instructed the jury (see 14th assignment) that “ if you believe the testimony in regard to Gray’s transactions, then the burden of proof is on the bank to show that they did pay the money over to a bona fide holder for value.” This was laying a burden on the bank it was not entitled to bear. The check in question was the bank’s own check, that is, it was issued by the cashier at the request of Mr. Gray, against whose account it was charged. The check was strictly commercial paper, and every holder is presumed to be a holder for value. It was presented at the counter of the bank by and paid to Mr. Howells. Hoes the mere fact that the bank had been informed by Frankish of Gray’s fraud, and of his suspicion that Howells was in collusion with him, accompanied with a request not to pay the money to Howells, change the burden of proof? It is conceded that if Howells was a bona fide holder the payment was good. Against the legal commercial presumption of his bona fides there was nothing but the suspicion of Frankish that he was in collusion with Gray. In addition to the legal presumption referred to there'was the affidavit of Howells that he received said check for value. If, as was asserted, it was taken merely as collateral for a pre-existing debt, the authorities are clear that he would not be a holder for value. But if taken in payment, or for a new consideration, the case might be different. This, however, will be a question for consideration upon a new trial in the court below. For the present it is sufficient to say there was not enough in the case to throw upon the bank the burden of showing the.bona fides of Howells’s holding. It had a right to rely upon the presumption in his favor. The burden of showing that Howells was not a bona fide holder rests upon those who assert it.</p>
