While there are some Pennsylvania cases that assert such a rule, it will be found, on examination, that those cases proceeded upon a decision to that effect made by Chancellor Kent, in Clute <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Johns.%20Rep.%20612" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Johns.

He gave his note for the balance due fipon the mortgage, when it was yet in the hands of McCullough, and when it did come into Gill’s possession he took no steps to have the arrangement endorsed either upon the papers or upon the record. The mortgage, bond and certificate of no defence were left in Gill’s possession as security for the note; in other words, they were to be of full force until the note was paid. Thus was Gill left with power to dispose of the mortgage as he might see proper, and he, having exercised this power, by assigning to Mrs. Lewis, at the same time keeping secret the collateral arrangement involving the note, I cannot see how, in justice, she is to be made to suffer. But the carelessness of McCain is further manifested in this: when the note was renewed, in August 1876, he neglected to examine the record, or to demand sight of the papers, by either of which he might have informed himself of the assignment, and in this manner he let slip the opportunity to secure himself Furthermore, he renewed this paper from time to time until Gill ran off and left him to pay it to his endorsee.
