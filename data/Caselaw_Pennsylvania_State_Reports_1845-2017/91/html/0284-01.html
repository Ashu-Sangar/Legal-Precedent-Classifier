Rut the court below in this case held differently, and permitted the defendant- to give in evidence his sheriff’s deed, and threw upon plaintiff the burden of contradicting the recitals in the deed. The defendant, not altogether relying on the correctness of this, undertook to corroborate it by offering a part of the record, to wit, the ff. fa., levy, inquisition and condemnation, and then rested. It is contended he was bound to offer the whole record. The Act of Assembly of June 16th 1836, Pamph. L. 769, requires that the sheriff should serve this notice of inquisition upon the defendant, if he be found within the county; if not, then to his agent or attorney, if they be known; if not, then to fix a handbill upon the premises.</p>
