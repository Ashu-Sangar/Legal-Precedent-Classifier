Held, that the Act of 1863 should not be so construed as to preclude the district from defending on the ground that the insane person did not reside therein. <em>Held further, </em>that it was competent and relevant for the county to show that he had a legal settlement in said township.</p>

Act June 13th 1836, Pamph. L. 541. Under that act no claim for necessaries furnished a pauper, however pressing his wants, can be recovered from the district, unless such order be issued prior to commencement of the action; but, in proper cases, it may be procured after the pauper has been relieved. Warrants for the removal of a pauper from the district when he becomes chargeable, to the one w'here he has a legal settlement, must be issued in like manner. From the orders of the justices an appeal may be taken, by an aggrieved party, to the Court of Quarter Sessions. It is contended on the part of the plaintiffs in error, that the county had no right of action, because the place of settlement of Michael Calinan had not been determined, as required by the statutes for relief of the poor; and this is the main question presented in the numerous assignments. Calinan was committed to the West Penns3rlvania Hospital by the Court of Quarter Sessions of Forest county, and it was certified by said court that he had a legal settlement in Harmony township; but notice of the inquiry, or of the adjudication, was not given to the overseers of the poor of that district.</p>

L. 539, makes it the duty of the court to inquire and ascertain certain facts, and if the insane person be declared in indigent circumstances, to certify to the managers of said hospital the legal settlement of such insane person, if he have any, and if he have no legal settlement in this Commonwealth, then to certify the place of residence of such insane person, which place shall then be held to be his place of settlement; and the county wherein such indigent insane person had his settlement or residence shall be liable to said hospital for the expenses of the care an'd maintenance and removal, and in case of death, of the funeral expenses of such insane person, with remedy over against the proper poor district. Section 14 of said act declares that a certified copy of the commitment shall be evidence in any suit brought by the hospital to recover the amount due; and no defence shall be taken by any county or poor district in any suit against them to recover the amount of such expenses, on account of any defect or informality in such 'commitment or record thereof, nor by reason of the failure of the court making such commitment to give the notices or certificates required by the first and eleventh sections of the act. By section 12, the county where such insane person had a legal settlement or residence, or from which he was sent, is made liable to said hospital for the expenses incurred in his care, as provided by law, and “ in all such cases the county so chargeable shall have remedy over against the proper township, <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>city, or poor district where, by existing laws, such township, city, or poor -district is liable for the support of such insane persons, or against any relative required by law to maintain him or her; and the overseers or guardians of the poor of any such township, city, or poor district shall also have remedy over against the property of such insane person, or against any relative required by law to support or maintain hinj or her.” Where the indigent insane person has no legal settlement in the Commonwealth, then his place of residence shall be held to be his place of settlement; and, if the evidence fails to show a settlement, but a residence be proved in a poor district, said district is liable for the expenses, which liability can only be thrown off when such district discovers and adduces proof of his place of legal settlement.</p>

This is by action at law: Danville Poor District <em>v. </em>Montour, 25 P. F. Smith 35. The law declares the requisites of a legal settlement, and when mere residence shall be deemed a settlement for the purpose of support, and prescribes the modes of procedure for relief of paupers. The procedure is not the same for the indigent insane, when originally commenced in courts of record, as for others, and ought not to be. Laws relating to the hospitals for the care and custody of these unfortunate persons, provide the remedy for recovering the expenses from their relatives, or the proper poor district. When the county has paid the hospital, neither reason nor anything in the statute which binds the county to pay, permits the district, liable for the expenses, to defend against an action by the county, in any other way than it could have done had it been sued by the hospital. ■ No part of the statute requires the county to wait some procedure before two justices of the peace before bringing suit; nor any additional adjudication by the Quarter Sessions.</p>

The 14th section specifies the defences which shall not be made, and the ex parte adjudication as to settlement is not declared to be final against the district. For some purposes, the record of the proceedings of the Court of Quarter Sessions in the matter of the lunacy of Michael Calinan was evidence; it was not relied on to prove his settlement in Harmony township.
