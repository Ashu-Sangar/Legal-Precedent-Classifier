There was no direct evidence to show that a fraud had been practised upon him in obtaining the certificate. It appeared by the testimony of Hutchison that he received no consideration from Gill for these instruments; that they were given to Gill to raise funds to enable Hutchison to carry out a contract, but that Gill never gave him any money whatever therefor.</p>

The certificate was not competent evidence unless it was first invested with all the qualities that constituted it an estoppel. The proof of the signature of Hutchison to it was the first step in that direction. But the equitable plaintiffs must go a step further, and show that they relied on it and acted on it. They must show that by reason of the statements contained in it they were induced to pay to Gill the sum agreed on for the mortgage. Unless this certificate, and it alone, produced this force and effect on the mind of W. W. Lewis, the qualities of an estoppel were not imparted to it, and if not, it served no purpose in the trial of the issue, and was irrelevant: Bispham’s Equity, sect. 291; State <em>v. </em>Laies, <a href="/mo/52/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Mo. 396" data-case-ids="972197" data-case-paths="/mo/52/0396-01">52 Mo. 396</a>; Weaver <em>v. </em>Lynch, 1 Casey 449; Eldred <em>v. </em>Hazlett, 9 Id. 307; Wilcox <em>v. </em>Howell, <a href="/ny/44/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="44 N.Y. 398" data-case-ids="507299" data-case-paths="/ny/44/0398-01">44 N.

It is an acknowledgment that he has received full consideration. It is indeed most usual to execute such writings when no consideration has been received, and the sole object of the mortgage is to raise money by the sale of it. It would be in the highest degree inequitable to allow the mortgagor to set up that there was fraud in obtaining the mortgage, or in a misappropriation by the mortgagee of the money raised by the sale. It is unnecessary to say what would be the effect of actual fraud in procuring the “ no defence” paper. In this case there was no evidence of such fraud.</p>
