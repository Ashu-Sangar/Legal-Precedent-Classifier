On the 20th day of October 1875, said Marshall and Cummins went to the prothonotary’s office, and in the presence of the prothonotary, altered the said judgment-note, by striking therefrom the syllable “out” in the word “ without,” making the note read <em>'with </em>interest, no alteration being made in the entries of the case in the continuance and judgment dockets, but at the same time and place Marshall signed a confession of judgment of revival to Cummins for the sum of $2860, viz.: “ $2000 debt, and $360 interest from 29th July 1872,” and costs, which judgment of revival was, by direction of Cummins in writing to the prothonotary, entered of record to No. 291, November Term 3875. Cummins then returned the four promissory notes of $100 each to Marshall.</p>

Execution issued against him and his real estate was sold on a writ of fi. fa., to No. 47 of January Term 1876. The real estate was sold for $2860, and an auditor was appointed to distribute the fund, before whom Cummins claimed the whole amount of the revived judgment, with interest from July 29th 1875, and a feigned issue was asked and granted.</p>

On the hearing, counsel for creditors contended that the facts as found by the jury, constituted such a legal fraud as would vitiate the Cummins judgment, and that it must be postponed to all lien-creditors who intervened between the entry of the original judgment and the entry of the revival. The auditor, however, decided against this view of the case, and gave the Cummins judgment $2177.26, the full amount of the same with interest. The court confirmed the report of the auditor, when Kimmell, with the other subsequent judgment creditors, took this appeal and assigned this action of the court for error.</p>

As Marshall was present and consented to the change, in the note, the judgment is valid against him, but in this controversy, the appellants stand in the same relation to Cummins and Marshall as if they were sureties in the note. Had they been sureties in the note, and the alteration had been made without their assent, they would have been released, although the principal would still be liable — even though the alteration had been made without any fraudulent design: Marshall et al. <em>v. </em>Gougler, 10 S. &amp; R. 164; Fulmer <em>v. </em>Seitz, 18 P. F. Smith 237; Hopkins <em>v. </em>Reed, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pitts.%20Rpts.%20120" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Pitts. Rpts. 120">1 Pitts.

The revived judgment was the one on which the money was first claimed, and it was claimed on this by virtue of the lien of the original judgment, the record of which had been altered and defaced. The effort to now recover on the judgment as first entered is the same in principle as the attempt to recover on an increased note the original amount of the note, the very thing that was condemned in Neff <em>v. </em>Horner and Fulmer <em>v. </em>Seitz, <em>supra.</em>
