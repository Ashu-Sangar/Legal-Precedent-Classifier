The third line of notes were those of John Gruber, Henry Gruber and Samuel Newell, which began on the 3d of October 1873, and after a succession of renewals, on the 27 th of November 1875, was closed by a judgment in favor of the bank of $348.30, which was not paid until the 28th of August 1876, and was then paid out of proceeds of sale of real estate principally of Henry Gruber. The fourth line of notes were those of Cook &amp; Co. and John Gruber, endorsed by E. Eulofson, which Eulofson had discounted at the bank, but charged the discount against John Gruber on a settlement Eulofson had with Gruber. On these several lines of notes, which constituted the greater part of the plaintiff’s claim, discount was charged generally at the rate of twelve per cent. Sometimes the discount was paid at the time of the purchase of the notes, sometimes it was reserved out of the amount given for the notes, and at other times it was added into the notes, and went along the line of successive renewals, till they were closed in judgments or paid. Excluding the notes of Cook &amp; Co. and John Gruber, that Eulofson had discounted, the whole amount of discount actually paid on the several notes claimed by plaintiff between the 4th of March 1874, and the 4th of March 1876, was $217.70; the whole amount added into or reserved out of notes <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>during the same period, was $62.50 ; the whole amount of discounts paid between the 4th of March 1870, and the 4th of March 1874, was $1064.72; and the whole amount added in or reserved out during the same period, was $264.28, and the greater part of all this was on the joint notes of John and Henry Gruber. The plaintiff in this case claimed this last line of notes was discounted for his benefit, and Henry Gruber claimed that the discount was paid by him, and had brought suit for the same discounts, which was offered to be proven by a certified copy of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States, in the case of Henry Gruber against the same defendant, but the testimony was excluded by the court.</p>

      <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>The evidence in this case establishes the fact that John Gruber was the beneficial owner of the notes produced on the trial, and that for him alone were they discounted by the bank. It hence follows that any claim that Henry Gruber might have set up to the penalty, growing out of the illegal discounts, was without foundation, and was properly disregarded.</p>
    <p id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[246,624,1160,559]]]'>In like manner, the learned judge of the court below, properly ruled that the banks created by the several Acts of Assembly, given in evidence by the defendant, were not banks of issue. These acts specifically define the powers of the several corporations created by them, but among them is not found the power to issue circulating notes, commonly known as bank notes. But the rule is, that as corporations are purely statutory creatures, powers not specifically granted are to be taken as withheld, and cannot be raised by implication unless they are ancillary to, and necessary for, the proper exercise of those granted. The defendant, then, having failed to show that the banks referred to were banks of issue, it cannot, under the act of Congress, claim the right of those banks to take more than six per cent, interest on loans and discounts.</p>
    <p id="b384-7" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[244,1184,1160,471]]]'>All other points, put to the court below, were well answered, except the defendant’s tenth point and others involving the same principle. That point reads as follows: “ There can be no recovery, under the evidence, as to moneys claimed in this action, except as to the penalty.” The answer was: “ We think there can be recovery for such moneys as were paid by the plaintiff as interest or discount where such moneys so paid were in excess of six per cent.” By a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States this would seem to be error, but it is an error of this court rather than of the court below, for our decisions in Lucas <em>v. </em>The Bank, and kindred cases, were followed.</p>

The defence, inter alia, was that Barnett and Whitesides, the drawees and acceptors of the bill in suit, were borrowers from the bank as early as January 11th 1866; that the indebtedness was continuous and unbroken from the 8th of April of that year; that it was at. no time less than $4000, and at one period amounted to $36,000; that at the time of the assignment of the drawees to Barnett &amp; Craig, who intervened and were made parties, th.e indebtedness was $28,000 on bills of exchange; that the bank had taken not less than $5000 in excess of the legal rate of interest; that for evasion the bills were arranged in series, and that each series was terminated, from time to time, by refusing to renew and discounting a new bill, the proceeds of which were applied in payment of the prior terminating one; that the bank had received satisfaction of all the bills but the one in suit, and that there was nothing due from the defendants. On demurrer, this plea was ovei’ruled by the <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>court below, and this ruling was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Mr. Justice Swayne, delivering the opinion of the court, in commenting upon the statute, says: “ Two categories are thus defined, and the consequences denounced:—</p>
    <blockquote id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[188,527,1161,88]]]'>“ 1. Where illegal interest has been knowingly stipulated for but not paid, there only the sum lent without interest can be recovered.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[188,613,1160,175]]]'>“ 2. Where such illegal interest has been paid, then twice the amount so paid can be recovered in a penal action of debt, or suit in the nature of such action, against the offending bank, brought by the persons paying the same or their legal representatives.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b385-7" data-blocks='[["BL_385.7",385,[189,785,1159,207]]]'>And further on in the same opinion: “ In the first defence the payment of the usurious interest is distinctly averred, and it is sought to apply it by way of offset or payment to the bill of exchange in suit. In our analysis of the statute we have seen that this could not be done.”</p>
    <p id="b385-8" data-blocks='[["BL_385.8",385,[188,1001,1160,175]]]'>From this it appears certain that neither by set-off nor original action can interest, over legal rate, paid to a national bank, be recovered except by the way of penalty, as prescribed by the act of Congress of June 3d 1864.</p>
    <p id="b385-9" data-blocks='[["BL_385.9",385,[183,1174,1164,208]]]'>We have but to add, that the case of Bletz <em>v. </em>The Columbia National Bank, 6 Norris 87, rules that the courts of this state have jurisdiction of suits to recover twice the amount of illegal interest, under the provisions of the national statute above referred to.</p>
