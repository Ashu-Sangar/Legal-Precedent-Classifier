Without any notification from Robertson, Gill, on June 24th 1873, sold the mortgage to McCandless, and at the instance of Gill, Hay, his law partner, assigned it to the purchaser. McCandless, in the negotiations, treated with Gill alone, and afterwards received from Gill the instalments of interest on the mortgage, as they severally fell due. Whether or not Robertson received from Gill any of the consideration paid by McCandless for this assignment, was disputed. There was no testimony to show positively that Robertson did know anything about the transaction, other than the fact that in 1875 he procured a policy of insurance on the property mortgaged, which contained this recital: <em>“ </em>Loss, if any, first payable to James McCandless, mortgagee.” Subsequent to the assignment, Gil'l, who was the agent and attorney of McCandless, and retained the mortgage in his custody, inserted therein a clause waiving the right of exemption under the Act of February 25th 1873, Pamph. L. 161, which act was repealed by the Act of April 10th 1873, Pamph. L. 712. He also modified the <em>“ </em>certificate of no defence” so as to make it appear as an extension by the mortgagor of the mortgage for one year. Gill absconded in 1877, and the interest remaining unpaid, McCandless brought this suit on the mortgage.</p>

    <p id="b245-11" data-blocks='[["BL_245.13",245,[177,1480,1173,910]]]'>This is a case of scire facias on a mortgage. It is conceded that the plaintiff in error executed the mortgage described in the writ of scire facias. He also executed the bond recited in the mortgage. They both bear date the 18th of June 1873, and the mortgage was acknowledged on the 24th of the same month. On the 18th of July following he executed “a certificate of no defence.” It distinctly referred to the bond and mortgage, stating where the latter was recorded, and declared that it, together with the bond accompanying the same, “is justly, fully and entirely owing and payable according to the terms and conditions thereof. And I hereby also further certify to any person or persons who may desire to purchase the same, that I have no drawback, claim, set-off, or other defence of any kind whatever, to the payment of any part of said mortgage, either principal, interest or commissions, when due and payable or collectible by the terms and conditions therein recited as aforesaid.” On the day after its date he duly acknowledged this certificate. He placed these three written instruments in the hands of Mr. Gill, in anticipation of needing money and with the view of a subsequent negotiation of the mortgage. Hay, to whom the mortgage was executed and the bond payable, was the law partner of Gill.</p>
    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[234,374,1166,216]]]'>
      <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>The jury has found, and on evidence amply sufficient to justify the finding, that in July following, McCandless, the equitable defendant in error, purchased the mortgage of Gill in good faith and for a valuable consideration, and took an assignment thereof from Hay.</p>
    <p id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[225,590,1174,1248]]]'>It matters not that Gill may have sold the mortgage and caused it to be transferred before he was authorized so to do, under the private instructions given him by the mortgagor; nor that he failed to account to the latter for the money received therefor. These facts are insufficient to defeat a recovery by the assignee. The papers which the mortgagor executed and placed in the hands of Gill, not only impliedly authorized a sale of the bond and mortgage; but invited purchasers by expressly declaring that he had “no defence of any kind whatever:” Ashton’s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 153; Hutchison <em>v. </em>Gill, <em>post, </em>page 253. This written declaration fresh from the mortgagor having been shown to the assignee when he was about to purchase, it is idle to say he should have gone to the mortgagor personally and inquired if there was any defence. This certificate was addressed “ to all whom it may concern.” It could not have been more effective and conclusive notice to one about to purchase, that the mortgagor had no defence, if it had been addressed to the purchaser by name. The main purpose of the execution and delivery of such a certificate is to dispense with personal inquiry. At the same time it gives certainty to the declaration and perpetuates the evidence thereof. It is a well-settled rule that where one of two innocent persons must suffer from the tortious act of a third, he who gave the wrongdoer the means of perpetrating the wrong must bear the consequences of the act. By placing the papers in the hands of his agent and attorney, the mortgagor gaye him the means of making sale of the mortgage and of obtaining the money of the assignee. The fraud which Gill may thereby have practiced on' the mortgagor, cannot operate to the prejudice of the innocent and good faith purchaser.</p>

They were made by Gill. He was either the agent of the mortgagor, intrusted by him with the papers, and authorized to sell the mortgage, so that the act of the agent became the act of his principal, or he was not such agent, and not intrusted, and not authorized to act for the mortgagor, in which case the alteration was the act of a stranger.

The alteration in the mortgage was by adding a clause waiving the benefit of a specific Act of Assembly, which, in fact, had been repealed prior to the execution of the mortgage. As then the act mentioned had no validity whereby the mortgage could be affected, an attempt to waive its provisions had no effect. It was simply an immaterial act which in no manner prejudiced the mortgagor. As, therefore, the legal effect of the mortgage remained the same, the alteration did not avoid it: Hunt <em>v. </em>Adams, <a href="/mass/6/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="6 Mass. 519" data-case-ids="2000752" data-case-paths="/mass/6/0428-01">6 Mass. 519</a>; Nevins <em>v. </em>DeGrand, 15 Id. 436; Gardinier <em>v. </em>Sisk, 3 Barr 326; Miller <em>v. </em>Gilleland, 7 Harris 119; Miller <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 Casey 244; Burkholder <em>v. </em>Lapp’s Executor, 7 Id. 322.</p>
    <p id="b247-6" data-blocks='[["BL_247.6",247,[205,958,1172,220]]]'>The substance of the alteration in the certificate is a recital that the mortgage was renewed and extended another year. It was the declaration of a fact intended for the benefit of the mortgagor. It was made by Gill long after the purchase by the assignee. It did not destroy the title which ‘the latter had previously acquired.</p>
    <p id="b247-7" data-blocks='[["BL_247.7",247,[208,1178,1171,345]]]'>It may be further observed, that after this alteration appears to have been made, the mortgagor obtained policies of insurance on the building covered by the mortgage, in which was inserted the clause, “loss, if any, first payable to James McCandless, mortgagee.” The plaintiff in error thereby clearly evinced knowledge, and implied ratification, of the assignment. It is unnecessary to consider all the assignments separately. We discover no error in the answers and charge of the learned judge.</p>
