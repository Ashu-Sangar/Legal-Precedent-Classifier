On or about February 18th 1873, Crawford, Chamberlin &amp; Co., who had already made some small payments on account, remitted to Hyatt $1000 <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>in cash and two drafts, both dated February 18th 1873, and drawn on and accepted by themselves, for the balance. Hyatt received this remittance, and credited it on their account on February 21st, after charging them with the interest or discount on the drafts.

The plaintiff, therefore, had a clear prima facie case, and the burden was on the defendant of proving that the draft in suit was the acceptance of the second firm, and that it was received by the plaintiff in absolute payment of the original debt.</p>
    <p id="b200-8" data-blocks='[["BL_200.10",200,[207,1179,1165,431]]]'>For the purpose of proving these facts, the letters referred to in the bills of exception, were offered and admitted.

Viewing the testimony in its most favorable light, there was no evidence from Avhich the jury was justified in finding that plaintiff agreed to take the acceptance as absolute payment and thus release defendant from an acknowledged liability. When it' is claimed that a creditor has agreed to accept the note or obligation of another, and in consideration thereof release his debtor, the proof of such novation should be at least clear and satisfactory. In this case it can scarcely be said that there was even a scintilla of evidence to show that the acceptance was taken in absolute payment. Since the scintilla doctrine has been exploded, both in England and in this country, the preliminary question of la.AV for the court is, not whether there is literally no evidence, or a mere scintilla, hut whether there is any that ought reasonably to satisfy the jury that the fact sought to be proved is established. If there is evidence from which the jury can properly find the question for the party on whom the burden of proof rests, it should be submitted; if not, <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>it should be withdrawn from the jury : Ryder <em>v. </em>Wombwell, Law Rep., 4 Exch. 39.</p>

Standing alone, as it did when offered to the court, the letter would appear to be relevant, and perhaps material, but when read in connection with that of March 26th 1873, to which it is a reply, it contains nothing to justify the inference sought to be drawn from it. In the last-mentioned letter, Crawford, Chamberlin &amp; Co., after referring to the dissolution of the firm, say: <em>“ </em>Both Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnston, who compose the Co., being wealthy men, insure to all creditors the payment of paper at maturity, as well as guaranteeing the entire indebtedness of the concern.” There is not the slightest intimation here that defendant was released; on the contrary, his continued liability is distinctly recognised. They then refer to the stock purchased from plaintiff, out of which the indebtedness to him arose, and propose to return a portion of it. It was in reply to this proposition that plaintiff wrote, “ it was all settled for in your acceptances I now hold.” Even if this could be. regarded as an admission that the acceptances were those of the second firm, it surely cannot be construed to mean that they were taken in absolute payment. The language of the letter, especially when considered in connection with the one to which it is a reply, does not justify such an inference.</p>

It is quite clear-that neither of these letters refers to the old account on which plaintiff’s claim is based, nor to the acceptances by which that account was balanced on his books. They evidently relate to subsequent transactions having no connection with plaintiff’s claim-against the first firm.</p>

The plaintiff’s testimony was distinct and positive that no such transaction occurred, and there is nothing in the correspondence, given in evidence, to contradict him. He says he drew on the first firm, by whom the debt was contracted, for a sum sufficient to cover their indebtedness, and when he received their acceptances he credited them and thus balanced the account. There is nothing in the.testimony, when properly considered, that is inconsistent with the continued liability of the defendant.</p>
