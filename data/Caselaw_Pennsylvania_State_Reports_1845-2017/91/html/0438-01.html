As applied to repairs of houses and mills, the doctrine laid down is correct: Dech’s Appeal, 7 P. F. <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>Smith 467. But this does not apply to woodland or arable land: Gregg <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20209" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 209">9 W. &amp; S. </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20209" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 209">209</a>; </em>4 Kent’s Com. 370. As to <em>improvements, </em>the doctrine is exactly the reverse: Crest <em>v. </em>Jack, <a href="/watts/3/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts 238" data-case-ids="1841292" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0238-01">3 Watts 238</a>; Gregg <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 197" data-case-ids="12169304" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0197-01">9 W. &amp; S. 197</a>; Dech’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 472; Story’s Equity, sect. 1235. It would seem, on reason and authority well settled, that one tenant in common cannot be held liable for any improvements made by his co-tenant without his authority or consent, and yet in this case the court charged that he could be so held if the improvements were “ absolutely necessary for the enjoyment of the property,” and submitted to the jury the inquiry whether the stumping claimed for was necessary for the reasonable <em>enjoyment </em>of the eighty acres, an inquiry which a jui’y of farmers would naturally and almost inevitably answer in the affirmative. In this there was palpable error.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[203,948,1164,304]]]'>The error in the sixth specification is the use of the word “credits,” and is a serious one. It opened the door for the allowance of any matters of set-off sworn to by defendant. It relieved the jury from the obligation to find a direct application as payments. To thus leave a jury to hunt up <em>credits </em>in addition to payments, on a judgment ooened on the single plea of payment, is unprecedented.</p>

The defendant had 'the .possession thereof and had expended money in pulling and removing stumps. He ■claimed to be allowed on this judgment for one-half of the suri <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>so expended. If he had agreed to pay his proportion, he would undoubtedly have been liable therefor, but whether it should apply on this judgment, presents a different question. The court, however, proceeded to say that if the plaintiff had not so agreed, yet he was liable if the work was absolutely necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the farm. In so charging, the learned judge overlooked the distinction between buildings and lands. A tenant in common is liable to his co-tenant for repairs that are absolutely necessary to houses and mills already erected and in being, which fall into decay; but the rule does not extend to woodland nor to arable land: Crest <em>v. </em>Jack, <a href="/watts/3/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts 238" data-case-ids="1841292" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0238-01">3 Watts 238</a>; Gregg <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 197" data-case-ids="12169304" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0197-01">9 W. &amp; S. 197</a>; Lech’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 467. It is not, however, sufficient that the defendant may have a claim against the plaintiff which might be enforced by action. That fact alone does not compel the latter to apply it on the judgment. Mutual indebtedness does not work an extinguishment of the respective debts without an application of them to each other by the concurrent acts of the parties: Carmalt <em>v. </em>Post, <a href="/watts/8/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Watts 406" data-case-ids="1848507" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0406-01">8 Watts 406</a>. Nor does the statute of defalcation apply the demand of one party to that of the other, so as to produce either payment, satisfaction or extinguishment of either: Hinkley <em>v. </em>Walters, Id. 260; Same <em>v. </em>Same, 9 Id. 179; Gilmore <em>v. </em>Reed, 26 P. F. Smith 462. The mere fact that a person has a debt against his judgment-creditor, gives no right against the will of the one holding the judgment, to apply the debt as a payment thereon. In actions to which the defalcation act applies, the defendant may, under the plea of payment, give in evidence any claim founded on contract, which he has against the plaintiff, although it has no connection with the claim on which the action is brought, and in case it exceeds the plaintiff's, recover a judgment for the difference. This rule does not apply on a judgment being opened after having been regularly entered. The judgment does not, thereby, become subject to set-off generally. If the defendant has a va-lid claim against the plaintiff exceeding the amount of the judgment, he cannot recover a verdict for the excess. He may be permitted to attack the validity of the claim on which the judgment is founded; the good faith of the transaction connected with the consideration; subsequent payment of the debt or equitable discharge therefrom. In some manner, either at law or in equity, the subject-matter of defence, must have attached to the judgment or the consideration on which it rests : Harper et al. <em>v. </em>Kean, 11 S. &amp; R. 280. No court would open a judgment merely on proof that the defendant had an account against the plaintiff equal to the amount of the judgment. The plaintiff may also have an account against the defendant; but whether he has or not, that is not the proper manner of adjudicating the account. It follows, therefore, the assignment is sustained, and also so much of the remaining assignments as are in conflict with this opinion.</p>
