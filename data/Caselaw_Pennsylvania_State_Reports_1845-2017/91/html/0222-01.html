    <p class="headnotes" id="b222-8" data-blocks='[["BL_222.7",222,[211,817,1173,348]]]'>Two minors died intestate, unmarried and without issue, leaving their father as their heir-at-law. The latter was imbecile and possessed, of no estate. A sister of the deceased nursed them through their last illness and prepared the bodies for interment. For these services she presented a claim to the administrator, who refused payment on the ground that the charges were exorbitant, and paid the balance to the father as distributee, but 'filed no vouchers. Held, that the claim being for necessaries, and the parent unable to pay it, the estate of the minors was liable; that the payment by the administrator to the father was at his own risk; that under the evidence the claim, ?45 for each' minor, was not exorbitant.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b222-12" data-blocks='[["BL_222.13",222,[212,1533,1176,735]]]'>Appellant filed his final account, which set forth that he has distributed the entire estate to Anton Hilline, the father and heir-at-law of the deceased, but filed no vouchers to said account. The estate was small, consisting of about $150. It appeared that the deceased were minors, unmarried and without issue. Their father, by reason of his habits of intemperance, was imbecile, impaired in health, and possessed of no means. The deceased had been sick, for several days prior to their death, with malignant typhoid fever, and required constant care and attention. Mary Hopkins, a sister of deceased, had boarded and nursed them through their last illness, and had • prepared their bodies for interment. She presented her claim for these services to the administrator, prior to the alleged distribution to the heir, payment of which was refused on the ground that it was excessive. She then excepted to the account of the administrator, and the court sustained her exception, surcharging the accountant with the sum of $45, in each case, and costs. Werner then took this appeal.</p>
