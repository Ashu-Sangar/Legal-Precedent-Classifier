Dahle obtained a judgment, before Justice Adam Black, against R. M. Shaw, and soon after issued an execution to John Young, a constable, who, by virtue thereof, regularly levied upon and sold, as the property of Shaw, certain rig timbers, about thirty-two pieces, to Philip Gloss, for $40. Gloss immediately gave the property in charge of a man he had hired to watch it, and the same day, or the next, began to have <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>it hauled to his home, which he accomplished within a few days. No notice of any adverse claim was given at the constable’s sale, nor did Gloss have any knowledge of any such claim till after he had hauled a considerable part of his purchase away. Hoofnagle and Walker were Gloss’s hands who did the hauling; John Young was the constable who sold the property. After he had delivered the timber to Gloss he had nothing to do with it. On part of Black, the plaintiff, it was claimed that he had bought the timber of Rockwell and McCool on the 16th of April 1877, who, .he claimed, had owned it. On part of defendant it was alleged the property had been cut off Shaw’s land, taken out and hauled by himself and Peters, Rockwell and McCool, as his employees, and that the property belonged to Shaw at the time of the levy. At the time of the levy and sale of the timber by the constable, it was lying at the side of the public road where it had been dropped as it had been hauled out of the woods — the public road at that place running over lands of Black, the plaintiff. The constable’s sale of the timber was made at the place where it was lying, the constable standing on the timber at the time, and immediately after the sale he delivered possession to Gloss, the purchaser, and gave him a bill of sale and receipt for the money.</p>

Under these facts, it is said there can be no recovery against Gloss and his hands. Plaintiff replies that there can be a recovery against all, for the reason set forth in his points as follows:</p>

It would be different with the constable if he seized the property under an execution on a judgment obtained against another. For further answer we refer to the answer to defendant’s point.</p>

Where goods of a stranger to an execution, are seized and held under it, they are in the custody of the law, and while so held the owner cannot take possession, nor maintain replevin. The law does not attribute constructive possession to the owner of property which it has in its own control by means of an officer. A mere purchaser at a sale by the officer, who receives from him immediate possession, is not responsible in trespass. His <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>purchase does not of itself make him a participant in the wrongful seizure, and he is not made a trespasser by relation: Hammon <em>v. </em>Fisher, <a href="/grant/2/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Grant 330" data-case-ids="227453" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0330-01">2 Grant 330</a>; Ward <em>v. </em>Taylor, 1 Barr 238; Talmadge <em>v. </em>Scudder, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20517" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Wright 517">2 Wright 517</a>. Young, the constable, seized and sold the timber. After such turning over and delivery as he immediately made to the purchaser, he did nothing. He had no interest in the timber and was not liable on an implied warranty of title. Before the sale, Gloss and his employees had in nowise participated in the acts of the constable. There is no evidence that Young and the other defendants acted in concert at any time. Can it be pretended that a public sale of goods in custody of the law, by its officer, without more, makes the officer and the purchaser joint trespassers ? Were this so then in all cases where the officer had committed a trespass in the seizure, the purchaser would be jointly responsible; but it is settled, as we have seen, that he is not. “ Separate acts of trespass where there is no concert will not authorize a joint recovery, although the injury be common and produced in part by each of the acts complained of:” Bard <em>v. </em>Yohn, 2 Casey 482.</p>
    <p id="b422-6" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[191,1178,1164,861]]]'>We think the defendants’ point should have been affirmed, for there was some evidence of the facts therein assumed. The timber was alongside the public road and on the plaintiff’s land. Gloss testified that the constable delivered it into his possession at the time of sale; that he hired a man to watch it, soon as bought; that he commenced hauling it the same or the next day, and had it nearly all away before he knew Black claimed it, and then Black permitted him to haul the rest. If this be the whole truth he was not a trespasser. Bidders at a sheriff’s or constable’s sale, made on the land of the owner of the goods, are not trespassers. Nor are buyers who take away their purchases as they leave. Nor is the purchaser of timber, situate as this was in reference to a public road, who, without violence, continuously holds possession for the necessary time for bringing teams to haul it away. But in another view of the facts, which the jury might well have found and to which their attention was directed in the charge, Gloss and his employees were trespassers. What the learned judge said, in answer to the point, was entirely fitting to this view, applied to all the defendants except Young, and just what ought to have been said, even if he had granted the instruction prayed for.</p>
