Whether Courts may disregard the vital function of corporate self-governance by second-guessing the decisions of corporate directors and failing to provide the required deference to their decision simply because the court may not agree with the decision?\nb. Whether a court may simply usurp the role of corporate directors by negating the presumption of good-faith to the decisions of directors required by law by simply asserting, without requiring any proof thereof, a conflict of interest by the directors?\nc. Whether funds, whose original source was a public entity, retain their public character once the public entity distributes those funds to a private corporation in satisfaction of an obligation, and after the private corporation had retained those funds as corporate assets, and after that corporation utilized the corporate assets for a corporate purpose?",
