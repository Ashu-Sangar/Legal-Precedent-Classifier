In this case, appellant asserts that he established jurisdiction under both of the following exceptions:\n(i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States; [and]\n(ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence....\nId. at \u00a7 9545(b)(i) and (b)(ii). Appellant\u2019s pleadings below did not establish the necessary jurisdiction pursuant to either of these subsections and, accordingly, this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain this third PCRA petition.",
