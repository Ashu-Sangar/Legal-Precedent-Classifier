The jury concluded, with respect to the circumstances of the murder, that the aggravating factors (committing murder to prevent testimony in a possible criminal proceeding regarding a felony and committing a killing in <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>perpetration of a felony) outweighed the mitigating circumstances (“character and record”).

Appellant argues that because there was insufficient evidence to prove that the killings had been committed during the perpetration of these felonies, the jury considered non-existing aggravating circumstances when it imposed the sentence of death. Appellant also challenges the ruling of the suppression court that allowed certain evidence to be presented against him at trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>

Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Trial, 5/1/08, at 188, 197-98. The girl and her family lived in a rural corner of Pennsylvania, and she was reported missing on the day of her disappearance. <em>Id. </em>at 197-98. The Pennsylvania State Police immediately initiated a search that was later joined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), other agencies, canine units, and civilian searchers. Police interviews with neighbors and other witnesses revealed that G.B. had been riding her small all-terrain vehicle (“ATV”) on the morning of her disappearance and was last seen heading in the direction of a neighboring horse and pleasure farm that she had previously visited with her parents’ permission. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 211-12, 241. The owners of the farm were away that morning; however, their sole hired farmhand, Appellant, Jeffrey Robert Martin, was working alone there at the time. N.T. Trial, 5/5/08, at 872, 874. Among Appellant’s duties was the collection and spreading of manure. N.T. Trial, 5/1/08, at 309.</p>

He did not make any incriminating statements and was released. N.T. Trial, 5/5/08, at 699-701. However, late in the day on June 17, <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>2006, and four days after G.B. had been reported missing, her ATV was found partially buried in a creek bank and under a top layer of manure near a horse trail on the farm where Appellant had very recently spread manure as part of his duties. N.T. Trial, 5/1/08, at 58; N.T. Trial, 5/5/08, at 685-86, 747-48, 778. Appellant, who was working on the farm at the time, was immediately placed under arrest for tampering with evidence, giving false information, and hindering a police investigation (N.T. Trial, 5/5/08, at 714, 749, 800), and taken to an area of the farm near to where the ATV had been found. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 584. Appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and then told that searchers had found G.B.’s ATV. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 628, 637, 687, 749. At that point, Appellant stated to a state trooper that there were new trails “down there” and that he had spread manure in that area. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 750, 780. The trooper pointed out to Appellant that he had never told Appellant where the ATV had been found. <em>Id. </em>at 750. Nevertheless, Appellant stated that “she’s not down there,” and then denied that he knew where G.B. was. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 688, 750, 781. Shortly afterward, Sergeant Kevin T. Kolson of the Pennsylvania State Police arrived on the scene, asked if Appellant had been read his rights, and, assured that he had been, asked Appellant where G.B. was, while jabbing his fingers into Appellant’s chest. <em>Id. </em>at 750-51. Appellant did not respond. <em>Id. </em>at 629-30, 639, 751, 784. No further questions were asked of Appellant at that time; however, he was then moved to a nearby area that was not as crowded with personnel searching for the missing girl. <em>Id. </em>at 751, 785. There, after the state troopers began questioning him, Appellant stated, “I think I need an attorney,” and all questioning immediately stopped. <em>Id. </em>at 587, 645, 690-92, 717, 751-52, 785-86.</p>

Standing near the patrol car <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>was a local constable who knew Appellant. The constable asked Appellant if he was ok. <em>Id. </em>at 670. Shortly thereafter, Appellant volunteered that he could save everyone some time, stating that only the ATV was down in the creek area, not G.B., and that she was somewhere else. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 671. The constable called to the nearby state troopers to inform them that Appellant had something to say. <em>Id. </em>at 602. Upon returning to the patrol car, the state troopers re-advised Appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(Id. </em>at 602, 678, 694-95, 754), transported Appellant back to the more quiet area of the search perimeter, once again advised Appellant of his right to remain silent and to consult with an attorney, and then requested that Appellant sign a written waiver of those rights as given him. <em>Id. </em>at 652-54, 696, 721. Appellant stated that he did not want to sign anything without consulting a lawyer. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 721. However, Appellant immediately volunteered that he been approached by a “fat, bald guy in a white truck,” who offered him $100 to help bury an ATV. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 591-92, 696, 720, 755. The troopers perceived this statement to be a falsehood, became frustrated with Appellant, and returned with him to the staging area on the farm. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 591-92, 696-97, 721-22, 755-56.</p>

Appellant first stated that he could show the troopers where the girl’s helmet and shoes were buried <em>(Id. </em>at 576, 761-62), and shortly afterward stated that he could show the troopers where G.B. was located. <em>Id. </em>at 762. Appellant told the troopers that they would need a backhoe to “recover” the girl. <em>Id. </em>at 578, 703, 726, 762.

Trial, 5/5/08, at 706-07, 796; Commonwealth Exhibit 90 at 2. He stated that he then went to get a farm vehicle called a mule, on which he placed the girl’s body and took it to the area of the farm where the burn pile was located. N.T. Trial, 5/5/08, at 707; Commonwealth Exhibit 90 at 2. He then went back to the farm shed to retrieve a backhoe on which he placed two bags of lime. Commonwealth Exhibit 90 at 3.

Appellant then took G.B.’s ATV, helmet and shoes to another area of the farm and buried the ATV in a hole near the creek that wound through the farm; he buried the helmet and shoes in two nearby locations. Commonwealth Exhibit 90 at 4. He also stated that he had had to flatten the tires on the ATV to make it fit in the hole he had dug, but that, even so, the vehicle remained unconcealed, so he returned to the ATV burial site with manure, which he piled and spread on top of the mostly buried ATV.

In addition to the evidence of the police investigation and arrest of Appellant as outlined above, including Appellant’s confession, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Dr. Cyril Wecht, the forensic pathologist who had performed the autopsy on G.B.’s body. The Commonwealth also introduced into evidence Dr. Wecht’s autopsy report. Dr. Wecht’s findings led him to conclude that G.B. had died by manual strangulation. Additionally, Dr. Wecht testified that the body showed evidence, in the form of an area of acute or fresh hemorrhage, that G.B.’s vagina had been penetrated by a blunt object consistent with a penis. N.T. Trial, 5/1/08, at 388-89. Dr. Wecht opined that the injury had occurred “anywhere from just shortly before death or at the time of death or maybe an hour or two.” <em>Id. </em>at 391. Although he could not exclude the possibility that the injury inside G.B.’s vagina could have been caused by some other type of blunt object, such as a finger or rounded pen, Dr. Wecht opined “with reasonable medical certainty, not absolute certainty but with reasonable medical certainty, that the most likely instrumentality or object that would have produced [the] injury would have been a penis,” based on the coinciding evidence that G.B.’s pants and panties had been pulled down and that she had died by manual strangulation. <em>Id. </em>at 421-23.</p>

Appellant explained that on the morning G.B. went missing, he had spied a white truck at the end of the farm driveway attended by a “young looking guy with long brown hair.” N.T.

Appellant <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>testified that this person stated that he had run out of gas and, in addition, he also had a four-wheeler (ATV) that he wanted to “get rid of for the insurance.” <em>Id. </em>at 877. The person then offered Appellant $100 to help him dispose of the ATV, an offer that Appellant “really didn’t think about” but “just went along with,” offering to this stranger that “there might be somewhere ... where we could ... get rid of it.” <em>Id. </em>at 877. Appellant then testified that as he backed his farm mule up to the rear of the truck in order to load the ATV onto it, he noticed that the man threw some other items onto the mule. <em>Id. </em>at 878. The two then purportedly discussed the need for shovels to bury the ATV; additionally, the man took an interest in the farm’s backhoe that was in a shed and walked over to the shed to inspect it. <em>Id. </em>at 879. After the inspection of the backhoe, the man then purportedly climbed back onto the mule, which by now had the ATV on its back, and the two men drove the mule down the driveway, with a detour to obtain a shovel from the barn, and onto a horse trail to search for a place to deposit and bury the ATV. <em>Id. </em>at 881-82. The two found a spot, and with shovels, dug a hole. They then deposited the vehicle into the hole after flattening the tires. <em>Id. </em>at 882-85. While Appellant was burying the ATV with dirt extracted from the hole, the man told Appellant that he had a helmet and a pair of shoes that he also wished to dispose of, which items apparently had accompanied the men on their ride on the mule. <em>Id. </em>at 885.

We held that such evidence was not sufficient, as a matter of law, to establish the defendant’s guilt of rape beyond a reasonable doubt, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Wiley, </em><a href="/pa-super/288/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="288 Pa.

In the instant case, the evidence did not present to the jury only a fifty percent probability that G.B.'s vaginal injury was caused by a penis, or a fifty percent probability that the injury was caused by a finger or other object.</p>

We also note that the record confirms the Commonwealth’s contention that Appellant failed to object to the trial court’s permitting the penalty-phase jury being tasked with considering the aggravating factor of whether Appellant had committed murder in perpetration of a felony. Rather, Appellant objected to this aggravator premised only on the contention that the trial court, during the guilt phase of trial, should have granted his motion to permit the jury to consider a verdict of felony murder instead of first-degree murder, and thus the trial court had erred by <em>then </em>denying such relief. Appellant did, however, directly object to the jury’s consideration of the other aggravator asserted by the Commonwealth, to wit, that Appellant had killed the victim in order to prevent her from testifying as a prosecution witness against Appellant in regard to his commission of a felony. <em>See </em>N.T.

Finally, Appellant notes that the trial judge instructed the jury that a death sentence could be commuted to a life sentence, but that commutation is a rare occurrence. Appellant apparently considers this charge incorrect or inadequate because Appellant asserts, without further argument or any citation to authority, that no capital defendant has had his or her death sentence commuted to life imprisonment "within the last 40+ years.” Appellant’s Brief at 21-22.</p>

Appellant also contends that he was prejudiced by the trial judge’s instruction that there existed the possibility that Appellant's sentence of death, should such a sentence eventuate, could be commuted. Appellant did not object to this instruction, and the trial judge's instruction correctly stated that the possibility of commutation fell under the category of rare events.

While the majority makes the most out of the fact that Appellant was the person with the most legitimate, routine access to the location where the victim’s all-terrain vehicle was found and the instrumentality by which it had been concealed, <em>see, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion, at 649-51, 101 A.3d at 722-23, the fact remains that the area was an open one to which Appellant’s access was non-exclusive. I also do not regard Appellant’s presence alone on the farm on the day of the victim’s disappearance as materially altering this assessment. Accordingly, I simply do not believe that any “reasonable inference” of Appellant’s involvement either with the victim or the all-terrain vehicle rises to the level of probable cause to effectuate an arrest. While certainly the suspicions of investigating officers were legitimately aroused by the discovery of the all-terrain vehicle (or amplified, since, in fact, Appellant appears already to have been a person of interest in the investigation), <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>I believe that further investigation was necessary to support an arrest, with or without a warrant.</p>
