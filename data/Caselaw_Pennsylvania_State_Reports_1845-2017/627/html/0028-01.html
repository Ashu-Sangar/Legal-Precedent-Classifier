For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Commonwealth Court correctly determined that Appellant, Kennett Square Specialties (“Employer”), bore the burden to prove that the loss of earning power of its injured employee, David Cruz (“Claimant”) was due to his lack of United States citizenship or other legal work authorization in order to obtain a suspension of his workers’ compensation disability benefits. We further hold that Claimant’s invocation of his Fifth Amendment<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> right against self-incrimination when questioned at the hearing before the Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) did not constitute substantial evidence of Claimant’s alleged lack of legal authorization to be employed in the United States, and thus could <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>not, standing alone, furnish sufficient evidence for the WCJ to suspend Claimant’s benefits.

On July 19, 2008, as part of his work duties, Claimant was loading 15-20 pound barrels onto his truck when he felt something snap in his lower back. He promptly informed Employer of his injury and sought medical treatment from a physician designated by Employer. Medical examination revealed that Claimant had a herniated disk. As a result of this injury, Claimant’s treating physician did not release him to resume his normal work duties, but, instead, ordered that he be restricted to lifting no more than 15 pounds, and also ordered that he undertake no work activities involving stretching, bending, or reaching. Employer, upon receipt of this information, informed Claimant that it had no position available which was compatible with these restrictions.

With regard to the question of Claimant’s citizenship status, the WCAB recited the general legal principle that a party cannot carry its burden of proof in a civil proceeding merely by relying on an adverse party’s failure to testify. Thus, the WCAB found that the Employer did not meet its burden of proof in the instant matter regarding Claimant’s citizenship status solely by relying on an adverse inference created by Claimant’s failure to answer Employer’s questions on the subject of his citizenship, as such an adverse inference, alone, was not sufficient evidence. The WCAB ruled that, since Employer provided no independent evidence to support its contention that Claimant was an undocumented worker, Employer was not relieved of its burden to show Claimant’s earning power or job availability. Accordingly, the WCAB reversed the WCJ’s order to the extent that it suspended Claimant’s disability benefits.</p>

Employer maintains this burden remains on the injured employee to show his disability throughout the entirety of proceedings on a claim petition and never shifts to the employer; thus, Employer argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in holding that the burden of proof shifted to it. Employer reasons that, because a workers’ compensation judge has the authority under Section 413 of the WCA, 77 P.S. § 772, to suspend or terminate disability benefits if the evidence so indicates, the judge may do so in proceedings on the employee’s claim without the necessity of the employer filing a separate petition to terminate, and, thus, if the injured employee fails to present competent evidence in a claim proceed<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>ing that his disability existed at all times, the employee’s benefits may be modified, suspended, or terminated.</p>

In any event, <em>Brehm </em>is distinguishable from this case as, in that case, the employer arguably met its burden of proof because it submitted substantial independent evidence of record regarding its investigation which revealed that the injured employee was receiving additional income from another company, which he did not reveal to his employer while also receiving workers’ compensation. To establish this fact, the employer submitted into evidence at the hearing on its petition documentary evidence of this fact in the form of the employee’s W-2’s from the company. <em>Brehm, </em><a href="/a2d/782/1077-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="782 A.2d 1077" data-case-ids="9473436" data-case-paths="/a2d/782/1077-01">782 A.2d at 1083</a>. Additionally, the employee, himself, through his own testimony corroborated the fact that he had received this extra, undisclosed income. At that point, once evidence of record had been introduced at the hearing to support employer’s allegation that the employee’s benefits should be suspended, the burden shifted back to the employee to rebut that evidence. Because employee failed to produce any evidence to rebut these facts, employer’s evidence remained unchallenged on this matter, and, standing alone, was sufficient for it to carry its burden of proof that a suspension was warranted. By contrast, in the case at bar, Employer presented no independent evidence of Claimant’s work eligibility status, nor was there any other evidence of record on this point. Due to the fact that Claimant, as discussed above, did not have the burden of proof on the suspension question, it was not obligated to produce evidence in this regard. <em>Wintermyer v. W.CA.B.

Employer notes that Claimant testified that he was born in Ecuador and had lived in the United States for 10 years. Employer asserts that this fact, coupled with Claimant’s refusal to testify regarding his immigration status, provided substantial evidence for the WCJ’s conclusion that Claimant is an undocumented worker. Employer distinguishes our Court’s decision in <em>Harmon </em>on the grounds that the school district in that case had the burden of proof, which it did not carry, and Employer reasserts its claim, which we rejected above, that it did not have the burden of proof in this matter.

Claimant refutes Employer’s assertion that he was either uncooperative in producing evidence regarding his work eligibility, or that such evidence was solely within his control. Claimant argues that it was not his burden to produce evidence on this point, and he further contends that Employer had other means by which it could introduce evidence regarding Claimant’s work eligibility status since it possessed Claimant’s 1-9 form and supporting documents, which Claimant was required to furnish to Employer prior to employment under federal law and retain for three years.

It is undisputed that the sole “evidence” regarding Claimant’s employment eligibility relied upon by the WCJ was Claimant’s invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to questioning from Employer’s counsel. We find that the Commonwealth Court properly determined, based on our <em>Harmon </em>decision, that the adverse inference drawn by the WCJ from Claimant’s invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination did not, by itself, constitute substantial evidence to support the WCJ’s finding that Claimant was not a United States citizen, and was not otherwise authorized to work in this country.</p>

I respectfully dissent because I remain of the opinion workers’ compensation benefits “should yield to the injunction of [congressional policy against employment of unauthorized aliens ...

I am not incognizant of the likelihood employer was aware of claimant's immigration status at the time claimant was hired and of the concomitant policy in permitting employer to "have its cake and eat it too” by shielding it from liability under the Workers’ Compensation Act for being complicit in, if not an accomplice to, hiring unauthorized aliens contrary to federal immigration law. However, tougher employer sanctions for engaging in such behavior are to be found in the General Assembly, not this Court, and unauthorized aliens are not without recourse for injuries caused by their employer’s negligence, because ”[i]f an unauthorized alien is ineligible for benefits under the [Act], it follows that the employer should not enjoy the immunity from suit granted by 77 P.S. § 481 ... and [the employee] may sue the employer for injuries caused by the negligence of the employer.” <em><a href="/pa/570/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="810 A.2d 99" data-case-ids="270252,9307221" data-case-paths="/pa/570/0464-01,/a2d/810/0099-01">Id.,</a> </em>at 111 n. 4; <em>see also </em>77 P.S. § 481(a) (emphasis added) (stating “liability of an employer <em>under this act </em>shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employes”).</p>
