As part of achieving that aim, the RRRI Act requires the trial court to determine at the time of sentencing whether the defendant is an “eligible offender.” 61 Pa.C.S.A. § 4505(a). If the court finds the defendant to be an eligible offender, or if the prosecuting attorney waives the eligibility requirements under Section 4505(b), the trial court must calculate minimum and maximum sentences, and then impose the RRRI minimum sentence, which “shall be equal to three-fourths of the minimum sentence imposed when the minimum sentence is three years or less,” or “shall be equal to five-sixths of the minimum sentence if the minimum sentence is greater than three years.” <em>Id. </em>§ 4505(c).

Specifically, Appellant observes that the RRRI Act expressly <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>lists crimes precluding a defendant from receiving a reduced sentence, including: offenses involving deadly weapons in Section 4502(2); personal injury crimes enumerated under Section 103 of the Crime Victims Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> in Section 4503(3); certain sexual offenses in Section 4503(4); and specific drug offenses in Section 4503(6). He notes that none of these include the crime of burglary. As burglary is omitted from the other offenses enumerated in the RRRI Act, Appellant asserts that the legislature intended to exclude it as a disqualifying crime; thus, he claims that burglary cannot then qualify as “violent behavior” under Section 4503(1). Appellant further asserts that, although burglary is characterized as a violent crime in Section 9714(g) of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9714(g), burglary has traditionally been viewed as a property crime, as evidenced by the Pennsylvania Uniform Crime Report, which lists burglary as a property crime. <em>See Executive Summary Crime in Pennsylvania 2012 Annual Uniform Crime Report, </em>http://ucr.psp.state.pa.us/UCR/ Reporting/Annual/pdf2012/2012ExecutiveSummary.pdf (last visited Aug. 20, 2014).</p>

Rather than relying on <em>Gonzalez, </em>Appellant suggests that we follow the Superior Court’s approach in <em>Commonwealth v.

He claims that these eases followed the common law maxim <em>“expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>” — the specific inclusion of one matter in a statute implies the exclusion of others — and reasons that only offenses which are specifically named in the RRRI Act may exclude an offender from eligibility.</p>

Rather, <em>amicus </em>contends that, because Section 4503(1) requires “violent behavior” and does not refer to mere threats of violence, only those burglaries during which violence was actually employed exclude an offender from RRRI Act eligibility under Section 4503(1). Accordingly, <em>amicus </em>suggests that, in determining whether a defendant’s first-degree burglary conviction constitutes disqualifying violent behavior under the RRRI Act, we should consider the individual facts surrounding the burglary to ascertain whether violence was actually employed.</p>

In support of its interpretation, the Commonwealth notes that construing Section 4503(1) as pertaining only to offenses which are specifically enumerated in Section 4503 would render the “history of present or past violent behavior” subsection superfluous, contrary to established tools of statutory construction. Rather than interpreting the statute <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>in such a fashion, the Commonwealth asserts that “[e]very statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 13 (quoting 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a)). Applying those principles of statutory interpretation, the Commonwealth suggests that the legislature intended the language of Section 4503(1) to be sufficiently broad so as to include offenses or circumstances not specifically provided for in the other provisions of the RRRI Act; otherwise, the Commonwealth argues, the General Assembly would simply have written an exhaustive list of disqualifying offenses.</p>

In so asserting, the Commonwealth observes that we have consistently viewed first-degree burglary as a violent crime in other contexts — such as the recidivist minimum sentencing provisions in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9714(g) and the significant history of violent convictions aggravating circumstance for capital sentencing under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(9) — based upon the basic principle that a person’s non-privileged entry into a structure creates the potential for dangerous resistance and the “use or threat of violence to the person.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 17 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

Although the courts below relied extensively upon <em>Gonzalez, </em>which, as discussed above, held that second-degree burglary was not "violent behavior” under Section 4503(1), we note the question before us concerns only whether <em>first-degree </em>burglary is violent behavior under that section. Thus, we need not, and do not, address whether second-degree burglary may constitute violent behavior under the RRRI Act.</p>

While the current burglary statute differs structurally from the prior version under which Appellant was charged, the current statute follows the same scheme of distinguishing between first-and second-degree burglary based upon the potential for confrontation posed by overnight accommodation of the structure entered and/or the presence of another individual at the time of entry. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>

Of course, although we generally treat burglary as a violent crime, as Chief Justice Castille noted in his Concurring Opinion in <em>Small, supra, </em>the General Assembly is within its power "to define [burglary] differently for other purposes" in other statutes. <em>Small, </em><a href="/pa/602/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="980 A.2d 549" data-case-ids="4195000,7294253" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0425-01,/a2d/980/0549-01">980 A.2d at 580</a> (Castille, C.J., concurring).
