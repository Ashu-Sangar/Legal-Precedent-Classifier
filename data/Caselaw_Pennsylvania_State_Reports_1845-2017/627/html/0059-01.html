For the reasons that follow, we find that the victims, although imprisoned in their home, nevertheless, were confined in a place of isolation, thereby satisfying our Commonwealth’s definition of kidnapping. Thus, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate Appellee Randal Rushing’s judgments of sentence.</p>

By way of background, Wes and Cynthia Collier lived in a home in Scranton, Pennsylvania with their children and stepchildren: 16-year-old Leslie Collier; 19-year-old Samantha Hintz; 22-year-old Dustin Hintz; and 22-year-old Matthew Collier, who was handicapped and could not walk.</p>

On this date, five days before the murder, Appellee became angry when he found Justin Berrios, age 22, Samantha’s former boyfriend and the father of her 2-year-old child Tristan, sitting on Samantha’s bed with her. Four days later, on July 16, 2008, Cynthia Collier drove Appellee to T.J. Maxx in Pittston, Pennsylvania, his place of employment, to work his <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>6:00 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. shift. Samantha worked the same shift, but drove herself to work. After working their shifts, Samantha gave Appellee a ride home. At 10:30 p.m., Appellee left for a friend’s house, and Cynthia retired for the evening at 11:00 p.m. This evening, Justin was at the Collier home watching Tristan.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[210,661,1151,1709]]]'>In the early hours of July 17, 2008, Appellee returned to the Collier home and stabbed Justin to death. Later, it was determined that Justin had died due to 14 stab wounds, 7 of which were to the neck. Thereafter, between 4:00 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., Leslie awakened his mother Cynthia, and told her that someone had run into his room and' stabbed him, and that he was bleeding profusely. Cynthia went to the kitchen to call 911 when she discovered the telephone was not in the kitchen. Dustin ran up from the basement after hearing his mother, and helped his brother to the floor in the hallway. Appellee then appeared from the living room with a gun and ordered everyone onto the floor. When Cynthia asked Appellee what he was doing, he replied “I’m giving Samantha something she’ll remember.” N.T., 9/27/10, at 185. Appellee took Leslie into the kitchen, where he ultimately died from his wounds, while Cynthia and Dustin were on the floor of the hall holding one another. Appellee returned and ordered Cynthia into her son Matthew’s room. Appellee ordered Cynthia to lie on the floor, which she did. Appellee then handcuffed Cynthia’s hands behind her back. Appellee also ordered Dustin into Cynthia’s bedroom and told him to lie on the floor. Cynthia could hear Appellee beating Dustin. Cynthia began to vomit, and Appellee reentered Matthew’s bedroom, put a gun to her head, and told her to “shut the fuck up” or he would kill her. <em>Id. </em>at 193. He then tightened her handcuffs. Appellee then took a shirt from Matthew’s dresser and tied Matthew’s hands with the shirt and his feet with a computer cable. Cynthia observed Appellee take a red hammer from a toolbox, then leave Matthew’s bedroom, then she heard Appellee began to strike Dustin with the hammer. Ultimately, Dustin died of blunt force trauma to the head. Appellee returned numerous times to Matthew’s room to check on Matthew and Cynthia.</p>

Samantha checked on her son, and then Appellant instructed her to go to her bedroom. Upon entering the bedroom, Appellee forced her onto the bed and lifted up a sheet and displayed Justin’s dead body, which was lying next to the bed. Appellee stated, “Do you know what happened to Justin? He didn’t make it.” N.T., 9/28/10, at 59. Appellant then tried to force Samantha onto her stomach on the bed, and, when she resisted, he put his gun to her head and told her to “get on [your] fucking stomach.” <em>Id. </em>at 56. Appellee tied Samantha’s hands behind her back with a necktie and tied her feet with a belt. He climbed on top of Samantha, kissed her, ran his fingers through her hair, and told her that he loved her. After leaving and then returning to the bedroom, Appellee said that he should rape her. He sat next to her and grabbed her left breast and gave her a “hickey” on the right side of her neck.</p>

He indicated that if the police did not find him, he was going to kill three individuals from work. At some point, Appellee also entered Matthew’s room and told Matthew and Cynthia that Wes Collier would be the next person in the house and that they could yell for help when he arrived. He then stated, “No, fuck it. It’s six o’clock now. If I ain’t back by 6:30 you guys can do whatever the hell you want.” N.T., 9/27/10, at 209.</p>

The police ultimately located Appellee, who was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and third-degree murder in conjunction with the killing of Justin, Leslie, and Dustin. He also was charged with multiple counts of kidnapping and robbery, and one count of indecent assault. The Commonwealth’s charging of Appellee with second-degree murder was based upon the kidnappings, not the robbery charges, as the underlying felonies.</p>

Even though in their own home, the court concluded that the victims were nevertheless confined for a substantial period “in a place of isolation,” thus, satisfying the offense of kidnapping. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2901(a).

Specifically, the court first noted that it was required to strictly construe criminal statutes in favor of a defendant, and reasoned that kidnapping did not include the incidental movement of a victim during the commission of a crime that did not substantially increase the risk of harm to <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>the victim, and did not apply to situations where confinement was a subsidiary incident to another crime. The court, finding the victims’ confinement in this matter was incidental to Appellant’s crimes of murder, robbery, and indecent assault, as they were not secreted in, for example, an attic, closet, or basement, and as they were aware that Wes Collier would be arriving at the residence, concluded Appellee’s convictions for kidnapping and second-degree murder could not be sustained. The Superior Court found it unnecessary to remand the case for resentencing, however, as the trial court sentenced Appellee for kidnapping and did not impose any sentence on the felony murder convictions, as it was foreclosed from imposing sentence on both crimes under the merger doctrine, and since Appellee had been sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, vacating his kidnapping sentence would not, in practice, affect the overall sentence imposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

According to the Commonwealth, Appellee confined his victims for a substantial period of time in a place of isolation to further the commission of other felonies, and to further his own flight, as well as to terrorize the victims. Noting that the Crimes Code tracks the Model Penal Code (“MPC”), the Commonwealth offers that even “one’s own apartment in a city might be regarded as a ‘place of isolation,’ if the circumstances of detention make discovery or rescue unlikely.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 12 (quoting MPC § 212.1, cmt. 3). Consistent with this understanding of the offense, the Commonwealth points to <em>Commonwealth v. Markman, </em><a href="/pa/591/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="591 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="3015086" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0249-01">591 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/pa/591/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="916 A.2d 586" data-case-ids="3015086,8333404" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0249-01,/a2d/916/0586-01">916 A.2d 586</a> (2007), wherein the victim was transported 25 miles to a trailer park, placed in a trailer’s living room, bound, and then strangled. The Commonwealth stresses that the <em>Markman </em>Court noted there was evidence of unlawful confinement as well, as the victim’s hands and feet were bound and her mouth gagged so that she could not cry out, and, thus, she was confined in a place of isolation as she was separated from the normal protections of society in a manner that made discovery or rescue unlikely. <em><a href="/pa/591/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="916 A.2d 586" data-case-ids="3015086,8333404" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0249-01,/a2d/916/0586-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/591/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="916 A.2d 586" data-case-ids="3015086,8333404" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0249-01,/a2d/916/0586-01">at 600</a>; <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>

The Commonwealth explains that, in <em>Hook, </em>the victim, who lived above a clothing store, was followed into her apartment by the defendant. The victim fled to a neighboring apartment, but was followed and sexually assaulted until the defendant passed out.

However, the history of the crime of kidnapping, the Model Penal Code, on which Section 1209(a) is based, and our Court’s decisions all suggest some ambiguity in the language, and have given context and a distinct meaning to the phrase. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c)(1), (2) and (5) (offering considerations in discerning legislative intent include the occasion and necessity for the statute, the circumstances under which it was enacted, and the former law on the same or similar subjects).

Originally, the key to kidnapping was the requirement of asportation, i.e., the carrying away of the individual. <em>See </em>William Blackstone, 4 Commentaries 219 (defining kidnapping as “the forcible abduction or stealing away of man, woman or child from their <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>own country, and sending them to another”). At common law, the crime was, in essence, an aggravated form of false imprisonment and carried with it the status of a misdemeanor. Over time, kidnapping became codified, but as ransom kidnappings across state lines, not covered by existing statutes, became more common in the early twentieth century, broader definitions and harsher penalties ensued. Indeed, the offense of kidnapping was so toothless that, in light of the famed Lindbergh infant kidnapping and murder of March 1, 1982, the kidnapper, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, was not prosecuted for kidnapping; rather, for the felony murder rule to apply, the prosecutor was forced to seek another crime which would supply the necessary felony — the stealing of the infant’s sleeping suit — which ultimately led to Hauptmann receiving the death penalty. <em>State v. Hauptmann, </em><a href="/njl/115/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="115 N.J.L. 412" data-case-ids="123602" data-case-paths="/njl/115/0412-01">115 N.J.L. 412</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.%20809" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="180 A. 809">180 A. 809</a>, 818 (N.J.1935).</p>

Further, expansion of the common-law offense involved the substitution of asportation with the intent to cause the victim to be secretly confined. Thus, statutory codification of the common-law crime, conceptually, reflected two kidnapping contexts: the seizure of the victim and his or her removal to another place, or the confining of the victim to a place of isolation. Further, the expansion of the scope of the crime of kidnapping was coupled with an increase in sanctions. What was once a misdemeanor became one of the most serious crimes, with 44 of 48 states permitting punishment by death or life imprisonment for kidnapping by 1952. <em>See generally </em>Comment, Two Crimes for the Price of One: The Problem With Kidnapping Statutes in Tennessee and Beyond, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20Tenn.%20L.%20Rev.%20789" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="76 Tenn.

As a result of the potential of unwarranted severe punishment, and a call for restricting kidnapping statutes, in 1962, the drafters of Section 212.1 of the MPC (“Kidnapping and Related Offenses; Coercion”) sought to affect a significant restructuring of the law of kidnapping. In this respect, the definition of kidnapping was narrowed to the most serious forms of unlawful restraint. The challenge, as viewed by the drafters, was to “restrict the drastic sanctions authorized for this offense to instances of misbehavior warranting such punishment.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=53%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%20540" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="53 Colum.
