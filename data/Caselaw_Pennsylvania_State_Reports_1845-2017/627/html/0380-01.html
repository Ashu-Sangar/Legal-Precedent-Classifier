Additionally, the Commonwealth Court described the Department’s September 17, 2003, letter to the sentencing court as “requesting clarification of the sentencing order,” <em>id. </em>at 3, when in fact the letter (a) opined that the court had improperly given duplicative credit, and (b) reflected an intention (unless expressly directed otherwise) to override the sentencing order by denying such credit based on the Department’s interpretation of decisional law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
