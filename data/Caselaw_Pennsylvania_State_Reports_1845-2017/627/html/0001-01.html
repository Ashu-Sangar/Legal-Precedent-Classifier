In proceedings before the Commonwealth Court, Guzzardi testified that he is a “lawyer on inactive status” who has not “practiced in a number of years, three or four at least.” N.T., 4/3/14, at 177. As all Pennsylvania lawyers know, there is no “semi-retired lawyer” status for members of the Pennsylvania Bar; attorneys are either active or inactive. At least one grammatically correct reading of the notation “semi-retired businessman and lawyer” indicates that Guzzardi is practicing law on a part-time basis; another fair reading would be that he was semi-retired from business, but still a lawyer. Either reading by an elector would reveal that the elector had been misled by the candidate, who was inactive and not licensed to practice law, on either a full-time or “semiretired” basis.</p>

Adoption of such a harsh and inflexible rule runs counter to this Court’s pronouncement that the strict disclosure requirements of the Ethics Act must be balanced with the liberal construction required under the Election Code in favor of ballot access. <em>In re Nomination of Paulmier, </em><a href="/pa/594/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="594 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="3595247" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0433-01">594 Pa. 433</a>, <a href="/pa/594/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="937 A.2d 364" data-case-ids="3595247,8361411" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0433-01,/a2d/937/0364-01">937 A.2d 364</a>, 370-71 (2007). Further, such ruling fails to appreciate that applying <em>nunc pro tunc </em>principles to the instant case does not relax the stringent statutory requirement of filing a timely statement of financial interests with the Ethics Commission, but rather recognizes that the candidate did not satisfy the statutory requirement here because there was a breakdown in the administrative process. Finally, because the cases relied upon by the majority to preclude application of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>principles did not, in fact, involve requests for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief, in my view, they cannot foreclose the grant of equitable remedies when sought in the appropriate case.</p>

Admittedly, an appeal for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief because “I was misinformed” (as herein) is “different” from an appeal for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief because, for example, a fire prevented access to the filing office, as the latter claim appears to present a much stronger case for granting <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief than the former. But, significantly, from the standpoint of whether equity is available to provide the requested relief, the claims are the same. If, as the majority holds, equity is not available under its construction of the election statute, the particular details underlying the claim— be it official misinformation, or disaster — are irrelevant. <em>Cf. </em>Majority Opinion at 10, 99 A.3d at 387 (conceding that “our enforcement of the governing statutory fatal-defect rule was dispositive of this appeal”). Thus, an appeal to equity such as made in this case and an appeal to equity because of a fire at the filing office are emphatically not “vastly different” — they are, in point of fact, identical legal claims. As a result, the majority’s contention that “we do not address those [claims] here” rings hollow, as I perceive no principled basis — and the majority offers none — for categorically distinguishing between the instant claim for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief and one based on the “natural disaster, fire, or bomb threat” scenarios proffered by Justice Baer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> Under the majority’s analysis, all are barred.</p>

I take this to mean that the majority recognizes that its interpretation of the statute may be so unfair in its application in certain scenarios that it could be unconstitutional.

In addition to the natural disaster, fire, or bomb threat scenarios suggested by Justice Baer, I would add the much more prosaic power outage, snow storm (filings are due in late winter), or water line break. In brief, short of negligence, there are any number of highly foreseeable events that could hamper or prevent the timely filing of a statement of financial interests. Surely, the legislature must have been aware of such possibilities in crafting the fatal defect language. However, by concluding the legislature intended to preclude equitable relief in <em>toto, </em>the majority nearly guarantees a constitutional contravention, flouting the above precept of statutory construction.</p>
    <p id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.6",83,[212,2122,1148,144]],["BL_84.1",84,[285,332,1148,743]]]'>In this regard, I do not mean to suggest the majority’s interpretation of the fatal defect language is unfounded: such language can reasonably be viewed as disallowing equitable <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>relief. At the same time, I regard Justice Baer’s alternative interpretation — that the fatal defect language was added to reverse this Court’s <em>dilution </em>of the filing requirement in <em>State Ethics Comm’n v. Baldwin, </em><a href="/pa/498/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="498 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1776291" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0255-01">498 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="498 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1776291" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0255-01">445 A.2d 1208</a> (1982), and thus is unrelated to restricting a court’s ability to grant equitable relief — also to be eminently reasonable. Yet, critically, Justice Baer’s interpretation has the advantage of avoiding the constitutional infirmity to which the majority alludes, and so comports with the presumption against unconstitutional interpretations. Given the panoply of highly foreseeable scenarios which may result in a non-negligent failure to timely file a statement of financial interests, I would interpret the fatal defect language in a manner which avoids, not presumes, constitutional impediments.</p>
