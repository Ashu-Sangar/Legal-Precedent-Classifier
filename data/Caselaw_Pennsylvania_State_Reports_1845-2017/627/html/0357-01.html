The Greenway and the Township intend to build a public walking/recreational trail on this property as a segment of the larger Schuylkill River Trail. Situated immediately to the west of the Greenway Property is a 58-acre tract owned by Fortune Development, L.P. (Developer), a private developer. Developer seeks to construct a 219-unit adult residential subdivision, known as Water’s Edge Village, on this tract.</p>

As for clean water, a water main passing through Ontelaunee (a municipality on the east side of the Schuylkill River) can potentially connect, underneath the Schuylkill River, with a proposed water main on the west side of the river, and then continue west to Water’s Edge Village. For this to occur, however, the west-side main would have to run through the Greenway’s property. A similar situation exists with regard to sanitary sewer and stormwater sewer outfall, albeit the water would flow in the opposite direction. In particular, treated sewage would combine with stormwater runoff and flow eastward through the Greenway’s property, ultimately discharging into the Schuylkill River. The conduits for the clean water and the sewer outfall could be laid side-by-side <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>within a 50-foot-wide underground space on the Greenway’s property, connecting the Schuylkill River and Developer’s land.</p>

After negotiations with the Greenway failed to produce an agreement, RAWA adopted a resolution in February 2009, authorizing the use of its eminent-domain powers to condemn a utility easement across the Greenway Property connecting Developer’s land with the Schuylkill River. The resolution reflected that the easement was to be condemned at Developer’s request and that it would be used for water, sewer, and stormwater purposes specifically to enable Developer to build Water’s Edge Village. The resolution also stated that Developer would be responsible for initiating eminent domain proceedings in conjunction with RAWA’s solicitor, and would be required to pay all costs associated with such proceedings, including just compensation to the Greenway. The City of Reading then passed a resolution approving the RAWA resolution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Complaint requested a decree condemning a 50-foot-wide easement across the Greenway Property, “to construct, maintain, [and] operate utility lines and appurtenance of a water main to be placed under the <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>Schuylkill River for water, sewer and stormwater purposes,” Complaint at ¶ 6, <em>reprinted in </em>R.R. 11a, and asked that the court value the easement at $3,500 based on the appraisal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> According to the attached exhibits, the water main would travel west from Ontelaunee under the Schuylkill River and continue west through the Greenway Property to Developer’s property. The sewer main would travel south from a sewage treatment plant on Developer’s property and intersect with a pipe which would drain a stormwater retention basin (also on Developer’s property). The sewer main and the stormwater pipe would then combine into a single conduit which would travel east under Developer’s property, and then continue east through the Greenway Property, within the same 50-foot-wide strip of land, ultimately emerging through a concrete headwall and discharging the effluent onto a six-foot downward slope covered by riprap.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

RAWA answered, asserting that it had statutory authority under the Municipality Authorities Act to condemn the easement, <em>see </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 5607(d)(15), it had legitimate <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>authority to accommodate sewer and stormwater facilities pursuant to the permission granted by the City, and the width of the easement was necessary to accommodate all of these facilities to serve the public.

According to his testimony, although all of the conduits — whether for water, sanitary sewer, or stormwater — would lie underground, the overall easement subsumed the surface ground as well. He observed that the development plans, and in particular the drainage portion of the easement, could interfere with the proposed trail in several ways. He testified, for example, that swales and other facilities might be created at the surface for storm-water management, and pipes would have to be excavated from time to time for repairs or replacement. Also, vegetation would need to be removed to install the headwall, grading, and riprap for the sewer discharge pipe, and especially in the summer months odors from the sewage treatment plant and sewer discharge operations would likely persist along parts of the recreational trail. Furthermore, safety fencing around the headwall could interfere with the path of the trail. <em>See </em>N.T., Aug. 31, 2010, at 8,15,19-26.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>The common pleas court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the Complaint. In its opinion, the court explained that the condemnation was effectuated solely to benefit a private commercial developer who had been unable to acquire an easement through private measures and, as such, violated the prohibition on using eminent domain for private purposes. <em>See RAWA v. Schuylkill River Greenway Ass’n, </em>No. 10-8544, <em>slip op. </em>at 6 (C.P.Berks, Oct. 27, 2011) (“Under the guise of expanding their customer base and providing water to the public, RAWA is attempting to achieve its true goal and take land from one private owner and give it to another.”)- The court observed that the sewage and storm-water management facilities would be privately owned, and that the primary beneficiary of the condemnation would be Developer, and not the general public. <em>See id. </em>at 4. The court opined that the scope of the easement exceeded that which was necessary to serve any public purpose since, according to the evidence, approximately half of the fifty-foot width of the easement would be used to accommodate Developer’s privately owned drainage facilities. <em>See id. </em>at 4-5, 8. Finally, the court expressed that the taking would not only primarily benefit a private party, it would also interfere with a portion of the Greenway’s land that the Township had earmarked for a walking trail for the public to enjoy. <em>See id. </em>at 8.</p>

The court also noted that RAWA had obtained permission, as required by its articles of incorporation, to engage in a project whose scope exceeds water supply works to include sewer services. As for the public-versus-private purpose of the taking, the court summarized PRPA and the constitutional framework together as dictating that private property may only be taken for public use. In application, the court reasoned that, although the availability of the utilities would make Developer’s homes more valuable, this alone would not negate the project’s public purpose of providing water, sewer, and <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>stormwater services to citizens in RAWA’s service area. Further, the court stated there was no indication whether such facilities will eventually be dedicated to RAWA. Thus, the court concluded that RAWA properly exercised eminent domain. <em>See Reading Area Water Auth. v.

They do not challenge the water easement, opting to focus their advocacy on the drainage easement. Appellants observe that this portion of the condemned land exceeds that which is necessary for RAWA’s proposed water-supply line. In this respect, they note that RAWA only operates a water-supply system, whereas it condemned an easement large enough to include extensive wastewater outflow facilities — including a pipe, a headwall, grading, and riprap — connected to a private sewage treatment plant and stormwater retention basin on Developer’s land. They contend, more particularly, that RAWA may not condemn more land than it needs for water supply solely to enable a private developer to discharge its private sewage and stormwater runoff through a privately built and maintained facility over the land of another. Thus Appellants adopt the position that the drainage easement is being taken for the private use of <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>Developer and, as such, it is not authorized by the Pennsylvania Constitution or the Eminent Domain Code, and is affirmatively prohibited by PRPA. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellants at 12.</p>

They proffer, however, that, for the taking to be valid, the public must be the primary and paramount beneficiary, and the public entity involved must assume ownership and maintenance of the condemned lands and any improvements installed thereon. <em>See Ormsby Land Co. v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/276/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="276 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1077727" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0068-01">276 Pa. 68</a>, 70, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.%20730" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="119 A. 730">119 A. 730</a>, 730 (Pa.1923) (holding that land dedicated for a public street may not be leased to a private entity for private use). Appellants assert that RAWA will not assume ownership and maintenance of the drainage easement or its improvements because any such dedication of these facilities to RAWA would exceed RAWA’s articles of incorporation and the City’s authorizing resolution. Appellants argue, therefore, that that Developer will own and operate the sewer facilities, and state that this conclusion is supported by: (a) the limited nature of the City’s resolution, in which the City authorized RAWA to condemn an easement large enough merely to “accommodate” sewage and stormwater facilities owned by others (in addition to RAWA-owned water lines), City Resolution at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>R.R. 35a, but not to construct, operate, or maintain such facilities; (b) RAWA’s own resolution, which expresses an intention “to provide a utility easement to [Developer],” RAWA Resolution at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>R.R. 15a; (c) RAWA’s failure to present any evidence to the contrary before the common pleas court; and (d) the fact that under Pennsylvania’s Storm Water Management Act, 32 P.S. §§ 680.1-680.17 (SWMA), as well as the associated Department of Environmental Protection regulations, Developer is alone responsible to design, construct, and operate stormwater maintenance facilities, <em>see </em>32 P.S. § 680.13 (assigning such responsibility to the person who alters or develops the land); 25 Pa.Code § 102.5(a) (same, in relevant part). Thus, Appellants <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>argue the Commonwealth Court misconstrued the record when it held there was no evidence concerning whether the drainage facilities will ultimately be owned by RAWA.</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[215,496,1152,1324]]]'>For its part, RAWA also references the principle, recited in <em>Washington Park </em>and elsewhere, that an incidental benefit to a private party does not in itself undermine the public character of a taking. RAWA observes that, in <em>Washington Park, </em>the government condemned land for a highway exit ramp which would benefit a shopping center and that such private benefit was not deemed to have undermined the validity of the taking. RAWA additionally references <em>Appeal of Heim, </em>151 Pa.Cmwlth. 438, <a href="/pa-commw/151/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="617 A.2d 74" data-case-ids="1438666" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/151/0438-01">617 A.2d 74</a> (1992), in which the intermediate court held that, even where a developer pays for the condemnation, including associated legal fees, the ancillary benefit realized by the developer does not vitiate the public nature of the condemnation so long as the condemnation is accomplished for a public purpose (in <em>Heim, </em>the construction of a road to a subdivision). To the contrary, RAWA emphasizes, this arrangement was expressly approved in <em>Heim </em>because it saved taxpayer money by shifting costs onto the developer. <em>See id. </em>at 447, <a href="/pa-commw/151/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="617 A.2d 74" data-case-ids="1438666" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/151/0438-01">617 A.2d at 79</a>. RAWA states that, as in <em>Washington Park </em>and <em>Heim, </em>the benefit conferred upon Developer in this case is ancillary and cannot taint the inherently public nature of the proposed project and corresponding condemnation — and that, as in <em>Heim, </em>any payment by Developer of the costs of the taking, including legal fees as well as compensation to the landowner, does not alter this conclusion since, again, it simply saves taxpayer funds.</p>

So long as there is no evidence of corruption, fraud, or malfeasance by the condemnor, RAWA argues, a condemnation for a public purpose should be upheld. Further, anticipating the counter-point that there is no present need for water and sewer services because the homes do <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>not yet exist (and indeed, may never exist if the taking does not occur), RAWA points out that a similar circumstance arose in <em>Washington Park </em>and that this Court answered what it termed the “chicken and egg” problem by recognizing that government officials must look to the future and anticipate the community’s needs. <em>See Washington Park, </em><a href="/pa/425/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="425 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1906671" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0349-01">425 Pa. at 354-55</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=229%20A.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="229 A.2d 1">229 A.2d at 4</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

There is also a natural tendency to regard the two functions as intertwined, at least insofar as the sanitary sewer outfall is concerned, since most of the water that enters a residence ultimately leaves the home through its sewer connection. This lends a certain appeal to the concept that the drainage easement is for a public use — particularly as municipal sewer and drainage systems generally constitute a public use. Furthermore, the drainage easement would, according to Developer’s plans, ultimately serve 219 homes in an adult-community residential development. This factor also tends to support the view that the drainage easement is intended for at least a limited public use vis-a-vis the prospective purchasers of the residences, regardless of the identity of the party that constructs, owns, and operates the sewer discharge facilities.</p>

Against this backdrop, the legislative body elected to phrase the central prohibition broadly in terms of whether the subject property is being condemned “to use it for private enterprise,” 26 Pa.C.S. § 204(a), rather than “to use it <em>solely </em>for private enterprise”— the latter of which, in any event, would have had little effect on the <em>status quo </em>since any condemnation accomplished solely for private purposes would likely have failed the constitutional public-use standard.</p>
