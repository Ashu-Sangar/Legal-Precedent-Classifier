Specifically, the trial court observed that Section 1722-A(e)(l) and (3) expressly differentiates between “nonprofit corporations” and “associated nonprofit foundations,” and provides for retroactive tax relief in (e)(3) only to “associated nonprofit foundations.” According to the trial court, although Appellant premised its argument on an assertion that it was an “associated nonprofit foundation,” which would entitle it to retroactive relief, it had demonstrated in its pleadings only that it was a nonprofit corporation; it did not plead, or support by exhibits, that it was an associated nonprofit foundation. The court then held that Appellant’s failure to substantiate its assertion that it fell within the nomenclature of Section 1722-A(e)(3) (that it was an “an associated nonprofit foundation”) doomed its request for retroactive relief, and it was not, therefore, entitled to a refund of taxes collected on behalf of the County in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

Assuming Appellant is included within the statutory nomenclature as “an associated nonprofit foundation,” then by its plain terms, Section 1722-A(e)(3) applies a retroactive tax exemption to such associated nonprofit foundations that filed an assessment appeal prior to the amendment’s effective date. 24 P.S. § 17-1722-A(e)(3) (“This subsection shall apply retroactively to all charter schools, cyber charter schools and associated nonprofit foundations that filed an appeal from an assessment ... prior to the effective date of this subsection.”).
