    <p id="b740-5" data-blocks='[["BL_740.5",740,[267,470,1146,741]]]'>On November 14, 2000, Appellant Michelle Sue Tharp was convicted of first degree murder and related offenses after she deliberately starved her seven-year-old daughter to death. After her judgment of sentence was affirmed on appeal, Appellant filed a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-46. Following several evidentiary hearings, the Washington County Common Pleas Court (“PCRA court”) dismissed Appellant’s petition. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the PCRA court’s denial of relief on Appellant’s guilt phase claims, and reverse the PCRA court’s denial of relief on the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present mental health mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Accordingly, we remand for a new penalty hearing.</p>
    <p id="b740-6" data-blocks='[["BL_740.6",740,[266,1234,1149,583]]]'>Evidence presented at Appellant’s murder trial established that she was the mother of the victim in this case, Tausha Lee Lanham. Appellant gave birth to Tausha prematurely on August 16, 1990, and, due to health consequences stemming from her premature birth, Tausha spent the first year of her life hospitalized. Tausha was the second born of Appellant’s four children, and was the sole target of Appellant’s severe neglect and abuse. Appellant did not mistreat or neglect her other children, who were all healthy and well-fed. In 1996, Appellant began living with Douglas Bittinger, Sr., with whom Appellant had her fourth child.</p>
    <p id="b740-7" data-blocks='[["BL_740.7",740,[267,1839,1147,421]],["BL_741.1",741,[227,330,1150,306]]]'>Pursuant to Appellant’s direction, the family would eat dinner while Tausha was either kept in the pantry or trapped in a corner of the kitchen by pieces of furniture. Appellant further instructed Bittinger not to feed Tausha while Appellant was away from the apartment. Accordingly, on multiple occasions, two or three days would pass without Tausha getting any food or drink. This led her to sneak and eat cake mix or dog food from the pantry, eat bread thrown outside for <a id="p685" href="#p685" data-label="685" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*685</a>birds, eat from the garbage, and drink from the toilet. Appellant also strapped Tausha to the toilet for extended periods of time to “potty-train” her. Additionally, notwithstanding that Tausha suffered from several infirmities due to her premature birth, in the years preceding her death, Appellant did not seek any medical care for Tausha.</p>
    <p id="b741-4" data-blocks='[["BL_741.4",741,[228,660,1149,513]]]'>Remarkably, several individuals in addition to Douglas Bittinger observed Appellant’s abuse and neglect of Tausha, but apparently could not rescue the child from her mother’s torment. Bittinger’s sister-in-law, Audrey Bittinger, lived in the apartment above Appellant’s residence, and observed the aforementioned abuse. She reported the matter to the Washington County Children and Youth Services (“CYS”), and a caseworker made at least five attempts to visit Tausha. However, Appellant removed Tausha from the apartment on each occasion.</p>
    <p id="b741-5" data-blocks='[["BL_741.5",741,[227,1205,1150,884]]]'>Appellant’s neighbor, Lisa Camp, witnessed Tausha eating “toy food,” cat food, and dog food. She further saw Appellant withhold food from Tausha, and described the child as weak and frail a few months before she died. When Camp asked Appellant about Tausha’s condition three weeks before the child’s death, Appellant responded that Tausha “belonged six feet under in a body bag.” Tausha’s aunt, Rhonda Lanham, who lived with Appellant and her children for several months, also documented the deplorable abuse that Tausha suffered at the hands of her mother. Lanham had such concern over Appellant’s treatment of Tausha that she offered to take the child to live with her, but Appellant refused. Finally, Carrie Tharp, Appellant’s step-mother, was a witness to Appellant’s abuse of Tausha. After one occasion where Tharp cared for Tausha and fed her, Appellant refused to let Tharp see the child again. Tharp made 25 calls to CYS to report the abuse from 1996 until Tausha’s death in 1998.</p>
    <p id="b741-6" data-blocks='[["BL_741.6",741,[228,2122,1148,254]],["BL_742.1",742,[262,332,1148,369]]]'>On the morning of April 18, 1998, Appellant returned home and found seven-year-old Tausha dead in her bed. Bittinger returned to the apartment shortly thereafter, and told Appellant to call 911. Appellant refused, indicating that she was afraid that CYS would take away her other children. Appel<a id="p686" href="#p686" data-label="686" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*686</a>lant and Bittinger thereafter placed Tausha’s body in a car seat in their car, along with the rest of their children, and proceeded to run errands. They ultimately drove to Empire, Ohio, where Appellant and Bittinger purchased garbage bags to dispose of the child’s body. Appellant and Bittinger proceeded to Follansbee, West Virginia, where they discarded Tausha’s body in garbage bags on the side of the road.</p>
    <p id="b742-4" data-blocks='[["BL_742.4",742,[260,741,1148,857]]]'>Appellant and Bittinger thereafter returned to a mall in Ohio, shopped for a while, and then reported to mall security that Tausha had been abducted. When questioned by police, both Bittinger and Appellant ultimately confessed that Tausha had died and that they had hidden her body. Bittinger led police to the location where Tausha’s body was recovered. An autopsy revealed that Tausha, at seven years of age, weighed only 11.77 pounds and was 31 inches tall. The medical examiner concluded that Tausha had not eaten for several days, that the cause of death was malnutrition due to starvation, and that the manner of death was homicide. The medical examiner based his opinion on the fact that Tausha’s body demonstrated various indicators of malnutrition, including no fat at all in parts of the body where fatty tissue normally accumulates, and extreme wear on the grinding surface of Tausha’s teeth, which is common in juvenile starvation cases.</p>

Approximately one week prior to the commencement of jury selection, the two defendants filed requests to waive their right to a jury trial. In response, the Commonwealth requested a jury trial pursuant to the 1998 amendment to Article I, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The trial court granted the Commonwealth’s request.

    <p id="b743-5" data-blocks='[["BL_743.4",743,[220,449,1148,1150]]]'>Upon remand to the trial court, Appellant’s case was severed from Bittinger’s, and a jury trial was conducted. To establish that Appellant deliberately withheld food from Tausha with the intent to starve her to death, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of several witnesses who had each independently observed Appellant repeatedly deny Tausha food. These witnesses included Douglas Bittinger, Audrey Bittinger, Rhonda Lanham, Carrie Tharp, and Lisa Camp. Additionally, three inmates who had been incarcerated with Appellant after her arrest testified that Appellant was not sorry Tausha had died. Specifically, inmate Juanita Donnelly testified that Appellant told her that she withheld food from Tausha because Tausha was mentally retarded. Inmate Dena Chandler testified that when she asked how Appellant could have committed the offense, Appellant responded that she never loved Tausha and that Tausha interfered with her life. Further, inmate Renee Vogel testified that Appellant told her that she was glad her “little retarded baby” had died. Finally, the medical examiner testified as to the basis for his conclusion that Tausha died as a result of malnutrition due to starvation, and opined that the manner of her death was homicide.</p>
    <p id="b743-6" data-blocks='[["BL_743.5",743,[219,1632,1148,615]]]'>Appellant testified on her own behalf at trial. Her defense was that Tausha suffered from the preexisting medical condition known as “failure to thrive,” and that such condition caused Tausha’s deteriorative physical state and, ultimately, her death. Appellant further testified that she had been a victim of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her own parents, step-parents, and previous boyfriends, including the fathers of her children, who gave her no support in raising the family. Appellant explained that she had felt overwhelmed by the burden of child rearing and may not have been a good mother to Tausha, but that she did not starve her own child to death.</p>

During the penalty phase of trial, the defense incorporated the guilt phase evidence and presented no other witnesses or documentary evidence in mitigation, with the exception of a stipulation that Appellant had no prior criminal history. Following the penalty hearing, the jury found one aggravating circumstance, that the victim was less than twelve years of age, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(16), and two mitigating circumstances, that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, <em><a href="/a2d/754/1251-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="754 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="11221534,11221560,225925,225969" data-case-paths="/a2d/754/1251-01,/a2d/754/1251-02,/pa/562/0230-01,/pa/562/0231-01">id.</a> </em>§ 9711(e)(1), and the “catchall mitigator” of any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of Appellant and the circumstances of her offense. <em><a href="/a2d/754/1251-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="754 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="11221534,11221560,225925,225969" data-case-paths="/a2d/754/1251-01,/a2d/754/1251-02,/pa/562/0230-01,/pa/562/0231-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 9711(e)(8).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the two mitigating circumstances, the jury returned a verdict of death.

In her direct appeal to this Court, Appellant challenged the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, and alleged that the trial court erred by denying her motion for change of venue. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred by admitting photographs of the victim, by failing to declare a mistrial after jurors overheard a witness’s comments, and by failing to <a id="p689" href="#p689" data-label="689" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*689</a>recuse.

Rather, the evidence showed a course of conduct over a 7-year period of time. The perhaps-unusual facts, however, do not change the ample evidence of appellant’s hardness of heart. They do not change the evidence of a seven-year-old’s starvation death at the deliberate hand of her own mother. Indeed, the very length of time needed to bring about Tausha’s death by starvation suggests a unique type of coldness and deliberation, for within that time there was ample opportunity for reflection, for reconsideration, and for the development of a tinge of sympathy for the child. That appellant still proceeded in her course reveals the sort of premeditation and deliberation that separates first degree murder from other killings or, at least, the jury could so find.</blockquote>

N.T., Nov. 8, 2000, at 431, 469-70. During closing arguments, defense counsel emphasized that Bittinger’s testimony should be viewed with caution because he was also charged in connection with the crime. N.T., Nov. 13, 2000, at 907 (stating, “Mr. Bittinger is also charged in this case, and the Court will instruct you that because Bittinger is charged, you can take that fact into consideration, and the Court will give you a specific instruction, but that goes to his credibility”); id. at 908 (stating, “Is Mr. Bittinger trying to make the situation look far worse than it ever was for his own gain and benefit?”). Finally, the trial court specifically instructed the jury that because Bittinger was an accomplice to the murder, he may testify falsely in the hope of obtaining favorable treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 954. The court explained that Bittinger’s testimony must be considered by special rules applicable to accomplices, including that the jury should view accomplice testimony with disfavor because it is from a corrupt and polluted source; that an accomplice’s testimony should be examined closely and only accepted with care and caution; and that the jury should consider whether the accomplice’s testimony is supported by other evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 955.</p>

As cogently noted by the Commonwealth, the testimony of Appellant’s own friends, neighbors, and relatives established that she deliberately starved her daughter to death, not only by denying meals, but by physically restraining the child so that she could not feed herself. The evidence demonstrated that, remarkably, Appellant asked others to perpetuate the same abuse upon her own child. Appellant also expended much effort to avoid the assistance of those able to help the child, including the Washington County CYS. Finally, the testimony of the medical examiner established that Tausha had not eaten for several days before her death, that she weighed less than twelve pounds at seven years of age, and that her cause of death was malnutrition as a result of starvation.</p>

A careful review of the record indicates that trial counsel was able to discredit substantially the testimony of the inmate witnesses without suggesting that they garnered favorable treatment in exchange for their testimony. Trial counsel brought to light that Donnelly had been transferred to the Washington County Correctional Facility because she was suffering from mental health problems, N.T., Nov. 8, 2000, at 541; that Chandler had 18 criminal convictions, most of them relating to theft, <em>id. </em>at 511; and that Vogel had not been particularly close to Appellant and was residing in a drug-treatment facility. <em>Id. </em>at 488.

Since four Justices in concurrence agree with a qualitative approach to claims resting upon additional evidence supporting a found-mitigator, however — a position which overrules <em>Marshall </em>and <em>Rios </em>— I believe there is some benefit in exploring this now-majority viewpoint in operation. A qualitative approach here begins with what the jury did have before it from the penalty phase: the stipulation that appellant had no prior criminal record and incorporation of the guilt phase evidence, which included appellant’s testimony in her own defense that she had been a victim of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her own parents, step-parents, and boyfriends, including the fathers of her children, who gave her no support in raising their children. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 686-87, 101 A.3d at 744. At the PCRA hearing, though, appellant asserted that counsel could have: (1) called numerous family members to corroborate her testimony; (2) obtained her school records, which showed consistently below-average intelligence and performance; (3) obtained her father’s criminal records, which included various DUI and drug dealing offenses; (4) corroborated appellant’s testimony of domestic abuse by her boyfriends by obtaining and presenting police <a id="p741" href="#p741" data-label="741" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*741</a>records available for such incidents; and (5) presented testimony of prison guards of appellant’s exemplary behavior while incarcerated. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45.</p>

But appellant did testify as to these complicated misfortunes in her life; and although testimony by family members or presentation of records would have been corroborative, and perhaps bolstered the credibility of appellant’s testimony in this regard, it would nevertheless have been cumulative of her own story in her own words, rather than factually distinctive with regard to the catchall mitigator. According to this qualitative rather than quantitative approach, I do not discount the possibility that one or more jurors may have given the catchall mitigator more weight, or that more jurors may have found the catchall mitigator (if the jury was less than unanimous in this regard). But this is not to say that an enhanced finding of the catchall mitigator would have altered the outcome, and ultimately I would conclude that there is not a reasonable probability that presentation of appellant’s additional catchall mitigation evidence would have led at least one original juror to have voted against imposing the death penalty.</p>

We cannot discount a potential ineffectiveness claim merely because the jury found the catch-all mitigator present. Since <em>Rios, </em>I have come to agree with Justice Saylor that the death penalty statute does not support merely evaluating the catchall mitigation evidence quantitatively on collateral review. Prejudice may be found when there is a substantial difference between the nature or quality of evidence presented at trial and the evidence which the PCRA record shows was available but not investigated or presented, even if it is categorized as part of the same “factor.” <em>See Rios, </em>at 828 (Saylor, J., concurring and dissenting) (“I fully support the notion that a failure on the part of trial counsel to adduce redundant evidence concerning a found mitigator will not satisfy [the] burden to prove prejudice. I have difficulty F with transporting this logic to bar claims that are based on substantial differences between the weight or type of the evidence that was presented at trial and that which is presented at the post-conviction stage.” (citation omitted)); <em>see also Commonwealth v.

In addition, as noted above, [Ajppellant told Lisa Camp that Tausha "belonged six feet under and in a body bag,” and, after her arrest, [Ajppellant stated to one of her prison cellmates: "I’m glad the little retarded baby is dead." N.T. 11/8/00 at 487. Appellant made a similarly disturbing comment to another cellmate, Dena Chandler, when Chandler asked [Ajppellant how she could kill her daughter. Appellant responded: "Easily.
