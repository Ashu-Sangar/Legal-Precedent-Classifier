    <p id="b806-14" data-blocks='[["BL_806.12",806,[303,1392,1104,525]]]'>(1) Whether in excluding Judge Garb’s [Opinion] and Judge Feudal Opinion as inadmissible hearsay, the Superior Court misapplied this Court’s controlling authority under <em>Weaver v. Lancaster Newspapers, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/592/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="592 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="3556091" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0458-01">592 Pa. 458</a>, <a href="/pa/592/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="926 A.2d 899" data-case-ids="3556091,8375477" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0458-01,/a2d/926/0899-01">926 A.2d 899</a> (2007), where both documents provided [the] Newspaper with strong grounds for believing that, before republishing the defamatory content of a January 12, 2004 article reporting on the Petitioners’ testimony before a statewide investigating grand jury, the content of the January 12, 2004 article was false.</p>
