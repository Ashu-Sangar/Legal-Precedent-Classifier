Appellants further contended that an original action for declaratory and injunctive relief was inappropriate because SEPTA had to await final agency decisions in the individual administrative cases against it before it could seek appellate review in court. In response, SEPTA pointed out that the statute authorizing the creation of metropolitan transportation authorities, such as SEPTA, provides that such an authority “shall exercise the public powers of the Commonwealth as an agency and instrumentality thereof,” 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(a), and asserted that Philadelphia’s authority as a home-rule jurisdiction extends only to the regulation of its municipal affairs. In its brief in opposition to the preliminary objections, SEPTA did not rely upon, or refer to in any manner, the section of its enabling legislation pertaining to sovereign and official immunity. 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(c)(3).

A majority of the court concluded that the Philadelphia Commission lacked jurisdiction because <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>SEPTA is an “agency and instrumentality” of the Commonwealth and therefore within the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (the “State Commission”). The majority noted that the State Commission is responsible for the administration of the PHRA, which bans any “employer” from engaging in certain forms of discrimination. 43 P.S. §§ 955, 956(a). Because the PHRA defines “employer” as including “the Commonwealth or any political subdivision or board, department, commission or school district thereof,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> and because neither the PHRA nor the FPO explicitly grants the Philadelphia Commission jurisdiction over SEPTA, the majority concluded the State Commission — and not the Philadelphia Commission — had jurisdiction over SEPTA. The Commonwealth Court did not base any portion of its reasoning upon the section of SEPTA’s enabling legislation pertaining to sovereign and official immunity. 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(c)(3). Because the majority considered the State Commission’s jurisdiction over SEPTA to be clear, and a Commonwealth instrumentality’s challenge to “the scope of a governmental body’s action pursuant to statutory authority” through a declaratory judgment action to be proper, the majority also concluded that SEPTA had no duty to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking relief in court. <em>SEPTA v.

The dissent stated that the General Assembly had enacted the portion of SEPTA’s enabling act that provides that a metropolitan transportation authority such as SEPTA is “an agency and instrumentality thereof’ merely to avoid constitutional and statutory questions, such as limitations on local governments’ acquisition of debt. 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(a).

In that case, the Department of Public Welfare (“DPW”) — which we characterized as “an agency of the Commonwealth” — applied to the City of Philadelphia for the permits needed to build a facility for the mentally handicapped. <em>Id. </em>at 449-50. The City denied the permits on the ground that the proposed facility did not comply with use and other restrictions under the Philadelphia Zoning Code. On review in this Court, we rejected the notion that DPW was immune from local land regulations because it had the power to condemn property to establish the facility it sought to construct. We reasoned that because the General Assembly had established both the City and DPW, and had fixed the extent of each entity’s powers, we would need to examine the enabling act of each entity to determine which entity’s authority the legislature had intended to prevail for purposes of the parties’ controversy. Because the applicable statutes did not clearly state which entity the legislature had intended to be “preeminent,” we applied the rule of statutory construction that a court may determine legislative intent by considering “the consequences of a particular interpretation.” <em>Id. </em>at 455 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(6)). Because Philadelphia’s zoning scheme would have been frustrated if DPW were to have prevailed, while subjecting DPW to local zoning rules and restrictions would not necessarily have frustrated DPW’s mandate to establish mental health facilities, we concluded that the legislature had intended the City to have priority in the circumstances at issue.</p>

The dissent therefore considered the effect of holding each entity preeminent and determined that ruling in SEPTA’s favor would frustrate the legislature’s intended scheme. Characterizing the PHRA as granting the State and <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>Philadelphia Commissions “concurrent jurisdiction,” the dissent explained that deeming SEPTA “preeminent” over Appellants would thwart the legislatively established system of shared jurisdiction. The dissent explained that, on the other hand, treating Appellants as “preeminent” would not interfere with SEPTA’s purpose of providing public transportation. The dissent stated, “All the consequence of the City’s and the [State Commission’s] preeminence means is that SEPTA would still have to respond to complaints, like private companies, of those choosing to file their claims of unlawful discrimination with [the Philadelphia Commission].” <em>SEPTA, supra </em>at 569 (Pellegrini, J., dissenting).</p>

Part of the dispute, ultimately, was the issue of whether the City, specifically the City’s zoning board, had jurisdiction over the Commonwealth agency. In resolving the dispute, the <em>Ogontz </em>Court observed that municipal corporations, such as the City, are subject to regulation by the state, having been created, governed, and having the extent of their powers determined by the General Assembly, generally subject to change, repeal or abolition at the will of the General Assembly. <em>Accord Robinson Township v.

In contrast, the Court observed that Commonwealth agencies derive their powers from their enabling statutes. Thus, the Court explained that the conflict at issue was that which “arises when a Commonwealth agency seeks to utilize real property in a manner that conflicts with a municipal corporation’s zoning regulations,” and that such a conflict “is not a contest between superior and inferior governmental entities, but instead a contest between two instrumentalities of the state.” <em>Ogontz, </em><a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">483 A.2d at 452</a>.</p>

In <em>County of Venango, </em>the county sought to construct a new jail upon county owned land located within the Borough of Sugarcreek, and zoned as a residential area not permitting the proposed use.

In each of those governmental land use cases, the <em>Ogontz </em>analysis was helpful and appropriate in resolving the land use conflicts between governmental entities.

In my view, when employed outside of its land use context, <em>Ogontz </em>at most stands for the general proposition that the General Assembly’s intent is the controlling factor in conflicts respecting the exercise of statutory authority, and where such intent is not apparent on the face of the applicable statutes, that intent should be ascertained by turning to the Rules of Statutory Construction, which permit (but do not mandate) consideration of the consequences of competing interpretations. <em>See generally </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921. Beyond that unremarkable general proposition, I believe that the analysis in <em>Ogontz </em>has its application only in the limited context of “the conflict that arises when a Commonwealth agency seeks to utilize real property in a manner that conflicts with a municipal corporation’s zoning regulations,” where the General Assembly’s “intent is indecipherable <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>from the applicable statutes” and “absent more certain legislative direction,” as the Court stated. <em>Ogontz, <a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">supra.</a> </em>Such is clearly not the context of this case.</p>

Indeed, a review of <em>Ogontz </em>and its progeny, and review of the relied-upon statutory construction rules cited therein, all point to the same conclusion: where the intent of the General Assembly is clear from a plain reading of applicable statutes, there is no need for a statutory construction analysis considering the supposed consequences of proffered interpretations in order to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.

First, referencing the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, the court observed that the General Assembly granted jurisdiction over Commonwealth employers to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission for adjudication of matters concerning Commonwealth laws that prohibit discrimination. Then, referencing SEPTA’s enabling legislation, the MTAA, the court observed the statutory language setting forth the General Assembly’s declaration that SEPTA shall in no way be deemed an instrumentality of any municipality, and the legislative determination that SEPTA instead exists as an agency and instrumentality of the Commonwealth. The court concluded: “Clearly then, as an agency and instrumentality of the Commonwealth, SEPTA qualifies as an ‘employer’ for purposes of the [Human Relations] Act, subject to the jurisdiction of the [Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission]____” <em>SEPTA v.

The Court further explained that absent such express statutory authority, property owned by SEPTA remains immune from local taxation so long as SEPTA’s action with respect to the property is within SEPTA’s legislatively authorized purposes and powers, and the actual use of the property is within the scope of SEPTA’s immunity. Notably, <em>Board of Revision of Taxes </em>does not reference an <em>Ogontz/Venango/Hazleton </em>test.

The fact that the Commonwealth Court did not employ the magic words— sovereign immunity — is of no consequence, as the court clearly recognized SEPTA’s enabling statute and its existence as a Commonwealth Agency subject to jurisdiction for discrimination cases within the Commonwealth only as permitted by the General Assembly.</p>

While the majority claims <em>Board of Revision of Taxes </em>“is consistent with [its] application of the <em>Ogontz </em>[] test here” because “[i]n both instances, we have sought to enforce the legislature’s allocation of authority[,]” Majority Op., at 485, 101 A.3d at 88, it fails to explain why <em>Ogontz </em>was not discussed, or even men<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>tioned, in <em>Board of Revision of Taxes </em>if it was not limited to disputes over zoning ordinances.</p>

However, I believe, given the legislature’s decision to confer upon SEPTA “the public powers of the Commonwealth as an agency and instrumentality thereof[,]” 74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(a), SEPTA’s role in “performing essential governmental functions[,]”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> and the absence of any indication local ordinances promulgated under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act were meant to apply to the Commonwealth, we must assume the legislature intended to foreclose such an absurd result. Therefore, I see no need to extend the scope of the <em>Ogontz </em>test, and would instead affirm the judgment of the Commonwealth Court in full.</p>
