On May 4, 2009, Autenrieth’s estranged wife filed a protection from abuse (PFA) petition against him in Northampton County where she lived. The court issued a temporary PFA order the same day prohibiting Autenrieth from having contact with his wife or children and evicting him from the marital residence. The same day, deputies from the Northampton Sheriffs office went to Autenrieth’s residence (also in Northampton County) to serve the temporary PFA order and to transfer custody of the children to Autenrieth’s wife. Gross was present, babysitting the children, and a deputy served the order on her as the adult in charge of the residence. The deputy incorrectly told Gross the temporary PFA order prohibited Autenrieth from possess<a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>ing firearms. Another deputy explained the PFA order’s terms to Autenrieth over the phone. On May 18, 2009, a final PFA order was issued, which prohibited Autenrieth from possessing firearms.</p>

On May 21, 2009, she attempted to acquire a New Jersey firearm permit but was informed the process would take several months. On May 29, 2009, Gross obtained a Pennsylvania driver’s license using Autenrieth’s address; within hours, Gross and Autenrieth went to a Berks County store, where Gross used her new license to buy a 9 millimeter handgun. Later, at his residence, Autenrieth showed Gross how to use the gun, offered to clean it for her, then put the gun in its box and stored it and its ammunition above his washer and dryer. This was the last time Gross saw the gun, though a few days later she learned Autenrieth had taken the gun, fired it with a friend, and replaced the ammunition used; Gross made no objection.</p>

Accordingly, applying the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard to venue challenges allows trial courts to speedily resolve this threshold issue without infringing on the accused’s constitutional rights. Like essential elements of a crime, venue need not be proven by direct evidence but may be inferred by circumstantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The trial court found Gross could not be an accomplice in Monroe County because Autenrieth, not Gross, possessed the gun there. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 7/15/10, at 11-12. Also, both the trial court and the Superior Court <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>concluded Gross could not be charged as an accomplice because “there is no evidence that she intended to aid or promote Autenrieth’s shootout with the police.” <em>Commonwealth v. Gross, </em>No. 2006 EDA 2010, unpublished memorandum at 7, <a href="/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205111048" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="2011 WL 5111048">2011 WL 5111048</a> (Pa.Super. filed July 13, 2011) (citing Trial Court Opinion, 7/15/10, at 11). This factual statement may be true, but it is irrelevant, reflecting a misapprehension of the charges filed. Gross was never charged as an accomplice in the <em>shooting; </em>rather, she was charged as an accomplice in the <em>illegal possession of a firearm, </em>and the evidence offered was sufficient to prove she could be convicted as an accomplice to such illegal possession in Monroe County.</p>

Thus, even non-substantial assistance, if rendered with the intent of promoting or facilitating the crime, is sufficient to establish complicity. See <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/437/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="437 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1927823" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0266-01">437 Pa. 266</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20350" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="263 A.2d 350">263 A.2d 350</a>, 351 (1970) (where assistance “‘is rendered to induce another to commit the crime and actually has this effect, no more is required’” (citation omitted)). Absence or presence at the scene and the participant’s role in the complicity are not dispositive of whether accomplice liability exists. <em>See Commonwealth v. Murphy, </em><a href="/pa/577/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="577 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="91732" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0275-01">577 Pa. 275</a>, <a href="/pa/577/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="844 A.2d 1228" data-case-ids="91732,9272965" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0275-01,/a2d/844/1228-01">844 A.2d 1228</a>, 1234 (2004) (“[A] defendant cannot be an accomplice simply based on evidence that he ... was present at the crime scene.” (citation omitted)). Accomplice liability does not create a new or separate crime; it merely provides a basis of liability for a crime committed by another person. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 306.</p>
