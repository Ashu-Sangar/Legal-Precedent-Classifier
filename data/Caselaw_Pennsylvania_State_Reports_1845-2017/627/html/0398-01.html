The differences between restaurants of identifiable height, bulk, and location may be inconsequential, but there are considerable differences between all the uses that qualify as “non-residential” — a restaurant is one thing, but a Walmart is quite another. A hotel is “commercial,” but brings with it a different dynamic than a barber shop.

When examining the subsections controlling an application for final approval, it appears the governing body has the duty to grant final approval as long as the plan conforms to the ordinance and does not contain “variations” from the approved tentative plan:</p>
    <blockquote id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[314,1653,1105,312]]]'>(b) In the event the application for final approval has been filed, together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in support thereof, and as required by the ordinance and the official written communication of tentative approval, the municipality <em>shall ... </em>grant such development plan final approval....</blockquote>

A tentative approval of “commercial/retail/restaurant” affords a developer unreviewable options in creating final plans, yet the plan would have to be approved because it would be in compliance with the tentatively approved plan, as the term is so broad that any variations or change could fit under its umbrella. Permitting broad multi-use designations promotes vagueness in the tentative-plan stage and results in less recognition of the final product, less vetting upon final review, and uncertain information being disclosed to affected parties and the governing body regarding what the developer actually proposes. Such wide-ranging designations appear contrary to the plain meaning of the PRD Ordinance and Article VII of the MPC regarding the purpose of final review and the requirement that tentative plans include all reasonably necessary information about the proposed PRD.</p>
