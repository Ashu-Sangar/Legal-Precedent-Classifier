Essentially, petitioners argue that the Supreme Court lacks power to enter orders suspending jurists and to act otherwise in any matter that may be considered “disciplinary.” In these litigants’ view, the CJD’s jurisdiction is exclusive in these cases. As a result of this theory, the question of which order is supreme when both the CJD and the Supreme Court act should not and would not arise again. The AOPC responds that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has “King’s Bench” jurisdiction over the <em>Bruno </em>matter pursuant to its administrative and supervisory authority over the courts and judicial officers of the Unified Judicial System. According to the AOPC, this jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the CJD over disciplinary matters; however, this Court’s authority is “supreme,” overriding inconsistent directives of the CJD. In addition to the parties’ arguments, we also recount those offered by the PBA in analyzing the constitutional issues implicated here.

According to petitioners, when Article V, Section 10 was drafted in 1968, the power of the Supreme Court was, “at best, loosely defined in the area of judicial discipline.” Until 1968, petitioners state, the Constitution did not provide for the discipline of judges short of removal, which was available via one of three exclusive methods: impeachment, address, or conviction for misbehavior in office or of any infamous crime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Petitioners <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>note that the Supreme Court could also exercise “its inherent common law supervisory powers over the entire judicial system” to remove, suspend, or discipline jurists, but that the Court had never squarely addressed the extent of its disciplinary authority. This authority, petitioners assume, was never applied, it was “untried and untested,” and, as a result, it was not an established power of the Court. Indeed, according to petitioners, with respect to removal of jurists, decisions of the Court suggested that the methods for removal expressly included in the Constitution were exclusive and the Supreme Court was absent from the removal process.

The Convention added Section 18 — addressing judicial discipline — and, for the first time, expressly removed disciplinary functions from the Court’s administrative and supervisory powers.

In petitioners’ view, the amended Article V, Section 18 limits the general powers of supervision and administration that the Supreme Court has under Article V, Section 10(a). Petitioners argue that the specific enumeration of the powers and authority in the disciplinary sphere of the Board and of the CJD acts as an implicit limitation on any general power of the Court. Petitioners go so far as to claim that the Court’s power to discipline in the first instance, as an adjunct of its administrative or supervisory authority, “has been eliminated.” Board’s Brief at 32-35 (citing Pa. Const, art. V, §§ 10(a), 18); <em>see also </em>Bruno Brief at 26-28, 57-58.

According to petitioners, the Court’s decision to issue a rule to show cause upon Judge Solomon suggests disciplinary action because more than a year lapsed between Judge Solomon’s alleged failure to cooperate with the Traffic Court investigation and the Court’s rule to show cause and, during this time, the FJD did not request any action by the Supreme Court to induce Judge Solomon’s cooperation before the rule issued. Petitioners also observe that no other judges who failed to cooperate with the court-ordered review of Traffic Court, <em>e.g., </em>by invoking the right against self-incrimination, were subject to a similar rule to show cause. Petitioners claim that the Supreme Court’s targeted action involving the sitting jurist was intended to discipline rather than to assure the functioning of the judicial system. Furthermore, petitioners emphasize that the Supreme Court’s action involves a fact-finding investigation into Judge Solomon’s past conduct, which they believe takes the case “into the area of asserted misconduct” subject to the CJD’s exclusive dominion.

The concurrence specifically addressed the CJD’s decision to suspend Judge Bruno with pay while this Court’s Order to suspend Judge Bruno without pay was in force. The concurrence opined that the CJD’s authority to issue interim suspensions is exclusive. According to the concurrence, following the 1993 amendment of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Supreme Court was “wrong” to rely on the decision in <em>Franciscus, </em>which interpreted Section 18 as added in 1968, to impose interim suspensions. In the view of the concurrence, the 1968 provision differed in quality from the 1993 amendment because the latter “greatly diminish[ed] the Supreme Court’s supervisory powers.” <em><a href="/a3d/69/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="69 A.3d 780" data-case-ids="7308264" data-case-paths="/a3d/69/0780-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/69/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="69 A.3d 780" data-case-ids="7308264" data-case-paths="/a3d/69/0780-01">at 802</a> (Clement, J., concurring, <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>joined by Cellucci and Mullen, JJ.) (emphasis omitted). The concurrence recounted that, under the 1968 version of Section 18, the Court had authority to impose discipline <em>de novo, </em>while the JIRB had no such authority at all, including to enter interim suspensions. The concurrence argued that the 1993 amendment “seriously circumscribed” the Supreme Court’s review of disciplinary matters decided by the CJD and expressly transferred the power to enter interim suspensions to the CJD. “[I]t is quite reasonable to regard Section 18(d)(2) as an express transfer of responsibility for interim suspensions to [the CJD] because [the provision] contains an express diminishment in the Supreme Court’s supervisory powers by expressly providing that the Supreme Court has no authority to review orders of [the CJD] imposing interim suspensions.” <em><a href="/a3d/69/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="69 A.3d 780" data-case-ids="7308264" data-case-paths="/a3d/69/0780-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis in original).

According to the concurrence, “it is beyond argument” that the people of the Commonwealth, in delegating a power to enter interim suspension orders to the CJD — orders which may not be directly appealed as of right — “intended that those orders were not to be overridden and that the [CJD] should be free from interference in performing its duty so assigned.” The concurrence maintained that when the Supreme Court enters interim suspension orders, whether in accord or in conflict with a CJD order in the same matter, Section 18(d)(2) is rendered meaningless. To resolve the conflict, the concurrence stated, Section 18 should be interpreted as the specific provision which controls the inquiry over and above Section 10, the general provision that grants the Supreme Court <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>authority over administrative matters — -just as a statute would be interpreted under the precept governing general and specific provisions. According to the concurrence, the Court’s powers under Section 10 do not include “matters of suspension, removal, discipline and other sanctions” because these are addressed by Section 18. The Supreme Court’s power under Section 10, the concurrence opined, is restricted to assignment of judges. The title of Section 10 is “Judicial Administration” which, according to the concurrence, implies that discipline is not among the considerations of the provision.</p>

The concurrence also noted that the actions of the Court in <em>Avellino I </em>and <em>McFalls </em>were not “interim” suspensions but temporary suspensions without pay for refusal to take the bench. These scenarios, according to the concurrence, are distinguishable from the circumstances in <em>Franciscus, </em>where the Court entered an interim suspension so as to protect the integrity of the judiciary. The concurrence dismissed the decisions in <em>Avellino I </em>and <em>McFalls </em>as “not hav[ing] the precedential credentials ascribed to them by the Supreme Court” when they were cited to support interim suspension orders by the Court in post-1993 amendment cases.</p>

Under these circumstances, the Convention created the JIRB which, according to the concurrence, was ill-equipped to address the emergent circumstances in <em>Franciscus. </em>As a result, the Court acted because, in the concurrence’s opinion: “it does not ‘look good’ for a judge so charged [with crimes relating to his official duties as a justice of the peace] to be ‘judging others,’ at least until he should be exonerated. For a fact the public is apt to be scandalized, and any confidence it may have had in the integrity of the judicial system is jeopardized so long as that state of affairs continues.” <em>Id. </em>The concurrence also felt that the JIRB’s authority was inadequate to address the exigencies of the matter.</p>

The exclusive “disciplinary” power of the CJD, according to petitioners, is a carve-out from the “supervisory and administrative” authority of the Supreme Court. Petitioners make the dual claim that the Supreme Court has never had the power to discipline jurists and that, if that power ever existed, it was removed by the “dramatic” revision of 1993 to Article V, Section 18. According to petitioners, the Supreme Court may now act in a disciplinary case only on appeal from the CJD, and under an “extremely” limited standard of review. Petitioners essentially claim that this Court usurped the exclusive constitutional authority of the CJD by ordering the interim suspension of Bruno (and also by ordering the appointment of a special master and raising the prospect of a temporary suspension in the related <em>Solomon </em>matter). The AOPC and PBA respond that the Supreme Court issued a suspension order to Bruno in a supervisory capacity, premised upon its King’s Bench authority. According to the AOPC and the PBA, Section 18 of Article V created a disciplinary system for jurists, but there is nothing contradictory about having a disciplinary authority vested in the CJD and the concomitant exercise of the Supreme Court’s supervisory and administrative power over the same jurist. The AOPC and the PBA suggest that the Court’s authority to investigate and suspend a jurist is consistent with its overarching responsibilities and the necessity of ensuring the integrity of the Unified Judicial System.

We respectfully, but no less fundamentally, disagree: the structure of the disciplinary apparatus and the nature of the CJD make clear that the CJD is a judicial body inferior to the Supreme Court, like every other tribunal within the Unified Judicial System. Pa. Const, art. V, §§ 1, 2(a), 18(b)(5).

Any adjudicative discretion reposed in the CJD is cabined by these standards. Neither adjudicative discretion, nor for that matter the CJD’s authority to promulgate procedures governing the disciplinary proceedings before it, authorize deviation from the substantive standards of conduct articulated by this Court. That the CJD has the enumerated power to discipline Pennsylvania jurists, including justices of the Supreme Court, in matters that the Judicial Conduct Board decides to pursue, does not act to remove the CJD from the Unified Judicial System, nor does it elevate the CJD by necessary implication above the reach of the Supreme Court’s supervision and King’s Bench authority. <em>Cf.

The constitutional powers of the Supreme Court and the CJD, and the legal predicates for their respective actions, are distinct and may comfortably operate separately. That the remedies available to the Supreme Court and the CJD are similar in some instances — such as temporary suspensions or interim suspensions — does not equate to exposing a jurist to two “disciplinary sanctions” for the same conduct, as petitioners suggest. Properly understood, any such supervisory action is not punishment, but instead represents action undertaken to preserve the integrity of the judiciary. Moreover, because the supervisory action does not punish a jurist for alleged misconduct, and as no decision of the CJD is before the Court for review, we also reject petitioners’ argument that the Court would be placed in a position of appearing to have prejudged an appeal from the CJD’s ultimate disciplinary decision. The issues are distinct: on appeal, the Supreme Court reviews the decision of the CJD for error on the law or facts and for whether the sanctions imposed were lawful; in a supervisory action, the Court is guided by the duty to safeguard the fairness and integrity of the Unified Judicial System. <em>Compare </em>Pa.

The AOPC and the PBA reject the notion that the Court must defer to the CJD because the Court is the supreme judicial power in the Commonwealth and its orders may not be disturbed by an inferior tribunal.

Make no mistake: no doubt all members of the Court wish that we could have perceived in the prior circumstances the criminal misconduct in Luzerne County, only made apparent by the filing of federal charges. But, the hindsight concern is off-point, indeed gratuitous, respecting the discussion here.

Both <em>Bowman </em>and <em>Gamble </em>implicated the constitutionality of acts of the General Assembly that purported to permit removal of judicial officers from office by means other than those articulated in the Constitution.

And, as the AOPC has noted, the word "exclusive" simply does not appear in the provision; petitioners read it into the text. There is no constitutional provision that places restrictions on the Supreme Court similar to those on the General Assembly respecting the ability to restrict a judicial officer's exercise of his or her office by removal, suspension, or otherwise. Moreover, the exercise of the Court’s supervisory authority in this respect does not implicate the separation of powers concerns that undergird the restrictions on the General Assembly upon which the <em>Gamble </em>decision elaborated.</p>

For example, petitioners emphasize statements in support of defeated amendments — which, unlike the 1993 amendment as ultimately adopted by the electorate, proposed that a majority of the Board’s and CJD's membership would be appointed by the Governor and that the budget of the disciplinary system would be separate from that of the judiciary — to suggest that Article V, Section 18 was intended to create a disciplinary process entirely independent of the Judicial Branch. <em>See </em>1993 Pa. Legislative Journal-House 53, 62 (January 27, 1993) (Piccola amendment). Proponents of the version of Article V, Section 18 that actually prevailed, however, emphasized dual principles supporting the 1993 amendment: "first, the independence of the judiciary, and second, the accountability of the judiciary____We should look in the long run and in the long term as to the impact that too strong an independent board would in fact wreck [sic] upon the separation of powers.

The legislators decried inaction of the sort that petitioners now advocate should be this Court's chosen course. <em>See </em>1992 Pa.

Parenthetically, we note that this Court also exercises its supervisory power over judicial officers in its adoption of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges. The last few decades have witnessed this Court implementing increasingly more comprehensive prophylactic rules respecting judicial conduct. <em>See, e.g., </em>Final Report at 3 (noting that Court directed review of existing rules of judicial conduct in light of Luzerne County events). In drafting these rules, we persist in the aspiration that the judicial office summons in those who serve the highest quality of professionalism and personal comportment. Yet, situations find us that defy these lofty expectations and call for judicial discipline or supervisory action, and further refinement of the rules. The exercise of the transcendent King’s Bench power in individual cases permits the Court to address novel, extraordinary circumstances for which the existing rules of judicial conduct may not yet provide. "The mere knowledge that such a power exists in th[e Supreme Cjourt it is believed will make its frequent use unnecessary.” <em>Batph, </em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.%20220" class="citation" data-index="338" data-cite="3 A. 220">3 A. at 230</a>.

In my view, on balance, withholding salary in the case of felonies relating to conduct on the bench — and thereby allocating the risk of an erroneous decision regarding pay to the accused jurist — better vindicates the public interests in the integrity and dignity of the judicial system, while sufficiently accommodating any concerns of fairness to the jurist. Indeed, I may be “old school,” but in my view, it is disappointing that a judge facing this sort of felony charges, for conduct occurring on the bench, would even pursue the relief Judge Bruno pursued here.

In other instances, however, I believe that a deconstruction of a criminal case premised upon a charging document and one-sided advocacy is a troubling criterion which loses sight of the imperative of judicial integrity — not only in the actuality of integrity, but in the appearance of integrity.

Starting with the second point, it is important to note that the purpose of a charging document is to state a <em>prima facie </em>case. The burden on the <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>government to make a <em>prima facie </em>case is far lower than that which the government is required for the case to proceed to a jury (or to a judicial factfinder) to determine conviction or acquittal. As a result, the assumption that a charging document reflects the universe of evidence available for trial is wrong. More importantly, as the Pennsylvania Bar Association (the “PBA”) recognizes, where the CJD does not, the deconstruction of a charging document “risks an inappropriate collateral attack on the validity of th[e criminal] charges” and potentially embarrassing conflicts with the criminal court adjudicating the charges. PBA Brief at 21.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> In addition, even <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>an acquittal does not mean the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to convict, and thus, the jury’s verdict in this case does not justify an approach by which the merits of charges of wrongdoing pending elsewhere are analyzed anticipatorily. And, finally, the question of whether the federal government will ultimately prove violations of federal criminal law is not coterminous with the question of whether there was misconduct on the bench. A defense of “fixing tickets is not a federal offense, even though it may be unethical, if money did not change hands” may prevail with jurors in an individual case; but an allegation of <em>ex parte </em>interference to fix a case is most certainly a basis for a response, including an interim suspension with or without pay, by the CJD or, if necessary, by this Court.</p>

It is the fact that the specific tickets at issue did not result in guilty adjudications with fees and costs which is at the heart of the entire "ticket-fixing" scheme alleged in the Indictment. The crux of the Government’s conspiracy claim is Defendants’ unique ability to prevent guilty adjudications that allows them to give preferential treatment to certain ticketholders for those with whom they were politically and socially connected. In this case, Defendants are in the unique position of being Traffic Court judges who have the power and, according to the Indictment, used such power to not permit the adjudication of specific traffic citations as guilty with fees and costs.

Upon reflection, and in light of the current presentations and the underlying circumstances as they have unfolded, however, I believe that it was error on our part to routinize a practice of interim suspension upon the indictment of judges on felony charges. I supported that practice, particularly in cases involving allegations of judicial corruption, because I found it unseemly for judges under the cloud of indictments to sit in judgment of their fellow citizens. Nevertheless, I have come to the view that, especially in the areas of interim suspension and discipline expressly directed by the Constitution to a separate constitutional body, the Court of Judicial Discipline’s role should be given primacy, and I find salience in the suggestion that any exercise of King’s Bench authority on our part should occur only in “extraordinary circumstances.” Majority Opinion, at 583, 101 A.3d at 682.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> For example, the Court of Judicial Discipline appears better equipped to make factual determinations in the context of judicial disciplinary proceedings while preserving the jurist’s procedural safeguards and a restrained course on <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>our part would minimize the prospect for overlapping and/or inconsistent orders.</p>

Although this type of action is more limited than an interim suspension order in that it would leave the jurist’s pay unaffected — whereas an interim suspension may be without pay — to my mind such limitation is not especially problematic when compared with the prospect of conflicting orders issuing from this Court and the Court of Judicial Discipline, as occurred vis-á-vis Judge Bruno. While the majority suggests that concurrent operation of the Supreme Court and the Court of Judicial Discipline in the suspension arena can occur “comfortably,” Majority Opinion, at 589-92, 101 A.3d at 686-87, in my opinion the Judicial Conduct Board rightly observes that such conflicting orders are “inexplicable to the public.” Brief for Judicial Conduct Board at 62.</p>

    <p id="b665-8" data-blocks='[["BL_665.8",665,[226,1468,1153,905]]]'>As noted by the majority, Judge Bruno was indicted on January 29, 2013, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania based on alleged impropriety in carrying out his obligations in the Philadelphia Traffic Court. He was charged with one count of conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, and one count of mail fraud. On January 30, 2013, the Judicial Conduct Board (“JCB”) filed with the Court of Judicial Discipline (“CJD”) a petition seeking Judge Bruno’s interim suspension without pay. Unaware that the CJD had been presented with the JCB’s petition the day before, this Court entered an interim order on February 1, 2013, suspending Judge Bruno without pay, pending further order of this Court. We acted with confidence that the federal indictment set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case in accordance with its articulated facts, although, notably, we did not afford Judge Bruno an opportunity to respond to the indictment or otherwise present his “side of the story.”</p>

      <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>What complicated this matter was that after we entered the interim order suspending Judge Bruno without pay, the CJD proceeded to adjudicate the JCB’s previously filed petition for his interim suspension. Following an evidentiary hearing and argument by the parties, the CJD determined that the indictment may not be as strong as its facial appearance, and that the appropriate sanction was to enter an order of temporary suspension, without elimination of Judge Bruno’s salary. Accordingly, the CJD issued an order suspending Judge Bruno with pay, in direct contradiction to our order suspending him without pay. Judge Bruno subsequently filed a petition in this Court, requesting that we vacate our order suspending him without pay. This Court ordered briefing and oral argument on the merits of his petition; but, by interim order dated July 11, 2013, retroactively reinstated Judge Bruno’s pay, pending final disposition of his petition. On July 23, 2014, Judge Bruno was acquitted of all charges. Thus, on August 28, 2014, we finally vacated our order of February 1, 2013, suspending Judge Bruno without pay, and indicated that an opinion would follow.</p>

It rejects Judge Bruno’s contention that this Court’s supervisory authority over “the administration of all courts and supervision of all officers of the Judicial Branch,” as granted by Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and as invoked in this case pursuant to our King’s Bench authority, was either rescinded or diminished by the adoption of Article V, Section 18, which created the Judicial Conduct Board (“JCB”) and the CJD, and gave those tribunals authority to prosecute and adjudicate claims of judicial misconduct.</p>

In all candor, had I known that the JCB had already filed in the CJD the petition seeking the temporary suspension of Judge Bruno without pay, and that the CJD was prepared to take imminent action thereon, I would have been content to await the CJD’s action, rather than issue our sm <em>sponte </em>interim order of February 1, 2013, suspending Judge Bruno without pay.</p>

For instance, the majority holds that the CJD should address routine matters of judicial misconduct, with this Court acting only in extraordinary circumstances. The majority does not, however, define what constitutes extraordinary circumstances, and leaves that determination to develop incrementally in the law. Further, there is the question of the appropriate timing for this Court to act. As a general matter, I believe we should allow the CJD a fair opportunity to act before we determine whether our involvement in a judicial misconduct case is necessary. While I do not endeavor to define extraordinary circumstances or pronounce precise timeframes in the paradigm of the facts presented, or more broadly, I suggest that we coordinate the efforts of this Court and the CJD to utilize judicial resources in the best manner and avoid issuance of conflicting orders.</p>

Either way, we would proceed with open eyes, and the possibility of both tribunals employing duplicative judicial resources and entering inconsistent directives would be reduced or eliminated.</p>

Admittedly, this analogy is not directly on point because, unlike trial courts with equivalent authority, the CJD is an inferior tribunal to this Court. Nevertheless, similar to trial courts in different jurisdictions acting in furtherance of the unified goal of avoiding contradictory custody rulings, this Court’s knowledge of a pending action in the CJD would be helpful in determining the appropriate course of action and avoiding inconsistent edicts in judicial misconduct cases.</p>

The resulting amendment constituted a momentous and far-reaching overhaul of the method for disciplining jurists in Pennsylvania, including implementing an idiosyncratic process for the discipline of Justices.
