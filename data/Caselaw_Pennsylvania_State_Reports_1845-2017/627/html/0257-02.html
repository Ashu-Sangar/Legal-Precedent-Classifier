I began my concurrence by noting that the source of the FCDO’s funding for its questionable forays into state court capital proceedings was not clear, though it appeared that the Administrative Office of Federal Courts (hereinafter “AO”) played a central role, and that this federal role in state court capital litigation was implemented without the consultation or involvement of this Court or any other relevant Pennsylvania authority.

This is an appropriate case to highlight those issues.</blockquote>

As I will detail below, the incremental insinuation of the FCDO into Pennsylvania capital cases has been remarkable in its stealth and pervasiveness. The FCDO has designated itself the <em>de facto </em>State Capital Defender’s Office, involving itself not only in virtually all capital PCRA<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> litigation, but also in direct capital appeals, and even, in one instance, as <em>amicus curiae </em>on behalf of a foreign nation, Mexico, in support of a Mexican national who murdered three people.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> No authority — state or federal— appointed the FCDO to take on this statewide role, and no authority has approved the arrangement. Pennsylvania does not have a statewide capital prosecutor’s office; and notably, in a great many capital cases, the chief law enforcement officer of the Commonwealth, the Attorney General, echoed by county prosecutors, has taken the position that the FCDO should not be permitted to continue in Pennsylvania capital cases without proving its specific federal authorization to do so.</p>

Remarkably, when directed by this Court to provide simple and modest information confirming a claim that it has not supported its private capital case agenda in Pennsylvania with improperly diverted federal funds, the FCDO response — the response of these officers of the court, to the Court with supervisory authority over the practice of law in Pennsylvania-<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>has been refusal and the removal of cases to federal court, ensuring yet more FCDO delay in those capital matters.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[274,449,1146,626]]]'>The circumstances and obstructionist effect of the FCDO’s silent takeover of the capital PCRA defense function in Pennsylvania requires that Pennsylvania reassert control over the litigation of state capital matters. Death penalty opponents, such as the FCDO, can then redirect their efforts to the political arena, where they belong. This Court.has a responsibility for the entire Pennsylvania judicial system, to ensure the delivery of swift, fair, and evenhanded justice in all cases. We are not obliged to indulge or countenance a group which manipulates and abuses the judicial process in Pennsylvania in the hopes of achieving a global political result that it has failed to secure through the political process.</p>

But, the void is an opportunity to return capital case advocacy to principled moorings. The restoration will require that Pennsylvania authorities, including this Court, step up and ensure the provision of the funding, training and resources necessary to ensure that capital defense representation in Pennsylvania fully meets Sixth Amendment standards, with competent, properly compensated and dedicated lawyers who act zealously to advance the cause of their clients, but who act ethically as well, mindful of their duties to the courts and the justice system overall. I believe the Commonwealth is up to the challenge.</p>

But, as I explain below, the FCDO continues to pursue an agenda beyond mere zealous representation, one which routinely pushes, and in frequent instances, as here, far exceeds ethical boundaries. FCDO lawyers appear in Pennsylvania courts only as officers of this Court; consequently, they are answerable to the Court. So long as the organization remains unauthorized to pursue its global agenda by any Pennsylvania authority, and so long as the FCDO refuses to be candid with the Court about its authorization and funding, it cannot be <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>permitted to continue its representation of capital defendants in Pennsylvania, absent a specific federal court order authorizing the specific endeavor in state court in an individual case.</p>

But like a rolling freight train, the use of the Great Writ gathered speed in the ensuing decades. It was adopted by the federal courts, codified by Congress, revised, and to some degree limited in certain respects. But the case at bar amply demonstrates that there is something grievously amiss in both our laws and jurisprudence as they relate to federal habeas practice. For while we admire zealous advocacy and deeply respect the mission and work of the attorneys who have represented Abdul-Salaam in this matter, they are at bottom gaming a system and erecting roadblocks in aid of a singular goal — keeping Abdul-Salaam from being put to death. The result has been the meandering and even bizarre course this case has followed. Its time on our docket has spanned nearly all of our service as a federal judge — almost twelve years. We have given Abdul-Salaam every courtesy and due process, perhaps even beyond what the law affords. <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>And yet for the family of Willis Cole, and indeed for Abdul-Salaam and his family as well, there has been no closure.

Simply stated, we all are called upon to promote respect for the law, our profession, and to do public good. Consistent with these guiding principles, the tactics used in this case require the Court to speak with candor. This case has caused me to reasonably question where the line exists between a zealous defense and an agenda-driven litigation strategy, such as the budget-breaking resource-breaking strategy on display in this case. Here, the cost to the people and to the trial Court was very high. This Court had to devote twenty two <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>full and partial days to hearings. To carry out the daily business of this Court visiting Senior Judges were brought in. The District Attorney’s capital litigation budget had to have been impacted. With seemingly unlimited access to funding, the Federal Defender came with two or three attorneys, and usually two assistants. They flew in witnesses from around the Country. Additionally, they raised overlapping issues, issues that were previously litigated, and issues that were contrary to Pennsylvania Supreme Court holdings or otherwise lacked merit.</blockquote>

Contrary to the FCDO claim in the Withdrawal pleading, Attorney Skipper no longer verifies that the FCDO’s activities in state court are authorized by federal law as activities ancillary to the federal <em>habeas corpus </em>exhaustion requirement. Instead, Attorney Skipper concedes that the FCDO is authorized to represent state and federal death row inmates in federal court only pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203599" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 3599">18 U.S.C. § 3599</a>(a)(2), which governs litigation of federal <em>habeas corpus </em>petitions filed under <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 2254">28 U.S.C. § 2254</a> (state prisoners) and § 2255 (federal prisoners). Attorney Skipper next notes the federal <em>habeas </em>requirement that state prisoners fairly exhaust their federal claims in state court before pursuing them in federal court. Attorney Skipper states that 18 U.S.C. §§ 3006A and 3599 empower federal courts to authorize appointed federal <em>habeas </em>counsel to represent capital defendants in state court. Attorney Skipper quotes Section 3599, which states that appointed federal <em>habeas </em>counsel shall represent the defendant at “every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 2254">Id.</a> </em>§ 3599(e).

Attorney Skipper states that nothing in federal legislation or AO “policies” prohibits FCDO lawyers from appearing as private lawyers in state court, so long as federal grant money does not finance that FCDO agenda. Attorney Skipper does not address whether the FCDO discloses to Pennsylvania courts when it is acting pursuant to the FCDO’s private <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>budget and agenda, rather than as counsel approved for a limited purpose by a federal judge, supported by federal taxpayer funds.</p>

Attorney Skipper attaches no supporting documentation, nor does he provide an explanation of the manner in which the FCDO’S state court activity in this case — including the commitment of six FCDO lawyers and numerous experts and investigators below, and preparation of the abusive brief filed on appeal — was funded. In addition, he does not suggest the amount of private funding available to support the FCDO’s private capital agenda in state capital proceedings. And, he does not explain the mechanics of the hybrid operation: <em>e.g., </em>are FCDO staff salaried or do they bill (publicly and privately) by the hour; are benefits such as health care, pensions, and leave time allocated between public and private funding, <em>etc. </em>Nor, again, does Attorney Skipper assert that the construct he describes represents the “applicable federal administrative rules and regulations” Attorney Wiseman referred to in asserting the FCDO’s full compliance.</p>

In other cases, he says, the FCDO is appointed by a federal court for federal <em>habeas </em>purposes and then determines to use nonfederal funds to appear privately in state court to exhaust state court remedies in advance of federal review. In other cases, he says, the FCDO makes cost-allocations between private and federal taxpayer funding. Attorney Skipper further declares that in some cases, the FCDO — using exclusively nonfederal funds — appears in state court to “protect” the rights of Pennsylvania capital prisoners <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>who, in its opinion, are likely to be entitled to FCDO representation if the case ever proceeded to federal <em>habeas </em>review. Attorney Skipper adds that, in some instances, the FCDO has been appointed to represent capital PCRA petitioners in state court; he does not state under what authority such appointments were secured; in any event, these activities likewise must fall under the FCDO’s private agenda, since it would be inappropriate to use federal funds for the endeavor.</p>
    <p id="b327-5" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[225,760,1150,897]]]'>Following this summary, Attorney Skipper represents that “[t]he FCDO believes we have properly entered appearances” in the PCRA cases he lists in an accompanying summary of then-open Pennsylvania capital cases in which the FCDO was involved. Moving from the question of entry of appearances to the use of federal funds, Attorney Skipper continues that the FCDO, in conjunction with the AO, “takes steps to ensure that the costs of litigation are properly allocated between federal and other funding sources” and, he declares, as of the time of the Verified Statement at least, “such allocations are proper.” No definition of what are deemed to be “costs of litigation” is offered. Nor is any documentation offered in support of this averment, so that its accuracy may be measured here, in the context of the FCDO’s allegation that my Concurring Opinion must be withdrawn because, <em>inter alia, </em>it “incorrectly” suggested that the FCDO misused federal funds to support its private state court capital agenda.</p>
    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[225,1682,1151,685]],["BL_328.1",328,[274,328,1146,87]]]'>Notably, however, Attorney Skipper states that, to discharge his ethical duties, he now “corrects” Attorney Wise-man’s absolutist assertion of “the FCDO’s ‘full’ compliance with applicable federal administrative rules and regulations.” Attorney Skipper explains that internal reviews of cases “have disclosed situations in the past in which prior allocations of costs were not in full compliance with administrative rules and regulations.” Attorney Skipper does not identify these cases where the FCDO violated federal funding restrictions, as measured by the “administrative rules and regulations” he does not provide and within a system of cost allocation that is not described; nor does he explain how pervasive and longstanding the violations were or whether the extraordinary <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>commitment of resources in this case represented one such violation.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[273,444,1148,1206]]]'>Attorney Skipper next advises that the FCDO, along with the AO, is “taking further measures and adding additional safeguards” to ensure compliance with the undisclosed federal rules and regulations. No specifics or supporting documentation are offered to permit an assessment of the FCDO’s prior claim of “full compliance,” its current position that it was formerly non-compliant, but now is compliant, or its assurance that “new measures” will prevent a continuation or recurrence of the prior violations. Nor, significantly, are any specifics provided that would offer the Court any assurance that, in permitting the FCDO to litigate in Pennsylvania courts where it has not been specifically authorized by federal court order, Pennsylvania courts are not facilitating a continuing, improper diversion of federal taxpayer money to support the FCDO’s private capital case agenda. In this regard, it is notable that the FCDO never indicates in its entries of appearance and its pleadings in Pennsylvania courts whether it is appearing in its capacity as purely-privately-funded counsel, or in its capacity as the federally-financed “federal defender.” The FCDO affiliation by which FCDO lawyers routinely identify themselves gives the impression that the organization’s appearances in state court are sanctioned and supported by the federal government.</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[272,1684,1147,682]],["BL_329.1",329,[229,323,1149,733]]]'>The Verified Statement next addresses this Court’s directive to identify the Pennsylvania capital defendants the FCDO was then representing or assisting, whether the involvement was by court appointment, and how and under what authority the FCDO was involved if not by court appointment. Attorney Skipper first seems to suggest that Congress’s restrictions on appointed federal <em>habeas </em>counsel’s appearances in state court does not prevent the FCDO from diverting federal funds to investigate prospective federal claims and provide the fruit of that labor to “clients” who may then present the claims in state court. Parenthetically, this is a strange assertion given Attorney Skipper’s prior averments. Under Attorney Skipper’s own account, federal funds may <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>only be employed in state court with specific federal court authorization. Moreover, the FCDO has no “client” for purposes of federal grant expenditures except when it has been appointed to actively pursue federal <em>habeas corpus </em>relief, which can only occur after the defendant’s state court remedies have been exhausted: that is the statutory <em>sine qua non </em>for court-authorized “ancillary” or “subsequent” state court litigation. Attorney Skipper identifies no statute that permits the diversion of federal tax dollars for advance shadow activity in support of a non-client’s state court capital pleadings. To the extent the FCDO continues to use federal funding for this sort of activity, the “further measures” and “additional safeguards” Attorney Skipper adverts to do not address the problem.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[231,1080,1148,406]]]'>Attorney Skipper also provides a chart with a list of cases— cases in addition to the untold number of “fruits of its labor” cases-in which the FCDO was then providing representation in Pennsylvania state courts to capital defendants, or was consulting with lawyers actually appointed or retained for the purpose. The chart also lists whether the FCDO was appointed and by what court, and if not, how the FCDO became involved.</p>
    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[232,1519,1148,518]]]'>The chart is a remarkable snapshot of just how thoroughly the FCDO has involved itself in Pennsylvania state capital litigation. According to the chart, FCDO lawyers were then actively providing representation in Pennsylvania state court litigation in 108 relevant cases, 97 of which were capital. (From other notations, it appears that the 11 noncapital matters involve defendants who have or had separate capital convictions; presumably, the litigation was pursued in the hope of generating collateral grounds to attack the capital convictions.)</p>

But, I admit that I had little idea just how pervasive the FCDO presence, and the consequent potential for its litigation abuses, had become. It is starkly apparent, from the FCDO’s chart and my own review of Pennsylvania capital cases, that a group of federally-financed “private” lawyers has managed to insinuate themselves into virtually every Pennsylvania capital case where they can manage the intrusion. Indeed, the FCDO has proven adept at inserting itself into cases even where the defendant has made clear that he does not want FCDO assistance, or to further the FCDO agenda. And, as my discussion below demonstrates, the FCDO’s effective self-appointment as a sort of statewide defender in capital PCRA matters has been achieved without the input, much less the approval, of any relevant Pennsylvania authority. The propriety of the unapproved arrangement is beyond dubious, given the FCDO’s demonstrated obstructionist private agenda.</p>

    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[228,898,1151,1017]]]'>The two attached orders, however, reveal that the FCDO was never authorized to prosecute appellant’s PCRA petition and appeal with federal funds, as ancillary to its appointment for federal <em>habeas </em>purposes. The orders were issued by the Honorable James M. Munley of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The first order, dated April 12, 2002, appointed the FCDO in connection with a stay of execution and directed the FCDO to file a federal <em>habeas corpus </em>petition within 120 days. The second order, dated May 10, 2006, was in connection with a second stay of execution; the order appointed the FCDO “to represent Petitioner in his to-be-filed habeas corpus petition,” and the order directed that the petition be filed within 180 days. Neither order authorized the FCDO to litigate an initial PCRA petition on appellant’s behalf, much less to do so by using federal funds. On November 27, 2002, Judge Munley denied the FCDO request to hold appellant’s federal <em>habeas </em>proceedings in abeyance while the FCDO pursued PCRA relief; dismissed the federal <em>habeas </em>petition; and directed the clerk to close the case.</p>

Some of the 63 cases involve serial PCRA petitions, and it is possible that a federal judge authorized the FCDO to exhaust a discrete new claim in a serial PCRA petition, pursuant to footnote 7 of <em>Harbison v. Bell. </em>The FCDO does not identify which of the 63 cases involve serial PCRA petitions and which, if any, involve specific federal court authorization to litigate a serial PCRA petition. In fact, my review reveals that 50 of the cases involve initial PCRA petitions, and at least 3 of the 13 remaining cases, which appear to be serial PCRA matters, involve defendants the FCDO previously represented, or attempted to represent, in first PCRA petitions <em>(Commonwealth v. Emanuel Lester aka Ali; Commonwealth v. Antoine Ligons; </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Ronald </em>Puksar). Thus, at least 53 of these 63 cases involve FCDO litigation of initial PCRA petitions in advance of federal <em>habeas </em>review. Given the federal statutory scheme and <em>Harbison v. Bell </em>— as the FCDO’s pleading here itself describes those restrictions — the FCDO’s pursuit of its private agenda in the 53 cases cannot lawfully be supported by the diversion of a penny of federal funds.</p>

Again, the FCDO did not respond to this Court’s order by claiming that its PCRA activities here were supported solely by its private funds Instead, the FCDO represents — incorrectly— that its abusive activities were “authorized” as “ancillary” to a federal court appointment. The 53 first-PCRA petition capital cases identified by the FCDO no doubt present like circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>the FCDO federal appointment was to file a federal <em>habeas </em>petition, -with no authorization to improperly <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>use federal tax dollars to pursue initial PCRA petitions in state courts.

Although the FCDO’s overall position is elusive and inconsistent, its core position, and its actual conduct, suggests its belief that it is free to redirect federal tax dollars to its private state court agenda whenever it has, or anticipates, a federal court appointment for purposes of federal <em>habeas </em>review. That position, which would apply to all 53 cases in this class, contradicts what the FCDO has admitted are the plain limitations in the federal statutory scheme and <em>Harbison v. Bell.</em>

It is difficult to believe that the FCDO has an annual private funding stream anywhere near that size, or indeed a funding stream sufficient to support the extensive litigation in this case alone.

And, when the FCDO enters a case, it deploys teams of investigators, paralegals, lawyers and experts, and reams of paper, pleadings, amendments, <em>etc. </em>Notably, on May 15, 2011, immediately after the Court’s decision in this appeal, the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>reported that David Rudovsky, Esquire, the President of the Philadelphia Defender Association, which oversees the FCDO, took the same position Attorney Skipper initially did in his Withdrawal pleading: <em>i.e., </em>that the FCDO diverts federal grant money to support most of its work in capital PCRA litigation, claiming that federal law allows the diversion in advance of federal <em>habeas </em>review, so as to exhaust claims.

The statutory authority cited by both parties here, as well as the decision in <em>Harbison v.

      <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>First, under the docket number for the dormant federal <em>habeas </em>petition held in abeyance while the FCDO pursued Mitchell’s PCRA petition, the FCDO filed a “Motion to Reactivate Case in Order to Enter an Order Directing Petitioner’s Counsel to Exhaust Claims in State Court.” In short, the FCDO sought retroactive federal authorization for extensive state court actions it had already undertaken and — according to what it told this Court — had supported strictly with its “private” resources. The FCDO related that, after filing the PCRA appeal now pending, it began investigating new claims not pursued by PCRA counsel. (In fact, the brief the FCDO eventually filed in this Court raises 15 claims, many of which are new, non-federal claims alleging that Mitchell’s PCRA counsel was ineffective.) The federal pleading stated that the FCDO conducted this serial PCRA investigation in “reasonable anticipation” of one day being appointed to serve as Mitchell’s federal <em>habeas </em>counsel. Meanwhile, the FCDO prepared and filed a federal <em>habeas </em>petition on March 25, 2011, which included the new claims it had developed. The FCDO asked to be appointed to represent Mitchell on the federal <em>habeas </em>petition it had already prepared; and then asked that the same petition be held in abeyance. Both requests were granted. The federal court, however, never appointed the FCDO to litigate the PCRA appeal and the new claims the FCDO had developed.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[270,1723,1151,636]]]'>The FCDO then remarkably claimed that both the Commonwealth’s Motion to Remove Counsel and this Court’s order “are part of a broader, ongoing effort on the part of some prosecutors’ offices ... to deprive capital petitioners” of FCDO representation. The FCDO noted instances where this Court remanded for determinations of whether the FCDO should be permitted to remain in a capital case; instances where county prosecutors made challenges to FCDO appearances; and instances where the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office sought to disqualify it. In each case, the FCDO said, it had removed or will remove those questions to federal court.</p>

      <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>Turning to its legal argument, the FCDO claimed that our remand in <em>Mitchell </em>“directs the PCRA court to take action against the FCDO that is pre-empted by federal law.” The FCDO alleged that the propriety of its appearance in <em>Mitchell </em>was not “unclear” merely because it acted without authorization. The FCDO further argued that the federal court had the authority to expand the FCDO’s appointment to encompass pre-federal <em>habeas </em>matters under <em>Harbison v. Bell </em>and <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203599" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 3599">18 U.S.C. § 3599</a>, notwithstanding that those authorities speak of state court proceedings subsequent or ancillary to federal <em>habeas </em>review. Finally, the FCDO opined that Mitchell’s claims will never be “properly exhausted” unless the FCDO does the exhausting.</p>
    <p id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[226,1040,1149,732]]]'>Judge McLaughlin denied the reactivation motion in a memorandum dated August 15, 2013. <em>See Mitchell v.

Judge McLaughlin noted that the FCDO was requesting her to “expressly authorize the FCDO to pursue Mitchell’s state court proceedings in the scope of its federally funded duties.” <em>Id. </em>at *2. Judge McLaughlin’s reasoning is instructive because it confirms what the federal statute plainly states, what the FCDO was told years ago when it attempted the same diversion of federal funds in <em>Wilson v.

Here, the FCDO stated outright that its Motion to Reactivate was designed to “moot” this Court’s administrative remand Order. The Notice of Removal said that the FCDO removed the counsel representation question from the PCRA court pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201442" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="28 U.S.C. §§ 1442">28 U.S.C. §§ 1442</a>(a) and (d)(1) and 1446(g).

The FCDO posited that defender organizations are federally funded to assist the federal government in providing representation to indigent defendants in federal criminal proceedings, including <em>habeas </em>proceedings involving state prisoners. The FCDO then bootstrapped from this authorized federal court role the proposition that it acts under an officer or agency of the U.S. government even when it pursues its private agenda by insert<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>ing itself into state capital proceedings in advance of federal review.</p>

The FCDO claimed that any attempt to enforce the provision by a state court somehow frustrates federal law and is therefore preempted.

As noted above, the FCDO removed to federal court a number of other capital cases where similar inquiries were underway, and then moved to dismiss them; and the Commonwealth responded along the same lines as it did in <em>Mitchell, i.e., </em>seeking remand of this Court’s supervisory questions to state court. The federal district courts have split <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>on the appropriate response: the <em>Mitchell </em>case and at least two others filed in the Eastern District resulted in a denial of the Commonwealth’s motion to remand and a grant of the FCDO motion to dismiss the action it removed; while three cases removed to the Middle District, and assigned to Judge A.

In his initial memorandum, Judge Caputo noted that, among other things, the FCDO had to show that it “acts under” a federal officer in order to prove removal jurisdiction under Section 1442(a)(1); and the FCDO’s essential position was that, as a federal grantee/contractor under the Criminal Justice Act, it “acts under” the AO even when acting exclusively pursuant to its private agenda in state capital cases. The Commonwealth rejoined that no federal agency is obliged to appear in state court, or to provide legal representation to criminal defendants in state court, and thus the FCDO is not serving the federal government when it represents indigent criminal defendants in state court proceedings that precede federal <em>habeas </em>review.</p>

A necessary condition to invoke the federal officer removal statute, the assistance or carrying out of duties of a federal superior, is therefore absent in this case. As a result, even if the FCDO is “acting under” a federal officer in the course of its representation of clients in federal court, it does not follow that it also “act[s] under” a federal officer in its performance of tasks for which the Government bears no responsibility, such as appearing in state postconviction capital proceedings to exhaust claims for federal habeas review. * * *</blockquote>

The Motion says recusal is required because I “attacked” the “integrity, ethics and methods” of the FCDO. The Motion thus echoes other recusal motions the FCDO has filed, which confuse the dubious conduct of FCDO attorneys with the cause of their clients, and suggest that ethically questionable FCDO conduct, if commented upon by a jurist, requires removal of the jurist rather than, for example, better conduct by, or removal of, the FCDO as counsel.

Specifically, the Withdrawal pleading argues that the FCDO is authorized to engage in state capital PCRA litigation in advance of federal <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings in order to exhaust federal <em>habeas </em>claims. The pleading further declares that the FCDO’s state court exhaustion activities are authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(c), which permits appointed federal counsel to represent clients in ancillary matters “appropriate to the proceedings.” As noted above, this interpretation of the governing federal statute is abjectly mistaken, and indeed is contradicted by the FCDO’s later account of the statute in its Verified Statement — ancillary matters cannot precede federal <em>habeas </em>review, and so litigation of a first PCRA petition cannot properly be ancillary to a federal court appointment for <em>habeas </em>purposes.</p>

The pleading argues that the attempted withdrawal, without leave of Court, “renders the matter moot.” In support, the FCDO claims that no case or controversy remains and, in a further collateral attack upon the Court’s July 28 Order, cites the minority view in Justice Todd’s Dissenting Statement. Finally, the FCDO collaterally attacks the Court’s July 28 Order by arguing that, even though it was withdrawing its prior Motions, the Court should vacate its order on mootness grounds.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that withdrawal of the FCDO’s motion will not put an end to the FCDO’s demonstrated abusive litigation tactics in state courts; withdrawal of the FCDO from unauthorized state court litigation is the only way to eliminate those ongoing <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>abuses. In addition, the Commonwealth notes that the FCDO’s opinion that withdrawal is “appropriate” is immaterial, since that question is for the Court; and, in any event, the Commonwealth does not withdraw its Motion for Sanctions, which is premised upon the FCDO’s two ancillary Motions being frivolous. Respecting the FCDO’s disputation of the propriety of the July 28 order, the Commonwealth notes the FCDO’s failure to request reconsideration or a stay, and its choice instead to violate the Order and file a “Withdrawal” which “stat[ed] that this Honorable Court’s order is wrong and that they do not wish to litigate why.” Respecting the FCDO’s mootness assertion and its request to vacate the Order, the Commonwealth again notes the pendency of its Motion for Sanctions. The Commonwealth adds that the FCDO’s Motions, which are frivolous, nevertheless required the Commonwealth to expend time and money to prepare replies.</p>

The Commonwealth’s argument anticipates the view of the federal restrictions eventually acknowledged by Attorney Skipper in his subsequently-filed Verified Statement, because it is the only plausible view: <em>i.e., </em>the FCDO is not authorized, by virtue an appointment in federal <em>habeas </em>matters, to litigate capital PCRA petitions and appeals in advance of federal <em>habeas </em>under a federal statute allowing for appointment to pursue matters “ancillary” to federal <em>habeas </em>proceedings. The Commonwealth, like the FCDO and Judge McLaughlin, also identifies <em>Harbison v. Bell </em>as controlling, since <em>Harbison </em>held that the proper interplay of state collateral review and federal <em>habeas </em>review of state convictions means that federal <em>habeas </em>appointment and representation is appropriate only after state proceedings have concluded. Thus, Section 3599(e) only authorizes “federally funded counsel” to “represent her client in ‘subsequent’ stages of available judicial proceedings.” The <em>Harbison </em>Court emphasized:</p>

FCDO counsel was ordered to provide the information necessary to determine the FCDO’s Motions and the Commonwealth’s responsive Motion seeking sanctions. It is not for a litigant or his attorney to say whether a Court order is “necessary” or whether a matter, taken under advisement by the Court, has become moot, or whether counsel’s slant on mootness authorizes and allows counsel to defy an unambiguous Court order.

As the FCDO itself admitted, the subject concerned an important issue: the propriety of the FCDO’s pervasive conduct and agenda in Pennsylvania capital cases. Notably, the FCDO’s initial allegations went uncorrected in its Withdrawal pleading, and those claims remain uncorrected, except for Attorney Skipper’s non-case-specific admission that Attorney Wiseman’s prior representation that the FCDO was in full compliance with federal rules and regulations was untrue.

No substantive or procedural rights are created, nor are any such rights diminished.” The IOPs create no rights. Second, nothing in the customs and traditions reflected in the IOPs purports to discourage, much less ban, joining concurrences. Indeed, Section 4(B) of the IOPs, the only subsection the FCDO cites, addresses only the “labeling” of opinions; it does not address or restrict the filing of opinions. Third, what the FCDO calls a subsection “defining” a “concurring opinion” in fact is a provision that is merely entitled “Concurrences and Dissents.” The subsection discusses and distinguishes the variety of responsive opinions premised upon the positions of the expressions with respect to the overall mandate; the subsection does not purport to ban responsive opinions, much less does it ban joining concurrences. Finally, the FCDO’s argument also misreads the select portion of the IOP it quotes: “An opinion is a ‘concurring opinion’ when it agrees with the result of the lead opinion. A Justice who agrees with the result of the lead opinion, but does not agree with the rationale supporting the lead opinion, in whole or in part, may write a separate ‘concurring opin<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>ion.’ ” This provision merely records the Court’s “custom and tradition” that a “concurring opinion” is one that “agrees with the result of the lead opinion,” which my Concurring Opinion expressly did.

From this purported authority, the FCDO derives the central proposition that capital PCRA counsel on appeal are ethically required to litigate “all issues” counsel deem “arguably meritorious” — even if those claims were “previously presented.” Motion, 5. On the question of the bedrock ethical prohibition against raising frivolous claims, the FCDO cavalierly declares that “ ‘frivolous’ is often in the eye of the beholder.” Respecting this case, the FCDO asserts that the 70-plus claims and sub-claims it raised in its Brief “meet both the ‘arguably meritorious’ standard of the ABA Guidelines, and the standard of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct, <em>i.e., </em>that a lawyer not raise a claim ‘unless there is a basis in law or fact for doing so that is not frivolous, <em>which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.’ ” </em>Motion, 7 (emphasis by FCDO).

      <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>The FCDO claims that the defendant’s federal constitutional claims must be exhausted in state court in order to pursue the same claims on subsequent federal <em>habeas </em>review, if any such review should occur. Ignoring that federal <em>habeas </em>review is not the primary or exclusive focus of state court litigation, that collateral point is true enough. But, the federal exhaustion requirement does not mean that all possible claims (federal and state) must, may or should be presented in an appeal to the Commonwealth’s highest Court; and it certainly does not mean that all conceivable claims must be listed, even if only in vague, conclusory, skeletal or unintelligible fashion. To the contrary, the federal <em>habeas </em>exhaustion doctrine requires a fair presentation of federal claims to state courts. “Just as the State must afford the petitioner a full and fair hearing on his federal claim, so must the petitioner afford the State a full and fair opportunity to resolve the claim on the merits.” <em>Keeney v.

Deliberately abusing a state’s highest court with a list of bald assertions — as the FCDO deliberately did here — does not fairly articulate federal claims. A boilerplate declaration with a footnote containing unexplained citations does not fairly present and properly exhaust a federal claim. Rather, the tactic abuses and pesters the state court. And, nothing in the federal exhaustion requirement authorizes lawyers to ignore or subvert state court briefing rules and specific court orders governing the content, form, and length of briefs.</p>

The FCDO initially requested leave to file a brief of 137 pages in length — twice the authorized maximum. The request was largely boilerplate, apparently borrowed from a template where the request was to accept a brief of 100 pages. Thus, where the number “100” appeared in typeface, FCDO counsel crossed it out and scribbled in, “137.” This effort led to the following contradictory assertion concerning what this Court “routinely accepts:”</p>

It is apparent that the Brief ultimately filed represented the FCDO’s deliberate flouting of a specific order rejecting a 137-page brief. Rather than comply with a Court order, the FCDO abused the Court, dispensing with a statement of the case, and jamming non-developed issues into bullet points and footnotes.

The FCDO then argues that my “misperception” concerning the proper role of capital PCRA defense counsel is proven by consultation of the ABA’s 2003 “Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases.” <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=31%20Hofstra%20L.%20Rev.%20913" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913">31 Hofstra L.Rev. 913</a> (2003). The FCDO says that it takes its “approach to capital representation” from the 2003 ABA Guidelines. The FCDO argues that it would be easy to comply with briefing rules if the FCDO “raised only two or three claims in each brief,” but “it would be ethically improper for the FCDO to “winnow’ claims in that fashion” in a capital PCRA appeal. Rather, the <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>FCDO states, it believes it has “an ethical duty to raise and exhaust claims on behalf of our clients.” The FCDO adds that its decision to raise innumerable claims follows the ABA’s preference, which urges capital collateral counsel to litigate all “arguably meritorious” claims and to beware that winnowing issues “can have fatal consequences.” Motion, 6, 29, quoting ABA Guidelines. This argument does not begin to excuse the abuses and excesses in the FCDO Brief here or in its capital litigation agenda generally. Indeed, the fact that the FCDO admits that its agenda in Pennsylvania cases follows this approach as a matter of routine is reason enough to remove it from all Pennsylvania capital cases.</p>

The FCDO raised over seventy issues or sub-issues. Second, the implied notion that the FCDO’s asserted “ethical duty” to raise all claims is an excuse to flout briefing rules, and specific briefing orders from the Court, obviously is frivolous. FCDO lawyers — like all lawyers — are obligated to obey court rules and orders, and to conform their strategies and agendas to that ethical reality. If the FCDO thinks that a state court briefing rule or court ruling violates the federal Constitution, the FCDO should be frank and raise and articulate that claim. But, the fact that a reasonable rule or ruling impedes the FCDO’s agenda does not grant the organization license to contemptuously flout both the restriction and the Court.</p>

The FCDO appears to suggest that the ABA would approve the abusive brief it filed here; I certainly hope that would not be the case. But, the ABA’s approval, or its disapproval of the FCDO’s conduct, is irrelevant.

Thus, the FCDO’s current complaint provides no basis for the withdrawal of my Concurring Opinion on grounds that I, rather than the FCDO, “misperceive” the “proper” role of capital PCRA counsel. The actual governing principle for ethical capital PCRA counsel is to make reasonable choices in determining which issues to pursue, so as not to pester the court and cause delay just for the sake of delay; to candidly acknowledge governing law; and to file professional pleadings that conform to court rules, court rulings, and the actual ethical standards governing our profession. Legitimate representation, however zealous, does not embrace a scorched earth policy of listing all possible claims, developing them erratically or not at all, flouting court rulings, seeking to manipulate procedural defaults, placing the burden upon the Court to drop all other matters in an attempt to decipher the Brief, and <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>then further wasting the Court’s time and resources when ethical lapses are noted.

I have already addressed these mistaken notions. Moreover, it bears repeating that the FCDO, despite burdening the Court with this Motion, never attempts to defend the actual Brief it filed in this case except through generic, and mistaken, assertions.

Instead, the FCDO embarked upon a deliberate course to secure for itself the statewide role of primary counsel for capital PCRA petitioners through some form of private, “volunteer” arrangements with individual defendants.

Lawyers owe competing duties: to their clients primarily, but they are also constrained by core ethical duties to the court. This reality can create tensions in any criminal case, especially with difficult clients, and the stakes are higher in capital cases. Nevertheless, no lawyer is authorized to abuse a court, by raising frivolous claims, or flouting a court briefing order, to appease a client. In some <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>cases, the lawyer must stand up to the client, or the client must pursue his own cause.</p>

A criminal defendant, like citizens generally, has a right to self-representation, even if his lawyer thinks self-representation is a bad idea; and he certainly has a right to refuse the unwanted assistance of non-retained, non-appointed, “volunteer” “private” federal lawyers pursuing their own agenda. But, none of these scenarios ever authorize an officer of the court — retained, appointed, or volunteer — to abuse and burden the court, whether to indulge the client or for any other reason. General questions of ethics aside, the only lawyer who would have difficulty navigating these shoals is one who decides that remaining in the case at all costs is the prime directive. And, that is where the FCDO’s special political agenda comes in: not only is the FCDO obviously willing to abuse the court to keep its client happy — which is even in question here (as explained infra)— but the FCDO has demonstrated in multiple cases the lengths to which it will go to remain in a case against its client’s wishes, as I noted in my Concurring Opinion. <em>Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/610/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="143" data-cite="18 A.3d 244" data-case-ids="4201975,7280594" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0017-01,/a3d/18/0244-01">18 A.3d at 339</a> (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by McCaffery, J.)

      <em>Id. </em>at 582-83. Given the prior conduct of the FCDO in deliberately seeking to create state procedural defaults that will not be honored by federal <em>habeas </em>courts, the organization can be expected to manipulate claims they raise in state court, in order to take advantage of the <em>Martinez </em>exception. It is far better to have capital PCRA matters handled by lawyers who do not pursue such global, unethical agendas, but who instead ethically and zealously pursue their client’s cause.</p>

Since the manner of its involvement is not regulated by any entity, judicial or otherwise, we can expect to see claims from defendants, in state and federal court, deriving from both the secretive manner of the FCDO’s self-involvement as well as the dubious tactics employed once the FCDO is involved. Again, it is better to have lawyers appointed by and responsive to Pennsylvania courts, and devoted to their clients, while dutiful to ethical obligations, court processes, court rules, and court orders, rather than lawyers devoted to an obstructionist and ultimately political agenda, which includes strategies to marginalize state courts.</p>

Irrespective of the outcome of the removal question in the Third Circuit, it is this Court — and not any federal entity — that is responsible for the supervision of the practice of law in Pennsylvania, and we play a special role in capital cases, even beyond our general superintendency over the Unified Judicial System. The FCDO may be able to shield itself from inquiry by its risible claim to be a federal contractor in PCRA cases— <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>at the same time swearing, to this Court, that it is acting “privately” in Pennsylvania — but Pennsylvania is not obliged to be complicit in any Pennsylvania lawyer’s deceptive, dubious or improper activities. And, this Court is certainly not obliged to defer to the FCDO’s private litigation agenda when it comes to a determination of the proper representation of capital defendants in PCRA matters across the Commonwealth. Given the FCDO’s course of conduct, this Court should exercise its power to remove FCDO lawyers from all Pennsylvania cases, just as we can remove any lawyer in an individual case whenever there is a grounded concern that the lawyer’s conduct is adversely affecting the administration of Pennsylvania justice.</p>

The Motion for Sanctions is premised upon the Motion to Withdraw Concurring Opinion. The Commonwealth argues, among other points, that this Motion neither complies with nor is contemplated by the Appellate Rules, and is meritless in some parts, and frivolous in others. The Commonwealth seeks sanctions in the form of striking the pleadings; fining counsel; quashing the Motions; referral of counsel to the Disciplinary Board; and payment of the Commonwealth’s attorney fees and costs. The contempt request is premised upon the FCDO’s failure to respond to the Court’s initial directive to provide a Verified Statement, and its choice instead to file its argumentative Withdrawal pleading. That <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>strategic choice put the Court to the trouble of drafting an administrative enforcement order, inconvenienced the Commonwealth by extending the litigation, and led to a series of other pleadings, further burdening the Court.</p>

As the Commonwealth recognizes, the broader problem that has been revealed is not the FCDO’s misconduct here, but the very fact of its institutional self-involvement in so many Pennsylvania capital PCRA matters. I have explained what I believe is the necessary and appropriate response above; that proposed response, like the response the Court has already incorporated into its briefing rules, does not depend upon the input, or involvement, of disciplinary authorities.</p>

I have explained above that the FCDO’s conduct in the PCRA court was abusive, and its Brief here was equally problematic. As Mr. Justice Saylor noted in his Concurring Opinion, in response to my Concurring Opinion addressing broader concerns respecting the FCDO’s practice in Pennsylvania, “a referral to our lawyer disciplinary apparatus is warranted,” to permit involved FCDO counsel to respond, and to provide a foundation for imposition of any appropriate sanctions. <em>Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/610/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="169" data-cite="18 A.3d 244" data-case-ids="4201975,7280594" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0017-01,/a3d/18/0244-01">18 A.3d at 354</a> (Saylor, J., concurring). The post-decisional Motions, administrative orders, Verified Statement, and the FCDO chart have provided more of a foundation to assess the conduct at issue here; and as reflected in the Commonwealth’s complaints, this additional litigation has raised further questions of concern. The better course in terms of possible sanctions, arising from this individual case, is by a formal inquiry. Hence, I will deny the Commonwealth’s requests.</p>

Later in its Motion, in discussing frivolous claims, the FCDO posits that " ‘frivolous’ is often in the eye of the beholder." Motion, 6, 7. The FCDO is wrong. The measure of what is frivolous is objective. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 3.1 (Explanatory Comment) (comparing Pennsylvania Rules to Code of Professional Responsibility). An argument, such as the one in text, which misapprehends or misrepresents the only authority cited, is frivolous.</p>

Attorney Bookman did not claim that he ever spoke with Ballard himself, or with Ballard’s court-appointed counsel. The Northampton County District Attorney’s Office responded by attaching a letter from Ballard’s court-appointed counsel, which related that: counsel received a telephone call from an FCDO lawyer, offering that he knew someone who might be willing to file a <em>certiorari </em>petition for Ballard, and asking to see materials relating to the case; counsel wrote to Ballard, who responded that he wanted no further appeals and that counsel was not to provide materials to any third party; counsel advised the FCDO lawyer of Ballard’s directions and wishes; the FCDO lawyer nevertheless said his office "will take it from here and speak directly with [Ballard] about the appeal;" and, after the <em>certiorari </em>petition was filed by Attorney Bookman, Ballard called counsel, asked who Bookman was, and advised that the FCDO had attempted to speak with him, but he told the FCDO he did not want to appeal.
