The victim informed <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>Lisby the next day that he had used the caps, but did not have the money to pay Lisby. Lisby worked for Lawrence Boston selling crack cocaine, and both of these individuals were attempting to obtain membership in the Junior Black Mafia (“JBM”), a Philadelphia-based crime syndicate. Boston and Lisby, in turn, worked for JBM member Kevin Bowman. Once the victim understood that Bowman would be upset regarding the missing drugs, he met with Bowman to explain the situation, and offered to make up for the lost income the following week.</p>

Boston was joined by Appellant, who was a member of the JBM. After a brief conversation, Appellant, Boston, and the victim left the house and began walking west on Cumberland Street. As the men approached the intersection of Cumberland Street and 31st Street, Appellant drew a weapon and shot the victim once in the center of his chest, once in his upper right chest beneath the collar bone, and once in the back of his right leg. The victim died as a result of his wounds. Important for certain issues discussed below, at Appellant’s first trial, Lawrence Boston testified as an eyewitness. At Appellant’s second trial, Boston invoked his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and, after establishing Boston was unavailable, Boston’s testimony from his first trial in which he inculpated Appellant as the shooter was read into the record.

The jury was also informed of Appellant’s prior conspiracy conviction at his first trial in this matter. The record of the guilt trial was incorporated into evidence at the penalty phase. While the trial court refused to allow Appellant to present evidence regarding his specific religion (Muslim), he was permitted to explain that he had embraced a religious philosophy that had endorsed morality and that requires one to change and reform, and that he had become a new person as a result of his religion. He also presented background character evidence and his age at the time of his murder, 20 years old. Appellant did not testify.

Again, however, recalling the Court’s inclination to liberality in these proceedings, this court will, of course, address all of the issues raised by the submissions, limited to those particular issues addressed by the defendant’s statement of matters complained of on appeal.</blockquote>

The first requirement is procedural. The PCRA requires that, to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing, a petitioner must include in his PCRA petition “a signed certification as to each intended witness stating the witness’s name, address, date of birth and substance of testimony.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(d)(1); Pa. R.Crim.P. 902(A)(15). The second requirement is substantive. Specifically, when raising a claim for the failure to call a potential witness, to obtain relief, a petitioner must establish that: (1) the witness existed; (2) the witness was available; (3) counsel was informed or should have known of the existence of the witness; (4) the witness was prepared to cooperate and would have testified on defendant’s behalf; and (5) the absence of such testimony prejudiced him and denied him a fair trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s failure to comply with the simple and straightforward rules governing entitlement to an evidentiary hearing should preclude Appellant’s requested relief of an evidentiary hearing. Moreover, although the Commonwealth did not object to a hearing on certain after-discovered/recantation witnesses, Appellant refused such a hearing. Even if such foundational and simple requirements can be overlooked, and even if we overlook Appellant’s rejection of the Commonwealth and the PCRA court’s offer of a hearing on at least certain of these witnesses, as discussed below, Appellant has failed to satisfy the further requirements for relief. Specifically, globally speaking, for each proposed witness, Appellant <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>fails to indicate how counsel was informed or should have known of the existence of these witnesses, and the witnesses’ willingness to cooperate and to testify on Appellant’s behalf. Before our Court, Appellant does not attempt to explain his failure to comply with the PCRA or our Rules. These failures are fatal to his claim. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Thus, on this basis alone, Appellant is not entitled to relief. Nevertheless, after individualized consideration of each of the witnesses trial counsel allegedly failed to present, they do not bring the reliability of the death verdict into legitimate question, and, thus, conclude that Appellant is not entitled to relief. We address each witness in turn.</p>

    <p id="b153-6" data-blocks='[["BL_153.6",153,[219,1679,1149,689]],["BL_154.1",154,[278,321,1147,411]]]'>The Commonwealth points out that Bowman, along with Appellant, was convicted of the murder of Neil Wilkinson. Further, the Commonwealth offers, as noted above, that Boston worked for Bowman, who was a JBM member. The Commonwealth argues that, in 1999, Bowman claimed that Boston told him, in front of Appellant, that he shot the victim. The Commonwealth asserts that Appellant, however, does not explain why he waited more than 10 years to provide this information, whether Bowman would have been willing to cooperate or testify on Appellant’s behalf, and whether Appellant ever informed trial counsel of Bowman’s conversation with Boston. Finally, the Commonwealth maintains that, because Bowman’s statement is hearsay, it is inadmissible and <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>Appellant could not be prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to use that statement. The PCRA court rejected the claim, noting the hearsay nature of the proffered statements, that there was no indication the information was available for trial or that trial counsel could have discovered such information, that it would have been used only for impeachment purposes, and that it was cumulative of Boston’s prior inconsistent statements.</p>
    <p id="b154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[274,778,1150,633]]]'>As offered by the Commonwealth, and noted by the PCRA court, Bowman’s testimony would have constituted hearsay.

Moreover, while Bowman signed a statement claiming Boston’s confession was made to Bowman in front of Appellant, Appellant in his PCRA petition never claimed that he informed trial counsel of Bowman’s supposed conversation in which Boston confessed to being the shooter. Likewise, the failure to show that Bowman would have been willing to cooperate and testify on Appellant’s behalf also defeats Appellant’s claim of ineffectiveness.</p>

Moreover, Appellant offers that Gray saw Dozier immediately after the shooting, at which time Dozier asked, “What happened?” The implication of this statement was that Dozier did not see the murder. The Commonwealth responds that, while in prison in 1999, Gray claimed to have been an eyewitness to the shooting, but there is no indication as to why Gray waited more than 10 years to come forward. Further, the Commonwealth argues that Appellant does not allege he informed trial counsel of this witness. The PCRA court rejected this claim, finding that Appellant failed to state that Gray would have been willing to cooperate and to testify on Appellant’s behalf.</p>

      <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>Gray’s statement is similar to that offered by Bowman, and fails for the same reasons. With respect to his testimony regarding Dozier, it is pure hearsay, and, thus, cannot support a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present it. <em>Puksar, supra. </em>Moreover, because Gray fails to indicate he would be willing to cooperate and testify on Appellant’s behalf, Appellant’s claim fails on that basis as well.</p>
    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[257,738,733,40]]]'>3. Robert Durand and Frank Bynum</p>

Also, Appellant offers that Bynum stated to Durand that eyewitness Dozier was a heavy user of crack cocaine and had been smoking crack for days before the murder. According to Durand, while Bynum did not dispute the accuracy of these statements, Bynum refused to sign an affidavit and refused to testify. As noted by the Commonwealth, the PCRA court found the statements of both Durand and Bynum to be hearsay, but, also, that Bynum could only hurt Appellant’s case because, if he testified, he would have been open to potentially detrimental cross examination, including that Bynum was with Appellant when Appellant admitted that he killed the victim, that Bynum was a JBM member who threatened Dozier at gunpoint after he testified against Appellant, and that Bynum shot Randall and Terrance Lisby when they confronted Boston about the victim’s murder.</p>

As noted by the Commonwealth, Brown was a JBM drug dealer who grew up with the victim and Appellant. At trial, Brown testified that he loaned Appellant his bicycle which was found at the scene of the murder, and that he heard Appellant state, “get down or lay down,” which, according to him, was a warning to the victim to cooperate with the JBM or he would be killed. The Commonwealth adds that, on cross-examination, Appellant accused Brown of implicating Appellant to gain favorable treatment in his own criminal case and impeached him with inconsistencies between his statement and his testimony. The PCRA court found Brown’s statements to be hearsay, insignificant in light of two witnesses to the murder who had not recanted, and lacked any indication Brown would have provided this information at trial.</p>

Moreover, we note that Appellant failed to include this witness in his “Statement of Matters Complained of Pursuant to Rule 1925(b),” and it was not until a subsequent “Supplemental Statement,” which was filed seemingly without leave of court, was this name added.

According to the Commonwealth, Randall Lisby gave a statement to police that Appellant told him he killed the victim, he was a member of the JBM, and that the drug-related killing was because Appellant “had a job to do.” Brief of Commonwealth at 17. Initially, while Lisby presently recants this statement, he did not aver he had been willing to cooperate with the defense and to testify on behalf of Appellant. Moreover, like Brown, Randall was a witness at trial and Appellant engaged in cross-examina<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>tion of him. Trial counsel elicited, <em>inter alia, </em>that Randall did not mention that Appellant had confessed to him at Appellant’s earlier trial, did not tell police about Appellant’s confession, and had indicated Bynum had killed the victim. As counsel had no reason to investigate Randall as a potential defense witness, let alone not foreseeing Randall’s recantation, we find that Appellant has failed to establish that trial counsel was ineffective and that he is not entitled to relief.</p>

Evidently, Williams confronted Boston with these allegations in 1992 and Boston confirmed that he had lied. While Appellant claims that “[t]his evidence was available at the time of trial,” Brief of Appellant at 12, the Commonwealth notes that these statements allegedly were made by Boston to Williams nearly two years after Appellant’s trial, and, thus, could not serve as a basis for an ineffectiveness of counsel claim. Again, before us, Appellant makes no claim with respect to after-discovered evidence. Moreover, William’s statements regarding the “word on the street,” constitute inadmissible hearsay.

This, according to Appellant, was a conflict of interest and resulted in Boston not being fully cross-examined by Attorney Seay at his first trial. While trial counsel at Appellant’s second trial objected that Boston was not “unavailable,” Attorney Seay’s alleged conflict of interest, which allegedly resulted in the lack of a full and fair opportunity to confront Boston, was not raised. Appellant maintains that, because Attorney Seay represented Boston at Appellant’s first trial, Attorney Seay could not have attempted to show that Boston was the actual murderer or to otherwise impeach his testimony. Thus, Appellant claims that trial counsel at his second trial was ineffective for failing to allege a conflict of interest with prior counsel. Appellant adds that there was no tactical basis for failing to object, and that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s failure because, had Boston’s testimony been excluded at Appellant’s second trial, he likely would have been acquitted. Finally, Appellant urges that, even if there was an attorney-client relationship between Boston and Seay prior to trial, issues of fact regarding that relationship remain and an evidentiary hearing is required.</p>

First, Appellant fails to refute the PCRA court’s factual determination that Attorney Seay did not represent Appellant and Boston at the same time. While Attorney Seay represented Boston in the preliminary stages of an assault case, this was prior to Boston’s testimony at Appellant’s first trial. Furthermore, Boston testified that, at the first trial, he was represented by Michael Wallace, Esquire. At Appellant’s second trial, Boston was represented by Nino Tinari, Esquire. Second, as argued by the Commonwealth, and found by the PCRA court, a review of the record reveals that Attorney <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>Seay aggressively and extensively cross-examined Boston, eliciting from Boston that Boston hoped for sentencing consideration in his own criminal case, that he lied to police, that he did not see Appellant with a gun, that Appellant had no motive to shoot the victim, and that he recanted statements he made to police regarding Appellant shooting the victim. Moreover, Attorney Seay repeatedly accused Boston of being the actual killer. Thus, Appellant failed to demonstrate how Attorney Seay’s prior representation of Boston in any way adversely impacted trial counsel’s representation of him, let alone constituted actual prejudice. <em>Commonwealth v.

Subsequently, both cases were dismissed. Further, Appellant claims that, after Dozier agreed to testify as a Commonwealth witness, but before testifying at trial, Dozier was arrested and charged in four separate cases, including two burglary cases, one criminal mischief case, and one theft and conspiracy case. According to Appellant, all of these cases were dismissed when Dozier was cooperating with the Commonwealth and before he testified at trial. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to bring the dismissals of these six charges against Dozier to the attention of the jury. Appellant asserts that this information should have been used for impeachment purposes, trial counsel had no reason to fail to introduce this evidence, and, as the Commonwealth’s case depended largely upon two witnesses, Dozier and Boston, he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s deficient performance.

According to the Commonwealth, Appellant’s trial counsel could not be deemed to be ineffective for not presenting evidence of alleged bias as the charges had been dismissed at time of trial, citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Further, the Commonwealth offers that trial counsel did impeach Dozier with evidence that he was on house arrest on a pending contempt charge, Dozier’s entire criminal record was introduced into evidence, and Dozier had testified that he had not been promised anything as to any open charge. Further, trial counsel cross-examined Dozier regarding <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions, and established that he: was a crack addict who had been drinking heavily at the time of the shooting, previously testified that he did not see Appellant shoot the victim, told a defense investigator that he did not see Appellant shoot the victim, and only told police this because they threatened to arrest him. Thus, according to the Commonwealth, even if there were open cases against Dozier, Appellant was not prejudiced by counsel’s failure to impeach Dozier with that evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

The PCRA court found that Appellant failed to develop whether the municipal court cases that were dismissed were the same matters about which Dozier testified. Moreover, the PCRA court noted that Appellant failed to provide the court with any details regarding whether these matters had relevance with respect to the witness’s credibility or bias. The PCRA court continued that Dozier’s testimony <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>was both cumulative and corroborated.

Thus, Appellant’s claim lacks a factual predicate. Yet, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>there were open cases that were dismissed shortly before Dozier testified, or at the time he testified, Dozier’s testimony was cumulative of, and corroborated, Boston’s testimony. Importantly, as noted above by the Commonwealth, Dozier was thoroughly cross-examined by trial counsel regarding his less than pristine background and his motives for testifying against Appellant.

Appellant believed Dozier received such benefits and sought discovery, <em>inter alia, </em>of any documents relating to such benefits. At a hearing on the motion for discovery, the Commonwealth asserted that it had reviewed the files in the matter and had found no responsive documents.

Thus, to the extent prior counsel failed to discover and raise this claim at trial or on appeal, Appellant argues he rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.

    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[216,388,1152,1754]]]'>Appellant offers that, as part of the Commonwealth’s case, a plea agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth and Terrance Lisby, the victim’s uncle. In exchange for his testimony against Appellant in this case, and against a co-defendant in his own homicide case, Lisby was permitted to plead guilty to third-degree murder in his own case and request that he be sentenced to at least five years imprisonment. According to Appellant, trial counsel attempted to establish the full benefits of that deal by introducing evidence that, if convicted of first degree murder, Lisby faced a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and that the allegations against Lisby supported the charge of first-degree murder. During counsel’s cross-examination of Lisby, he attempted to elicit that Lisby faced a sentence of life “without parole.” The Commonwealth objected, and the trial court stated to counsel for him to just refer to “life imprisonment,” so that the issue of commutation would not have to be explained. Appellant claims that the full terms of the plea agreement were important and that the greater consequences faced by a witness if he or she did not accept the plea agreement resulted in a greater motive to lie to secure the benefits of such a deal. Here, Appellant maintains, the jury heard only that Lisby would be facing “life imprisonment,” and that juries have misleading impressions of that term. According to Appellant, most juries lack accurate information about the meaning of life imprisonment, and believe such prisoners will actually be released after a term of years, citing <em>Simmons v.

The Commonwealth maintains that the jury knew Lisby avoided a life sentence by pleading guilty to third-degree murder, the plea agreement was read to the jury, Lisby testified to his understanding of the requirements under the agreement, and Lisby was obligated to testify against his co-defendant in his trial, and against Appellant. Finally, the Commonwealth offers that the jury was informed that, if Lisby did not meet his duties under the plea agreement, the agreement would be "withdrawn, and he would face first-degree murder charges and life imprisonment. According to the Commonwealth, the jury was informed of the full extent of the “sweetheart deal,” including the sentence Lisby faced absent the deal. Further, the Commonwealth offers that Appellant fails to establish counsel lacked a reasonable basis for not further pressing the issue, as the jury was informed that Lisby avoided life imprisonment and was aware of the substantial benefit he gained by agreeing to cooperate.</p>

According to the PCRA court, when the prosecutor objected to the term “without parole” and “pardon,” it did not rule on the objection and did not instruct the jury to disregard those statements.

Furthermore, it appears that trial counsel thoroughly addressed all aspects of Lisby’s plea agreement. Moreover, in closing, trial counsel, without objection, noted that the only relief from life imprisonment was commutation by the Governor, albeit in reference to Appellant. N.T., 1/10/91, at 8.76.

Specifically, it appears that the jury had more than enough evidence to discredit Lisby based upon the agreement itself, as well as testimony that Lisby was a murderer and a drug dealer, that he and Boston confronted the victim about stolen drugs, that he lied to police, lied under oath, testified inconsistently, and had a motive to kill the victim. Further, Lisby was not an eyewitness, but explained Boston’s role as Lisby’s drug supplier, that the victim had stolen the drugs, and that Appellant was tied to the JBM. Thus, Lisby’s testimony was harmful to Appellant, but cumulative and inferior to other incriminating evidence. Therefore, even if the jury had been informed that a life sentence means life without parole, and it had rejected Lisby’s testimony as driven by a plea deal, there was still significant evidence against Appellant. We find that Appellant is not entitled to relief. Finally, regarding Appellant’s cursory claim that trial counsel was prevented from developing information about the underlying facts of Lisby’s homicide case, Appellant offers no authority or meaningful argument in support thereof.

Our Court noted on direct appeal that, while this information was directly applicable to the charges against Appellant, it only implied prior criminal activity, and did not refer to an actual previous crime or similar specific act. <em>Reid, </em><a href="/pa/537/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="642 A.2d 453" data-case-ids="775522,7862821" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0167-01,/a2d/642/0453-01">642 A.2d at 461</a>. Thus, as found by the PCRA court, because Appellant’s association with the JBM, and not any specific acts he committed in that association, was directly probative, it did not require any instruction. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>there is merit to Appellant’s claim that trial counsel failed to request cautionary <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>instructions, we find that in light of the mere implication of criminal activity due to Appellant’s association with the JBM, and the other evidence against Appellant as having murdered the victim, he has failed to establish prejudice. Moreover, Appellant’s suggestion that the incorporation of the guilt phase evidence into the penalty phase resulted in the same error, resulted in impermissible consideration of non-aggravating factors, and required a cautionary instruction, fails for the same reason and also because the trial court instructed the jury that “only” Appellant’s significant history of felony convictions involving the use of threat or violence can constitute an aggravating circumstance, and only if proven. N.T., 1/10/91, at 8.88. Thus, we find that PCRA court’s determination is supported by the record and free of legal error.</p>

Specifically, with respect to Dozier, Appellant claims that he was arrested in Philadelphia County for two counts of theft and receiving stolen property and unauthorized use of a vehicle. According to Appellant, the trial court erroneously charged the jury that only arrests leading to <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions could be used to challenge credibility. Appellant argues pending criminal cases within the same jurisdiction are always admissible to show the witness’s bias and motive to fabricate, citing <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em><a href="/us/415/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="415 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="6174956" data-case-paths="/us/415/0308-01">415 U.S. 308</a>, 318, <a href="/us/415/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="415 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="6174956" data-case-paths="/us/415/0308-01">94 S.Ct. 1105</a>, <a href="/us/415/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="415 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="6174956" data-case-paths="/us/415/0308-01">39 L.Ed.2d 347</a> (1974). Appellant offers the same claim with respect to Boston, whom Appellant asserts had pending aggravated assault charges when he testified against Appellant. While the trial court admitted the evidence of the pending charges, according to Appellant, it failed to properly instruct the jury regarding how to consider such evidence, based on the jury’s belief that only <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions could be used to impeach. Appellant asserts that it was never contended that the “trial court’s instructions on <em>crimen falsi </em>impeachment was in error, but rather that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on how it should <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>consider evidence of the witnesses’ pending charges.” Brief of Appellant at 39.</p>
    <p id="AG" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[218,444,1152,1000]]]'>Additionally, Appellant offers that Terrance Lisby pled guilty to third-degree murder, and that the Commonwealth dropped first-degree murder charges against him, in exchange for Lisby’s testimony in both Appellant’s case and Lisby’s own murder case. Part of that agreement was that the Commonwealth would make no recommendation regarding Lisby’s sentence, and, according to Appellant, the Commonwealth emphasized the open nature of that agreement. Appellant argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that evidence of Lisby’s third-degree murder conviction was admitted solely to inform the jury that an agreement had been reached with the Commonwealth, yet, Appellant maintains it was equally admissible relative to Lisby’s “subjective expectation of leniency and favorable treatment, regardless of the existence or terms of an actual deal.” Brief of Appellant at 40. Thus, according to Appellant, it was an expectation of leniency, and not just the agreement itself, that the jury should have been able to consider and was prevented from doing so.</p>

Also, Appellant claims that the trial court erred further by reminding the jury that Brown denied that a deal existed. Finally, Appellant contends the trial court erred by instructing the jury that only arrests leading to <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions could be used for impeachment, and failed to explain to the jury that robbery was a <em>crimen falsi </em>offense with which Brown could be impeached.</p>

Further, the Commonwealth offers that the trial court instructed the jury it should consider whether a witness had an agreement with the Commonwealth in exchange for testifying, and whether there existed an interest or motive that could have impacted the witness’s testimony. More generally, the Commonwealth points to the instruction for the jury to take “all of the surrounding circumstances and determine which witnesses you will believe and what weight you will give their testimony.” N.T., 1/8/91, 6.148. The Commonwealth also points to our decision on direct appeal, wherein we noted that the trial court instructed the jury concerning its duty to make credibility determinations and that it “clearly explained that any interest or motive of a witness that may color his recollection and testimony could be considered in making such determinations.” <em>Reid, </em><a href="/pa/537/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="642 A.2d 453" data-case-ids="775522,7862821" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0167-01,/a2d/642/0453-01">642 A.2d at 462</a>.

More specifically, Appellant asserts that, while at the first trial Boston acknowledged being at the scene of the murder, his testimony from the first trial was not self-incriminating. According to Appellant, Boston’s testimony at Appellant’s second trial would not have required the disclosure of any new information that would have placed him in jeopardy. Therefore, Appellant reasons that Boston’s waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights at Appellant’s first trial precluded him from asserting the privilege at Appellant’s second trial. Appellant asserts that counsel, however, failed to preserve this issue on appeal, and, thus, was ineffective. Appellant adds there was no reasonable basis for failing to raise this claim on appeal, and that, due to Boston being a crucial witness for the Commonwealth, and because Appellant was deprived of his right to confront Boston at his second trial, had counsel raised this issue on direct appeal, there was a reasonable likelihood the outcome at trial would have been different.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth contends Appellant’s statement of the law is simply wrong. Moreover, the Commonwealth maintains that, while Appellant claims that, because Boston had not been charged in this case he did not risk self-incrimination, this was not true. As offered by the Commonwealth, Boston’s account of the events of the murder implicated him as a co-conspirator and led to Appellant’s conviction for criminal conspiracy. Both Boston and Appellant were at the scene of the murder, both had a motive to <em>Mil the </em>victim, and both men went together to confront the victim regarding the theft of drugs that Terrance Lisby was selling for Boston. Further, the Commonwealth highlights that Boston admitted to selling drugs, lying to police in an initial statement, and implicated himself in an outstanding aggravated assault case. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth argues, Boston had reason to believe he was in danger of prosecution, and, <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>therefore, his exercise of his right against self-incrimination was proper.</p>

It acknowledged Appellant’s assertion that, once a waiver of the privilege has been made, such waiver applies in a later proceeding as long as the subsequent proceeding would not require the disclosure of new information, and as long as the former testimony did not implicate the witness in any wrongdoing. However, according to the PCRA court, as there was no showing that Boston consulted with his attorney or that he was aware of the privilege, or that he knew the testimony could be used against him, the court reasoned it could not be said that Boston made a valid waiver at Appellant’s first trial. The PCRA court continued that Appellant makes no attempt to demonstrate that Boston’s testimony was not incriminating or that Appellant was denied a full opportunity to cross examine Boston at Appellant’s first trial. The PCRA court concluded Boston’s former testimony clearly implicated him in wrongdoing and that the Commonwealth was clear that charges against him were a possibility.

In the lawsuit, which was withdrawn in December 1997, Sagel claimed that the magazine’s publication of comments he was alleged to have made during a 1990 lecture on jury selection defamed him. Appellant requested copies of Sagel’s answers to interrogatories and request for production of documents, as well as Sagel’s deposition transcript, pertaining to the lawsuit. In addition, Appellant sought copies of Sagel’s lecture notes. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Motion for Discovery, 2/21/06.

Appellant’s Brief at 50. Initially, the Commonwealth contends that, by failing to make a record of the race of potential jurors who were acceptable to the Commonwealth, but excluded by the defense, Appellant is unable to establish even a <em>prima fade </em>case of discrimination.

Appellant also contends that a study by Professor Baldus documents a pattern of racial discrimination in jury selection in Philadelphia during the years 1981 through 1997. Appellant further argues that the infamous 1987 training tape on jury selection prepared by former Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Jack McMahon “supports an inference” that the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office engaged in purposeful discrimination, as do lecture notes taken during a training lecture for prosecutors delivered by Bruce Sagel in 1990. <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>

Specifically, Appellant claims <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>that, following the reading into the record of Boston’s testimony from Appellant’s first trial, the only conclusion the jury could have reached was that Boston was invoking his privilege against self-incrimination because he was afraid he would be found to be the actual shooter.

Thus, Appellant contends the conspiracy charge was not supported by the evidence in this case, and that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the instruction at trial. Appellant claims that, as trial counsel’s strategy was to challenge that Appellant participated in any way in the killing, counsel had no reasonable strategy for failing to object.

The PCRA court noted initially that while Appellant claimed to offer "affidavits” (or “sworn declarations”) from these individuals, except for that of Damien Williams, they were not sworn by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths or witnessed. The court went on to determine that, even assuming the truth of the declarations, Appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em><a href="/pa/582/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="582 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="650333" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0461-01">582 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/pa/582/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="185" data-cite="872 A.2d 1139" data-case-ids="650333,8979014" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0461-01,/a2d/872/1139-01">872 A.2d 1139</a>, 1169-70 (2005) (Castille, C.J., concurring) (offering unwitnessed and unsworn non-affidavits are of considerably less value than sworn affidavits and questioning whether such pleadings should be relevant to issue of entitlement to evidentiary hearing).</p>

In his brief, Appellant further suggests that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that evidence of consciousness of guilt by itself is never enough to convict and counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve this issue on appeal. As Appellant plainly fails to develop this claim in any meaningful fashion, it is not reviewable. <em>Commonwealth v.

Additionally, Appellant also argues the Commonwealth engaged in other misconduct by references to Philadelphia's social ills and by blaming groups like the JBM and individuals like Appellant for causing those problems, and by urging the jury not to "let him walk out of here.” Appellant failed to include these assertions in his 192503) statement, and, thus, they are not reviewable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Castillo, </em><a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="188" data-cite="585 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="2472599" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01">585 Pa. 395</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="189" data-cite="888 A.2d 775" data-case-ids="2472599,8998737" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01,/a2d/888/0775-01">888 A.2d 775</a>, 779-80 (2005).</p>

We also note that in a separate argument section of his Amended PCRA Petition, Appellant contends that his death sentence should be vacated because the trial court’s instructions to the jury at the penalty phase erroneously advised the jury how to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

      <p id="Azt" data-blocks='[["BL_196.6",196,[341,1933,1080,310]]]'>The fact that on paper this jury apparently did not find even one mitigating circumstance does not somehow render "harmless” this significant error. As a general matter, so many grievous errors were committed in connection with the otherwise applicable mitigating circumstances that it is not surprising that no mitigation was found. First, trial counsel failed to introduce abundant mitigating evidence that would have supported at least three (3) distinct mitigators. See Supplemental Amended Petition.</p>

Kloiber, <a href="/pa/378/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="378 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1250885" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0412-01">378 </a></em><a href="/pa/378/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="378 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1250885" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0412-01">Pa. 412</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20820" class="citation" data-index="191" data-cite="106 A.2d 820">106 A.2d 820</a> (1954). In the companion case, I explained that the court erroneously displaced a material circumstance in which a <em>Kloiber </em>charge is required — when an eyewitness’s positive statements as to identity are weakened by failure to identify the defendant on one or more prior occasions — and improperly shifted the analysis to time-of-trial witness explanations. <em>See Commonwealth v.
