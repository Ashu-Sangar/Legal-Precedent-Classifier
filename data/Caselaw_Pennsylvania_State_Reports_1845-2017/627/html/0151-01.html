One of the snowballs struck a vehicle driven by Appellant, who was also known as “Tone” or “Tone-Bey.” PCRA Court Supplemental Rule 1925(a) Opinion, 2/14/11 (“PCRA Court Opinion”), at 1. Appellant stopped his vehicle, and he and his two passengers exited the car. The boys scattered, and Appellant asked two bystanders, Daniel McKay and Scott Keenan, if they were involved in throwing the snowballs. The bystanders denied involvement, and, as Appellant reached his hand inside his jacket, he replied ‘You better hope none was your family.” PCRA Court Opinion at 7. Appellant then said to his passengers, “Well, let’s at least get one of them.” <em>Id. A </em>third bystander, Walter Coggins, not realizing what Appellant meant by that statement, suggested Appellant drive around the corner to “get one.” According to Coggins, his discussion with Appellant lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes. N.T. Trial, 8/7/90, at 808. As Appellant and his passengers drove around the block, some of the boys who had been throwing snowballs pulled a stop sign into the middle of the street on which Appellant was driving. When Appellant reached the stop sign, he drove the car onto the sidewalk and gunfire erupted from the passenger side of the vehicle. Michael Waters, who was sixteen years old, was fatally wounded when <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>a bullet struck him in the back and exited his chest. Appellant and his passengers then drove away. Two 10-millimeter shell casings were found at the scene, and one deformed .38 caliber bullet was recovered from a nearby window frame. At the hospital, another .38 caliber bullet, which was undamaged and apparently had not entered Waters’ body, fell from Waters’ jacket.</p>

Woods survived and gave police a statement naming Appellant as one of the two shooters.

On May 6, 2005, the PCRA court issued a notice of intent to dismiss Appellant’s PCRA petition in this case, and in the Lisby case.

In the lawsuit, which was withdrawn in December 1997, Sagel claimed that the magazine’s publication of the comments he was alleged to have made defamed him. Appellant requested copies of Sagel’s Answers to Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, as well as Sagel’s deposition transcript, pertaining to the lawsuit. In addition, Appellant sought copies of Sagel’s lecture notes. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Motion for Discovery, 2/21/06.

Woods never testified that he gave statements to the police after the Waters killing; he never, in fact, said anywhere at any time that he talked to the police. It is only the prosecutor’s stated belief that he did that defendant uses to claim that he did, which unfounded assumption he then uses to make the further egregious leap in logic to claim that statements must exist and that the Commonwealth withheld them.

The Commonwealth further responds that Appellant’s assertion that he had been scarred by his foster father’s death was “ridiculous,” in view of subsequent declarations by Appellant’s foster sisters that his foster father “beat him, was uncaring and lacked affection, and kept him in his home only to collect foster care money.” Commonwealth Brief at 40.</p>

Lydia Banks testified that Appellant’s foster father, was older, had been sick for approximately three years before he died, and was bedridden for the last two. N.T. Trial, 8/14/90 at 1348, 1350.

Several months before trial in the instant matter, Appellant was tried for the murder of Mark Lisby. As noted <em>supra </em>note 8, the jury in the Lisby case initially reached a verdict only on the offense of criminal conspiracy. Herein, the Commonwealth introduced evidence of this conspiracy conviction, as well as Appellant’s conviction for the murder of Neil Wilkinson, for the purpose of establishing the aggravating circumstance of a significant history of violent felony convictions. At one point during the Commonwealth’s questioning, one of the detectives stated that Appellant “was convicted of conspiracy, and there are charges of murder and possessing instruments of a crime still pending.” N.T. Trial, 8/14/90, at 1328. Appellant argues that this statement constituted evidence of an impermissible non-statutory aggravator.</p>

Appellant further claims that, “but for counsel’s deficient performance, it is reasonably likely that the jury would have found mitigating circumstances,” and that the “prejudice resulting from the violation of Appellant’s rights alleged here and from counsel’s deficient performance should be assessed <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>cumulatively____ Viewed in that light, the error was not harmless.” Appellant’s Brief at 76.</p>

Where a jury finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance, it must impose a sentence of death. Additionally, irrespective of the statement as to the pending murder charges against Appellant, there was evidence to support the jury’s finding of the Section 9711(d)(9) aggravator, including Appellant’s conviction for the Wilkinson murder and his conviction for conspiracy to commit murder in the Lisby case. Thus, Appellant fails to establish that he was prejudiced by the detective’s statement that Appellant was subject to pending murder charges.

Banks testified that Appellant’s mother abandoned him; that their foster father was elderly; and that Appellant didn’t really have a father figure. Banks also testified that, since he has been in jail, Appellant has been going to school, and has become a Muslim. White also testified to the fact that Appellant’s mother abandoned him, and, when asked why she felt that the jury should impose a life sentence instead of the death penalty, she stated: “[h]e really wants to get his life back together.

Note well that the law picks no length of time or no appreciable length of time as necessary to form or frame the intent to kill, which design to kill can be formulated in a fraction of a second, but it leaves the existence or non-existence of a fully-framed intent to kill as a fact to be determined by the jury from all of the facts and circumstances in the evidence. Accordingly, no appreciable amount of time is needed between formation of intent and the killing if you as finders of fact determine that the killing was done with the required intent to kill. Further, the required intention to kill <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>may be found in the defendant’s acts, declarations, words or conduct or by the circumstances under which the killing was accomplished.</p>

The majority downplays Keenan’s actual and affirmative "misidentification” at the lineup — which was plainly acknowledged as a matter of the official record by the detective who conducted the lineup — by recharacterizing the lapse as "difficulty recalling Appellant’s placement in a lineup.” Majority Opinion at 187, 99 A.3d at 492-93. In my view, such approaches relying on <em>post hoc </em>explanations and characterizations have no place in the determination of whether a <em>Kloiber </em>instruction is implicated in the first instance. If there are problems associated with an eyewitness identification, the instruction should issue, and a properly informed <em>jury </em>should decide the salient credibility questions. <em>Accord Kloiber, </em><a href="/pa/378/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="378 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1250885" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0412-01">378 Pa. at 424</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20820" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="106 A.2d 820">106 A.2d at 827</a>.
