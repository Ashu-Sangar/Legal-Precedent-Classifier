    <p id="b437-3" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[203,497,1150,1134]]]'>In Donohugh’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20806" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="86 Pa. 806">86 Pa. 806</a>, we early ruled that a purely public charity, within the meaning of Article IX, Section 1, of the Constitution, is not necessarily one solely controlled by the State, but extends to private charitable institutions which are not administered for any individual gain; and in Fire Ins. Patrol v. Boyd, <a href="/pa/120/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="120 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="559800" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0624-01">120 Pa. 624</a>, we held that the true test of a public charity is the character of the objects sought to be attained, saying (p. 645), to bring the hearts of an indefinite number of persons “under the influence of education or religion,” was a proper object of public charity; finally, in White v. Smith, <a href="/pa/189/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="189 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="903479" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0222-01">189 Pa. 222</a>, we ruled that the mere fact of a public charity being under the control of those belonging to a particular religious denomination, so long as its ultimate object was to help an indefinite number of persons, without regard to their religious beliefs, made it none the less a purely public charity. When these authorities, and others which might be mentioned, are applied to the present case, the right of plaintiff to tax exemption, is plain; and we find nothing in Phila. v. Masonic Home, <a href="/pa/160/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="160 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="852141" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0572-01">160 Pa. 572</a>, to the contrary.</p>

As stated in Phila. v. Barber, <a href="/pa/160/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="160 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="852129" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0123-01">160 Pa. 123</a>, 128, “The parts rented and producing income are liable to taxation. There is in fact no express Warrant in the act for dividing the building for purposes of taxation and exempting any part of it, when other parts produce income; but such division was sustained...... in Association v. Donohugh, 7 W. N. 208, upon grounds of equity and the broad intent of the statute, and has been received with general acquiescence.” The rule <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>adopted by the court below in the present case was equitable, it did defendant no injustice, and the results thereby attained will not be disturbed.</p>
