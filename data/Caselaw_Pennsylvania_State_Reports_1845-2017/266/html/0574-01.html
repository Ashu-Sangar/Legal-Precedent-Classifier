Testator died on June 24,1917, leaving to survive him a widow and half-brothers and half-sisters, but no father, mother, children or descendants. By the first clause of his will, he devised all of his real estate to his widow for “the period of her natural life,” and by the second clause bequeathed his personal property to her to use the income during her natural life; with the right to consume the principal when “necessary for her maintenance.” He then provided as follows: “All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, subject to the life .estates heretofore devised and bequeathed to my said wife, I give, devise and bequeath unto such persons as shall be entitled to receive the same under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.” The widow elected to take under the will. She then sought to have set aside to her, out of the residue, and as her share thereof, real and personal property to the value of $5,000, according to the Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 87. The property was duly appraised, and all of the real estate and part of the personal property was set aside to her. The appraisement showed that the value of the real estate was much less than $5,000. By agreement between the widow and the heirs, the value of the whole estate, real and personal, was fixed at $45,000, and there was nothing to show that, at the time the will was written, testator possessed any other or additional real estate. The court below set aside the appraisement. <em>Held, </em>(a) that it was apparent from the language of the will that it was not testator’s intention that the widow should take an absolute fee in all of the real estate; (b) that, since the widow was given power to consume, if necessary for her maintenance, all or any part of , the personal property, it was impossible, prior to her death, to tell what constituted the “rest, residue and remainder,......real, personal and mixed”; (c) that it was probably not testator’s intention to include the widow among the persons entitled to take the residuary estate “under the intestate laws”; (d) that, as no distribution under the intestate laws could arise until after the widow’s life interest ended, she had no present right to the $5,000, and was confined to the provisions for her benefit contained in the first two clauses of the will; and (e) that, as the widow was never entitled to an appraisement, the court below was justified in setting it aside.</p>

Frisbie, two half-brothers and two half-sisters, but no father, mother, children or descendants; by his will, dated March 29, 1913, probated June 29, 1917, he devised all of his real estate to his widow, “for and during the period of her natural life,” and bequeathed his personal property to her, to use “the income and the proceeds thereof for and during her natural life,” with the right to consume the principal, when “necessary for her maintenance.” The will then provides: “All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, subject to the life estates heretofore devised and bequeathed unto my said wife, I give, devise and bequeath unto such persons as shall be entitled to receive the same under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.”</p>

    <p id="b604-7" data-blocks='[["BL_604.6",604,[259,1463,1151,803]]]'>When we read the will with the facts in mind as to the nature and extent of testator’s property, it is apparent the language used does not show an intention that his widow shall take an absolute fee in all of the real estate, as she is now attempting to do; on the contrary, it is expressly stated she is “to have and to hold” such real property “for and during the period of her natural life,” and these words, of course, imply that her dominion cannot be exercised beyond that period. Again, since the widow is given power, if necessary for her maintenance, to consume all or any part of the personal property, it is impossible now to tell what constitutes the “rest, residue and remainder,......real, personal and mixed,” of decedent’s estate, nor can this be ascertained so long as the widow lives.</p>

Frisbie left so much of his estate as might remain after her death to his next of kin, and “it was not the intention of testator that the widow should be entitled to any of his residuary estate”; but, be this as it may, no one is in a position to claim part of the residuary estate while the widow lives. It is clear, under the language of the will, that the right to a distribution in accordance with the intestate law cannot arise until after the widow’s life interest ends.</p>

    <p id="b605-6" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[190,1570,1148,699]]]'>We cannot agree with appellant’s counsel that testator “left the ownership of his property exactly where it would have been if he had executed no will, except that he made it subject to the right of his wife to use all of it during her life and, if necessary for her maintenance, to consume the personalty”; as previously stated, we feel that Mrs. Frisbie is confined to the provisions for her benefit contained in the first two paragraphs of the will, and is not now in a position to claim any definite part of the residuary estate. Of course this means the widow never was entitled to the appraisement under attack, and hence the court below was justified in setting it aside.</p>
