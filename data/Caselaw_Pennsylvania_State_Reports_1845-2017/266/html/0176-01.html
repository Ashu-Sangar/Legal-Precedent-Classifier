In an action by an employee against his employer to recover for personal injuries resulting from the breaking of a cotter-pin in the wheel of a truck, the questions of defendant’s negligence and plaintiff’s contributory negligence are for the jury, where the evidence tends to show that defendant owned about two hundred trucks whose axles were held in place by cotter-pins, and that its employees, when occasion arose, could use. any one of them which happened to be idle; that on the day of the accident plaintiff took the truck in question, worked with it for about two hours, in the usual and ordinary way, when the cotter-pin broke, resulting in his injury; that the employees in using these trucks did not make any inspection, and were not supposed to do so; that an employee of defendant was detailed to oil and repair the trucks, but that neither he nor any one else made any inspection thereof; and that the cotter-pin which broke was “old” and “worn thin” “right in the middle......where it broke,” at a point where it could not be seen from the outside.</p>

    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[265,435,1152,975]]]'>On May <em>4, </em>1914, Palkovitz was engaged in hauling boxes of tinplate piled upon a four-wheel truck, the latter about three feet long and two feet wide, with steel axles at either end; the wheels were held in place on these axles by what are known as “cotter-pins,” some three and a half inches long. Defendant owned approximately 200 such trucks, and its employees, when occasion arose, could use any one of them which happened to be idle. On the morning of the accident, Palkovitz took the truck in question; he and a fellow employee, named Schuler, worked with it successfully for about two hours, when, with an ordinary load of 15 boxes thereon, Schuler pulling in front and plaintiff pushing behind, in a manner which he testified was necessary and usual under the circumstances, the cotter-pin holding the left-hand rear wheel broke, the wheel came off, and the load fell upon one of plaintiff’s hands, badly injuring it.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[264,1423,1146,362]]]'>The testimony shows that, in using these trucks, defendant’s employees did not make an inspection, and were not supposed to do so, but took any that in a general way appeared fit for use.

This man stated that neither he nor anyone else made inspections; although, according to his testimony, the cotter-pins were apt to become flat, where they “rubbed against” the wheel, at a point which could not be seen “from the outside,” because, as he explained, “you would have to take the wheel off or take the pin out to see that.”</p>

It may be that what defendant now states as its theory of plaintiff’s contributory negligence was not precisely presented to the jury; but, after detailing the circumstances attending the accident, and particularly calling attention to the manner in which Palkovitz was pushing, with his back to the load, the jury were told more than once that, if plaintiff was “guilty of, or chargeable with, a lack of ordinary care,” or in any negligent manner contributed to his own injury, he could not recover. Moreover, at the end of his charge, the trial judge said to counsel: “Before taking up the points, is there anything we have overlooked?” To which defendant’s attorney replied: “We have nothing to suggest.” Under these circumstances, appellant cannot justly complain of the manner in which the issue of contributory negligence was submitted.</p>

He was paid $12 at the execution of this paper, and subsequently received other sums aggregating something over $106. Plaintiff, a Pole, was so ignorant of the English language that an interpreter was used at the trial. It also appears, in defendant’s evidence, that, recognizing plaintiff could neither read, write nor properly understand English, an interpreter was used to explain the document to him at the time the alleged release was executed. This interpreter, a man named <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>Klamar, when called as a witness by defendant, testified there were parts of the paper which he, himself, could not understand, these being explained to him by other persons present at the time, which explanations he used in interpreting to plaintiff; but when the other persons were called, they were unable to tell just exactly what parts of the document they had explained or what explanations they had given in reference thereto. Klamar, when asked whether he had told plaintiff the money he would receive was to be “in full settlement of all claims for injuries,” replied that he had told him to sign the contract “for his relief”; and the witness repeated that he had informed Palkovitz the document “was a receipt for the relief and he couldn’t get the relief money unless he signed the paper.” In brief, defendant’s principal witness on this point plainly showed that the alleged release had not been properly explained to Palkovitz or fully read to him in a language which he could understand; on the contrary, the testimony bears out the assertion of plaintiff, to the effect that he placed his mark upon the paper believing it to be a mere receipt for relief money. No matter what, ordinarily, the proper rule of law may be in cases of this kind, it is clear that, under the circumstances at bar, defendant, after its own witness had destroyed the effectiveness; as a release of the writing in question, is not in a position successfully to maintain plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence to that end.</p>

Since, however, so far as the binding effect of the release <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>is concerned, on the evidence produced by defendant itself, instructions might have been given, with propriety, for plaintiff, and the rulings on the evidence were of a kind within the discretion of the trial judge, it is unnecessary to discuss the criticisms to which we have referred; and, moreover, since they are not comprehended by the statement of questions involved, we are not called upon to do so.</p>
