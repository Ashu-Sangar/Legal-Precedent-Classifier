Paul, one of the defendants, conducted with George Heebner a partnership business in the City of Pottsville for the sale of musical instruments. This partnership was dissolved in 1895 and Paul engaged in the same business in the same city on his individual account which he continued until January 13, 1903, at which time plaintiff, Howard I. Paul, alleges a partnership agreement was made orally between him and defendants, Levi M. Paul, his father, and Sarah K. Paul, his sister. On May 31, 1904, the parties named filed in the office of the prothonotary of the county in which they were doing .business, a certificate to the effect that on January 19, 1903, they entered into a copartnership for the sale of music and musical instruments, under the name of Levi M. Paul &amp; Company, and stated their respective interests in the firm to be Levi M. Paul one-fifth, Sarah K. Paul two-fifths, and Howard I. Paul two-fifths. The business was continued under that name until August, 1917, when a disagreement arose and plaintiff demanded his interest in the firm, and, upon his right to share in the firm property being denied by defendants, the present bill was filed asking that the partnership be dissolved and an accounting ordered. Defendants denied the existence of the partnership and averred plaintiff was merely an employee and that the certificate <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>filed by plaintiff and defendants in the prothonotary’s office was “for the purpose of protecting the property of Levi M. Paul from the possible liability for the debts of Heebner &amp; Paul.” The court below found as a fact that a partnership was not intended in good faith to be formed between the parties, and that plaintiff was aware he was without actual interest in the business or its assets, and at no time asserted an interest until August, 1917, following a dispute which arose between him and his father. The court found the purpose disclosed by the defense was fraudulent and defendants were estopped from asserting their claim and from denying the partnership, and that to permit such defense would allow defendants to benefit by setting up their fraud in avoidance of their contract. A decree was accordingly entered directing an accounting.</p>
