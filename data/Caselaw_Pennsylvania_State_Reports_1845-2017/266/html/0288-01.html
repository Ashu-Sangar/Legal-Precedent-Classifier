All those relating to the first thereof must fail, because the contract does not refer to the Eckhart mine, and there is no allegation that anything was omitted by fraud, accident or mistake, or that any promise was made to induce its execution, and hence it cannot be overthrown or modified by oral evidence (Krueger v.

Except where court rules provided otherwise, the only purpose of an affidavit of defense under the prior law was to prevent summary judgment. Under this section, however, it is an essential part of the pleadings, and the court below should refuse to admit evidence upon any issue not raised thereby. The provision for amendments gives ample opportunity for the curing of oversights; and hence where, as here, the evidence offered is not within the issues raised either by the original pleadings or amendments thereof, its .exclusion by the court below must be approved.</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[240,1044,1150,703]]]'>Defendant’s fourth point embodied in the twelfth assignment of error, deals with the second of said issues, and should have been affirmed. It is as follows: “4. Notwithstanding that the contract mentioned 3,000 tons more or less, should you find that the contract was really to supply the needs of the plaintiff’s manufactory within the time of the contract, and that during the months of July, August and September but two cars of coal were required each month, and thereafter but four or five cars per month, then you will disregard the number of tons as stated in the contract and consider only the number of cars of coal required by the plaintiff’s plant during the period of the contract.”</p>

The Ben Franklin Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/173/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="173 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="875836" data-case-paths="/pa/173/0053-01">173 Pa. 53</a>; Myers’s Est., <a href="/pa/238/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="238 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="991492" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0195-01">238 Pa. 195</a>, 211. It is true the words “3,000 tons more or less” ordinarily would be construed to mean that the amount should be approximately that stated, because usually that is the intention of the par<a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>ties; but in ascertaining the intention this is not always so'. If those words follow an alleged quantity of land which is also described by metes and bounds, or an estimated quantity of personal property in bulk, the vendor is obliged to give and the purchaser to take whatever there is, even if it is considerably more or less than that stated; or if the real purpose of the provision is to enable the vendee to get the article desired for a particular use, as for instance to operate a plant during a specified period, it can require enough for that use and need take no more, though it is considerably more or less than the amount named: Glen v.

It follows that plaintiff was entitled by the contract to receive only sufficient coal to run its plant, and this is recognized in the statement of claim, which avers: “Immediately there<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>after [i. e. after the execution of the contract] the agent of the plaintiff and the agent of the defendant, both being duly authorized by the contractors, agreed in pursuance of their authority that during the months of July, August and September, the plaintiff would require about two cars of coal per month, and that thereafter the plaintiff would require four or five carloads of coal per month until the full 3,000 tons of coal were purchased.” Under section 16 of the Practice Act of May 14,1915, above quoted, plaintiff would be permitted only to recover in accordance with that averment; which is, after all, merely a statement of the needs of plaintiff’s plant, is within the rule above mentioned, and hence demonstrates the error of refusing the point now under consideration.</p>
    <p id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[229,1171,1151,927]]]'>Under this averment of the statement defendant was required to furnish only during the period of the contract from July 1,1916, to April 1, 1917, either 30 or 36 carloads, depending on whether four or five were needed for the months beginning with October and ending with March; and, in the absence of averment and proof to the contrary, the presumption is that the cars were to be of the capacity commonly used for the shipment of coal from the George’s Creek district. In the exhibit attached to the statement it appears that, after this agreement is alleged to have been made, <em>22 </em>carloads were delivered aggregating 1,017 tons, the average capacity of the cars therefore being about 46 tons.. Assuming this to be a fair average, under the above quoted paragraph of the statement the deficit was at most only 14 cars or 644 tons, instead of 1,983 tons, as claimed by plaintiff and submitted to the jury.</p>
