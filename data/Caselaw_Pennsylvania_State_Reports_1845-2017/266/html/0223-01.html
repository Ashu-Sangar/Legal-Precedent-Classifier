After a review of the evidence, I find nothing in it which would justify you in rendering a verdict of voluntary manslaughter; therefore, under the evidence in this case, you may find the defendant guilty of murder of the first degree, murder of the second degree, or you may acquit him of all the charges against him.] (3) [If you find that the defendant killed Charles J.

As I have said to you, murder of the first degree is a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing. It is the most heinous crime known to the law. It means that the prisoner had time to make up his mind to kill the deceased, and that he killed him in pursuance of that determination. As you know from everyday experience, it takes a very short time to form an intention. An intention may be formed almost instantaneously, and it matters not how long the prisoner may have had his intention. If he formed it almost immediately before, and did intend to kill the deceased, and shot him with the purpose, it is murder of the first degree.] (7)</p>

The defendant, on April 9, 1918, purchased two revolvers, some cartridges and a blackjack from a pawnbroker in the City of Philadelphia. Close to three o’clock on the same day he, with his brothér, entered a <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>jewelry store on Girard avenue and inquired about some wedding rings. After a few minutes’ conversation they left the store and shortly afterwards returned and again asked to be shown the rings; while the defendant was looking at them, his companion struck the proprietor on the head with a blackjack; the defendant then shot, but did not kill him. The proprietor, in escaping, was shot a second time by the defendant. His outcries brought a number of people to the place. The defendant and his companion went to the dining room at the rear of the store, where they met the jeweler’s wife; the defendant, after striking her with the blackjack, left the store with his companion and started to run east on Girard avenue, thence south on Eleventh street, and up a blind alley between Girard avenue and Poplar street. Their effort at flight being balked in this direction, they retraced their steps and were returning to Eleventh street. The deceased, who had joined in the pursuit, was standing at the entrance to the alley. The defendant, on approaching him, fired the shot that caused his instant death. It is for this homicide that he stands convicted of murder of the first degree.</p>
    <p id="b253-3" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[240,1536,1149,869]],["BL_254.1",254,[245,320,1153,1303]]]'>It is contended by the defendant that the evidence as to what took place in the jewelry store and the defendant’s flight should not have been admitted in evidence, as it had a tendency to establish an independent crime having no relation whatever to the actual killing that took place in the alley. This evidence was received without objection. A very short period of time elapsed between the occurrence in the jewelry store and the shooting and the testimony was not offered with the view of showing a distinct offense from that charged in the indictment, nor to show that the accused was generally a bad man; it was offeréd, as stated by the Commonwealth, as being the probable result of a series of acts which had their inception in the attempt to perpetrate a robbery. There was no break in the continuity of events between the time defendant entered the jewelry store, <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>the assault on the proprietor and his wife, his attempt to rob the store, his flight, and the killing of the deceased. A very clear exposition of the law as to the scope evidence may take which has a tendency to involve the commission of other offenses may be found in our Brother Stewart’s opinion in Commonwealth v. Coles, <a href="/citations/?q=265%20Pa.%20366" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="265 Pa. 366">265 Pa. 366</a>: “It is quite true that, ‘as a general rule, a distinct crime unconnected with that laid in the indictment, cannot be given in evidence against the prisoner’:......

It often happens, however, that two distinct offenses are so inseparably connected, that the proof of one necessarily involves proving the other, and, in such a case, on a prosecution for the one, evidence proving it cannot be excluded because it also proves the other.” See also Com. v.

It was perfectly proper to show why Martin, the deceased, had pursued him to the alley and his evident purpose in the alley; this, no doubt, impressed itself on the mind of the accused to such an extent that he felt it necessary to kill the deceased to gain freedom. The evidence of prior acts is in explanation of the conduct of Martin, the deceased, and of the defendant, and shows the motive that prompted the commission of the crime. In this view, it was undoubtedly relevant evidence. It was further competent as being one of the probable results of an attempted robbery, so much so that where, as in this case, no intervening act broke the series of events, it may be con<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>sidered as part of the res gestas.

It was not so forcible an expression of indignation at the crime as to convey to the minds of the jury the conviction or belief that the judge felt the prisoner was guilty.

It is now urged this was an erroneous instruction as it took away from the jury its statutory duty of ascertaining the degree of the crime. The jury has the power, and it is its duty, to ascertain the degree of murder; it is so fixed by the law of the State. Peremptory instruction that takes from it this power is erroneous, and it is the duty of the court to submit the question of manslaughter unless it is clearly convinced there is nothing in the evidence to reduce the grade of the crime below murder; while the jury must be free to act in determining the degree of murder, there is no such requirement in distinguishing between murder and manslaughter : Com. v.

But where there is no evidence which in the least degree points to the offense of manslaughter, the court does not commit error when it refuses to charge with respect to manslaughter, or charges the jury as in this case. The defendant hoped to exculpate himself by the statement that he was a drug fiend and had no recollection of what happened from the time he entered the jewelry store until some time after the crime was committed, that he was suffering from aphasia, superinduced by the narcotic.
