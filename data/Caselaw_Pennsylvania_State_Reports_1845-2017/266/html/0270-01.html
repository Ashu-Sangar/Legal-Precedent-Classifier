The plaintiff, Yetta Kauffman, who resided with her parents in Philadelphia, was injured by a street car in 1910. She being then about eleven years of age, an action for damages was brought against the street car company by her father as next friend. Pending this, the company made offers of compromise, and it became evident that something would be recovered for plaintiff, which her parents decided should be invested in real estate. Meantime there was an opportunity to buy the property known as 645 Porter street for $650, subject to mortgages. Mrs. Bothman, a friend of the family, advanced or loaned Kauffman $600 with which to make this purchase, upon the express agreement that the property was bought for plaintiff and that the $600 would be repaid out of the latter’s money when recovered; and, upon a like understanding, her father advanced the remaining $50 of the purchase money and some expenses necessary to complete the purchase. The deed was taken in the name of Zipa Kauffman, plaintiff’s mother, but with the express understanding and agreement that the property was plaintiff’s and would be conveyed to her upon her marriage. In June, 1912, Kauffman received $1,440.67 for plaintiff from the street' car company, out of which he repaid Mrs. Bothman and himself the amounts advanced, as above stated, deposited <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>$500 of the balance in bank and handed the remaining $222 to his wife for safe keeping. In October, 1912, Kauffman bought another encumbered property, known as 2137 South Seventh street, and paid the consideration therefor with plaintiff’s money. This exhausted all of her money except $200 which he used in repairing the property. He took title to the Seventh street property in his own name, but with the same express agreement and understanding as his wife had for the Porter street property. When buying the Seventh street property he temporarily borrowed $300 but repaid it with plaintiff’s money which he drew from the bank. The deeds were taken in the names of the parents to facilitate resale should a favorable opportunity occur. Since the purchases Kauffman has occupied one of the properties as a residence and rented the other. The understanding and agreement that the properties above mentioned were plaintiff’s, and to be turned over to her, rested in parol and were not manifested by any instrument in writing, but her money paid the entire consideration therefor.</p>

Later a general judgment was entered upon the bond which became a lien prima facie upon both the Porter street and the Seventh street properties, and Steiner is joined as a defendant with plaintiff’s father and mother; the prayer of the bill being that the latter account for and turn over the properties and that the same be released and discharged from the lien of the former’s judgment. As to Steiner the case was heard upon bill, answer, replication and testimony; but neither Kauffman nor his wife filed an answer; however*, when called as witnesses they fully confessed the trust as stated in the bill. The chancellor found the facts, <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>in effect, as above stated; and, from final decree entered thereon granting the relief prayed for, Steiner brought this appeal.</p>

Merely as an express trust of land resting in parol, it could not be enforced against the trustees (Sec. 4 of Act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 533, Purdon’s Digest, 13th ed., vol. 4, p. 4838), except that they confess it in open court. A parol trust becomes valid when in the course of litigation it is confessed by the trustee: Hatcher v.
