    <p class="summary" id="b141-9" data-blocks='[["BL_141.17",141,[153,1634,1153,695]]]'>The action was by a minor, who came of age before the trial of the case, for injuries sustained by being struck by a wagon belonging to, and driven by a servant of, the defendant. Liability was conceded and the only question in the case was the extent of the injuries of the plaintiff, and the damage sustained by him. The verdict was for $5,000 and the defendant’s principal reason for asking a new trial is that this verdict was excessive and against the weight of the evidence. If the medical testimony on the part of the plaintiff was believed by the jury they were fully justified in finding a verdict for this amount, and we are unable to say that the jury should not have believed it. . The motion is therefore refused.</p>
