A bill in equity was filed against a borough incorporated under a special act, to declare void and of no effect certain annexation proceedings and from relief from alleged illegal taxation in the annexed territory. Such proceedings were not authorized under the special act by which it was incorporated, and were only authorized where .a borough had accepted the provisions of the general borough Act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320, as provided by the Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 312, 325. The bill recognized the probability of the borough having accepted the Act of 1851, and carefully avoided averring that it had not done so. The averments of the bill, and its prayers, indicated that the real purpose of the suit was to declare the annexation proceedings void, and that relief from illegal taxation was merely an ostensible purpose. The answer not only specifically averred that the borough had accepted the act but introduced a court record demonstrating that fact. A replication was filed, and the case was heard on bill, answer and replication. The court dismissed the bill. <em>Held, </em>(1) that, although ordinarily questions of jurisdiction must be determined on what appears in the bill alone, the court was warranted in concluding that the borough had accepted the Act of 1851, inasmuch as no issue was involved, as to the acceptance of such act, requiring further evidence for its determination; (2) that, even if this were not plain from the pleadings, yet, since the bill itself showed that the proceedings by which plaintiffs claimed to be “aggrieved,” contained matter “purporting” the annexation to be by virtue of the Act of 1915, plaintiffs’ remedy would still be by complaint under that act to “the next court of quarter sessions” and not in equity; (3) that the court was justified in deciding the question of jurisdiction in limine; and (4) that the bill was properly dismissed, inasmuch as the plaintiffs had a remedy at law under the Act of 1915, by a complaint to “the next court of quarter ¡sessions.”</p>

Although plaintiffs filed a replication, <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>yet, on the peculiar facts at bar, no issue was thereby raised as to defendant’s acceptance of the Act of 1851. An issue is a point affirmed on one side and denied on the other. Here the bill, while in effect recognizing the possibility of defendant borough having accepted the Act of 1851, carefully avoids averring it did not do so, and the answer not only specifically avers that it did accept, but introduces a court record demonstrating that fact. Under these circumstances, albeit ordinarily questions of jurisdiction must be determined on what appears in the bill alone (Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. Co. v. Stowe Twp., <a href="/pa/252/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="252 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="1021646" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0149-01">252 Pa. 149</a>, 155), in the present instance, there being no issue involved as to the acceptance of the Act of 1851, requiring further evidence for its determination, the court was warranted in concluding the borough had accepted such legislation; but, even if it were not plain from the pleadings that the borough had accepted .the Act of 1851, since the bill itself shows that the proceedings (see paragraphs 2 and 3 of this opinion), by which plaintiffs claim to be “aggrieved,” contain matter “purporting” the annexation to be by virtue of the Act of 1915, under the beforequoted provision of the borough code (chapter 7, article I, section 9), their remedy would still be by complaint to “the next court of quarter sessions,” and not in equity.</p>

Moreover, the above-quoted statement is far from ruling that, when a statutory remedy is provided, whereby a legal right may be effectually settled, it is not necessary to pursue the.remedy, and thus establish the right, before an application for an injunction to enforce such right will be entertained, especially in a case like the present where the right claimed — relief from what is said to be an illegal tax levy — rests in part upon the ascertainment of controverted facts, involved in a proceeding heretofore had under a statute which provides an adequate method, or remedy, for judicially settling those very facts. We incidentally take occasion to remark, however, that, in a case of the character of the one now before us, after the legal status of the territory embraced in the annexation proceeding is determined at law, it is hardly conceivable any further relief in equity will be called for, so far as tax levies are concerned.</p>
