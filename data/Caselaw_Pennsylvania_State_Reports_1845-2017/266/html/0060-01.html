The daughter died in her minority, March 22, 1918, intestate, unmarried and without issue. The court below, being of opinion that her interest in her father’s estate was vested, awarded her share in it to her personal representative for future accounting to those entitled thereto. From this the Union Trust Company, of Pittsburgh, executor and testamentary trustee under the will of testator, has appealed.</p>

The interest clearly vested at testator’s death: Carstensen’s Est., <a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a>; Bair’s Est., <a href="/pa/255/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="255 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1027673" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0169-01">255 Pa. 169</a>; McCauley’s Est., <a href="/pa/257/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="257 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1032402" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0377-01">257 Pa. 377</a>.

Thus where stock is bequeathed to A. for life, and after his decease to trustees, upon trust to sell and pay, and divide the proceeds to and between C. and D.; as the payment or distribution is evidently deferred until the decease of A., for the purpose of giving. precedence to his life interest, the ulterior legatees take a vested interest at- the decease of the testator: 1 Jarm. on Wills, 764.”</p>
