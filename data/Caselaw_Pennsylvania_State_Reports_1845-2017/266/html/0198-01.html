    <p class="summary" id="b227-3" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[188,658,1150,642]]]'>(4) The said crossing was made at right angles to the lane eighteen inches above grade; the approaches were properly filled and graded; drain pipes to care for the surface water were duly laid; the space between the rails and for a distance of two feet on either side was covered with oak planks two and one-half inches thick and sixteen feet long, and a cinder filling was made east or below the crossing, greatly improving the grade and condition of the lane road to the point of junction with the public road. The grade of the lane road above the crossing for a short distance was also improved by the defendant.</p>

The road has been in use by the plaintiff and her predecessors in title for many years for the purpose of hauling supplies and produce, transporting animals, and in the matter of general foot and vehicle traffic. The road has not been kept in good repair. Often it has been impassable, and at different times in the year for considerable periods the plaintiff in preference has made use of a way across the fields to reach the public road.</p>

Henry Leech is the common source from which plaintiff and defendant derived their respective titles.</p>
