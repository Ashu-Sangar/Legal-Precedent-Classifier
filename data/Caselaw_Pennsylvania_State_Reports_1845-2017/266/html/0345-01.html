The contract provided, inter alia, that the binder, consisting of stone and asphaltic cement, should be so made as to “contain bitumen in quantity from three to five per cent of the mixture.” The paving company having defaulted, the city readvertised for bids, and awarded the contract to the Barbour Asphalt Paving Company, the lowest responsible bidder, at a price in excess of the original contract. This later contract varied from the first in that it required the bitumen in the binder to be “from four to six per cent of the entire mixture.” The city sued on the bond to recover the loss which it suffered, and defendants averred four differences between the two contracts, the one above referred to, however, being the only one urged on this appeal. In the court below they presented a point for binding instructions which was refused, and a verdict having been rendered for the city for the full amount of its claim, made a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto which was overruled, judgment was entered on the verdict and this appeal followed. The refusal of the point and the dismissal of the <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>motion are the only matters referred to in the statement of the questions involved, and, under Rule 34, the only ones to be reviewed by us.</p>

The important inquiry, however, related to the summer of 1917, when the new contract was made, and the question at issue was whether the resultant mixture of stone and asphalt, including the labor necessary to' produce it and place it, would have been more expensive under the new contract in 1917 than under the one of 1916 had it been readvertised, and the evidence upon which defendants rely does not touch this point. One of the city’s witnesses testified that practically there was no difference in cost, and one of defendants’ that it would not cost the difference between six per cent and five per cent of asphalt, though he was of opinion contractors would probably bid as if it did. Another witness was of opinion the change would increase the price of the finished pavement, but fixed no date as to which he was testifying, could not say how much the difference would be, and gave no reason for his opinion. This was <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>all the evidence on the point, and while it probably had to be submitted to the jury to determine whether or not the change was material, it is clear therefrom that the trial judge could not properly have given binding instructions for defendants or entered judgment in their favor non obstante veredicto, especially as the credibility of the witnesses was for the jury in any event: Harlow v.
