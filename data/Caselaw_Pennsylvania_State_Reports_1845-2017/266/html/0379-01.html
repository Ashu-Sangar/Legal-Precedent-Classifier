M., an American citizen, was a member of the international banking firm of A. &amp; Co., a juridical entity under the laws of Chile. After his death the firm went into liquidation. The liquidator contracted with B., an attorney, afterwards associated with P., to represent “him” and “said firm” in the prosecution of a claim against Chile and Bolivia, and agreed to pay, as counsel fees, a stipulated percentage upon the amount “recovered for me or said firm.” The liquidator subsequently died. Thereafter B. and P', presented the claim to a commission created by the United States and Chile for the consideration of claims of the citizens of each country against the other. The commission rejected the claim because A. <em>&amp; </em>Co., the claimant, being a Chilean citizen, its rights were not comprehended by the terms of the submission, which embraced only corporations, companies, or individuals, citizens of the <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>United States. Subsequently the heirs of E. M., who were ignorant of the contract between the liquidator and B. and P. retained their own counsel. The claim was afterwards submitted to the King of England for arbitration, being presented not on behalf of A. &amp; Co., or its surviving member, but on behalf of certain designated American citizens, including E. M., their “heirs, assigns, representatives and devisees.” An award was made by the king in favor of the American claimants which was paid by Chile to the secretary of state for distribution. Certain questions having arisen, an agreement of compromise was entered into by some of the parties, including the heirs of E. J£, containing a provision for the payment of a specified percentage to B. and P., as attorneys’ fees. This agreement was annulled by a subsequent agreement which submitted all such questions to the secretary of state for arbitration. The secretary refused to act, and the respective interests of the claimants were paid over by the United States government to representatives of their estates for distribution. B. and P. presented to the representative of E. M. a claim for attorneys’ fees at the rate specified in their contract with the liquidator, based upon the amount awarded to the heirs of E. M. The representative of E. M. refused payment of this claim. <em>Held: </em>(1) That the contract of retainer imposed no liability on the estate of E. M., which had employed independent counsel; (2) that neither the compromise agreement nor the agreement of arbitration constituted a ratification or confirmation by E. It’s estate of the employment of B. and P. or recognition of their claims, but merely a recognition that it was to the mutual advantage of. everyone concerned to have all demands upon the fund disposed of, if possible by the secretary of state, rather than to have them litigated elsewhere.</p>

Instances may be found where a particular provision in the contract itself causes a liability for attorney fees to continue against him who takes any part of the fund eventually realized; or where the demand from which the fund arises really remains with, and, in the end, is recovered by the original claimant, or his direct representative, and, for that reason, the liability to pay attorney fees continues; or where the party to whom the claim eventually passes so recognizes and accepts the services of the attorney, originally retained, as to create a liability on his part for the latter’g fees. But the principles there involved do not apply to this <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>case, where it was necessary to abandon the original claimant and substitute others in its place before recovery of any part of the fund now for distribution could be secured, and where, until this was done, success did not accrue.</p>

After obtaining the award, which created the fund, by talcing a certain stand before the international tribunal, it would be a breach of good faith to ignore or depart, in any manner or degree, from the basic grounds upon which such recovery was had.</p>

Alsop &amp; Co. went into liquidation, and, in 1876, John Wheelwright, its liquidator, looking towards the collection of a debt due by Bolivia to the Alsop firm, made a contract with that country; but war ensued between Chile and Bolivia, and acts of the former prevented payment by the latter. In 1885, Wheelwright contracted with George S. Bout-well, Esq., to represent “him” and “said firm” in the prosecution of the claim of Alsop &amp; Co. against Chile and Bolivia; he agreed to pay, as counsel fees, a stipulated percentage upon the amount “recovered for me or said firm,” and an effort to have part of these fees charged against the American heirs of Edward McCall gave rise to the present litigation.</p>

Bout-well and Prentiss again presented that demand, but it was rejected because Alsop &amp; Co. was “a Chilean juridical person,” and, possessing such nationality, its rights as a claimant against Chile were not comprehended by the terms of the submission, which in this respect embraced only corporations, companies, or individuals, citizens of the United States.</p>

In this connection, the auditing judge (Gest) properly says: “When the protocol of submission was made between Chile and the United States, by which the determination of the amounts equitably due to the individual partners of Alsop &amp; Co. was referred to King Edward VII, the case assumed a radically different position, and the estates of Boutwell and Prentiss, in order to maintain their claim against the estate of Edward McCall, should show some contractual obligation on the part of the latter or its representatives. In the diplomatic intervention made by the United States against Chile, in consequence of which the protocol was executed, the distinction between the firm as a legal entity and the partners composing it appears clearly in every phase of the proceedings. Neither Wheelwright nor Prevost assumed in the slightest degree to contract in behalf of, or to bind, the individuals who were or had been members of the firm. This is far from being an academic or technical distinction; the liquidator of the firm of Alsop &amp; Co. was acting in behalf of an entity entirely distinct in every legal aspect from the individuals who were partners, and any asset which might have been recovered by such liquidator probably would have been subject to claims, liens or other rights, radically distinct from those growing out of the interests of the individuals......The claim of Boutwell and Prentiss......is put clearly upon a contractual basis, and their estates must recover on that basis or not at all.” The orphans’ court then decided that, since the McCalls had. employed independent, counsel to represent them, and Boutwell and Prentiss, although representing several other interests, had shown no contract of retainer with either of the McCall estates, their claim for counsel fees could not be allowed against the latter; and this is the matter of complaint which we have to' adjudge.</p>

Our attention is directed to two documents which mention the fees in controversy; but, as stated by the learned auditing judge, the first of these so-called agreements was never consummated, several of the parties in interest having failed to sign, and the second is nothing more nor less than “a submission to arbitration by the secretary of state of numerous disputed claims,” among others that of Bout-well and Prentiss. The secretary having refused to assume such arbitration, “the agreement,” in the words of Judge Gest, “proved futile and cannot in the present litigation be regarded as in any way a ratification or confirmation by George McCall of the employment of Bout-well and Prentiss, or a recognition of their claim......

We think, under the circumstances, the documents relied upon were properly held by the court below to be in the nature of compromise agreements, which could not legally be given the effect claimed for them by appellants; they were not necessarily an acknowledgment of either the legality or justice of the claim for attorneys’ fees mentioned therein, but merely a recognition that it was to the mutual advantage of everyone concerned to have all demands upon the fund disposed of, if possible, by the secretary of state, rather than to have <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>them litigated elsewhere.

    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[267,712,1153,1017]]]'>Instances may be found where a special provision in the contract itself causes a liability for attorney fees to continue against him who takes any part of the fund eventually realized; or where the demand from which the fund arises really remains with, and, in the end, is recoverable by the original claimant, or his direct representative, and, for that reason, the liability to pay attorney fees continues; or where the party to whom the ciaim eventually passes so recognizes and accepts the services of the attorney originally retained, as to create a liability on the former’s part for the latter’s fees. Some such authorities have been cited; but all of them are distinguishable on their facts from the case now before us, where it was necessary to abandon the original claimant, Alsop &amp; Co. (the client of the attorneys whose fees are here in controversy), and substitute others in its place, ere recovery of any part of the fund now for distribution could be hoped for, and where, until this was done, success did not accrue.</p>

After obtaining the award which created the fund, by taking a certain stand before the international tribunal, it would be a breach of good faith in any manner or degree to ignore or depart from the basic grounds upon which such recovery was had.</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[214,610,1149,1087]]]'>Judge Henderson, speaking for the court below in banc, well summarizes the phases of the case which are now before us, thus: “The previous attempt to recover ......for the account of the Chilean entity, Alsop &amp; Co., failed because Chile refused to recognize the right of the United States to intervene for any but her own citizens......The balance shown by the account is a national fund donated by Congress to the heirs and representatives of Edward McCall; [but the same persons] take the fund, in the same proportions, whether derived through Edward or Anne McCall. The account is filed by the estate of Anne McCall [and, the United States government having paid the fund to that estate, it can] properly be distributed [in the present proceeding]. ......Neither Prentiss nor Boutwell were employed by, or even known to, the McCall executor; hence they have, and make, no claim to recover on a quantum meruit, and they cannot now recover, against the McCalls, on the original contract of retainer, which Boutwell made with the liquidator of Alsop &amp; Co.”</p>
