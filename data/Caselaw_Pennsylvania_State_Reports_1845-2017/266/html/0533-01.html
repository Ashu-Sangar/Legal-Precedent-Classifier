      <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>The defendants are four or more corporations publishing newspapers in the City of Pittsburgh. The plaintiff alleges that a long time before the acts complained of, at a time not stated, but, from the letters attached to the plaintiff’s claim, sometime in or before the year 1916, all the newspapers of Pittsburgh, including those published by the defendants, had designated him as distributing agent for their newspapers at an agency established by him on Chestnut street in Pittsburgh, his employment as such agent being to distribute newspapers to newsboys working in that section of the city and carriers having routes therein. He alleges that he had acquired a right, by reason of his efforts in establishing this agency, to continue it in the district mentioned, and that up until July, 1918, his agency was the only one for all the newspapers of Pittsburgh in that district, and that he was receiving as compensation twelve per cent for the sale and distribution of the newspapers, and that before he had established the agency there was none in that section of the city; and that he had an established, valuable and lucrative business which was built up by means of his own exclusive efforts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[237,1533,1151,753]]]'>The plaintiff alleges that his employment was by oral' agreement but he adds to his supplemental affidavit letters from the various defendants dated in November, 1916, announcing an increase in the wholesale price of papers and the discount and commission which he would be allowed. The statement then alleges that on this state of facts the defendants conspired together to ruin and destroy his business, by refusing to sell or furnish him newspapers, published by any of them, after July 1, 1918, but to employ another person in his place as distributing <em>agent; </em>and that they have since refused to sell or furnish him newspapers published by them, although requested so to do, and that by reason thereof his business was destroyed and he suffered damages.</p>

We are unable to see why they did not have a right to do so. That they might have done so acting separately, we understand is admitted by the plaintiff. If the act was unlawful at all it was because of the combination of a number.</p>
