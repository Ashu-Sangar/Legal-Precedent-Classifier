For the same reason the Masonic Home of Pennsylvania is a charity. Being charities, the prohibition in the Act of April 18, 1853, P.

    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[259,487,1150,1017]]]'>It must be kept in mind that the alleged interest we are investigating is not in a charitable institution which is to profit by the will, but simply one connected with an ordinary pecuniary legacy; because of which, — under an old rule, now changed by statute (Acts of 1911 and 1917, supra), — appellant attempts to destroy all the charitable features of testator’s will. No matter what the governing rule may be where the alleged disqualification arises from an interest in a charity, we again say, at the cost of reiteration, under present circumstances the interest which will affect the capacity of an attesting witness must be in the nature of a direct property right in the testamentary fund, or such immediate, certain, close and intimate connection with the legatee as leads to the inevitable conclusion that the witness will pecuniarily profit by the legacy; and, even then, the interest must exist at the time of execution and attestation of the will. Let us see if any such incapacitating right or interest is present here.</p>

Certain of the lodges and encampments of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows belong to this corporation, among others, the lodge of which James Moore is a member. Each of these lodges and encampments elect one member annually to represent them respectively in the affairs of the corporation; and each of them pays to the corporation a regular contribution, or tax, at the rate of one cent a week per member on their roll. Because of this payment, every lodge or encampment, in good financial standing with the home, has the right to place one out of each one hundred of its members in the institution, as a resident; but, in order to enter, the nominee must be over sixty years of age, unable to support himself, and must have been a <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>contributing member of his lodge or encampment for five consecutive years preceding the latter’s application for his admission. All of which means, in law, that a contributing lodge or encampment has a contractual right to place a varying number of its members, possessing designated qualifications, in the home, but no individual member of a lodge or encampment has a right of entrance, contractual or otherwise, or even a certainty of acquiring such right.</p>
    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[198,824,1148,370]]]'>At the time James Moore attested Joseph Channon’s will, and when the latter died in 1908, the witness was but forty-nine years of age; although he was then a contributing member of his lodge, in good standing, he was not and never had been an officer of the Odd Fellows’ Home, neither had he represented his lodge on the board of that institution nor had any other connection with it.</p>
    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[199,1206,1149,860]]]'>From the facts we have recited, relating to the status of Moore, it may readily be seen that his interest in the Odd Fellows’ Home, so far as the possibility of deriving a pecuniary benefit or advantage therefrom is concerned, was most uncertain and remote, depending upon the happening of many contingencies. In other words, when Moore witnessed the will, he had no legal right to enter the home, or even to apply for entrance, but simply belonged to a class, as one of which, eleven years hence, if he possessed certain other qualifications, and his lodge selected him as its nominee for the place, he might be entitled to enter the institution. That is to say, he did not possess, .but simply had the capacity of attaining, the legal right to share in the benefits of the home; and this was too remote an interest to disqualify him as an attesting witness, under the Act of 1855.</p>

L. 503, 507. In this connection, it may be said, all the remaindermen were conceded to be charities, except three — the Odd Fellows’ Home, the Methodist Episcopal Home and the Masonic Home. As previously <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>stated, the decision in Sharp’s Estate that the first of these is not a charity, is accepted as the law of this case; but appellant contends the orphans’ court should have held the other two institutions, just named, not to be charities, and awarded to her, as next of kin, the accumulations bequeathed to them.</p>

Judge Gest there states: “The Methodist Episcopal Home for the Aged is a charity within'the act of assembly [Daly’s Est., <a href="/pa/208/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="208 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="998110" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0058-01">208 Pa. 58</a>]; its organization and administration are quite different from those of the Odd Fellows’ Home, the benefits of which are conferred [only] upon those members of the order of Odd Fellows who [attain] a legal right to share in them. The fact that admission to the Methodist Episcopal Home is primarily granted to persons who have been members of the Methodist Episcopal Church for a certain period, is no objection [Price v. Maxwell, <a href="/pa/28/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="28 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="981734" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0023-01">28 Pa. 23</a>], particularly as this rule is not adhered to in special cases of merit,.....others besides Methodists......being admitted on nomination by a member of the church. The fact that an admission fee is charged is likewise no reason to the contrary; for the money derived from such source is insufficient to run the home, and the deficit is made up by charitable contributions: Phila. v. Masonic Home, <a href="/pa/160/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="160 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="852141" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0572-01">160 Pa. 572</a>. Likewise it does not alter the charitable nature of the institution that its inmates, on admission, assign to the home whatever property they may have [Brooks v. Hastings, <a href="/pa/192/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="192 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="909034" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0378-01">192 Pa. 378</a>, 388]; such a requirement is not unusual, but we find no case which holds it renders an institution noncharitable. The status of the Masonic Home was considered in Phila. v. Masonic Home, <a href="/pa/160/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="160 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="852141" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0572-01">160 Pa. 572</a>, where the question was as to the liability of the home for taxation under the Constitution, sec. 1, art. IX, and the Act of May 14,1874, P. L. 158,......the home claiming to be exempt as an institu<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>tion of purely public charity. The Supreme Court held that the Masonic Home was a charity, but not a ‘purely public charity.’ The distinction is an obvious one, and the opinion of the Supreme Court, in its discussions, shows clearly enough that the home is for a charitable purpose within the meaning of the act of assembly which we are discussing.”</p>
    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[197,716,1150,471]]]'>Before taking up the next matter which calls for our attention, we note the fact that both the conduct and the charter of the Methodist Episcopal Home show it to be an institution devoted not solely to the care of aged members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, but also of “other aged persons whose needy circumstances require such aid”; therefore, it, like the Masonic Home, is a charity within the pnrview of the legislation here involved.</p>

The adjudication, hereinbefore referred to, awarded the trustee something over $66,000, from the income of which the will directs the payment to two annuitants of the comparatively small sum of $500 per annum each, giving the entire fund, subject only to these payments, “together with the accumulation of income,” to the seventeen remainder-men. This is a rational reading of testator’s words; for it required no accumulations of income to pay the two annuities — which, in itself, sufficiently answers the present contention: Lennig’s Est., <a href="/pa/154/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="154 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="842401" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0209-01">154 Pa. 209</a>.</p>
