The plaintiff claims title under a sheriff’s deed made in pursuance of a sheriff’s sale on an execution issued on a judgment in favor of the City of Pittsburgh to recover on a scire facias issued on a delinquent tax lien. The lien was filed <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>against Mary A. Smith, owner or reputed owner, and Francis Murphy, registered owner, and there is no question in this case that the act of assembly was complied with in the filing of the lien. The plaintiff offered in evidence the record of the judgment by virtue of which the sheriff sold the property, and the record of a scire facias sur the municipal lien, and an alias scire facias on the same. The record of the scire facias and the alias scire facias and the judgment thereon cannot be found, and we have only the docket entries as evidence of the regularity of the proceedings, and those docket entries are as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[258,986,1146,199]]]'>“Sci. fa. to first Monday of January, 1898. Dec. 30, 1897, posted premises and nihil as to defendants. Dec. 16,1899, alias sci. fa. to first Monday of February, 1900. Nihil.”</p>

Quinn, <a href="/pa/123/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="123 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="967149" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0337-01">123 Pa. 337</a>, the service in this case as shown by the record is defective and the judgment entered thereon void; but this does not purport to be the return of the sheriff; it is the entry of the clerk on his docket as to the substance of the sheriff’s return, and that those docket entries are evidence of title has been decided and it is not necessary to discuss that question here. The simple question in this case is, judgment having been issued on the record and the actual return of the sheriff being lost and mislaid, have we a right to assume that the return of the sheriff on the alias scire facias showed a regular proceeding under the statute. Undoubtedly the service which it was intended to make in this case was service by two nihils, and that was the service which it was attempted to make in Ferguson v. Quinn, <a href="/pa/123/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="123 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="967149" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0337-01">supra.</a> But in that case the actual return to the alias scire facias was offered in evidence, and that showed that the property had not been posted by the sheriff on the alias <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>scire facias, nor had any attempt been made to find the defendant.</p>

In the absence of the exact return of the sheriff there is nothing in this record which shows that he did not make a proper service in both the writs of scire facias. The defendant offered no testimony and the case rests entirely, so far as the regularity of the proceedings is concerned, on the entry of the judgment on the record <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>as above set forth.
