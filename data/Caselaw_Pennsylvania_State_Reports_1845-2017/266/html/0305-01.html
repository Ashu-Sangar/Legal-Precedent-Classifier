    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.13",333,[221,897,1151,817]]]'>This action of trespass is for the death of plaintiff’s husband, caused, it is averred, by defendant’s negligence. Defendant has a system of tracks at Manayunk by which it serves certain mills and factories there located, and among others a plant of the American Bridge Company. Such service is performed by what is called a “shifting train” which places and removes cars, loaded or empty, as required. Under and between certain of the tracks the bridge company has a coal bin which is supplied with coal from the cars placed on the tracks for that purpose. On the morning of August 2,1916, the shifting train had left coal cars there for the bridge company to unload, and the deceased met his death while employed at that work. This appeal is by plaintiff from the judgment of the trial court refusing to take off a compulsory nonsuit.</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.14",333,[220,1725,1151,705]],["BL_334.1",334,[250,335,1147,758]]]'>With some hesitation we have reached the conclusion that such action was error. The evidence, as developed, was for a jury to pass upon, for it tended to prove the deceased was killed by defendant’s- shifting train strik-. ing violently against the car in which he was at work, so that he fell or was thrown upon the track and crushed by the car or engine; and also that the conductor of the shifting train had notice before the accident that a man was at woi*k in the car. The case seems to turn largely upon that fact, and the evidence tending to show such notice in time to have prevented the accident, while not clear, was for the jury. Pierson, the bridge company’s foreman, testified that he told the conductor to “be care<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>ful pushing down there — there is a man working at the bin”; also that the engine attached to a string of cars was then pushing down. His evidence seems to indicate that this notice was given about 12:35 p. m.; for he says he left the office in ten or fifteen minutes and went to the yard where he was informed of the accident, which, as he recalls, occurred between 12:45 and 12:55. Another witness fixed the time of the accident somewhat later. It was the uniform practice to have the cars unloaded before noon, and, as this accident happened about one o’clock, unless the crew of the shifting train had notice that work was still being done in the car, they were not responsible for bumping against it (Cunningham v. Phila. &amp; R. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/249/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="249 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1013548" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0134-01">249 Pa. 134</a>).</p>

The deceased was alone and no one saw him at the moment of accident, so it does not appear just how. he was thrown to the track, but the lack of proof as to that will not excuse the defendant if otherwise liable.
