We make the last assertion because, while the statute declares the phrase “public service company” comprehends “water corporations,” it also, in effect, stipulates the latter term shall “not include municipal corporations” or their regulation, even when rendering the same kind of service as the former class of companies, except as otherwise (to the limited extent) provided in the act.

    <p id="b60-4" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[256,1047,1157,864]]]'>Wherever municipal corporations are referred to in the parts of the act to which we have called attention, it will be noticed that, in each instance, the provision in question covers some concrete object to be accomplished with reference to such corporations, within the limited extent the statute is intended to apply to them. No express provision appears either for the supervision or control of municipal rate-making. The parts which deal with municipal corporations contain no reference to either rate-making or regulations, while those having to do with the latter subject omit all mention of municipalities ; and neither the provisions we have noted nor those to which we have found no occasion to refer justify the implication that the legislature intended the rate supervisory or regulative features of the statute to govern municipal corporations.</p>

For instance, all the numerous provisions as to supervisory control of the commission <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>over the issue of bonds and other securities by those constructing or maintaining public service plants, are inappropriate to municipalities engaged in such work, and it is inconceivable there was legislative purpose that they should apply thereto; yet if we, on general principles, construe such corporations' to be, for purposes of the act, on a par with public service companies these provisions would apply in the same degree as those granting to the commission supervisory power over rates. In other words, if we go on the theory of evident intendment, there is just as much warrant for holding the one set of provisions applicable to municipal corporations as the other. Many additional instances of a like character might be noted, such as the provisions requiring the consent of the commission ior either the chartering, or change in franchise, of a corporation controlled by the act; those subjecting the officers of corporations exercising public service rights to criminal charges of misdemeanor for the violations of the statute, etc., etc., all of which are inappropriate to municipalities.</p>

The act probably intended such accounts to be kept and reports to be made by municipal corporations, in order that the commission might have the benefit of the information which they, contain, in regulating public service companies operating in the same neighborhood or under approximately like conditions, and in passing on future municipal applications of a character over which, by the express terms of the statute, that <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>body is given jurisdiction. Furthermore, when the act is read as a whole, it is plain that its provisions, requiring municipalities to obtain consent of the commission before purchasing, entering upon the construction of, or extending public service plants, were intended probably for the purpose of protecting public service companies which operate in territories sought to be accommodated by municipalities, and thus to prevent municipal plants being used to the injury of private ones previously established, whenever the latter are ample for the accommodation of the public.</p>

When rendering the same character of service as public service companies, municipalities for many purposes must be considered and treated like private corporations (as shown by the Pennsylvania, cases before cited); <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>but, for purposes of supervision over their internal management (which the present act repeatedly treats as necessarily involved in the control of rates), it can readily be seen they may justifiably be put on a different basis from ordinary public service companies; for, though engaged in rendering the same kind of service as the latter, and entitled to derive therefrom a just gain (Jolly v.

The last statement is important because appellant, while admitting the probability that the legislature did not intend to regulate municipal rate-making, contends nevertheless that the classification in question offends our constitu<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>tional inhibition against special legislation and, since the act contains a provision to the effect that if any particular part shall be declared unconstitutional such decision shall not affect other parts thereof, it further contends we should read the law as though the alleged unconstitutional parts — working the division of corporations into different classes — were not contained therein, thus placing municipal corporations rendering the same kind of service as public service companies in a general class with the latter, and, by this method of construction, or elimination, subjecting the former to all the terms of the act. This view was taken by the Supreme Court of Illinois in the Springfield Gas &amp; Electric Co. v.

April being subsequent to February, this arrangement would appear to render the statutory appeal thus provided for nugatory, so far as the present appellant and other users of water-meters are concerned. We need not, and do not, decide that point, however, for the sole right which the act gives on such an appeal to persons “aggrieved by any assessment” is to “demand a reassessment,” and, since the board have only “the power and authority of assessing” in accordance with the “schedule of water rates” prescribed by council, the former could do no more, on revision, than correct its own administrative errors, — of law, in interpreting, or of fact, in carrying out, its chart of powers; it, like other administrative officers (Chelten Trust Co. v. Blankenburg, <a href="/pa/241/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="241 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="976027" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0394-01">241 Pa. 394</a>, 397), being bound by all relevant city ordinances until they are either abrogated by council or duly set aside by the courts. In other words, the board of water assessors, even on appeal, would have no authority to inquire into the reasonableness or justice of either the rate or classification ordained by council; and the alleged unreasonableness and discriminatory character of these are the real grounds of complaint in this case.</p>

Although equity ordinarily will not entertain a suit where redress may be had at law, yet equitable jurisdiction does not depend entirely upon the want of a common law remedy, but may be sustained on the ground that, under given circumstances, it is the most convenient and efficient road to adequate relief; which principle applies to the present case.</p>
