The <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>right-of-way at this point was quite wide and somewhat in the form of a triangle. There are tracks on two sides of the triangle and an open space in the center; this space was very frequently used, without objection on the part of defendant, as a playground by the boys in the neighborhood, who were in the habit of playing baseball there [and it had been so used for many years]. Defendant’s brakeman and other employees frequently took part in the games. It is quite likely that the ball field was not confined to the open space between the tracks, but extended over the latter.”</p>

The cars in question, unattached to any motive power, were stationed at a place where defendant “put cars that stand for some time”; and, while the testimony is meager, yet young Gawronski’s brother stated he and Stanley had been “playing over three months” on and around the cars, between which the former was caught and injured; that they had been on top of them “a couple of times”; and the railroad watchman was within their view “every day” they either played around or sat on top of such cars.</p>

I leave it to you to say whether that is a proper control of the engine, or whether that is not evidence of a lack of control on the part of those who were in charge on that day. The only suggestion or reason for the conduct of the engineer and fireman in jumping from the engine and letting it go wild, uncontrolled, is that they thought their lives were in danger.” At this point, counsel for plaintiff suggested: “According to the admission, I gather that the brakes were out of order on this day”; to which Mr. Mason replied: “There is no such admission.” Even here, counsel for defendant did not specifically contend there was no proof of negligence; although, at the end of the trial, he took an exception “to that part of the charge which is concerned with the proof of negligence,” and the court then said: “Of course, gentlemen, if there is no negligence shown in this case, your verdict must be for defendant.” As before intimated, when counsel for defendant undertook to admit the circumstances which gave rise to* and attended the runaway of <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>the engine — knowledge peculiarly within the possession of defendant — and failed to state facts which would relieve his client from the implication of negligence put upon it by those already proved or-admitted, it was for the jury to say whether, on the evidence and admission, defendant was guilty of negligence in the premises.</p>
