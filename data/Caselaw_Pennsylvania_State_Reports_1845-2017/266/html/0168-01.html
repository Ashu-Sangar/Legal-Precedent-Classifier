The agreement of sale calls for the conveyance of the estate in fee simple, clear of all liens and encumbrances. The affidavit of defense denies that the estate covered by the deed which plaintiffs tendered is an estate in fee simple. Whether it is or is not, depends upon the quantum of the estate which Rachel L. Baines, through whom the plaintiffs derived whatever title they may have, took under the will of her husband, James C. Baines. If she took less than an estate in fee, the rule for judgment before us should be discharged.</p>

As an expression of his confidence in her willingness and ability to “care for and do the best for the welfare” of their children, he left her the entire estate, or all it “will be worth,” to use “to the best of her judgment in raising and clothing our dear children.” He therefore imposed upon her a specific duty.</p>
