On a bill in equity by a stockholder of a corporation against the company and three persons named as all its officers and directors and against the three persons individually, for an accounting of money received from the sale of a large number of oil leases alleged to be owned either by the company or held for its use by the individual defendants, the plaintiff claimed that the leases had been sold for $6,000,000 covering all the properties, but that the individual defendants had improperly and fraudulently retained for their own use $1,850,000. It was admitted that the purchase price of $6,000,000 was entire, but the individúal defendants claimed that the $1,850,000 represented leases owned by them personally, and that plaintiff knew of this and consented to the sale as made. They offered no direct proof that plaintiff had agreed to any particular apportionment, but claimed that he knew all the circumstances and had acquiesced in the apportionment as made. The written contract of sale made no mention of any apportionment, but provided that all payments should be made to the company or its representatives. The evidence on the issue thus made was conflicting. <em>Held:</em>

In this connection, the chancellor states: “It developed that, under an agreement between A. C. Bedford, on the one part, and the J. C. Trees Oil Company, J. C. Trees, M. L. Benedum, and H. S. Gray-son, on the other part, the leases on the 114,000 acres of land, belonging to the J. C. Trees Oil Company and the three individuals, were sold as one property to A. C. Bed-ford for the sum of $6,000,000; and therefore we con<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>sidered it incumbent upon defendants, they being the majority of the stockholders and the majority of the board of directors and the officers who had negotiated the contract with Bedford, to show that their dealing with this plaintiff was fair and open. Accordingly, we proceeded to take testimony on the question as to whether the plaintiff, C. E. Glenn, and his brother, H. S. Glenn, knew the facts concerning the ownership of the leases held by Trees, Benedum, and Grayson and of the terms of the contract with A. C. Bedford, before they joined with the other stockholders in ratifying the sale of the property of the J. O. Trees Oil Company to A. C. Bedford for $4,000,000 [evidently meaning $4,150,-000]. That is the important controverted question; and, as I view the law, it is the only serious question in this case. The Glenns both testified they did not know anything about the leases alleged to have been held by Grayson and subsequently joined in by Trees and Benedum; that they did not know the contract with A. C. Bedford purporting to convey the individual property of the three defendants; that they had asked for the terms of the contract, and the information had been refused; and that they had asked to see the contract and had been refused permission to see it. On the other hand, the defendants claim the Glenns knew all about the situation, that they were told the conditions of the contract, that the contract itself was lying on the table at the meeting of December 3d, and that Coulter E. Glenn, the plaintiff, picked it up and examined it. Of course, they could not say whether he had read it or not — nobody could say that.”</p>

Of course, this made the credibility of these witnesses a matter of importance; nevertheless, when plaintiff offered in evidence, “an office copy” of a certain return made to the United States government, “for the purpose of contradicting the defendants’ statement that it was agreed to sell the property of the company for $4,150,000, the return showing $4,380,000,” this, upon objection, was refused.</p>
    <p id="b107-3" data-blocks='[["BL_107.4",107,[167,831,1150,1364]]]'>The ruling in question (complained of in assignment of error 44) and others of a similar character, represent clear and material error. It is true the offer was of an office copy, and not the original return; but the objection thereto was simply that the evidence was irrelevant and immaterial, not that the proof offered was incompetent. If the objection had been placed on the latter ground, it may be plaintiff would have either secured the original or shown, as a matter of law, that the copy was sufficient. Under the circumstances, assignment 44 is sustained; and this ruling should be a sufficient guide in the next trial, without our discussing or passing directly upon other like specifications of error, further than to say that any competent evidence, which, if true, would tend to prove an effort to deceive plaintiff in relation to material matters pertaining to the sale in question or otherwise to sustain his allegations of fraudulent conduct on the part of defendants regarding such matters, or which would reasonably go to show him entitled to an accounting as to any part of the moneys claimed, should be admitted and passed upon by the chancellor in making his findings of fact; so also should all evidence be received and carefully weighed by the chancellor, before making such findings, which, if true, might materially affect the credibility of important witnesses.</p>

Such an answer to a properly drawn point is in violation of our equity rules; the correct practice is to either affirm or deny the request. If the facts set forth are deemed immaterial, the chancellor can so state in his answer (see Hoyt v. Kingston Coal Co., <a href="/pa/203/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="203 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="994666" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0509-01">203 Pa. 509</a>, 511; Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v.

The chancellor found originally that the price which the corporation was to receive for its holdings was fixed at the December meeting; subsequently, on consideration of exceptions, the court below stated this was a mistake — that it was at the meeting in June such price was “agreed to.” Notwithstanding this change, the following appears upon the record: “Plaintiff was not informed prior to the meeting of December 3,1910, that Bedford had agreed to pay $4,150,000 for the corporate property.” The June meeting was held before the negotiations which led to the Bedford sale had even been entered upon, such sale taking place in November, 1910. Moreover, it appears from other findings that Bed-ford never agreed to pay any fixed amount for the “corporate” as distinguished from the other property included in his purchase. The facts concerning plaintiff’s inf or<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>rnation, or opportunity lor information, as to the price which the corporation was to receive for its property, are of prime importance; hence changes and apparent discrepancies in the findings relating thereto are, to say the least, confusing.
