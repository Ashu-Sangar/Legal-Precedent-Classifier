The estate of a remainderman who dies dining the life tenancy, is vested and not contingent under a will of a testator leaving a wife and four children for whom he provided by giving to his wife certain real estate for life, or during widowhood, and stipulating that, “upon” her death or remarriage, “said estate shall fall and vest in my children or their descendents absolutely and in fee.”</p>

Where the will was that of a husband and father, providing for wife and children — the natural objects of his bounty — the word “or,” in the phrase “said estate shall fall and vest in my children or their descendents absolutely and in fee,” will be construed as being used in the conjunctive and “descendents” as being used in descriptive sense of “heirs of the body,” or “issue,” of his children, where it is apparent from the writing itself, in light of relevant rules of interpretation, and from the next paragraph of the will wherein testator provides for the event of his death <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>“without leaving issue,” that testator did not intend by “decedents” to designate a certain set of persons to take directly from him at a given time.</p>

Under these circumstances notwithstanding the remainderman did not live to enjoy possession of his remainder, it was vested, not contingent.</p>

The determination of the wife’s life estate does not depend upon an uncertain event, and the remainder in the children is limited to ascertained persons in esse, it being “certain to take effect in possession by enduring longer than the precedent estate.” Under these circumstances, notwithstanding Harry A. Burkley did not live to enjoy possession of his remainder, it was vested, not contingent: Bair’s Est., supra.</p>
    <p id="b367-6" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[225,1282,1151,814]]]'>In the words of Judge Wessel of the court below: “It is true the children are not to have the immediate enjoyment of the estate, that being deferred until the determination of the widow’s interest,......but the time when it is to be enjoyed by the children depends upon a date certain to arrive, to wit, the widow’s death, with a possible acceleration by a remarriage. While testator did say that, ‘upon the death or marriage of my said wife, the estate shall fall and vest in my children,’ [it is plain from the will as a whole that] those words do not refer to the persons who should, at the widow’s death, become possessed of his estate, but to the time when his children should be entitled to [enjoy] possession thereof.” We agree with the court below that Harry A. Burkley died possessed of a vested estate in fee.</p>

The learned court' below therefore erred in refusing to find as facts, alleged in the bill and not denied by the answer, that Louis F.
