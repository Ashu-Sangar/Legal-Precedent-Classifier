If the work in hand is interstate, or so closely related thereto as to be practically a part of it, then it falls within the act of Congress (N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. Co. v. Carr, supra), as it also does where the work has a direct application to both intra and interstate commerce (Erie R. R. Co. v.

But a crossing flagman is in the nature of a traffic officer who protects the public and pilots each train over the crossing; and how can it be said that he is engaged in through traffic when so conducting a local train? He is assisting that train and his act is not essentially different from that of a conductor or brakeman thereon, for each is working for the safety of the train. Yet an employee upon an intrastate train is not engaged in interstate commerce: Ill. Cent. R. R. v. Behrens, <a href="/us/233/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="233 U.S. 473" data-case-ids="3673337" data-case-paths="/us/233/0473-01">233 U. S. 473</a>. However, it <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>is urged that flagging a local train promotes its safe passage and thus tends to keep the track open and clear for through traffic; but certainly no more so than the work of the crew of the intrastate train on the same track, and if this incidental matter of keeping the track open renders the one an interstate employment, why not both? The repair of a track or bridge over which interstate commerce passes is a direct immediate benefit thereto; entirely unlike any remote or collateral benefit it might possibly derive from flagging an intrastate train. And the true rule apparently is that to come within the range of interstate commerce the work must bear directly and not remotely thereon; otherwise practically all local work on trunk railways would be in interstate commerce, for one can scarcely conceive of any act SO' done that might not have some remote bearing upon such commerce. So, while this question does not seem to have been directly decided by the United States Supreme Court, and the rulings thereon by other courts are not in harmony, we conclude that a crossing watchman while flagging an intrastate train is not employed in interstate commerce, although trains engaged in such commerce use the same tracks.</p>

While a state court can take judicial notice of an act of Congress it cannot take such notice of facts necessary to bring a particular case within its provisions. The Federal Employers’ Liability Act, applicable to interstate commerce only, bears no analogy to the Federal Bankruptcy Act, which is of general application. There is no presumption that the train a watchman at a local crossing was flagging when killed was an interstate train. It is not a matter governed by presumption but by proof (Hench v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/246/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="246 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1006167" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0001-01">246 Pa. 1</a>, 6; and see Hancock v. Phila. &amp; R. Ry. Co., <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a><a href="/pa/264/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="264 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1048478" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0220-01">264 Pa. 220</a>), the burden of which rests upon the party alleging it — here the defendant: Polk v. Philadelphia &amp; R. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/266/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="266 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1056074" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0335-01">266 Pa. 335</a>. This familiar rule of evidence is especially applicable here, otherwise plaintiff must prove a negative, to wit, that her husband was not killed while flagging an interstate train,' and must do so when the evidence as to whether it was such or not is peculiarly within the knowledge of defendant. As the latter offered no evidence upon the question, that defense failed. It was its duty to individuate the particular act in which the deceased was engaged and show by competent evidence the train in question and that it was an interstate train, or at least that his act had some reasonably direct connection with such train. In Orborne v. Gray, <a href="/us/241/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="241 U.S. 16" data-case-ids="8285019" data-case-paths="/us/241/0016-01">241 U. S. 16</a>, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Hughes, say (p. 21) : “It is apparent that there was no evidence requiring the conclusion that the deceased was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of his in j ury, and we are asked to supply the deficiency by taking judicial notice that the cars came from without the State. This contention Ave are unable to sustain. The make-up of trains and the movement of cars are not matters which Ave may assume to know without evidence. ......The defendants kneAv the actual movement of the cars, and, failing to inform the court upon this point, cannot complain that they have been deprived of a federal right.”</p>
