    <p id="b597-3" data-blocks='[["BL_597.6",597,[183,405,1150,1083]]]'>This is an action of trespass brought by a father and minor son to recover for personal injuries to the latter. Defendant had a coal mining plant, including a breaker and other buildings, located on a thirty-five acre tract of land at Jessup, in Lackawanna County. This land was traversed by a ravine over which defendant many years ago constructed a bridge 175 feet long and 26 feet wide. A double track railroad occupied the center of the bridge, on each side of which was a plank walk 4 or 5 feet in width and protected on the outerside by a railing. The railroad was used for the storage and movement of coal cars. The bridge formed part of defendant’s plant and as such was private property; however, for many years prior to the accident, people, both adults and children, had been accustomed to use the walks daily as a short cut between Jessup and Winton, and for other purposes, including attendance on ball games, going for cows, etc. This appears from all the evidence and is ample to show that the walks had become permissive ways</p>

The car overhung the walk nearly two feet and left only a narrow space for pedestrians, and plaintiffs’ evidence tends to show that a pile of coal occupied a part of such space at the place of accident. Defendant gave no warning of the movement of its cars; in fact, the brakeman in charge thereof testified that he could have seen the boys but did not look, although he knew people were accustomed to use the walk. Defendant’s evidence is that it had posted notices forbidding trespassing upon the premises, but none with<a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>in fifty feet of the bridge; also that it had repeatedly ordered boys from the bridge, bnt plaintiff was not identified as one to whom such orders had been given. Defendant also offered evidence tending to show that Stephen said a boy had pushed him under the car, but this he denied. The trial judge submitted the case to the jury, including the questions of negligence and contributory negligence, and this appeal by defendant is from judgment entered upon verdicts for plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[277,834,1152,1290]]]'>The only question raised is that the court erred in submitting the case to the jury; not to have done so would have been manifest error. The evidence not only warranted but required a finding that the walk in question had become a permissive way; hence, those using it. were licensees and not trespassers, and the rule as to the latter has no application. As to the former it is the duty of the owner of premises to exercise reasonable care to avoid inflicting injury upon those using a permissive way thereon: Counizzarri v. Phila. &amp; R.

Defendant’s employees knew the daily use the public made of the walk, and especially that the boys used it in going for cows; also knew the width of the walk, the overhang of the cars and all the conditions. Hence, it might well be found that it was negligence to run a car onto the bridge so as violently to bump another car standing thereon, without warning or looking to see who might be upon the walk; for it falls within the rule that it is the duty of those moving cars over a permissive crossing to look ahead and see if the tracks are clear.</p>
