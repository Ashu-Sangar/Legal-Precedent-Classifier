        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nOn April 15, 1918, about 7 p. m., Stanley Gawronski, not quite eight years of age, was injured while on a freight car, which was standing, with others, in an open railroad yard of defendant company at American and Norris streets, Philadelphia.\nThe opinion handed down by the court below, entering judgment for defendant n. o. v., correctly describes the location thus: \u201cThe scene of the accident was defendant\u2019s right-of-way, which is partly coincident with the lines of American street,- as plotted but unopened. The right-of-way at this point was quite wide and somewhat in the form of a triangle. There are tracks on two sides of the triangle and an open space in the center; this space was very frequently used, without objection on the part of defendant, as a playground by the boys in the neighborhood, who were in the habit of playing baseball there [and it had been so used for many years]. Defendant\u2019s brakeman and other employees frequently took part in the games. It is quite likely that the ball field was not confined to the open space between the tracks, but extended over the latter.\u201d\nOn the day above stated, for at least three quarters of an hour before the accident, fifteen boys, Stanley among them, had been seated on the beforementioned freight cars, looking at a ball game, in full view of one of defendant\u2019s watchmen and others of its employees. The cars in question, unattached to any motive power, were stationed at a place where defendant \u201cput cars that stand for some time\u201d; and, while the testimony is meager, yet young Gawronski\u2019s brother stated he and Stanley had been \u201cplaying over three months\u201d on and around the cars, between which the former was caught and injured; that they had been on top of them \u201ca couple of times\u201d; and the railroad watchman was within their view \u201cevery day\u201d they either played around or sat on top of such cars.\nThe accident was caused by a \u201crunaway engine\u201d which collided with a train coming from the opposite direction, thus upsetting either itself or the locomotive of the latter (which, is not made certain); as a result of this collision, the freight cars on the adjoining track were struck in the rear, and the Gawronski boy was injured by being caught between two of them.\nExactly what caused the engine to run away was not shown; but, when plaintiff was proving his case, counsel for defendant made the following admission: \u201cIt is admitted that the engineer of the runaway engine...... lost control of the mechanism of the engine in such a way that the brakes would not work\u201d; that the engine gained speed just prior to the accident and \u201cboth the engineer and fireman jumped to save their lives.\u201d\nThe jury gave the minor plaintiff a verdict of $3,750, upon which the court below refused judgment, saying, inter alia: \u201cThe accident did not result from the use of the place as a playground, but because the boy was otherwise trespassing and was in a situation where he was not to be looked for, and where the railroad could not, by any custom proved, have been charged with knowledge of his presence actual, likely, or probably; the permissive use of the place shown by the testimony was as a playground, but nowhere was it suggested that there was any custom or permission to use standing cars as part of the playground.\u201d\nWe have repeatedly held that, where a railroad company permits its yards or tracks to be used as a playground for children, the corporation is required to operate its rolling stock with due care to avoid injuring such children, and that the ordinary rule, as to the limited measure of duty owing to trespassers, is inapplicable: O\u2019Leary v. Pittsburgh, etc., R. R., 248 Pa. 4, 9; Counizzarri v. P. &. R. Ry., 248 Pa. 474, 477, 478; Francis v. B. & O. R. R., 247 Pa. 425, 429; as to the duty toward children, see also Toner v. P. R. R., 263 Pa. 438, 440; Petrowski v. P. & R. Ry. Co., 263 Pa. 531, 536; Piepke v. P. & R. Ry. Co., 242 Pa. 321, 326.\nWe have held likewise that one fixed with a duty to regard the safety of children is obliged reasonably to anticipate they will do the ordinary and natural things which may be looked for from them under the circumstances. What we said in Hydraulic Works Co. v. Orr, 83 Pa. 332, 336 \u2014 \u201cThe mind......sees at once that in such a place, and under these circumstances, he [defendant] had good reason to expect that one day or other some one, probably a thoughtless boy,......would be led there\u201d \u2014 is not inappropriate here, when considering plaintiff\u2019s position on defendant\u2019s cars.\nAs before indicated, the testimony shows that freight cars were ordinarily permitted tovstand in defendant\u2019s yard, and that those upon which plaintiff was hurt had for some time been located where they could readily be occupied as a \u201cgrandstand\u201d for the baseball games which were constantly going on there. True, it was not specifically shown that these particular cars, or others, had on any considerable number of occasions been actually so employed, but, under the- circumstances, it was for the jury to say whether defendant, \u2014 knowing how the cars were located, that youngsters were in the habit of playing on or about them, and that the grounds immediately adjacent were continually used as a ball park by the boys of the neighborhood, \u2014 should not have anticipated the presence of children; and, when we add to all of this the further fact that defendant\u2019s- watchman was, for at least three quarters of an hour prior to the accident, in a position to see and must have known plaintiff and other persons of tender years were on the cars in question, it becomes clear the case was for the jury\u2014 to say whether or not the railroad acted with due care toward these little ones when, without requiring its employees either to give the boys warning or clear them off the cars, it permitted the collision which led to. plaintiff\u2019s injury.\nDefendant contends that, besides the position assumed by the court below in entering judgment n. o. v., negligence was not sufficiently proved, since plaintiff failed to show precisely what caused the locomotive to run away; but we cannot subscribe to this view. Counsel for defendant volunteered an admission wherein he stated: \u201cThe engineer lost control of the mechanism of his engine in such a way that the brakes would not work.\u201d This, in the absence of further explanation, presumably, within the power of defendant to make, was sufficient to justify the jury in finding either that the locomotive was defective or that it was improperly handied by the men. having charge thereof, either of which would constitute negligence.\nThe admission just referred to was made at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case, evidently for the purpose of saving him from presenting further testimony, by supplying, in this manner, the necessary information relative to the actual (Cause of the runaway of the engine. We say this, because, immediately thereafter, defendant moved for a nonsuit, stating various reasons, but not that proof of negligence was lacking so far as the runaway of the engine is concerned; in fact, that point does not appear to have been specifically raised until the written motion for judgment n. o. v. was filed after the trial.\nThe presiding judge said to the jury: \u201cAs to the lack of control of the engine......the fact is established by admission......that this engine was so operated it ran into another car upon its track, upsetting the latter and throwing it into* two* neighboring cars, causing this boy\u2019s injury. I leave it to you to say whether that is a proper control of the engine, or whether that is not evidence of a lack of control on the part of those who were in charge on that day. The only suggestion or reason for the conduct of the engineer and fireman in jumping from the engine and letting it go wild, uncontrolled, is that they thought their lives were in danger.\u201d At this point, counsel for plaintiff suggested: \u201cAccording to the admission, I gather that the brakes were out of order on this day\u201d; to which Mr. Mason replied: \u201cThere is no such admission.\u201d Even here, counsel for defendant did not specifically contend there was no proof of negligence; although, at the end of the trial, he took an exception \u201cto that part of the charge which is concerned with the proof of negligence,\u201d and the court then said: \u201cOf course, gentlemen, if there is no negligence shown in this case, your verdict must be for defendant.\u201d As before intimated, when counsel for defendant undertook to admit the circumstances which gave rise to* and attended the runaway of the engine \u2014 knowledge peculiarly within the possession of defendant \u2014 and failed to state facts which would relieve his client from the implication of negligence put upon it by those already proved or-admitted, it was for the jury to say whether, on the evidence and admission, defendant was guilty of negligence in the premises.\nFor a ruling illustrative of the principle just applied, see Janock v. B. & O. R. R. Co., 252 Pa. 199, where certain cars overturned on the elevated tracks of a railroad, and their contents spilled, injuring a pedestrian on the street beneath. We held the defendant liable, saying (pp. 200-201) : \u201cFreight carsdonot ordinarily leave their tracks......; when they do so, the natural inference is either the tracks or cars were in a defective condition, or the method of operating the train faulty.\u201d See also Dougherty v. Phila. Rapid Transit Co., 257 Pa. 118, 124; Haggerty v. Phila. Rapid Transit Co., 244 Pa. 107.\nNo contributing efficient cause having intervened to interrupt the sequence of events which were set in motion by the railroad company\u2019s failure to maintain control of its instrumentalities, the jury was warranted in finding defendant\u2019s negligence to be the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury: Gudfelder v. Pittsburgh, etc., Ry., 207 Pa. 629, 633, et seq.; Chambers v. Carroll, 199 Pa. 371, 374.\nFor the reasons here given, the judgment for defendant is reversed and the record remitted to the court below with directions to enter judgment for plaintiff.",

McAdoo.\nNegligence \u2014 Bcdlroads\u2014Infmts-r-Nards\u2014Playing in yards\u2014 Sitting on freight cars \u2014 Notice \u2014 Burden of proof \u2014 Proximate cause \u2014 Sequence of events \u2014 No intervention of contributing cause \u2014Defendant in possession of instrumentalities \u2014 Presumption \u2014Admissions at trial \u2014 Case for jury.\n1. Where a railroad company permits its yards or tracks to be used as a playground for children, the corporation is required to operate its rolling stock with due care to avoid injuring such children, and the ordinary rule, as to the limited measure of duty owing to trespassers, is inapplicable.\n2. One fixed with a duty to regard the safety of children, is obliged reasonably to anticipate they will do the ordinary and natural things which may be looked for from them under the circumstances.\n3. In an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries to .a boy eight years old, injured while on a freight car standing with others, in an open railroad yard of defendant, the case is for the jury, where the evidence tends to show that the yard in question was triangular in form, with tracks on two sides of the triangle, and an open space in the centre; that this space had been very frequently used for years, without objection by defendants, as a playground by the boys in the neighborhood; that, on the day of the accident, the plaintiff and fifteen other boys had for at least three quarters of an hour before the accident been seated on the freight cars, looking at a ball game, in full view of one of defendant\u2019s watchmen and others of its employees; that the cars in question, unattached to any motor power, were stationed at the place where defendant \u201cput cars that stand for some time\u201d; that the boys had been \u201cplaying\u201d on or around the cars for \u201cover three months\u201d; that they had been on top of them \u201ca couple of times,\u201d and the watchman was in view \u201cevery day\u201d they played around or sat on top of them; that the accident was caused by a runaway engine which collided with a train coming from the opposite direction, thus upsetting itself, or the locomotive of the train; that, as a result, the freight cars on the adjoining track on which plaintiff was seated, were struck in the rear, and plaintiff was injured by being caught between two of them; and it was admitted by defendant\u2019s counsel at the trial that the engineer, of the running engine, lost control of the mechanism in such a way that the brakes would not work, as a result of which the engine gained speed just prior to the accident, and \u201cboth the engineer and fireman jumped to save their lives.\u201d\n4. In such a case, when counsel for defendant undertook to admit the circumstances which gave rise to and attended the runaway engine, knowledge peculiarily within the possession of the defendant, and failed to state facts which would relieve his client from the implication of negligence put upon it by those already proved or admitted, it was for the jury to say whether, on the evidence and admission, defendant was guilty of negligence in the premises.\n5. Where a thing is shown to be under the management of defendant and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if proper care is used, the burden is on defendant to prove that the accident did not arise from want of care.\n6. As no contributing cause intervened to interrupt the sequence of events, which were set in motion by the railroad company\u2019s failure to maintain control of its instrumentalities, the jury was warranted in finding defendant\u2019s negligence to be the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury.\nArgued January 7, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 31, Jan. T., 1920, by plaintiff, Stanley Gawronski, from judgment of O. P. No. 4, Phila. Go., March T., 1918, No. 4016, for defendant n. o. v., in case of Stanley Gawronski, by his next friend and father, Antonio Gawronski, and Antonio Gawronski, in his own right, v. William G. McAdoo, Director General of Railroads.\nBefore Mosohzisker, Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nReversed.\nTrespass for personal injuries to a boy eight years old. Before Finletter, J.\nVerdict for plaintiff, Stanley Gawronski, for $3,750, and, as to his father, for defendant.\nThe court entered judgment as to Stanley Gawronski, for defendant n. o. v. Plaintiff, Stanley Gawronski, appealed.\nError assigned was entry of judgment for defendant n. o. v.\nAbraham Werniele, with him I. G. Gordon Forster and Rowland G. Evans, for appellant.\nThere can be no doubt that under the evidence in this case defendant 'company owed plaintiff a duty to use ordinary care and whether such ordinary care was used was a question for the jury: Petrowski v. Phila. & Reading Ry., 263 Pa. 531; Toner v. Penna. R. R., 263 Pa. 438; Francis v. B. & O. R. R., 247 Pa. 425; Counizzarri v. Phila. & Reading Ry., 248 Pa. 474; Piepke v. Reading Ry., 242 Pa. 326; Kilpatrick v. Phila. & Reading Ry., 55 Pa. Superior Ct. 399.\nThe very fact that children played ball there for over 15 years was sufficient to put defendant on notice that the same children would be tempted to climb on standing cars and be seated there to watch the ball games: Kreiner v. Straubmuller, 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 609; Kilpatrick v. Phila. & Reading Ry., 55 Pa. Superior Ct. 399.\nWm. Clarke Mason, for appellee.\nThe burden being on plaintiff to prove negligence and there being no evidence except proof of the accident, there is no foundation to support a verdict against defendant, and therefore the judgment of the court below is clearly correct: Crary v. Lehigh Val. R. R., 203 Pa. 525; Ackerman v. Union Traction Co., 205 Pa. 477.\nThe evidence justifies the conclusion that there was no negligence and therefore even though plaintiff had a status different from that of a trespasser he could not recover. The facts, however, show that he was clearly entitled to no greater protection than a trespasser. There is no evidence in this case that his injury resulted from any wanton disregard of his position and until this was proved he was not entitled to have his case submitted to the jury: Weatherbee v. P., B. & W. R. R., 214 Pa. 12; Schleich v. B. & O. R. R., 245 Pa. 184; DiMeglio v. P. & R. Ry., 249 Pa. 319; McGinnis v. Peoples Bros., 249 Pa. 335; Osborne v. P. & R. Ry., 263 Pa. 472.\nMarch 1, 1920:"
