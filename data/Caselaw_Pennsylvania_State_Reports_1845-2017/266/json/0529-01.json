Cohabitation and reputation are circumstances from which marriage may be presumed, but such presumption may always he rebutted, and will wholly disappear in the face of proof that no marriage in fact had taken place.\n2. A claim of a woman for the statutory interest of a widow in the estate of a decedent, will not be allowed where she testifies that the decedent asked her to get married, but that she declined, and she admits that her relations with the decedent were illicit at their inception, and continued so until his death. Under such circumstances no consideration can be given to her claim, founded solely upon cohabitation and reputation.\nArgued February 9, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 27, Jan. T., 1920, by Anna Bisbing, from decree of O. C. Chester Co., Dec. T., 1918, No. 27, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in estate of Eugene Bisbing.\nBefore Brown, C.

Before Hause, J.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the case.\nThe court dismissed the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report.

Anna Bisbing, the claimant, appealed.\nError assigned was decree dismissing exceptions.\nHugh Roberts, for appellant,\ncited: Knecht v. Knecht, 261 Pa. 410; Richard v.
