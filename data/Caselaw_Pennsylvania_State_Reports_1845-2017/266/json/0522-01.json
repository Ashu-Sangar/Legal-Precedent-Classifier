Where a devise or bequest is made to a life tenant, and at his death to the surviving children of the testator, the word \u201csurviving,\u201d or its equivalent \u201cliving,\u201d is to be construed as meaning surviving at the death of the testator, unless there is something in the will to indicate that the testator contemplates the continued existence of the remaindermen after his death.\n2. Where a testator, with a son and three daughters living at the date of his will and at the date of his death, devises to his son his real estate during life, \u201cand at his death to be divided equally between my living daughters, and should my son get married and die before his wife, then his widow shall share equally with my living daughters in said real estate,\u201d and after testator\u2019s death a daughter dies without issue, leaving a husband surviving, and thereafter a second daughter dies intestate, leaving a son and daughter and a husband surviving, and afterwards the son dies unmarried, intestate and without issue, the two children of the deceased daughter are entitled to an undivided half of the real estate, inasmuch as it was the intention of the testator to give a share in his lands, subject to a life estate in his son, to his daughters who should survive him.\n3. In such a case, the fact that two of the daughters of the testator died leaving husbands still living, has no effect upon the rights of the children of the deceased daughter, for the reason that these husbands are not entitled to any estate by the curtesy upon a reversion or remainder in their wives, expectant upon an estate of freehold which was not ended during the coverture.\nArgued February 2, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 9, Oct. T., 1920, by defendant, from order of O. P. Allegheny Co., July T., 1918, No. 1158, entering judgment for plaintiffs on the pleadings in case of Anna M. Kohl , and W. E. Harrison, heirs of Elizabeth A. Harrison, deceased, v. George W. Kepler.\nBefore Brown, O. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for an undivided half interest in land in Mifflin Township.\nRule for judgment on the pleadings. Before Shaper, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that Thomas Gibson died on April 21, 1899, leaving to survive him four children, Thomas Gibson, Jr., Susan B. Carothers, Elizabeth Harrison and Alice McDaniel.\nAlice McDaniel died November 30, 1909, without issue, and leaving to survive her, a husband, Noble McDaniel.\nElizabeth Harrison, died intestate September 9, 1913, leaving to survive her, a husband, W. J. Harrison, a son, Wm. E. Harrison, and a daughter, Anna Kohl.\nThe life tenant, Thomas Gibson, Jr., died April 20, 1915, and left to survive him one sister, Susan Carothers, and Wm. E. Harrison and Anna Kohl, children of his deceased sister.\nOther facts appear by the opinion of Shaper, P. J., which was as follows:\n\u25a0The action is ejectment and the facts are not in any respect in dispute. The claim of the plaintiffs is founded upon the will of Thomas Gibson, Sr., which provides-as follows: \u201cI devise to my son Thomas Gibson, Jr., all my real estate during -his life, and at his death to be divided equally between my living daughters; and should my son Thomas get married and die before his wife, then his widow shall share equally with my living daughters in said real estate.\u201d\nThe testator had, at the time of his death, besides his son Thomas Gibson, Jr., three, daughters, Alice, Elizabeth and Susan. Elizabeth died in 1913, intestate, leaving a daughter,. Anna M. Kohl, and a son, William E. Harrison, who are the plaintiffs herein, and leaving also a husband who is still living. Thomas Gibson, Jr., died in 1915, unmarried, intestate and without issue. The daughter Susan, now intermarried with Herbert B. Carothers, is still living and at the death of her brother Thomas Gibson, Jr., appears to have taken possession of the property and thereafter conveyed the same to the defendant, George W. Kepler, who is now in possession.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 contention is that their mother, Elizabeth Harrison, had an undivided half of the real estate in question, subject to a life estate in Thomas, which descended to them upon the death of their mother.\nThe whole case turns upon the meaning to be given to the expression \u201cliving daughters.\u201d If this means daughters living at the death of the testator, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover; if it means daughters, living at the death of Thomas Gibson, Jr., the life tenant, they are not entitled to recover.\nThe rule is well settled in Pennsylvania that where a devise or bequest is made to a life tenant and at his death to the surviving children of the testator, the word \u201csurviving\u201d or its equivalent, in this case \u201cliving,\u201d is to be construed as meaning surviving at the death of the .testator, unless there is something in the will to indicate that the testator contemplates the continued existence of the remaindermen after his death: Stoner v. Wunderlich, 198 Pa. 158; Shallcross\u2019s Est., 200 Pa. 122;\nWe are unable to find anything in the will of Thomas Gibson, Sr., to indicate that he did not intend to give a share in his land to his daughters who should survive him.\nThe fact that two of the daughters of the testator died leaving husbands who are still living, has no effect upon the right of the plaintiffs in this case to recover, for the reason that these husbands are not entitled to any estate by the curtesy upon a reversion or remainder in their wives expectant upon an estate of freehold which is not ended during the coverture.\nWe are therefore of opinion that under the will of Thomas Gibson, Sr., his daughter Elizabeth, at his death, took a vested interest in common with her sisters in the lands of the testator, subject to open and let in the widow of Thomas Gibson, Jr., if he should leave one, which interest descended to her son and daughter, the plaintiffs herein, and that therefore the plaintiffs are entitled to recover an undivided half of the land described in the writ.\nIt is therefore ordered that judgment be entered for the plaintiffs and against the defendant for the one undivided half of the lands described in the writ, with six cents damages and costs.\nGeorge W. Kepler, vendee of Susan B. Carothers, appealed.\nError assigned was order entering judgment for plaintiff.\nE. E.
