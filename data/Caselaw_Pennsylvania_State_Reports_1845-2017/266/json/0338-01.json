        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nPlaintiff filed a bill for partition of real estate and prayed an accounting of rents alleged to have been collected by one of the defendants.\nThe case first involves the construction of a will, the question being whether Harry A. Burkley, a son, who survived his father, the testator, but predeceased his mother, the life tenant, took a vested fee simple in certain realty, or only a life estate.,\nJohn Peter Burkley, the testator, had a wife and four children, for whom he provided in his will by giving to Catharine Burkley, his wife, an estate for life or during widowhood, stipulating that, \u201cupon\u201d her death or remarriage, \u201csaid estate shall fall and vest in my children or their descendents absolutely and in fee.\u201d\nWe think that the word \u201cor,\u201d which follows \u201cchildren\u201d and precedes \u201ctheir descendents,\u201d is used in the conjunctive (see Bair\u2019s Est., 255 Pa. 169, 173), and that it is apparent testator did not intend by \u201cdescendents\u201d to designate a certain set of persons to take directly from him at a given time, but used the word in the descriptive sense of \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d or \u201cissue,\u201d of his children; all of this is suggested by the writing itself, when viewed in the light of relevant rules of interpretation, and- is indicated by the next paragraph of the will, wherein testator provides for the event of his death \u201cwithout leaving issue.\u201d\nThe will is by a husband and father, providing for wife and children \u2014 the natural objects of his bounty; and we see no indications therein of a desire to- make any distinction between the latter. The determination of the wife\u2019s life estate does not depend upon an uncertain event, and the remainder in the children is limited to ascertained persons in esse, it being \u201ccertain to take effect in possession by enduring longer than the precedent estate.\u201d Under these circumstances, notwithstanding Harry A. Burkley did not live to enjoy possession of his remainder, it was vested, not contingent: Bair\u2019s Est., supra.\nIn the words of Judge Wessel of the court below: \u201cIt is true the children are not to have the immediate enjoyment of the estate, that being deferred until the determination of the widow\u2019s interest,......but the time when it is to be enjoyed by the children depends upon a date certain to arrive, to wit, the widow\u2019s death, with a possible acceleration by a remarriage. While testator did say that, \u2018upon the death or marriage of my said wife, the estate shall fall and vest in my children,\u2019 [it is plain from the will as a whole that] those words do not refer to the persons who should, at the widow\u2019s death, become possessed of his estate, but to the time when his children should be entitled to [enjoy] possession thereof.\u201d We agree with the court below that Harry A. Burkley died possessed of a vested estate in fee.\nThe next question involved is put by plaintiff (appellant here) thus: \u201cIs it proper practice for the court to enter a decree directing partition of real estate and appointing a master for that purpose, without first directing an accounting of rents collected, and entering a decree adjusting the equities in the balance due thereon, where the bill for partition alleges the collection of rents by a defendant and prays for an accounting thereof?\u201d\nThe proposition just stated must be answered in the negative. The learned court' below therefore erred in refusing to find as facts, alleged in the bill and not denied by the answer, that Louis F. Burldey had collected and failed to distribute rents of the real estate about to be partitioned; it further erred in not ordering an accounting of such rents: Dunshee v. Dunshee, 234 Pa. 550, 556.\nThe chancellor should have had an account before him, and fixed the amount of defendant\u2019s indebtedness to his cotenants (Act of June 24,1895, P. L. 237), before entering the decree for partition (Dunshee v. Dunshee, supra); but, this not having been done, when the present record is returned, the court below must set the case for rehearing and, after finding the necessary facts, enter a decree in accordance therewith, so as to adjust the question of the rents between the parties, for the guidance of the master in making his final distribution, \u2014 unless those in interest agree, under Equity Buie 69, that the same person who has been appointed master shall act as referee to pass on the account and distribute the balance found to be due.\nThe two assignments of error which complain of the trial judge\u2019s failure to order an accounting, ar\u00e9 sustained ; and, to this extent, the decree is reversed; otherwise it is affirmed. The record is remitted with a procedendo, the court below to act in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion; costs to be paid out of the fund for distribution.",

The estate of a remainderman who dies dining the life tenancy, is vested and not contingent under a will of a testator leaving a wife and four children for whom he provided by giving to his wife certain real estate for life, or during widowhood, and stipulating that, \u201cupon\u201d her death or remarriage, \u201csaid estate shall fall and vest in my children or their descendents absolutely and in fee.\u201d\n2.

The determination of the wife\u2019s life estate does not depend upon an uncertain event, and the remainder in the children is limited to ascertained persons in esse, it being certain to take effect in possession by enduring longer than the precedent estate.

Where a bill for partition alleges the collection of rents by the defendant and prays for an accounting thereof, the court should direct the accounting of rents collected and fix the amount of defendant\u2019s indebtedness to his cotenants, before entering a decree for partition.\n5. In such a case where the court entered a decree, directing partition of real estate without first directing an accounting for rents collected and without fixing the amount due the cotenants, the Supreme Court directed the lower court to set the case for rehearing and, after finding the necessary facts, enter a decree so as to adjust the question of rents between the parties for guidance of the master in making final distribution, unless the parties in interest agree, under Equity Rule 69, that the master appointed to make partition shall act as referee to pass on the account and distribute the balance found to be due.\nSubmitted January 13, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 160, Jan.
