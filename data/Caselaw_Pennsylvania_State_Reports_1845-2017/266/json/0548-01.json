J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from appraisement of lands situate in West Virginia, made for the purpose of assessing the direct inheritance tax thereon. Before Whitehead, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the properties in question were certain oil and gas leases owned by the decedent.\nThe material portions of the leases were as follows:\nThe said parties of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar to them in hand well and truly paid by the said party of the second part,...... have granted, demised, leased and let, and by these presents do grant, demise, lease and let unto the said party of the second part, its successors or assigns, for the sole and only purpose of mining and operating for oil and gas, and of laying pipe lines, and of building tanks, stations and structures thereon, to take care of the said products, all that certain tract of land,......Containing one hundred (100) acres, more or less.......\nIt is agreed that this lease shall remain in force for the term of ten years from this date, and as much longer as the rent for failure to commence operations is paid, and as long after the- commencement of operations as said premises are operated for the production of oil or gas.\nIn consideration of the premises the said party of the second part covenants and agrees:' 1st \u2014 To deliver in the pipe lines to the credit of the first parties, their heirs or assigns, free of cost, the equal one-eighth part of all oil produced and saved from the leased premises; and 2d \u2014 to pay |300 dollars per year for the gas from each and every gas well drilled on said premises, the product from which is marketed and used off the premises.\nThe court held that the leases conveyed interests in lands situated in West Virginia, and were not taxable in Pennsylvania. The appeal of the Commonwealth was accordingly dismissed. The Commonwealth appealed.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nWilliam M. Hargest, Deputy Attorney General, with. him A. M. Eoagland, W. E. Spencer and William I. Schafer, Attorney General, for appellant.\nS. T. McCormick, of McCormick & Hippie, for appellee.\nMarch 8, 1920:"
