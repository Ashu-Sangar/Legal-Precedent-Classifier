The path was covered with snow, and the plaintiff testified that after she had fallen she discovex*ed ridges of ice beneath the snow, which caused her to fall. How long the ice had been there did not appear from the testimony, and there was nothing to show that the city had either actual or constructive notice of the icy condition of the path. The verdict for the defendant having been properly directed, the judgment on it is affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed.",

City of Philadelphia.\nNegligence \u2014 Municipality\u2014Icy sidewalk \u2014 Constructive notice\u2014 Evidence \u2014 Records of weather bureau \u2014 Ordinance.\n1. A verdict is properly directed for defendant in an action against a city to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff by a fall on an icy sidewalk covered with snow, where it did not appear how long the ice had been there, nor that the city had either actual or constructive notice of the icy condition of the path.\n2. The records of the weather bureau and a city ordinance providing a penalty for permitting ice to remain on paved footways, offered in evidence in this case, held not sufficient to prove constructive notice of the condition of the path.\nArgued January 16, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 119, Jan. T., 1920, by plaintiff, from judgment of O. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1917, No. 2682, on verdict directed for defendant in the case of Mary V. Roop v. City of Philadelphia.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff due to a fall on the icy sidewalk. Before Shoemaker, J.\nTo show constructive notice of the condition of the path the records of the United States weather bureau at Philadelphia were given in evidence.

Temperature March 16th and 17th,, highest 29, lowest 16. The accident occurred about noon on March 18, 1916. Plaintiff also placed in evidence an. ordinance of the city providing a penalty to \u201cpermit snow to remain more than six working hours after the same may cease to fall on any paved footway,\u201d etc.\nThe further facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nAfter the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the court gave binding instructions to find a verdict for defendant. The court refused a new trial and entered judgment on the verdict. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was directing a verdict for defendant.\nBertram K.
