    "head_matter": "Holland v. Kaufman Department Stores, Inc., Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Excessive verdict \u2014 New trial \u2014 Abuse of discretion \u2014Practice, Appellate Qourt.\nThe appellate court will not reverse a judgment on a verdict on -the ground that the verdict was excessive, unless it is made to appear that the court below was guilty of abuse of discretion.\nArgued October 17, 1919.\nAppeal, No. 95, Oct. T., 1919, by defendant, from judgment of O. P. Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1918, No. 2213, on verdict for plaintiff in case of George Fay Holland, a minor, by his next friend and grandfather, John J. Holland, v. Kaufman Department Stores, Inc.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Shaper, J.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $5,000.\nOn a motion for a new trial Shaper, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe action was by a minor, who came of age before the trial of the case, for injuries sustained by being struck by a wagon belonging to, and driven by a servant of, the defendant. Liability was conceded and the only question in the case was the extent of the injuries of the plaintiff, and the damage sustained by him. The verdict was for $5,000 and the defendant\u2019s principal reason for asking a new trial is that this verdict was excessive and against the weight of the evidence. If the medical testimony on the part of the plaintiff was believed by the jury they were fully justified in finding a verdict for this amount, and we are unable to say that the jury should not have believed it. . The motion is therefore refused.\nDefendant appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing new trial.\nGeorge O. Bradshaw and Charles F. Patterson, for appellant.\n3. Fred Mercer, for appellee, was not heard.\nJanuary 5, 1920 :"
