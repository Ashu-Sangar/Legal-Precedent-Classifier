On appeal to the court below and here the complaint of the appellant is that the evidence did not justify that finding. It is sufficient to say that the evidence is not before us, and the finding of the board under the statute is conclusive: Poluskiewicz v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, 257 Pa. 305.\nAppeal dismissed and award affirmed.",
