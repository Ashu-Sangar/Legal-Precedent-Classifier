Appellant solicited Joseph Stenger and two other unidentified men to retaliate. The four made a stop to retrieve weapons (a baseball bat and a crow bar), then drove to Haith’s home. While the two unidentified men hid near the door, appellant lured Haith outside; the two men beat him with the weapons, while appellant repeatedly kicked him and bit his right hand. Stenger got out of the vehicle and shot Haith in the face; the bullet entered his left cheek, exited near his mouth, and produced only superficial wounds. Haith died the following day from the head trauma sustained during the attack.</p>
    <p id="b113-8" data-blocks='[["BL_113.7",113,[128,1281,1154,409]]]'>Police interviewed appellant later that day, at which time she handed over the mud and blood-splattered clothing she was wearing during the attack. Appellant was not arrested until 2004, after she confessed to her ex-boyfriend that she participated in the attack on Haith. Forensic evidence indicated the mud on appellant’s clothing was consistent with soil samples from the crime scene, and her dental molds matched the bite mark on Haith’s hand.</p>
    <p id="b113-9" data-blocks='[["BL_113.8",113,[129,1726,1155,526]]]'>Appellant was charged with criminal homicide and conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, plus assault charges. A jury found appellant guilty of third degree murder and conspiracy to commit criminal homicide. Notably, the criminal homicide verdict slip provided the option of finding appellant guilty of first degree murder, third degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty; the jury indicated third degree murder. The conspiracy verdict slip read “Criminal Conspiracy-Criminal Homicide,” and the jury wrote the word “Guilty” below the charge, which provided no gradation options.</p>

Sentencing Hearing, 4/19/06, at 4. The original sentencing orders perpetuated the error; listed at improper docket numbers, these orders identified the convictions as “Criminal Homicide Murder 3rd Degree (F-l),” and “Criminal Conspiracy Murder 3rd Degree (F-l).” Sentencing Orders at No. 1496 of 2004, 4/18/06, &amp; No. 1496-1/4 of 2004, 4/19/06.

Both the original and amended orders set forth the same sentence: 12 and one-half to 25 years imprisonment for the murder conviction, and a consecutive two and one-half to five years imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction.</p>

For example, a conspiracy to destroy an inhabited dwelling, without a specific intent or purpose to kill its occupants, would not constitute a conspiracy to commit homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 408. Thus, of relevance in the instant case, in order to convict a defendant of conspiracy to commit third-degree murder, the Commonwealth would have to prove that the defendant, with the intent of promoting or facilitating third-degree murder, agreed with another person that one or both of them would engage in conduct which constitutes third-degree murder, or engage in an attempt or solicitation to commit third-degree murder. As previously noted, however, the essence of third-degree murder is a homicide that occurs <em>in the absence of a specific intent to kill. </em>Thus, to be guilty of conspiracy to commit third-degree murder, an individual would have to intend to commit an unintentional killing, a logical impossibility-</p>
