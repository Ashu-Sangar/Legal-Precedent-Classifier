Minutes later, two others joined him, hereinafter, “Second Man” and “Third Man.” All three were Asian men dressed in green military jackets. Upon being seated at a booth, the men drew the attention of the restaurant’s customers and employees due to their loud and abusive behavior toward their waiter, Phong Ngo.

When Jade Wong followed him and demanded that they leave the restaurant, Second Man, later identified as Appellant Cam Ly (hereinafter “Second Man” or Appellant), and one of the other men placed their guns at the backs of Jade and Phong. The men corralled Jade and Phong into the kitchen, where Jade’s sister, Janice Wong, had been watching the entire confrontation and was in the process of calling the police, without success. As Janice attempted to escape and seek help through the kitchen’s side door, the three men pursued her. Eventually, Second Man grabbed her arm and turned her to face him at the well-lit street corner, allowing her ample time to view his face.</p>

Phong testified that he did not see the shooting but turned to see an arm in a green jacket, with gun in hand, going out the side door. Like Phong, Janice did not witness the actual shooting. When it occurred, however, Janice immediately ran to her sister, called police, and told Phong to lock all the doors of the restaurant.</p>

The evidence led them to investigate Chinese gang activity up and down the East Coast, in particular focusing on members of the New York City based “Flying Dragons.” After viewing hundreds of photographs in both New York and Philadelphia without identifying any of the assailants, Janice Wong identified a photograph of Ah Thank Lee, on September 8,1983, as the First Man.</p>

Janice Wong identified Appellant’s photograph out of an array as the Second Man, the individual who grabbed her in the street and who shot her sister Jade. On the same day, however, officers showed Janice a single photograph of another individual, whom she identified as playing the role of First Man. The individual depicted, however, was Wong Kin Fung, and not Ah Thank Lee whom she had identified as First Man in 1983. Wong Kin Fung was known by the nickname Kwa Jai, which translates to “Bad Boy.” As is relevant to Appellant’s issues, the names Wong Kin Fung, Kwa Jai, and Bad Boy repeatedly appear in the documents obtained by Philadelphia detectives during their investigations. A central dispute in the current appeal concerns whether Janice Wong’s conflicting identifications of Ah Thank Lee and Wong Kin Fung/Kwa Jai as First Man were disclosed to the defense before trial, and, if not, whether the failure to disclose the conflicting identifications and the other documents referencing Wong Kin Fung/Kwa Jai affected Appellant’s ability to formulate a defense.</p>

The statement has exculpatory value that could have led to an alternative defense theory of the case given that counsel could have attempted to develop a defense based on Wing Tsang’s assertion that he and another Flying Dragons leader named Kwa Jai as the shooter, thus potentially clearing Appellant of direct liability for the murder. This theory, however, conveniently ignores the first half of the statement that indicates that Appellant confessed to Wing Tsang in great detail regarding his role as the shooter. Accordingly, the Commonwealth argues that the statement of Wing Tsang was not exculpatory, but instead, as initially noted by defense trial counsel, devastating to Appellant’s case. Regardless of when the statement was revealed, we agree with the Commonwealth that the statement, as a whole, was not exculpatory, and therefore does not trigger the protections of <em>Brady.</em>

Critical to Appellant’s argument is the lack of direct evidence establishing which of the three men involved in this case shot Jade Wong. Appellant argues that Janice Wong heard the gunshot, saw him exiting the restaurant from the vicinity where she heard the shot, but did not see who actually fired the killing shot. N.T.(Jury), 1/26/88, at 66. Similarly, Phong Ngo identified Appellant as one of the two men who had guns earlier in the encounter and testified that he saw an arm covered in a green military jacket, holding a gun, but could not shed any additional light on who killed Jade Wong. N.T.(Jury), 1/27/88, at 21. Given that all three men were wearing similar jackets, Appellant asserts that the shooter could have been any of the three men, or at least, either of the two with guns. Appellant argues that the lack of an eyewitness to the killing makes the credibility of Janice Wong’s testimony crucial.

While the PCRA court concluded that the issue was previously litigated, we reject this conclusion. On direct review, this Court considered whether “trial counsel failed to request an instruction clearly indicating that the Commonwealth had the burden to prove malice and intent to kill beyond a reasonable doubt because without such a charge, the burden shifted to appellant to disprove malice or intent to kill.” <em>Ly, </em><a href="/pa/528/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="528 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1829793" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0523-01">599 A.2d at 619</a>.

Appellant offers two justifications for review. First, Appellant claims that the doctrine of relaxed waiver that existed for capital cases at the time of his trial and when he filed his first PCRA petition should be applied to his case and allow him to revive claims that otherwise would be deemed waived. <em>See Commonwealth v.

He argues that the language used in this case is similar to that given by the same trial court judge in <em>Commonwealth v.

The court in <em>Bronshtein </em>concluded that the jury could have concluded that the conspiracy charge provided a separate avenue for conviction that did not require demonstration of the defendant’s specific intent to kill. However, the court did not grant a new trial because the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to murder, which also required a finding of the defendant’s specific intent to kill. Appellant distinguishes <em>Bronshtein </em>by noting that in this case Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery, not murder, which did not involve the element of specific intent to kill.</p>

Appellant invokes the doctrine with respect to some of the record-based claims of error which he did not challenge on direct appeal. <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>Appellant contends that, “under the relaxed waiver doctrine that was in effect at the time of [appellant’s] direct appeal (and when he filed his PCRA petition), this Court would have been ‘obliged’ to review claims not raised below on their merits.” Appellant’s Brief at 44.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Appellant maintains that, “because he was entitled to raise [these claims] in his direct appeal, he is entitled to raise [them] now as if on direct appeal.” <em><a href="/us/548/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="548 U.S. 331" data-case-ids="3500432" data-case-paths="/us/548/0331-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis omitted). Not to afford direct relaxed waiver review now, appellant says, violates the due process rights of those who “relied” upon the doctrine.

    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[300,971,1157,567]]]'>The obvious initial response to appellant’s argument is that he is not presently on direct appeal to this Court. Whatever appellant may have been “entitled” to demand on that direct appeal has long since passed; to the extent appellant failed to raise claims, including waived claims of trial error invoked under relaxed waiver, he has defaulted the claims here. Defaulted claims from direct review are cognizable only to the extent they are permitted under the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546, which, as appellant recognizes, in this instance, requires him to prove layered claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>

The Majority dismisses appellant’s relaxed waiver argument because “[ajppellant fails to acknowledge that even when the relaxed waiver rule applied, it was a discretionary rule that did not mandate this Court’s review of waived issues.” Majority Op. at 311, 980 A.2d at 86; <em>see also id. </em>at <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>319-20 n. 34, 980 A.2d at 91-92 n. 34 (“[E]ven if the relaxed waiver rule applied to these claims, the rule never provided a guarantee that this Court would hear the otherwise waived issue, but only that we had the discretion to hear it.”). The Majority is correct. I would add, however, that the discretionary nature of relaxed waiver review eviscerates appellant’s current claims that he is “entitled” to relaxed waiver review now and that he “relied” upon the doctrine in defaulting his claims at trial and on direct appeal. Appellant could not have justifiably “relied” upon the doctrine with respect to waived claims heretofore. <em>See Commonwealth v. Duffey, </em><a href="/pa/585/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="172" data-cite="585 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="2472195" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0493-01">585 Pa. 493</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="889 A.2d 56" data-case-ids="2472195,8991745" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0493-01,/a2d/889/0056-01">889 A.2d 56</a>, 64 (2005) (“[TJhis [Cjourt’s relaxed waiver doctrine was discretionary, and thus, there was no guarantee that we would have analyzed [issues] under the relaxed waiver doctrine.... Accordingly, any reliance on this [C]ourt’s relaxed waiver doctrine is unavailing.”). Furthermore, it defies logic that a defense counsel would deliberately fail to raise a claim on direct appeal, thereby guilefully manipulating the appellate process, in “reliance” on the prospect of delayed, collateral review premised upon a discretionary doctrine. And, most importantly, there has been no proffer or proof that appellant in fact “relied” upon the doctrine in defaulting claims on direct appeal; indeed, it is highly unlikely that any defense counsel could with any candor forward such a claim.</p>

However, it also appears that, inarticulate as the claim is, appellant intends a stand-alone, albeit near-boilerplate argument that appellate counsel independently was ineffective for failing to press <em>Mills </em>because the decision was rendered before his direct appeal was briefed and decided, and, he thinks, all changes in the law effected by decisions of the High Court “will be given effect while a case is on direct review.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 69 (citation omitted).</p>
