The question in essence is whether this Court should adopt an “issue-by-issue application” of Rule 313, or whether, once the collateral order test is satisfied with respect to one issue, an appellate court has jurisdiction to consider every issue within the ambit of the appealed order — that is, whether to adopt a “whole order approach” to Rule 313. For the reasons which follow, we adopt an issue-by-issue application of Rule 313. Accordingly, we vacate the determination of the Commonwealth Court quashing the depositions of Appellees Monty J. Batson, Esquire, Shawn E. Smith, Esquire, and Larry Hall (collectively “Deponents”), and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b146-7" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[295,1408,1154,642]]]'>The background of this case is as follows: Appellants Robert Rae and Commonwealth Funeral Consultants, Inc. operated a business selling insurance for funeral expenses to consumers, which was investigated by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs (“the Bureau”). The investigation commenced after a complaint filed by the Pennsylvania Funeral Directors Association (“the Association”) in 2000. Initially, the Bureau assigned Appellee Monty J. Bat-son to the investigation. After five years of unexplained inactivity, the file was closed and then reopened.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At that time, Deponents Smith and Hall were assigned to the investigation.</p>

      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>In the interim, Appellants commenced the present civil suit against the Association for defamation, tortious interference with contractual relationships, and tortious interference with potential contractual relationships, alleging the Association told consumers Appellants were engaged in illegal activity and that they consequently lost business. Appellants filed subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>upon Smith and Hall, seeking to depose them and directing that they produce the file of the Bureau’s investigation into Appellants at the time of their deposition. The Bureau initially sought to quash the subpoenas. However, after briefing, argument, and the trial court’s <em>in camera </em>review of the file, the Bureau voluntarily produced the file. Deponents then moved to quash the subpoenas as related to their depositions only, and the Bureau moved to treat the file as confidential. After a subsequent status conference, the trial court denied Deponents’ motion to quash and scheduled the depositions, though specifying that proceedings would be conducted <em>in camera </em>and barring any party from disclosing any information which might arise during the discovery process to any non-party without the express permission of the court. Trial Ct. Order, 8/24/06. Deponents appealed to the Commonwealth Court, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that their testimony was (1) precluded by the deliberative process privilege, and (2) irrelevant to Appellants’ cause of action. Appellants moved to quash the appeal as interlocutory, challenging whether the order in question was an appealable collateral order.</p>

The court restated the well-established test for collateral review laid out in <em>Ben, supra, </em>and Pa.R.A.P. 313: collateral review is appropriate, despite the general directive that appellate courts conduct review only of final orders, if an order is (1) separable from and collateral to the main cause of action, (2) implicates rights which are too important to be denied review, and (3) the appellant’s claim as to that order will be lost if postponed until <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>final judgment. The court reasoned the order in question was a collateral order, since it was collateral to the defamation suit, involved the important issue of the deliberative process privilege, and would be mooted if review was postponed until final judgment because the privileged depositions would already have been conducted. On that basis, the court denied Appellants’ motion to quash.</p>

While we grant that the cases are not factually identical, <em>Swint </em>and <em>Abney </em>are grounded in the Court's explicit aversion to permitting parties to “parlay <em>Cohen-type </em>collateral orders into multi-issue interlocutory appeal tickets,” not in their particular facts. <em>Swint, </em><a href="/us/514/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="514 U.S. 35" data-case-ids="1340371" data-case-paths="/us/514/0035-01">514 U.S. at 49-50</a>, <a href="/us/514/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="514 U.S. 35" data-case-ids="1340371" data-case-paths="/us/514/0035-01">115 S.Ct. 1203</a>.
