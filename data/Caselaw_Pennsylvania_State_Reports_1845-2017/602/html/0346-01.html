    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[130,1280,1154,1085]]]'>Appellant argues this is a professional negligence case because it was required to research and identify applicable records, plot the course of the water line, and determine the necessity of an easement from Merlini, or use an existing PennDOT right-of-way already on Merlini’s property; thus, because the water line design and installation is governed by professional standards, it is beyond common knowledge and experience. Appellant also asserts the Superior Court erred because its decision was not in accord with <em>Varner, </em>which held the difference between a claim of ordinary negligence and professional negligence requires determining whether expert testimony is necessary for elucidation of the issue. <em>See Varner, </em>at 1074-75. Further, appellant alleges that notwithstanding the Superior Court’s recognition of the need for expert testimony to interpret applicable state, county, and municipal records regarding property rights, it rendered a decision contrary to <em>Varner. </em>Appellant contends the Superior Court erred as a matter of law in concluding its professional services did not raise issues of professional judgment beyond the realm of common knowledge.</p>

      <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>Finally, appellant argues the Superior Court erred in failing to apply the plain language of the Engineer, Land Surveyor and Geologist Registration Law. Appellant states the Act defines the practice of land surveying as “the practice of that branch of profession of engineering which involves the location [or] relocation, ... of any property line or boundary of any parcel of land or any road right-of-way, easement or alignment.” Appellant’s Brief, at 17 (quoting 63 P.S. § 149(d)). Appellant further argues the Act defines professional engineer and engineering land surveys such that Merlini’s allegations against it clearly implicated professional, and not ordinary, judgment. Appellant contends because the Superior Court’s opinion indicated its duty required an understanding of the location of Merlini’s property and applicable right-of-way or easements, the knowledge was within the express purview of the engineering profession and is a branch of land surveying. Appellant asserts the Superior Court over-simplified the issue by stating, “Either a trespass occurred, or it did not.” <em>Id., </em>at 18 (quoting <em>Merlini, </em>at 106). Appellant argues a trespass only occurred if its professional judgment fell outside acceptable professional standards.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[297,1448,1154,681]]]'>Merlini asserts an ordinary negligence case exists here because appellant had the same duty as any other third party regarding her property — to not come onto her land without an easement. Appellant breached its duty by instructing Kukurin to lay the water lines without an easement, thereby limiting Merlini’s rights to use the surface above the lines, which resulted in a continuing trespass. Merlini contends appellant’s negligence was its failure to hire a surveyor to plot her property, and because appellant is not a surveyor, a professional with that expertise was required. Merlini asserts whether appellant trespassed is within the ordinary knowledge and experience of laypersons, and determination of such actions does not require expert testimony.</p>

      <em>Merlini </em>also asserts appellant’s reliance on <em>Varner </em>is misplaced because in <em>Varner </em>the plaintiffs cause of action was against an architect providing professional services in the construction of the plaintiffs townhouse, whereas here, appel<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>lant’s professional duties were to Gallitzin and Kukurin to oversee the water line installation; there was no professional duty owed to Merlini. Moreover, Merlini asserts appellant is an unincorporated association, which failed to register under the Professional Engineers Registration Law; therefore, it should not enjoy the protection of a licensed professional, which requires the filing of a certificate of merit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Here, Merlini’s petition was timely filed, and this is a meritorious cause of action, so the question remains whether there was a legitimate excuse for the inactivity — the failure to file a certificate of merit. In order to determine whether Merlini asserted a liability theory sounding in professional or ordinary negligence, we must look to the specific averments made in her complaint.

It further alleged Kukurin’s actions, while working under appellant’s direction, constituted <em>trespass </em>and <em>negligence. Id., </em>at ¶ 10 (emphasis added).

As the Superior Court found, appellant’s actions occurred while it performed professional services; however, the issue Merlini raised was not one of professional judgment beyond the scope of common knowledge and experience. Merlini asserted a claim of basic negligent trespass — this is not a breach of a duty owed by a professional, but a breach of a duty owed by any third party entering upon the property of another. As the Superior Court acknowledged, expert testimony may be required to clarify the property rights as established through state, county, and municipal records; however, once that factual issue is clarified, whether appellant trespassed will not require further expert elucidation. Therefore, the Superior Court did not err in its analysis and application of <em>Varner, </em>and we affirm its finding that Merlini did not assert a professional liability claim against appellant; thus, she was not required to file a certifícate of merit in conjunction with her complaint.</p>

The note following the rule indicates “[t]he new and amended rules shall apply to all pending actions in which a judgment of non pros for failure to file a certificate of merit has not been entered by the effective date.” Pa.R.C.P. 1042.1, Explanatory Comment — 2008. The trial court entered the order granting judgment of <em>non pros </em>in this case July 17, 2006; thus, the preamendment version of the rule applies. Despite appellant’s argument, as it relates to the Act’s language and its alleged use of professional judgment, we have determined Merlini’s complaint alleged ordinary negligence with regard to appellant’s trespass upon her property. Despite the need for a land survey, which may require expert testimony because appellant is not an association composed of licensed land surveyors, once the right-of-way location is determined, a jury of laypersons could easily determine, without further guidance, whether appellant actually committed the trespass alleged.</p>

The difficulty with this analysis is that Appellant is not alleged to have entered on the property of another, and thus, the action against Appellant is not one of “basic negligent trespass.” Rather, the critical averments of the complaint pertaining to the claim against Appellant are that:</p>

In my view, Appellees’ theory of liability on the part of Appellant, as a third party to the alleged trespass, necessarily entails an examination of Appellant’s professional services.

Furthermore, as Appellants argue, the Civil Procedural Rules require that a certificate of merit speak to both the relevant professional standards <em>and </em>causation, <em>see </em>Pa. R.Civ.P. No. 1042.3(a)(1), and I believe Appellants advance a substantial argument that the determination of causation (entailing, <em>inter alia, </em>the “clarification of] the property rights as established through state, county, and municipal records,” Majority Opinion, at 356, 980 A.2d at 507, as well as a review of Appellant’s project specifications) would implicate a certificate, assuming all other conditions were met.</p>
