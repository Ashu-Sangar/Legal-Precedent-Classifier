However, because of ongoing complaints of sometimes severe pain, as well as shortness of breath, Appellant received medical care for circulatory and respiratory problems over the course of the next thirty-six years. Appellant was diagnosed with thrombophlebitis and a pulmonary embolism on August 23, 1965; and on various occasions over the years, she was diagnosed as suffering from thrombosis, phlebitis, and/or pulmonary emboli. None of her treating physicians could determine the cause of these conditions until Appellant underwent an echocardiogram on December 30, 1999, which uncovered an echogenic abnormality. <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>Subsequent echocardiograms on January 19, 2000, and February 8, 2000, revealed the presence of a twelve- to eighteen-inch catheter, with a chronic appearance, coiled in the right atrium of her heart, passing into and through the right ventricle to the outflow tract.</p>

Appellant filed a third amended complaint on September 18, 2003, in which she alleged that the catheter observed in the echocardiogram was one of the ones used in the 1965 cutdowns. Specifically, Appellant alleged that the doctors had failed to 1) appropriately perform the cutdowns; 2) take appropriate steps to avoid leaving the catheter or a portion thereof in her body following the procedures; 3) recognize that the catheter or a portion thereof remained in her body; 4) properly evaluate and/or interpret her ongoing and deteriorating physical condition after the procedures; 5) order and obtain appropriate diagnostic studies when her condition continued to deteriorate; and 6) inform her of the risks of the cutdown procedures. Appellant also alleged that the Hospital was negligent in that it had failed to 1) use reasonable care to maintain safe and adequate facilities; 2) select and train competent physicians; 3) properly oversee the persons practicing medicine in its facility; 4) formulate, adopt or enforce rules with respect to the performance of cutdowns; 5) properly train doctors, nurses, and staff to detect signs indicating that a catheter still remains in the body; 6) train doctors, nurses, and staff to warn patients of the risks associated with a cutdown procedure; and 7) appropriately supervise its agents. In addition, she alleged that because the catheter in her heart has fragmented, it cannot be safely removed. For this reason, she alleged that her medical conditions would continue to adversely affect her into the future.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Dr. Padula’s discovery document included a request to explain, if Appellant denied having had any IV catheterizations during those hospitalizations, how medications had been administered and procedures accomplished without the use of catheters. Further, Dr. Padula requested that Appellant admit: “[Appellant] has no other information from any source that the foreign object in her body is a piece of IV catheter from her Chestnut Hill Hospital: May 12, 1965 — May 22, 1965 admission — the time period at question in this lawsuit — is not from one of the other catheters she has had placed in her medical history.” Request for Admission of Defendant, Richard T.

Her untimely response was apparently mailed to Dr. Padula’s counsel on or about May 10, 2004, approximately forty-seven days after the date the requests for admissions were served. Appellant’s unverified response denied that the catheter found in her heart came from any procedure except the May 1965 cut-downs. Appellant asserted that the only time during which she had had a catheter inserted into her, which had not been <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>removed, was during that hospital admission. She further asserted that her “treating physicians have related the catheter wire loss into her cardiovascular system to her admission at Chestnut Hill Hospital in August [sic] of 1965.” [Appellant’s] Response to the Request for Admission of Defendant, Richard T. Padula, M.D., dated April 12, 2004, No. 3, at 2. Moreover, Appellant generally denied having had the sixteen IV catheterizations identified in the request for admissions. Dr. Padula did not move to strike Appellant’s response.</p>

On July 14, 2004, the trial court entered separate orders granting the three summary judgment motions. After her motion for reconsideration was denied, Appellant filed a praecipe to discontinue her cause of action against the remaining defendants. The trial court issued a final order discontinuing the action as to all parties on October 1, 2004, and Appellant filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court.</p>

Reiffel, M.D., and Nicholas L. DePace, M.D. As noted by the trial court, Dr. Reiffel stated in his report that of all Appellant’s medical procedures, “the one in which there was the ‘highest likelihood’ of a catheter being inserted which was long enough to account for the findings on the echocardiogram” were the cutdowns in May 1965. Report of James A. Reiffel, M.D., <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>dated April 4, 2004, at 2. Dr. Reiffel’s supplemental report stated that the catheter fragment in Appellant’s heart “must have” come from the cutdown in May 1965. Supplemental Report of James A. Reiffel, M.D., dated May 26, 2004, at 1. Dr. DePace, in his supplemental report, “concur[red] with Dr. Reiffel that the anticubital [sic] cutdowns were the most likely source of [Appellant’s] catheter migration.” Supplemental Report of Nicholas L. DePace, M.D., dated May 27, 2004, at 2. The trial court found that these statements lacked the requisite degree of medical certainty to withstand the defense motions for summary judgment.

Dr. Reiffel admitted that he lacked any evidentiary support as to the basis of his opinion. Dr. Reiffel stated, “[Although no details are provided in the hospital records or the deposition material I received to allow a precise determination of how the catheter material came to embolize to the right heart and reside there chronically.” [sic] (Expert Report, dated 4/4/04, pg. 2). Yet Dr. Reiffel still opined that there had to be negligence either in the insertion, removal, and/or maintenance of the intravascular catheter. Similarly, it is not clear what, if any, prior medical records Dr. DePace in fact reviewed prior to reaching his conclusion. Dr. DePace makes no reference to reviewing any medical records and/or deposition testimony which would support the conclusions.</blockquote>

The three-member Superior Court panel initially reversed the trial court. In its memorandum opinion filed November 30, 2006, two members of the panel concluded that, read as a whole, the expert and supplemental reports of Appellant’s expert -witnesses, Drs.

      <p id="b643-6" data-blocks='[["BL_643.3",643,[162,1986,1123,303]]]'>However, contrary to the stated concerns of the concurrence, we emphasize that we do not condone non-compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, nor do we posit or suggest that any court should have stepped into counsel's shoes to make a motion to withdraw "deemed” admissions. We fully acknowledge that under appropriate circumstances, deemed admissions may support a grant of summary judgment. Those circumstances are not present in the instant case based on the record as it now stands.</p>

Initially, the majority indicates that our Order allowing the appeal was not intended to encompass the issue of whether the relevant facts were appropriately deemed admitted under Rule 4014. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 550-53, 981 A.2d <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>at 152-53. Later in the opinion, however, the majority offers a lengthy footnote criticizing the Superior Court for acting “quick on the trigger” in recognizing the admissions were deemed. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 564-65 n. 18, 981 A.2d at 160 n. 18.</p>
    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[124,590,1157,864]]]'>To the extent the discussion is appropriately in the case, I differ with the majority’s treatment of the Superior Court’s approach. Rule 4014 provides that matters of which an admission is requested are “admitted[, subject to limited exceptions not relevant here,] unless, within thirty days after service of the request, ... the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission an answer verified by the party or an objection, signed by the party or by the party’s attorney.” Pa.R.Civ.P. No. 4014(b). Furthermore, the Rules stress that “[a]ny matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.” Pa.R.Civ.P. No. 4014(d). Here, their straightforward operation resulted in the deemed admission found by the Superior Court, as it appears to be essentially undisputed that Appellant did not serve the timely, verified response required to avoid the deemed admission.</p>
    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[122,1484,1154,612]]]'>The majority faults the Superior Court for failing to recognize that the trial court had before it a record that contained Appellant’s response (which Appellant attached to its memorandum opposing summary judgment). <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 564-65 n. 18, 981 A.2d at 160 n. 18. This circumstance, however, is irrelevant under the rules, which recognize the deemed admission upon the expiration of the period allowed for response and place the burden squarely on the admitting party to move affirmatively for relief from the admission. While the majority is correct that our rules are to be liberally interpreted in the interests of justice, I cannot fault the Superior Court for understanding they cannot be ignored.</p>
    <p id="b645-6" data-blocks='[["BL_645.6",645,[120,2116,1154,251]],["BL_646.1",646,[302,317,1158,898]]]'>Here, Appellant’s counsel appears, in the first instance, to have attached an inaccurate certificate of service to the request for admissions. Instead of moving for relief under Rule 4014(d) once it was understood that there may have been a mistake, at the very least, in the dating of the certificate (as <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>well as in failing to include the required verification), counsel merely advanced the erroneous legal position that the matters admitted by operation of the Rules could not be taken as admitted at the summary judgment stage. <em>See </em>Memorandum of Law In Support of Plaintiffs Response In Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment of Defendant Richard T. Padula, M.D., R.R. at 428 (“Plainiff s response to Defendant’s Request for Admission may have been delayed in being sent to Defendant, however, a Motion for Summary Judgment is not the proper medium to challenge such a submission.”). I cannot agree with the majority that either the trial court or the Superior Court was obliged to step into counsel’s shoes to make the necessary motion. There are countless instances in the law where attorneys’ or their clients’ own derelictions have affected the availability of relief in the judicial forum. The orderly administration of justice, quite simply, cannot proceed without some structure.</p>
    <p id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[305,1251,1157,904]]]'>Regarding the summary judgment decision, I agree with the majority’s conclusion that it is not sufficiently clear, on this record, that other instances of catheterization could have accounted for Ms. Stimmler’s injury to support the award of summary judgment. In the present landscape, I do not reach a final conclusion concerning the effect of Appellant’s deemed admission that Appellant “has no information from any source” that the catheter in her body “is not from one of the other catheters she has had placed in her medical history,” particularly in light of the representations that Appellant’s expert reports (which obviously represented this form of information) were provided to Appellees prior to the date the deemed admissions became effective. Rather, since such matter was not considered by either the Superior Court or the trial court, I would leave it for resolution on the remand, together with all other outstanding and further matters the parties have pursued or may pursue.</p>
