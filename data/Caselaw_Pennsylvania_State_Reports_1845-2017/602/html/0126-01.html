Appellant was arrested on drug charges and a non-jury trial was scheduled for November 14, 2005. Appellant, asserting that police lacked probable cause, filed a motion to suppress cocaine and money seized from him at the time of his arrest. Following several requests for continuances, the suppression motion and trial were set for March 7, 2006. Appellant appeared in court with counsel on that date and proceedings began with a hearing on the suppression motion.</p>

Officer McCauley explained that the drug trade in the neighborhood was rampant and that he had participated in over 100 narcotic surveillances and numerous drug arrests there. On the night in question, he observed Appellant and another person standing in the rain in an alley. Officer McCauley watched as the individual handed Appellant cash and Appellant retrieved a small plastic bag from his waistband. When the officers approached, Appellant shoved the bag back into his pants and attempted to flee. Police apprehended Appellant and recovered the plastic bag, which contained eight packets of cocaine. Police also recovered $82.00 in cash from Appellant.</p>

The Commonwealth countered that Appellant’s telling conduct, as well as the neighborhood’s widespread drug activity and the officers’ extensive experience investigating narcotics combined to establish probable cause. <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth and denied the motion to suppress.</p>

At this point, Appellant had already completed a written waiver of his right to a jury trial. The trial court then commenced with an oral colloquy to confirm Appellant’s desire and willingness to waive his right to a jury trial and proceed with a bench trial. Appellant’s counsel conducted the colloquy and Appellant confirmed, on the record, his intention to waive his right to a jury trial and his understanding of the ramifications of such a decision. Immediately after the jury waiver colloquy, defense counsel asked the court if it was satisfied with the colloquy. Appellant interrupted and announced to the court that he wished to know if he could represent himself at trial. The trial court responded that Appellant was to participate with his attorney. The following exchange took place:</p>

With regard to Appellant’s self-representation claim, the Commonwealth argued that Appellant’s request was neither timely nor unequivocal, thus he was not entitled to relief. The Commonwealth further argued that Appellant waived the claim because he did not properly preserve it at time of trial. In its Pa.R.Crim.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court stated that Appellant sought to represent himself only after his motion to suppress was unsuccessful and that the request constituted “inappropriate gamesmanship.” Trial Court Opinion 1/11/07 at 3.</p>

Thus, the second question we certified for review, whether Rule 121(C) requires the trial court to conduct a colloquy where a defendant indicates his readiness to proceed pro se at a bench trial, must be answered in the negative under these facts. The structure of Rule 121, as well as the Comment thereto, demonstrate that subsection (A), titled "Generally,” sets out a criminal defendant’s right pursuant to <em>Faretta </em>and lists the information that the court must elicit from the defendant, <em>i.e., </em>the substance of the colloquy. Subsections (B) and (C) are not independent bases for the grant of a <em>Faretta </em>colloquy. They merely provide the mechanism by which such colloquy is delivered and memorialized. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(B) (providing that the waiver of counsel in a summary case or for a preliminary hearing be in writing and signed by both the defendant and the issuing authority); Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(C) (providing that where the waiver of counsel occurs after a preliminary hearing, it is the judge who shall ascertain, on the record, a defendant's knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver). <em>See also </em>Comment to Rule 121 ("Paragraph (A) recognizes that the right to self-representation is guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the Federal Constitution when a valid waiver is made, <em>Faretta v.

We observe that the Commonwealth also argues that Appellant waived his request because he failed to ask for further inquiry of any kind from the trial court. Appellant insists that he did all he could do to seek self-representation and that it is unreasonable to expect a criminal defendant to insist that a trial judge conduct a further inquiry once the defendant makes his request and the judge rules on it definitively, as the judge in this case did. Appellant further claims that this Court’s decision in <em>Davido </em>makes it clear that Appellant was not obligated to ask the trial court to inquire further into the reason for his request. In <em>Davido, </em>this Court held that counsel’s failure to request a colloquy under <em>Faretta </em>did not constitute ineffective assistance of trial counsel as the duty to secure a valid waiver of the right of counsel pursuant to Rule 121 rested with the trial judge. <em>Davido, </em><a href="/pa/582/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="868 A.2d 431" data-case-ids="650302,9177582" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0052-01,/a2d/868/0431-01">868 A.2d at 437-38</a>. The Commonwealth does not assert trial counsel’s ineffectiveness here; rather, it argues that Appellant himself had an obligation to make his request clear and to seek further inquiry by the court. We agree that <em>Davido </em>is not controlling on this issue. While it does not appear from the record that Appellant pursued his request after the trial court denied it, we decline to resolve the issue on this basis. As our analysis <em>infra </em>demonstrates, the trial court simply did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Appellant's request under the specific circumstances of this case.</p>

Specifically, unlike the Majority, I believe that the failure of appellant or his counsel to proffer any reason for the belated request, as well as their failure to suggest that the trial court was obliged to inquire further when the counseled appellant made the bald request, alone proves that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Where, as here, the tardiness of the <em>pro se </em>request renders the “right” to self-representation non-absolute, the defense does not proffer a basis for the request, and defense counsel does not ask that the court make further inquiry of his client, I do not believe that the trial court has any obligation beyond issuing its ruling.</p>

On direct appeal to this Court, the defendant argued that the trial court had erred in denying his request to proceed <em>pro se </em>without holding a colloquy pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 121. The Commonwealth argued that the defendant had waived the Rule 121 claim by not objecting or requesting a colloquy in the court below, and that the claim was therefore best addressed as one of ineffective assistance of counsel. The majority rejected the Commonwealth’s argument, reasoning that Rule 121 “sets forth the procedure a judge must follow to determine whether the waiver of counsel was made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently” and therefore “it is up to the trial court, and not counsel, to ensure that a colloquy is performed if the defendant has invoked his right to self representation.” <em>Id. </em>at 437-38. The majority qualified this statement, however, by noting that the trial court only has the duty to insure that the colloquy is conducted if the defendant’s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>is “timely and unequivocal.” <em>Id. </em>at 438. If the request is not timely, the majority noted, the question of whether to permit the defendant to waive counsel is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the majority determined that the defendant’s invocation of the right to proceed <em>pro se </em>was not clear and unequivocal, and thus the trial court did not err in failing to conduct a Rule 121 colloquy. <em>Id. </em>at 439-40.</p>
