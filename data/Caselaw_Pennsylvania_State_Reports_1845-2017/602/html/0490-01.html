    </p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[131,908,1154,359]]]'>First, we evaluate whether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming Referee Milspaw’s determination that the Claim was properly classified under subsection (b) of the Act. The Commissioner and amicus Northland Insurance Company (“Northland”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> characterize the Claim in divergent ways, and these characterizations would seemingly result in different classifications under the Act.</p>

The Commissioner argues that Ms. Follen-Davis had a claim under a policy for loss, but that the loss was compensated by Farm Bureau. The Commissioner therefore <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>concludes that the compensation of the loss pushes the Claim outside of subsection (b) and into subsection (g) classification pursuant to the carve-out. 40 P.S. § 221.44(b). The Commissioner emphasizes that a subrogee insurer can be entitled to no greater payment than its insured. Moreover, as the Commissioner argues, public policy supports this result because “[subordinating claims as to which recovery has already been secured from another source that is contractually responsible for payment of claims encourages all claimants to seek recovery from other insurers where possible, conserving the insolvent insurer’s assets for claimants who have nowhere else to turn.” Appellant’s Brief, 22.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[300,968,1153,734]]]'>Amicus Northland argues that the Claim was properly classified under subsection (b) and that the Commonwealth Court did not err. According to Northland, the statutory “claimant” is Farm Bureau pursuant to a settlement agreement with Reliance. Northland argues that Farm Bureau has no alternate source of compensation. Northland therefore concludes that the carve-out is inapplicable so subsection (b) classification is proper. Moreover, Northland argues that the General Assembly could have expressly excluded all subrogation claims from subsection (b), in the way these claims are excluded in later Model Act provisions, but the General Assembly chose not to do so. Accordingly, Northland argues that the legislature must have meant to include some subrogation claims within subsection (b) classification.</p>

As a result, the classification of claims in this and other liquidations is a matter of great significance to claimants. The liquidator, here the Commissioner, is charged with properly classifying claims to ensure equitable distribution of assets. 40 P.S. § 221.36(b)(3). Recognizing the importance of classifying claims, the General Assembly enacted the Act to ensure that claimants entitled to more protection have prioritized claims. Section 544 of the Act states, in relevant part, that “[e]very claim in each class shall be paid in full or adequate funds retained for such <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>payment before the members of the next class receive any payment.” 40 P.S. § 221.44.

On one hand, Northland argues that the Claim arises not from subrogation directly, but from the settlement agreement between Farm Bureau and Reliance. If this is true, then the Claim fails to meet the first element, that a claim derive from a <em>policy </em>covering loss. There is no policy between Farm Bureau and Reliance. The only applicable policy is an insurance contract between Reliance and the Members of the Harness that applies to third parties injured by Pocket Rocket. Under the facts of the instant matter, that policy covers injury to Ms. Follen-Davis but not Farm Bureau. In order to avail itself of any coverage under the policy, Farm Bureau must stand in the shoes of its insured Ms. Follen-Davis. Without this subrogation context, there is no policy under which Farm Bureau can seek payment from Reliance. Moreover, Northland’s interpretation of the Claim <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>is faulty. Farm Bureau is not a “third party claimant” merely as a result of the settlement agreement. Farm Bureau would have no cause of action against Reliance without its insured, Ms. Follen-Davis. Farm Bureau’s entire posture in the Reliance liquidation is vis-a-vis its relationship with its insured.</p>

The true statutory “claimant” is Ms. Follen-Davis. Even when Farm Bureau steps into her position pursuant to the rules of subrogation, Ms. FollenDavis remains the true “claimant.” Because she has already been compensated, the carve-out applies to the Claim. Ms. Follen-Davis — and thus Farm Bureau — is a “third party claimant” with a claim against Reliance for injuries committed by Reliance’s insured. Were it not for the compensation by Farm Bureau, Ms. Follen-Davis could have asserted a claim subject to classification under subsection (b). But Ms. FollenDavis had coverage through her own insurer, Farm Bureau, and was compensated. Farm Bureau cannot claim any higher status than Ms. Follen-Davis could have claimed herself, and payment to Ms. Follen-Davis triggers the application of the carve-out. Therefore, since Ms. Follen-Davis would not be entitled to priority under subsection (b), Farm Bureau cannot be entitled to such priority. Northland’s argument, if accepted, would result in Farm Bureau having more rights than its insured.

For the reasons that follow, I do not believe that the doctrines invoked by the Commissioner apply.

The Reliance liquidation is an extremely complex process in which many parts and layers operate. In light of the challenges inherent in such an undertaking, the Insurance Department Act (“Act”) expresses in its “Construction and Purpose” section that “[t]he purpose of this article is the protection of the interests of insureds, creditors, and the public generally, with minimum interference with the normal prerogatives of the owners and managers of insurers, through ... (iii) enhanced efficiency and economy of liquidation, through clarification and specification of the law, to minimize legal uncertainty and litigation.... ” 40 P.S. § 221.1(c) (emphasis added). The Act provides a statutory scheme for liquidation set forth in Sections 221.19-221.52. From the outset, the Commonwealth Court recognized the <em>sui generis </em>nature of the difficult task the Reliance litigation posed. Thus, on September 9, 2002, then-President Judge Colins issued an Order outlining procedures, deadlines, requirements, responsibilities, and instructions specific to the Reliance liquidation. Both the legislative and the judicial response to the unique challenges of the Reliance liquidation have attempted to provide a uniform, consistent, and predictable paradigm, not unlike the Newtonian concept of the universe. A certain degree of regularity, consistency, and stability in terms of the treatment of similarly-situated claims and claimants is one of the primary goals.</p>

The Commissioner uses this study’s projections to determine the appropriate interim distributions to those claimants who are clearly eligible for “(b) priority” status. If individual judges of the Commonwealth Court are free to issue inconsistent rulings, even when confronted with the existence of prior indistinguishable cases, the study projections will need to be adjusted in order to include hundreds of potential subrogation claims.

But, if so, the corrective measure should be the usual ones available when a preclusion doctrine applies: prompt, open, and formal reconsideration before a Commonwealth Court panel. In addition, there is nothing to preclude a single judge from referring an issue to the Commonwealth Court as a whole. A single judge who is convinced that the prior decisions are problematic may explain the basis for that view and invite correction at a higher level. But single judges in the context of complex liquidation litigations like this one should be mindful of the stakes involved and should be discouraged from essentially ignoring prior cases that appear to be directly on-point.

I recognize that, under the Rules of Appellate Procedure and cases such as <em>Great Valley, supra, </em>the Commissioner could have taken measures short of petitioning for review by this Court to ensure the consistency he desires, <em>i.e., </em>by seeking formal reargument before the Commonwealth Court as a whole under Pa.R.A.P. 2541-2547. As I understand it, however, in practice, the court as a whole has an opportunity to consider the reconsideration application made to the single judge, although that practice is not generally acknowledged in the IOPs or the Rules of Appellate Procedure. That informal practice may explain why eleven copies of an application for reconsideration to the Commonwealth Court are required pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2541 even though the court’s IOPs say that the application is exited only to the single judge. Institutional litigants such as the Commissioner may be aware that a single-judge denial has at least some measure of approval by the Commonwealth Court as a whole. Whether my understanding is accurate or not, the Commonwealth Court should have some formal mechanism in place to better police these matters.</p>

Rather, I find that Northland advances a colorable argument that Farm Bureau’s subrogation claim qualifies for subsection (b) priority under a literal reading of the statute, since Farm Bureau is a “claimant” standing in the shoes of a “third party” to a Reliance policy pursuing a “claim[ ] under [such] polic[y] for losses.” 40 P.S. <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>§ 221.44(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Since, however, a subrogation interest deriving from a potential third-party claimant is even further removed from the policy than the underlying third-party claim itself, a question arises whether the Legislature intended for such claims to enjoy subsection (b) priority. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, drafter of the model legislation on which the Section 544 priority scheme is based, provides an extensive discussion of the history and intent of the statute, which I believe addresses the material ambiguity deriving from the indirectness of the subrogee’s connection to the policy of the insolvent insurer.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[128,952,1156,472]]]'>Principally, based on the drafting history and associated policies, I believe the NAIC persuasively demonstrates that subrogation claims were not considered the type of “loss claim” that subsection (b) priority is designed to address. <em>See </em>NAIC Brief at 7-11. Indeed, the NAIC observes that changes were made in 1994 which “merely make[ ] clear what was intended all along: that claims of subrogated insurers are not included in the same priority as those of [direct] third-party claimants and policyholders.” <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>

In this regard, I do not read Northland’s argument as placing it in a "double bind.” Majority Opinion, at 504-05, 980 A.2d at 595-96. Indeed, one of the linchpins to this conclusion, namely, the majority's position that Farm Bureau is not the claimant, <em>see id. </em>at 504-05, 980 A.2d at 595-96, seems to me to be strained. I fail to see how Farm Bureau is any less a "claimant” for purposes of subsection (b) than it is under subsection (g). Finally, in reasoning that Farm Bureau cannot be accorded subsection (b) priority because this would invest it with rights greater than the subrogor, <em>see id. </em>at 504-05, 980 A.2d at 596, the majority overlooks Northland’s argument that ”[i]t is black-letter law that a party in subrogation steps into the shoes of the subrogor and <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>assumes its rights as they existed <em>before </em>— not after — indemnification occurred.” Northland Brief at 13-15.</p>
