Appellant Ronald Strieker requests that we overrule the Orphans’ and Superior Courts, and hold either that the Orphans’ Court’s orders to sell real estate were final and therefore appealable, or that those orders were interlocutory but appealable as collateral orders. We decline to do either and, accordingly, affirm the Superior Court.</p>

Appellant and his sister, Appellee Linda Strieker, were appointed co-executors of the decedent’s estate. There are approximately ten beneficiaries to the estate, including Appellant. The two tracts of land at <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>the core of the present dispute constitute the bulk of the estate’s value. The first, referred to below as the “restricted tract,” is restricted by an option to repurchase in the deed. Appellee Mary Detweiler, current owner of the adjacent land and proper holder of the option to repurchase, has chosen to exercise the option. The other tract, the “unrestricted tract,” has been sold to John Fulton, the highest bidder at auction. On this basis, the Orphans’ Court ordered that the unrestricted tract be delivered to him.</p>
    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[131,833,1157,853]]]'>Appellant had, prior to the auction, made several offers to the estate to buy both tracts. His offers, which were below fair market value, were rejected by the co-executrix and the beneficiaries. Appellant participated in the public auction for the unrestricted tract, but Mr. Fulton’s bid exceeded the amount that Appellant had previously offered for both tracts, and exceeded Appellant’s auction bid. When it became apparent after the auction that Appellant would not cooperate in the sale of either tract, Appellee Linda Strieker, as co-executrix, petitioned the court to compel him to sign the agreement of sale disposing of the unrestricted tract. After holding multiple hearings on this issue as well as Appellant’s attempts to have Ms. Strieker removed as co-executrix, the court determined that the sale was valid. Appellant filed an appeal of that decision, and on July 15, 2005, the Superior Court quashed the appeal as interlocutory.</p>

The court also ordered the co-executors to move toward finalizing the sale of the unrestricted tract, which had still not been delivered to Mr. Fulton. Appellant filed a notice of appeal and a statement of matters complained of pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925. The Orphans’ Court subsequently issued an opinion pursuant to Rule 1925 wherein it determined that the order appealed from was interlocutory and recommended quashal.</p>

It is true that the real estate will no longer be available to Appellant once a sale to another party is accomplished. But Appellant was not bequeathed the tracts themselves. Instead, Appellant is entitled only to a share of the decedent’s estate after it has been liquidated. Therefore, his claim that an immediate appeal is necessary to protect his interests fails. Indeed, Appellant has no greater rights with respect to this property than any potential buyer. Moreover, if we accepted Appellant’s argument that any claim on or about property that might be sold during the probate process should be immediately appealable, the appellate court system would be flooded with such appeals and the administration of decedents’ estates would be unreasonably delayed.</p>

Appellant’s argument applies with even greater strength to personal property. For example, if a piece of furniture were to be sold at auction and <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>an executor/beneficiary objected to the sale, but was ordered to go through with it by the Orphans’ Court, the property could soon be on another continent, well beyond the jurisdiction of our courts. Yet our rules do not permit immediate appeal under such circumstances, unless the Orphans’ Court decides its order approving the sale is final pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 842(1). Under appropriate circumstances, a sale of property might be stayed by an immediate appeal authorized by the Orphans’ Court, but the court clearly did not certify its order as final in this case. We find no error. A delay in review of the orders in this case “will not result in the loss of any right in any of the parties because the real estate is not specifically devised under the will to any person, and the proceeds of sale will remain under the review and control of the Orphans’ Court until confirmation of the final account.” <em>Habazin, </em><a href="/a2d/679/1293-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="679 A.2d 1293" data-case-ids="11337900,767057" data-case-paths="/a2d/679/1293-01,/pa-super/451/0421-01">679 A.2d at 1295</a>. “[A]n order is not final and appealable merely because it decides one issue of importance to the parties.

In this case, the “main cause of action” is the final administration of Catherine Strieker’s estate, along with the distribution of estate property according to her Last Will and Testament (the “Will”), in accordance with the central purpose of the Orphans’ Court’s jurisdiction. The Will, which consists of a single page, does not make any specific bequests; rather, it first directs that the executors pay debts, expenses, and taxes, and then directs that all remaining property in the estate be given in equal shares to the decedent’s children or their issue <em>per stirpes. </em>Since the Will directs that the residue be divided equally among the decedent’s heirs, it is not possible that an order to sell estate property in pursuit of such division is collateral to the main cause of action.

This is unsurprising, of course. As a general rule, a purchaser of real property seeks certainty in the title acquired, and the seller seeks to maximize the sale price. In the context of sales, mortgages, leases, and/or options involving estate property, the interests on all sides of transactions are adversely affected by the cloud created when an appeal is delayed until the closing of an estate, an event which may occur many years after the disposition of any individual estate asset.</p>

Further, the vesting of absolute, standardless discretion in our orphans’ courts yields the potential for disparate treatment. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Castillo, </em><a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="585 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="2472599" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01">585 Pa. 395</a>, 401, <a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="888 A.2d 775" data-case-ids="2472599,8998737" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01,/a2d/888/0775-01">888 A.2d 775</a>, 779 (2005) (rejecting the exercise of appellate discretion to review issues on appeal where the appellant has failed to comply with the obligation to file a statement of matters complained of on appeal, where such discretion yields “inconsistent results and uneven justice”).</p>

The majority does not provide evidence to support its floodgates concern; further, it is significantly diffused by the recognition that the Appellate Rules’ requirement of finality delays appeals but does not foreclose them. I also differ with the belief that immediate appeals from orders <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>determining interests in estate property unreasonably delay administration. Instead, I believe, consistent with the understanding of all parties to this appeal (and I suspect many other participants in the estate administration process), that allowing appeals as of right most frequently would result in a net benefit.</p>
    <p id="b142-4" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[298,655,1156,579]]]'>There are obviously substantial interests in tension in this setting (again, for example, those of the intermediate appellate courts in containing their workload and minimizing piecemeal appeals versus the interests of participants in the estate administration process in maximizing certainty of title). Thus, I believe our Appellate and Orphans’ Court Procedural Rules Committees should continue to study the application of the present rule in practice and make recommendations for improvements where appropriate, particularly given the troubling implications of maintaining a system based on absolute, largely standardless discretion.</p>

It should be borne in mind, however, that Rule 342 expressly recognizes that there may be other available avenues for securing immediate appellate review, for example, a permissive appeal. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 342(2) &amp; Note.</p>
