      <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>The Commonwealth asserts that the Trademark Counterfeiting Statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad, claiming that it is limited to those persons with the intent to sell or distribute items with counterfeit trademarks, and thus that the statute does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech. The Commonwealth observes that the trial court’s analysis of unconstitutionality centered on the inclusion of the word “use” in the definition of the offense of trademark counterfeiting. The Commonwealth, however, asserts that the statute only applies when the counterfeit trademark is used “with intent to sell or distribute.” Implicitly, the Commonwealth is contending that the phrase “with intent to sell or distribute” applies not only to the word “possess,” which immediately proceeds the phrase in subsection (a), but also to the entire list of verbs in subsection (a), including “use.” To support its argument that the breadth of the statute is limited by intent, the Commonwealth relies upon the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. George, </em><a href="/a2d/878/0881-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="878 A.2d 881" data-case-ids="8945621" data-case-paths="/a2d/878/0881-01">878 A.2d 881</a>, 886 (Pa.Super.2005), in which the court emphasized the defendant’s intent to sell.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In <em>George, </em>the court rejected the defendant’s sufficiency of the evidence argument where the defendant claimed that the statute required possession of twenty-five counterfeit items with the intent to sell.

Additionally, the Commonwealth relies upon the default mens rea provided in the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(c), which provides, “When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.” It therefore contends that the statute only applies to those intending to sell items with counterfeit marks. Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that even if protected behavior might be prohibited by the statute, we should overlook the unconstitutionality based upon the provision in the Crimes Code allowing courts to dismiss charges where the conduct is <em>de minimis </em>or does not involve the behavior that the statute intends to prevent. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 312.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

[or] distribute[ion]’ of items bearing a counterfeit mark, and defining ‘counterfeit mark’ broadly to include ‘any term or word,’ the Trademark Counterfeiting statute is easily applied to a broad array of constitutionally protected activity.” Brief for O’Connor at 4. Appellees note that the use of the word “Nike” on a sign at a protest rally, such as “Nike uses sweatshop labor” would fall within the reach of the Trademark Counterfeiting Statute because the activity would involve the unauthorized use of a word or term used by another to identify goods or services. Indeed, Appellees contend that the brief they submitted in this case violated the Trademark Counterfeiting Statute because they distributed (to the Court and the parties) an item containing an unauthorized reproduction of words, such as Nike and Penn State, that are used by other entities to identify goods or services.</p>

Therefore, any unauthorized use of a “term” or “word” that is engaged by another person to identify that person’s goods or services is a “counterfeit mark.” Accordingly, the definition of intellectual property criminalizes not only the use of the trademark, which would include the stylized logo or name but also the mere word, without regard to font or color. When the relevant definitions are inserted into the definition of the offense, the statute criminalizes the use of any items bearing an unauthorized reproduction of terms or words <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>used by a person to identify that person’s goods or services. 18 Pa.C.S. § 4119(a), (i). As highlighted by the trial court, the statute, therefore, unconstitutionally prohibits protected speech, including the use of words on a sign praising or protesting any entity with a trademarked name, including Penn State. Taken to the extreme, even our use of the words “Nike” and “Penn State” in this opinion without the permission of the company or the university would fall under the current definition of a counterfeit mark.

The offense, again, is defined as “Any person who knowingly manufactures, uses, displays, advertises, distributes, offers for sale, sells or possesses <em>with intent to sell or distribute </em>any items or services bearing or identified by a counterfeit mark shall be guilty of the crime of trademark counterfeiting.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 4119(a) (emphasis added). Applying the “last antecedent” rule of grammar, the phrase “with intent to sell and distribute,” applies solely to the verb “possesses,” which immediately precedes that clause, such that the statute prohibits the possession of a counterfeit trademark item with the intent to sell or distribute that item. <em>Packer, </em><a href="/pa/568/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="798 A.2d 192" data-case-ids="163625,9428700" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0481-01,/a2d/798/0192-01">798 A.2d at 198</a> (observing “the well established cannon of construction that courts should generally apply qualifying words or phrases to the words immediately preceding them”).

Here, the structure of the sentence demonstrates that the rule should apply because otherwise the statute would prohibit the selling of items with the intent to sell and the distribution of items with the intent to distribute, which results in grammatically absurd redundancy. Therefore, we <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>cannot construe the statute to be constitutional without doing violence to the sentence as written by the legislature.</p>

A review of the Superior Court’s decision in <em>George, </em>relied upon by the Commonwealth to support the significance of the intent to sell or distribute, reveals that that ease did not consider the constitutionality of the statute, and only considered the intent of the defendant in regard to whether there was sufficient evidence of “possession with intent to sell or distribute,” in a case involving possession, not use. <em>George, </em><a href="/a2d/878/0881-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="878 A.2d 881" data-case-ids="8945621" data-case-paths="/a2d/878/0881-01">878 A.2d 881</a>.

Finally, we find no comfort in the existence of 18 Pa.C.S. § 312, providing for the dismissal of <em>de minimis </em>infractions, as the concern of our overbreath jurisprudence is not directed only at the risk of prosecution under overly broad statutes but also at the chilling of speech in fear of prosecution. <em>Davidson, </em><a href="/pa/595/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="938 A.2d 198" data-case-ids="3844538,8313549" data-case-paths="/pa/595/0001-01,/a2d/938/0198-01">938 A.2d at 208</a>.

Other requirements in the sentence, which clearly apply to all the enumerated verbs, are not set off clearly. For example, does the term “knowingly” modify only the word “manufactures” which immediately follows?

Nor does the Statute fail to describe a violation with sufficient definiteness. Simply stated, pursuant to the Statute it is criminal to make deceptive use of a recognized word or mark for the purpose of a sale or distribution. When the Statute is read in the context of the General Assembly’s clear legislative intent, as evidenced by the presumption of intent to distribute or sell set forth in Section 4119(b), it is clear that mere use of a mark is not criminalized. The grammar of the Statute, while somewhat unconventionally structured, nevertheless defines a violation sufficiently to pass void-for-vagueness and overbreadth review and it is not necessary to strike down the Statute.</p>
