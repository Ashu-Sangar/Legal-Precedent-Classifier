Even though many of the attendees at the party were underage, large quantities of alcohol and marijuana were consumed. At some point during the evening, a fight <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>erupted and the police were called to the scene. Prior to the arrival of the responding police officers, a group of the partygoers left in two separate vehicles and drove to a local tavern. After consuming more alcohol at the tavern, the group drove to a wooded area outside of Hanover, known as “the Pines.” Several members of the group departed. At one point, the victim left the remaining members of the group and went into the woods to relieve herself. She was followed by [Small] and co-defendant James Frey. Sometime thereafter, witnesses testified that they heard the victim scream. An eyewitness, Larry Tucker, later testified at trial that he had followed [Small] into the woods and then watched [Small] and the co-defendant grab the victim, throw her to the ground and say to her “you give it to everybody else.” [Small] was seen shortly thereafter coming out of the woods -with blood on his hands. Co-defendant Frey followed several minutes later and the remaining members of the group then left the Pines leaving the victim in the woods. The victim was never seen alive again and her body was found seven weeks later, in a spread eagle position, naked from the waist down with her shirt rolled around her neck, exposing her upper torso. Forensic evidence indicated that the cause of death was a head trauma.</blockquote>

Finally, police investigators learned that [Small] had been making incriminating statements implicating himself in the murder. Linda Rhinehart testified that she overheard [Small] at an arcade in Hanover state to some friends that: “I followed her into the woods ‘cause I was going to get some of that.... She won’t be a tease anymore. It’s amazing what a tire iron can do to hush someone making that much noise.” Cerenna Hughes testified that [Small] told her that after the night at the Pines, Cheryl “run away” and “she gave in, she gave up.” Harry H. Carper III testified that sometime during 1981, he visited [Small] at his home and [Small] stated “he might have killed” Cheryl Smith and that “he hit her over the top of her head.” Lastly, Janice Small, [Small’s] wife at the time of the murder, testified that one <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>night in 1981 when Carper was visiting at their residence, she overheard [Small] say to Carper “I killed a girl.... [We] hit her over the head, dumped her ass in the woods and left her there.” She also testified that on one occasion when she was reading a newspaper article about the murder, [Small] walked by and said, “that’s the girl we killed.”</blockquote>

At Small’s trial, Berlan testified regarding a conversation he had with Tucker in 1993 about the Smith murder. Two years prior to trial, the York County Public Defender’s Office represented Berlan. Attorney Evanick was York County’s chief public defender. When the public defender’s office represented Berlan, Berlan never mentioned the Smith murder, although he was trying to help police solve some crimes. Attorney Evanick wanted to use that information to impeach Berlan. However, as he informed the court, he had learned <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>the information as part of the attorney-client relationship with Berlan. To avoid breaking the privilege, Attorney Evanick agreed with the Commonwealth to work out a stipulation that would inform the jury about that information without breaking the privilege. However, no such stipulation was reached, and Attorney Evanick did not cross-examine Berlan on this matter. <em>Id., </em>at 28-30, <a href="/pa/572/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="813 A.2d 707" data-case-ids="716450,9381115" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0017-01,/a2d/813/0707-01">813 A.2d 707</a>.</p>

Berlan was informally providing police with some information on crimes in the area after Tucker made his 1993 statement. The fact Berlan did not specifically mention Tucker’s 1993 statement when informally informing police of crimes does not rise to the level of such a conflict of interest that it prejudiced Small. Tucker’s 1993 statement is highly valuable for Frey as it does not place Frey at the murder scene. However, Tucker’s statement, and the fact Berlan did not relay it to police earlier, is not as obviously valuable to Small. The only negative for Small from Berlan’s trial testimony is he mentioned the Smalls were at the crime scene. But Attorney Evanick quickly objected, and the trial court provided a lengthy curative instruction (which the jury is presumed to follow) of already known information. If Berlan was cross-examined as to why he did not mention Tucker’s 1993 statement to police, he might have said he simply forgot, or since he was only informally helping the police, he did not tell them; there could have been any number of different reasons. Ultimately, this uncertainty only allows us to conclude such cross-examination might have helped Small.

In response to a question of whether he would be able to impose the death penalty if the Commonwealth met its burden, he said, “If it was required, yes, sir.” <em>Id., </em>at 1040. Graham also agreed a murder conviction without considering other circumstances and the trial court’s instruction would not be sufficient to impose the death penalty. <em>Id., </em>at 1043.

However, the other evidence against Small, including his own statements to no less than four individuals admitting his involvement in the murder, render the lack of Sofi and Elzey's impeachment testimony non-prejudicial. Therefore, this claim fails regardless of the credibility of either Sofi or Elzey, and we need not further consider their credibility. Nonetheless, when confronted by claims alleging ineffectiveness by trial counsel for failure to call a witness, we encourage PCRA courts to facilitate appellate review by making credibility findings.</p>

First, a decision in this case was made unnecessarily difficult by the York County District Attorney’s unexplained failure to brief appellee/cross-appellant Small’s 20-issue cross-appeal. I agree with the Majority’s <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>notation that the Commonwealth is strongly encouraged to file responsive pleadings in capital cases. Such a failure is particularly perplexing where, as here, the Commonwealth was the initial appellant and appellee cross-appealed. Going forward, I am not convinced that we should simply accept the Commonwealth’s determination not to participate in capital cases. To facilitate this Court’s disposition of these difficult and laborious cases, perhaps we should first issue a rule to show cause upon the Commonwealth why a capital defendant’s request for relief should not be summarily granted, if the Commonwealth indicates no interest in defending a death penalty judgment.</p>

See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(g) (burglary only deemed “crime of violence” for purposes of two and three strikes mandatory punishment when burglary is “of a structure adapted for overnight accommodation in which at the time of the offense any person is present.”). Thus, it is no longer accurate to say, as <em>Rios </em>and <em>Pruitt </em>did, that burglary is always classified as a crime of violence in Pennsylvania, even though it certainly remains a violent crime for purposes of the Section 9711(d)(9) aggravator.</p>

The majority’s recounting of this Court’s sufficiency review on direct appeal is not persuasive, as sufficiency review is very different a review of the prejudicial impact of particular items of evidence. The majority’s vague reference to “forensic evidence” also provides little support, since the only forensic evidence identified in the trial record is the testimony that the cause of death was head trauma and the manner of death was a homicide.

However, because of Tucker’s pivotal role in this case as the only witness who placed [codefendant Frey] at the scene of the crime and because the only evidence that the Commonwealth had in this case was circumstantial evidence offered through the testimony of witnesses, trial counsel's failure to properly impeach Tucker without a reasonable basis for this omission prejudiced [Frey’s] case and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>

On collateral review, the PCRA court, after conducting a hearing, awarded Appellee John Amos Small a new trial based, <em>inter alia, </em>upon its conclusion that counsel’s stewardship was constitutionally deficient for failing to interview and produce two witnesses who would have testified regarding an admission to the murder by an individual other than Small.

    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[303,1446,1156,785]]]'>In the appeal before us, our review focuses on the PCRA court’s award of a new trial on the basis of trial counsel’s failure to interview and produce two witnesses, Darick Sofi and Robert Elzey. These witnesses would have testified that Lawrence Tucker made the statement, “this is where I iced this chick,” implicating him as the murderer of the victim, Cheryl Smith. Tucker added that he believed the police were stupid and that he would get away with it. At trial, however, Tucker implicated Small as Smith’s killer. Employing our Commonwealth’s three-prong <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>test, the PCRA court found that Small’s ineffectiveness claim based upon counsel’s failure to call Sofi and Elzey at trial had merit, that there was no reasonable trial strategy for failing to obtain this witness testimony, and that Small was prejudiced by this failure.</p>

Thus, the underlying legal issue has arguable merit. Moreover, no strategic reason for failing to .call witnesses Sofi and Elzey existed, satisfying the prong requiring that counsel’s actions lacked a reasonable basis. Both Justice Saylor and Justice Baer surmise, however, contrary to the PCRA court, that the failure to call Sofi and Elzey would not likely have changed the outcome of Small’s trial. Thus, according to the Majority, as well as the concurring Justices, Small failed to establish the prejudice prong of his ineffectiveness claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a>

Concurring Op. (Saylor, J.) at 482-83, 980 A.2d at 583. In my view, such credibility determinations are absolutely essential because of the circumstances surrounding this prosecution. Tucker was the Commonwealth’s primary witness. Additionally, Tucker was sexually intimate with Smith, abused her, and threatened to kill her. In fact, the Commonwealth initially charged Tucker with criminal homicide. Tucker, however, testified against Small after he entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth for the reduction in charges against him. Not only would have Sofi and Elzey’s testimony cast doubt upon Tucker’s testimony against Small, but the prosecution highlighted the absence of their testimony to the jury to convict Small. The import of Sofi and Elzey’s testimony was not inconsequential — the extent of Small’s participation in the murder of Williams may have been the difference between first-degree murder and second-degree murder.</p>

Thus, in light of our proper role as an appellate court of limited review, the superior point of view held by the PCRA court to make credibility determinations, the PCRA court’s duty to set forth express credibility findings in the first instance, and, most importantly, the unique circumstances underlying this capital appeal, I believe the jurisprudentially prudent course of action is to remand the matter to the PCRA court for express credibility findings concerning witnesses Sofi and Elzy.</p>
