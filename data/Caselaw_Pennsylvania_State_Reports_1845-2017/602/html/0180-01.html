Dr. Fishbein opined, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that appellant had a low intelligence quotient and a schitzoid personality, but was competent to fully participate in and understand the trial proceedings. Appellant testified he had the ability to participate in and understand the proceedings; the defense and prosecuting attorneys also agreed appellant was competent to stand trial. Following thorough discussion with Dr. Fishbein and appellant, the trial court found appellant competent to participate in the proceedings.</p>

Among the witnesses were the police officers who were on duty the night of the incident; they testified about the crime scene, the victims’ conditions, and appellant’s confessions. Trooper Elwood Spencer, a firearms expert, testified the .22 caliber handgun found at the scene could fire a bullet with sufficient velocity and mass to penetrate a human being. Dr. Samuel Land, an expert in forensic pathology, testified that both Creed Vincent and James Dick died of intermediate range gunshot wounds to the head and chest. He stated the chest wounds were fatal, and each child would have died within seconds to minutes with those wounds alone; however, due to the shots to the head, their deaths were likely immediate.</p>

Betty remains permanently disabled as a result of the gunshot wounds she sustained. She has no peripheral vision in her left eye, suffers chronic headaches, and will require continued treatment for symptoms associated with her injuries — including the eventual installation of a metal plate in her head. Dr. Joseph Williams, the neurological surgeon who performed surgery on Betty, stated bone fragments still remain in her skull, and a bullet still resides in her chest. He indicated these defects could cause additional problems in the future, including seizures, lung function problems, and pulmonary disease.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth verified only four people were present in the room the evening of the incident: Betty Dick testified no one else was in the room that evening, and she had to unlock the door to get to the neighboring room, thus eradicating any suspicion the wounds were inflicted by an intruder.</p>

    <p id="b266-7" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[294,931,1155,527]]]'>As previously stated, the trial court found three aggravating circumstances in each of the two murder cases: appellant, in the commission of the offense, knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim; appellant had been convicted of another murder committed in any jurisdiction before or at the time of the offense; and the victim was a child under the age of 12. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7), (11), <em>&amp; </em>(16). Appellant chose not to present any mitigating circumstances, and the trial court sentenced him to death, as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv).</p>
    <p id="b266-8" data-blocks='[["BL_266.7",266,[294,1499,1155,581]]]'>Upon reviewing the evidence, we find acknowledging these aggravating circumstances is unavoidable. Appellant clearly created a grave risk of death to Betty Dick by shooting James and Creed multiple times in close proximity to her while the three were sleeping in the same hotel room. Even more inescapable is the fact appellant committed two murders at the same time, and each victim was a child under the age of 12. As three aggravating circumstances were clearly present, and no mitigating evidence was presented to counter-balance these factors, under mandate of law the court was required to impose the death penalty, and accordingly did not err in doing so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

We additionally find the Commonwealth presented evidence that established the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The presence of these aggravating circumstances, absent any mitigating evidence, supports the trial court’s imposition of the death penalty. Furthermore, we find the sentence imposed was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and therefore affirm the verdict and the sentence of death imposed by the trial court.</p>
