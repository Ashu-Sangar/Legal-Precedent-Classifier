Because we find the issues raised by appellant either unreviewable or without merit, we affirm the convictions and judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[132,1184,1160,1064]]]'>The myriad charges in this case arose out of the abuse of P.B. and her three sisters, which culminated on the night of August 16, 2003, when appellant caused the death of P.B. Evidence presented at trial established that in 2002, appellant was living in an apartment located at 1705 South 5th Street in the City of Philadelphia. Tiffany Bennett, the mother of four girls, P.B., age three, P.B.2., age four, A.B.2., age six, and A.B., age ten, knew appellant and his brother, Jason Chambers (“Jason”) from the neighborhood. Bennett met appellant and Jason in 1999, when she moved into the neighborhood to live with her mother. Jason and appellant paid Bennett to braid their hair, and Bennett’s daughters played with Jason’s children. Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 5/13/05, at 64-67. Bennett found appellant to be “a nice guy. I didn’t see anything wrong with him.” N.T. 5/13/05, at 67. Bennett initially asked Jason to babysit the girls, and he did so for some period of time. Precisely when appellant began babysitting the girls is unclear; however, the girls were in his care by the fall of 2002. Appellant babysat the girls during Bennett’s work hours, from 4:00 p.m. until midnight.</p>

Jason Chambers lived on the second floor with his two sons, Jayshawn and Jayshine. A woman named Jennifer and her son lived on the third floor, while appellant shared the first floor apartment with Ruth Leonard, whom he called his “godmother.” Bennett’s sister, Candice Geiger, was also living with appellant and Ruth on the first floor. When Bennett first began leaving her children with appellant she was unaware that her sister Candice was living with appellant; however, even after Bennett discovered that her sister was living in the house with her daughters, she never discussed their care or welfare with her.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[296,965,1156,998]]]'>Bennett initially paid appellant $60.00 per week to watch the girls. The girls were in appellant’s apartment for approximately eight hours per day, from 4:00 p.m. until after midnight, when Bennett picked them up and took them to her home. Prior to Thanksgiving of 2002, however, appellant suggested that it would be better for the girls to stay the night at his apartment rather than go home at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. Bennett agreed, and began to pay appellant $80.00 per week for babysitting. At this point, Bennett’s interaction with the children became less frequent and she largely stopped visiting them at appellant’s apartment or taking them home for weekends or special occasions. Someone from appellant’s house would come to her work to get the babysitting money, or she would drop the money off during her lunch break. Bennett spent an hour or so with her children on Christmas Day; then, between Easter and August 17, 2003, she did not see her children at all. In June of 2003, appellant asked Bennett to take her children back, to which she replied, “I don’t want the kids.” N.T., 5/12/05, at 150.</p>

The apartment consisted of two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living area, and a kitchen. It was filthy and infested with flies and cockroaches. An overwhelming stench of urine permeated the dwelling. N.T., 5/3/05, at 15. The front bedroom was occupied by Ruth Leonard, while the girls shared the back bedroom with appellant and Geiger. There were two doors to the bedroom. One <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>was nailed shut, and the - other was stripped of its latch mechanism, and could only be opened by a key. The bedroom was furnished -with two beds: one, next to the radiator, for the children; the other for appellant and Geiger. There was a child’s potty overflowing with urine and feces on the floor. There was also feces on the floor around the room, particularly by the children’s bed. The single window was covered with dark plastic, and on the wall were taped six pieces of paper listing “Rules for this room.” <em>Id., </em>at 24. Rules one through six instructed the children in their daily chores, while rule seven mandated that everyone “[r]espect [appellant] at all times or every body [sic] gets their ass whooped.” <em>Id., </em>at 25.</p>

If anyone visited, appellant locked the girls in the bedroom or made the girls cover their faces and bodies. When P.B. wet the bed, appellant made A.B. put the three-year-old in a cold shower. To keep P.B. from getting too cold, A.B. would get into the shower with her. N.T., 4/22/04, at 26. The girls were also locked in the basement -with appellant’s two pit bulls as punishment, and were fed sporadically and inconsistently. At times, they were forced to eat “dog poop” out of the dogs’ food bowls. N.T., 4/20/04, at 11-12, 25.</p>

Later, he locked A.B. in the basement, and he, Geiger, P.B., A.B.2, and P.B.2 went to bed. Some time after midnight, appellant and Geiger were having sex when appellant noticed P.B. looking at them. Appellant told her to stop watching, but, when she did not comply, appellant called her over to his bed, beat her with an extension cord, and struck her in the face several times with his hand. Geiger also beat P.B., then appellant picked her up by her feet and threw her across the room. P.B. struck her <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>head on the cast-iron radiator and ended up lodged between the bed, radiator, and wall. She remained there, slowly-suffocating, until the next day. Appellant did nothing to help the child; further, he instructed the other girls not to help her. N.T. 4/22/04, at 56.</p>

Firefighters dispatched to the apartment found P.B. laying face up on a sofa. Despite realizing that P.B. had been dead for some time, the EMTs attempted to resuscitate her. She was later pronounced dead on arrival at Methodist Hospital.</p>
    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[304,970,1149,307]]]'>When police officers arrived at the scene, appellant and Geiger calmly falsified a story that they had put the children to bed at 9:00 p.m. the previous evening, and that when they awoke around 1:00 p.m. the next day, they found P.B. between the wall and the bed. They reported that P.B. was unresponsive when they found her. N.T. 5/10/05, at 75, 77, 81.</p>

She stated that after appellant threw P.B. into the radiator, he “took her off the radiator and threw her behind the bed.” N.T., 5/3/05, at 174. A.B.2 also informed Detective Reinhold that Geiger had instructed her to tell the police that appellant “treated us right, but he didn’t.” N.T., 5/3/05, at 174. She maintained that appellant and Geiger frequently beat them and withheld food, and that on the night that P.B. died A.B. was locked in the <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>basement after having been severely beaten the day before.

A.B. also stated that her own injuries were inflicted by appellant, who beat her because “he thought I did something wrong to my sister.” She also indicated that appellant regularly beat her, A.B.2, and P.B.2, but not P.B., and that the police were not called until 1:00 p.m. the next day because “the phone wasn’t charged,” and because Geiger “didn’t have minutes on her cell phone.” N.T., 5/4/05, at 86. A.B. later testified at trial that appellant had instructed her to lie about what happened to P.B., and to tell police that a strange man had broken into the apartment and fought with appellant.

She stated that after P.B. was killed, appellant instructed her to hide on the third floor and that, if the police found her, she was to tell them that her injuries were due to a fall. She also stated that appellant had beaten P.B. the night of her death, and that appellant had made her stand in Ruth Leonard’s bedroom with Ruth while P.B. was being beaten.

Dr. Hood testified that P.B. was below normal height and weight for her age, and that she <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>was “very scrawny, very thin, with loose folds of skin that indicated that she had been heavier at some point in time” and then lost that weight in a short period of time. N.T., 5/2/05, at 16. Dr. Hood testified that “[t]he most significant finding about this child was just everywhere you looked on the skin, there was a mark or bruise of a varying age.” The marks and bruises were of various shapes, indicating that they were inflicted with different instruments. The instruments identified by Dr. Hood were two different kinds of belts and buckles, looped cords, and “a couple of patterned, fairly nasty scars that had completely depigmented the skin and were made with something that was about the size of [a] knuckle.” He was unable to determine the exact number of injuries because “the problem in documenting the bruises, the scars, and the abrasions on this child was that many of them did overlap and coalesce.” He estimated thirty to forty areas of injury, and significantly more individual bruises. The most recent of her injuries were inflicted the night of her death, while the oldest were a minimum of two months old. N.T., 5/2/05, at 16-18, 20-21, 33, 71.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[294,1388,1157,675]]]'>P.B. had a recently-inflicted bruise on her left forehead, another around her left eye, and a third underneath her left eyebrow. There were a series of bruises over the left side of her face, caused by “knuckles or fingers from an adult hand.” Another, similar bruise was on the right side of her face. Describing the injuries to P.B.’s head, Dr. Hood noted that P.B. had thick braids that were “very protective,” but that her scalp was still bruised and abraded in a number of places. N.T., 5/2/05, at 23-24. Dr. Hood speculated that the scalp injuries could have come from being struck with a hard object or being propelled into an object. Her forehead was marked with a pattern of bruises and indentations consistent with the radiator.</p>

P.B.’s liver had undergone “sudden forceful compression” and had ruptured and begun to split apart. Dr. Hood testified that the blood loss from the ruptured liver would not normally have <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>been fatal in and of itself, but given P.B.’s malnourished and weak condition, “it would be certainly capable as acting as the straw that broke the camel’s back.” <em>Id., </em>at 39. Consistent with her malnourished state, P.B.’s thymus gland was shrunken. Dr. Hood testified that the state of her thymus gland indicated that she had been under physical stress for a significant period of time.</p>

Inanition is a “peculiar condition” specific to neglected and abused infants or children, and is characterized by malnourishment and a shrunken thymus gland. P.B. was “off the bottom of the chart” for a normal three-year-old’s height and weight. P.B. also exhibited a condition called lanugo hair, a growth of body hair typical in infants and in older children suffering from inanition. N.T. 5/2/05, at 39-41.</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[138,1300,1158,680]]]'>Dr. Hood further testified that it took several hours for P.B. to die, but also stated that it was difficult to assign a single cause of death. Instead of a single cause of death such as blunt head trauma or exsanguination from her ruptured liver, he opined, P.B.’s death was due to multiple factors, including the multiple blunt force traumas she suffered, inanition, and asphyxia from lying “crumpled up in a heap” jammed between the bed, the wall, and the radiator. “Putting all of that together, the multiplicity of the blunt trauma, the obvious stress the child had been under, I finally assigned her cause of death as multiple blunt trauma, asphyxia, and inanition.

A.B. testified that when she was first interviewed by the police at Children’s Hospital, she had withheld the truth about the extent of the abuse and the events the <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>night of P.B.’s death because she thought that they would be returning to the apartment after being released from the hospital.

Appellant leads with a 1920s case from the New York Court of Appeals in which a father strangled his three-year-old daughter. The Court of Appeals remarkably stated, in that case, that it was doubtful “whether the defendant intended to kill his daughter; ... it is far more consistent with the evidence that she died as a result of his bad temper and brutal chastisement without any intent to cause her death.” <em>People v.

In addition, appellant cites to cases from Tennessee, California, and Oklahoma. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21. From these cases, appellant asks that we adopt a bright-line rule that evidence of the abuse of a child, no matter how severe, is <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>legally insufficient, in and of itself, to support a finding of first-degree murder.</p>
    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[135,453,1158,683]]]'>Appellant argues that some additional proof, above and beyond the deadly physical abuse of a child, is required. As examples of such additional proof, appellant suggests a verbal confession by the abuser that his or her intent was to cause the child’s death, or some action from which the only possible outcome was death. In fact, appellant goes a step further in his conclusions, arguing that the fact of abuse itself should be deemed to negate a finding of specific intent to kill because the goal of all abusers, supposedly, is to punish and to continue the abuse. Killing the victim, appellant argues, would actually deprive the abuser of one of his chief pastimes and a primary emotional outlet; thus, it would be counterintuitive to find that the abuser intended to kill the victim.</p>

In <em>Tharp, </em>we affirmed the appellant’s conviction for first-degree murder arising out of the starving death of her daughter. Appellant argues that the evidence in <em>Tharp </em>was sufficient to sustain a verdict of first-degree murder because Tharp made statements confirming her intent to kill her daughter and engaged in a course of conduct “that could only lead to death,” <em>i.e. </em>starvation. Appellant’s Brief at 24. Additionally, appellant argues that Tharp evidenced her guilt by hiding her daughter’s body and informing the police that she had been kidnapped. By contrast, appellant observes that there was no evidence that he made statements indicating that he intended to kill P.B. and he never attempted to conceal her body, and he argues that P.B. could potentially have survived the abuse that he inflicted upon her. While the trial court held that the jury could conclude that appellant intended to kill P.B. solely from the fact that appellant threw P.B. into the radiator and left her to suffocate, appellant maintains that absent proof that it is “common knowledge” that those actions will result in the death of a child, the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.</p>

The Commonwealth characterizes appellant’s sufficiency argument as merely an attempt to recast the evidence in a light more favorable to appellant, arguing that appellant’s portrayal of the facts in his appellate brief is “far different from the one the jury heard and the evidence established.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 19. The facts received by the jury, the Commonwealth notes, include evidence that appellant repeatedly beat P.B. on the night of her death, then threw her headfirst across the bedroom into a cast iron radiator. Ordering A.B.2 not to help her sister, appellant then left P.B. to suffocate. From this evidence, the Commonwealth urges that the jury could reasonably conclude that appellant had formed the specific intent to kill P.B. when he picked her up and threw her into the radiator.</p>

According to the trial court, specific intent could be sustained solely on the basis of the testimony that appellant picked up three-year-old P.B. by her feet and threw her across the room and into the radiator. The trial court also found, however, that the finding of specific intent could be sustained on the basis of appellant’s course of conduct towards P.B.</p>

It is true that the medical examiner testified that a healthy three-year-old could have survived being thrown across the room and into the radiator. However, the fact that another child could have survived the act did not prevent the jury from finding that appellant acted with the specific intent to kill. Rather, it simply indicates that, had circumstances been wholly different, appellant may not have succeeded in his attempt. Moreover, appellant did more than throw the child into the radiator: he <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>also hit the child, picked her up after throwing her into the radiator, and threw her between the bed and the wall.

    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[129,604,1158,1163]]]'>In any event, sufficiency review requires examining the entire record. The jury could find that appellant’s intent to kill P.B. was further proven by the course of conduct that culminated on the night of her murder. In arguing that the evidence was insufficient because P.B.’s death was caused by suffocation rather than solely by the impact with the radiator, appellant asks this Court to draw different inferences than those available to the jury. We recently rejected a similar “one-blow” argument in <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, </em><a href="/pa/598/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="598 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="3990016" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0224-01">598 Pa. 224</a>, <a href="/pa/598/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="956 A.2d 406" data-case-ids="3990016,8207764" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0224-01,/a2d/956/0406-01">956 A.2d 406</a> (2008), which was decided after the case <em>sub judice </em>was briefed. In <em>Powell, </em>this Court held that a pattern of child abuse, culminating in an hours-long beating that ended in the child’s death, was sufficient to sustain the jury’s finding of specific intent to kill despite the medical examiner’s inability to point to a “final blow” that definitively caused the child’s death. In that case, the victim’s death was brought about by a seizure, to which the child was predisposed due to the repeated beatings and blows to the head that Powell had inflicted on him. While the child may have survived the final beating absent this preexisting condition (inflicted by Powell), we nonetheless concluded that the evidence overwhelmingly supported a finding of specific intent to kill.</p>

After starving and abusing her for months, appellant repeatedly beat P.B. on the night of her death. Later that night, when P.B. disobeyed him by looking while appellant and Geiger engaged in sex, appellant called the three-year-old over, hit her repeatedly, picked her up, threw her across the room into a cast-iron radiator, then picked her back up and threw her between the bed and the wall. Appellant then instructed <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>P.B.’s older sister not to help her get up, from which the jury could infer that appellant knew that P.B. was unable to move or to help herself. While appellant and Geiger returned to their sexual activities, unconcerned about the helpless child’s predicament, P.B. remained wedged behind the bed and radiator for hours, apparently unable to extract herself due to her injuries and weakened condition, and slowly suffocating. There P.B. remained until the next day, when Jason called the police at 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon. In the meantime, appellant went about instructing the other children to lie to the police.</p>

The fact that appellant argues that he “only” intended to abuse P.B. in the days before her murder does not mean the jury was obliged to believe that theory (for which there was no testimonial support), nor does it somehow negate a finding that he decided later to kill her. Further, the fact that a single blow would not have killed the child had the child not been in a weakened state does not show that appellant did not intend to kill the child, only that, absent the history of abuse, he may have been unsuccessful in this particular attempt.</p>

The statute draws no such distinction and the rule appellant poses would negate the jury’s function. The jury is no less able to measure the totality of the circumstances against the settled definition of specific intent in child-abuse murders than it is in <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>other first-degree murder prosecutions. Furthermore, appellant’s attempt to characterize <em>Tharp </em>as establishing this heightened standard ignores that fact that, while <em>Tharp </em>held that the evidence was sufficient to establish sufficient intent under its specific circumstances, <em>Tharp </em>did not purport to render a legislative-type determination that only those circumstances could be sufficient. Indeed, imposing such a standard would be absurd, considering the multiplicity of ways in which abusers can torment, and ultimately kill, their victims. <em>Tharp </em>illustrates one factual record supporting a specific intent to kill.

Within broad constitutional parameters, the states are free to define crimes as they see fit. In addition to the fact that these cases do not bind us, select references to individual case circumstances means little absent some understanding of the way a state approaches first-degree murder. For example, in <em>State v. Brown, </em>a case prominently discussed by appellant, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that “the deliberation necessary to establish first-degree murder cannot be formed in an instant.” <em>State v.

But, it is well-established in Pennsylvania law that the specific intent to kill can be formed in a fraction of a second, and may be found whenever the defendant acts with a conscious purpose to bring about the death of the victim. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Beyond that, in Pennsylvania, it is a jury question. Further, <em>Midgett, </em>decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1987, was overturned by statute one year later when the Arkansas legislature responded to <em>Midgett’s </em>reasoning by amending the first-degree murder statute to include “knowingly causing the death of a person fourteen or younger <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>under circumstances manifesting cruel and malicious indifference to the value of human life.” <em>Davis v.

In any event, as we have noted, the evidence here showed not only a specific blow, but immediate prior abuse, a failure to so much as check on the child, and appellant’s forbidding the victim’s sister from going to her assistance.

Appellant argues that the charge was inappropriate because he does not believe that his abuse of P.B. was a “factual predicate” establishing that he intended to kill her. Appellant offers two hypothetical situations as examples of fact-patterns that would, in his view, establish such a factual predicate for the charge: first, a situation in which the defendant’s course of conduct could only result in death; and second, a circumstance where the defendant explicitly expresses his or her desire to kill the victim.

Furthermore, the evidence showed that appellant took four young girls into his home and turned that home into a virtual torture chamber, inflicting horrific abuse upon them for months. Appellant’s ongoing actions regarding the children revealed his course of conduct, which <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>culminated in the death of P.B. The Commonwealth argued that the jury should infer from this evidence that appellant intended not only to kill P.B., but to do so in a prolonged and painful way. Appellant now counters that the jury was obligated to infer that he took such pleasure in abusing P.B. that he would never wish to kill her and deprive himself of that pastime. Appellant was, of course, free to argue whatever inferences he chose to the jury, but the jury was equally free to disbelieve his claims. It is neither self-evident nor logical that sustained child abuse and an intention to kill are mutually exclusive. The jury in this case was free to conclude that a course of conduct involving abusing, starving, isolating and terrorizing a helpless three-year-old child indicates an intention to kill that child. We see no logical reason to transform appellant’s fact-specific argument into a point of law, and to forbid future juries from drawing their own inferences from the evidence presented. Moreover, the charge properly left it to the jury to determine whether there was a course of conduct, and if so, whether that tended to prove specific intent to kill.

Appellant posits that there was no medical evidence presented establishing that P.B. suffered physical pain during the hours in which she was trapped and suffocating after appellant threw her into the radiator. He therefore argues that there was no evidence of pain and suffering and, consequently, no evidence to support a finding of torture. Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that his abuse of P.B. could be considered as proof of torture. Appellant contends that evidence of the pain and suffering he inflicted over the months prior to P.B.’s death cannot support the torture aggravator because the suffering must be inflicted concurrently with the final event that brings <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>about the victim’s death. Thus, in appellant’s view, the acts of abuse in the months, days, and hours leading up to P.B.’s death cannot constitute acts of torture for purposes of establishing the aggravator. In his view, it is only the “single blow” to the child and her subsequent hours trapped between the bed and the wall that may be considered in assessing whether the murder was committed by means of torture. Appellant also downplays the seriousness of the abuse he inflicted upon P.B., characterizing other cases where the torture aggravator has been upheld by this court as “much more egregious.” He urges this Court to find that the facts in the instant case cannot establish torture when we have held, in previous cases, insufficient evidence in “more agonizing deaths than appellant’s victim suffered.” Appellant’s Brief at 32, 34.</p>

      <em>Pursell </em>ties its formulation of “concurrent acts” to the time period in which the “actual commission of the offense” occurred. What is truly at issue, then, is how to define the commission of the offense, and not the moment of death alone. In <em>Pursell, </em>the offense was begun and completed in a brief period of time, temporally linking the acts of torture with the moment of death in that case. However, as <em>Powell, Daniels, </em>and <em>Heidnik </em>recognize, murders committed by means of torture are often not so expeditiously carried out. Indeed, some of the more “conscienceless or pitiless” crimes that are most “unnecessarily painful to the victim” are those in which the offense is committed over an extended period of time.</p>

On the first question it is clear that the jury may properly consider acts by the defendant that ultimately contributed to the victim’s death. Here, the medical evidence established that the abuse appellant inflicted upon P.B. before the night when he carried out the final act directly contributed to her death. The jury considered those acts— appellant’s course of conduct — as evidence of appellant’s intent to kill. It would be illogical to permit the jury to consider the defendant’s course of conduct as part of the murder itself for the purpose of evaluating specific intent, and then prevent the jury from considering the very same course of conduct as part of the “actual commission of the offense” for purposes of the torture aggravator. While torture may often occur contemporaneously with the killing blow or blows, this is not necessarily required — as reflected in our case law as, for example, when the victim is held against his or her will and terrorized for a lengthy period of time. It would defy logic and common sense to interpret the statute so that defendants who inflict pain and suffering over a course of time on their victims are deemed immune from the aggravator.</p>

The beatings and neglect appellant inflicted upon P.B. took place over the course of months and caused bruises, abrasions, and scars over most of her body. She suffered sudden and serious weight loss, and was underweight from lack of food. The severe physical and emotional abuse caused her to suffer from inanition, making her more susceptible to severe injury resulting from further abuse. The months of torture then culminated on the night of the killing, as appellant beat P.B. with an extension cord in a cold shower, then beat her again later that evening, just before throwing her into the radiator with sufficient force to leave indentations in her face and head. Appellant then threw the three-year-old behind the bed, where she slowly suffocated over the course of hours.

As to the second murder victim, the evidence was deemed sufficient to prove torture based upon evidence that Heidnik administered electrical shocks to her body "while she lay in a water-filled pit and screamed in agony." <em>Id. </em>at 692-93.</p>
