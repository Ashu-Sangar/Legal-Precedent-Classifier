In resolving these issues, the trial court noted, under <em>Pollock’s Estate, </em>appellant was correct that the will created a debtor-creditor relationship between appellant and Blechstein.

Stephano, and through Stephen C.S.’s estate, to Daniel T. Stephano, Stephen C.S.’s son (Appellant). Specifically, the gifts bequeathed to Stephen C.S. (and after his death, Appellant), were a number of shares of stock in a family-owned business. The stock was given on the condition, however, that certain portions of its proceeds be paid to Stephen C.S.’s sister (and, therefore, Appellant’s aunt) Penelope S. Blechstein (Appellee), for life. Appellant currently has control of the subject securities and the responsibility to pay the dividends from those securities to Appellee. Thus, the question presented in this appeal is whether Appellee is a creditor to the estates, with Appellant a debtor; or, whether the arrangement created a trust, with Appellant the trustee and Appellee the beneficiary.</p>

More importantly, however, is that much of the UTC is taken or based upon the Restatement (Second) and Restatement (Third) (Tentative Draft) of Trusts. Specifically, the comment to Section 7702 recognizes that the UTC “does not attempt to distinguish express trusts from other legal relationships with respect to property....” Rather, should a situation arise where distinctions must be parsed out, the comment directs that the Restatement (Second) Sections 2 and 5 through 16C, and Restatement (Third) (Tentative Draft) Sections 2 and 5, be consulted. <em><a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.%20555" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="159 A. 555">Id.</a></em>

If, however, property is transferred to another “with” or “subject to” a direction that the payment or payments are to be made to a third person out of the transferred property or its product or proceeds, a trust and not an equitable charge is created. This is because the transferor manifests an intention to impose a duty on the transferee to deal with the property, in part at least, for the benefit of the third person.</blockquote>

Indeed, Stephen C.S., and after his death, Daniel (Appellant), were given shares of stock in a family-owned business with the explicit obligation to pay proceeds from the securities to Appellee, Penelope Blechstein. To mirror the language of Sections 7731 and 7732, as to this life estate held by Appellee: (1) Appellant was given securities; (2) he was obligated to pay Appellee proceeds from those securities; (3) Appellee was the definite beneficiary of such a transaction; and (4) neither Appellant nor Appellee were the sole trustees and beneficiaries to the life estate.</p>

To me, the language of Sections 7731 and 7732, coupled with the statutory references to the Restatements, which are to be employed when distinctions between trusts and other circumstances must be made, suggests that under the UTC, the testamentary devise at issue herein may have created a trust for Appellee’s benefit. At the very least, the recent addition of the UTC to Pennsylvania statutory law undermines the Majority’s re-affirmance of <em>Pollock’s Estate, </em>and its conclusion that “[Wjhere property is bequeathed with a condition to pay a third party a certain sum from the property, and the will’s language and testator’s intent do not clearly create a trust, a debtor-creditor relationship will be presumed.” Maj. Op. at 534, 981 A.2d at 142. Thus, while I concur that, on the facts of this case and the status of the law as it existed in 1945 when the devise was created, a debtor-creditor relationship exists, I distance myself from the portion of the Majority Opinion that re-affirms <em>Pollock’s Estate </em>beyond the effective date of Act 98.</p>
