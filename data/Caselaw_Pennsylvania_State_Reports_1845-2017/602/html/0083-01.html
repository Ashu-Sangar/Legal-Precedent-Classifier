The lots are in an area zoned R-10 residential district. In June of 2005, Woodstock filed two separate applications with the Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections (“L &amp; I”) seeking to construct a three-story, single family home on each of the lots. L &amp; I denied the permits because each residence did not have a roofed-over front porch with usable space underneath and failed to meet certain open area requirements of the Code. Woodstock appealed to the Zoning Hearing Board of Philadelphia (“Board”) seeking a dimensional variance with respect to each lot. The Board conducted a hearing on August 17, 2005.</p>
    <p id="b168-8" data-blocks='[["BL_168.8",168,[302,2271,1150,95]],["BL_169.1",169,[133,313,1152,679]]]'>Prior to the hearing, Gary Spahn (one of the appellants herein) submitted a letter in opposition to the request. At the <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>hearing, the parties agreed that the front porch was not at issue but was the result of a clerical/labeling error on the design plans and the matter proceeded solely on the question of the open area requirements. The Code requires a minimum open area of 30% for lots in an area zoned R-10. The plans submitted by Woodstock only provided for an open area of 19% with respect to each lot. Spahn testified in opposition to the granting of the dimensional variance at the hearing. Following the hearing, the Board granted a variance with respect to each lot, concluding that Woodstock had presented sufficient evidence to meet the criteria necessary for a variance. Spahn appealed the grant of both variances and the trial court consolidated the appeals.</p>
    <p id="b169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[133,1016,1152,633]]]'>Before the trial court Woodstock filed a motion to quash the appeals on the basis that Spahn was not an aggrieved person having standing to appeal the Board’s decision. Woodstock argued that the General Assembly’s addition of Section 17.1 to the Home Rule Act eliminated the general standing granted to any taxpayer under Section 14-1807 of the Code to appeal a decision of the Board. The trial court agreed with Woodstock’s interpretation of Section 17.1 and pointed out that Spahn did not present evidence to establish himself as an aggrieved party. Therefore, the trial court granted Woodstock’s motion to quash the appeals on the basis that Spahn did not have standing to pursue them. Spahn appealed.</p>

As to Spahn’s first argument, that Section 17.1 did not eliminate taxpayer standing, the court majority explained that it saw “no purpose” of the language of Section 17.1 “other than to limit the broad grant of general taxpayer standing provided” in the Code. <em><a href="/a2d/922/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="922 A.2d 24" data-case-ids="8305829" data-case-paths="/a2d/922/0024-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/922/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="922 A.2d 24" data-case-ids="8305829" data-case-paths="/a2d/922/0024-01">at 28</a>. The court further noted that Section 17.1 limited the definition of “aggrieved person” by specifically excluding “taxpayer” from its definition. Therefore, “under Section 17.1, only a taxpayer with an interest that could be ‘detrimentally’ affected by a decision of an entity such as the Board has standing to appeal.” <em><a href="/a2d/922/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="922 A.2d 24" data-case-ids="8305829" data-case-paths="/a2d/922/0024-01">Id.</a></em>

The intent of Section 17.1 was to give the specific power of standing to appeal a decision of a zoning hearing board within a city of the first class to the governing body vested with legislative powers and to “aggrieved persons.” Notably, the statute does not define the term “aggrieved person” except to state what an aggrieved person is not — a taxpayer that has not been detrimentally harmed by a zoning decision, <em>i.e., </em>taxpayers generally. Moreover, Section 17.1 is contained in the First Class City Home Rule Act and Philadelphia presently is the only city of the first class in Pennsylvania. Thus, the plain language of the section leads to the inescapable conclusion that the General Assembly intended to limit standing to appeal a zoning decision in the City to two classes- — -the governing body <em>and </em>aggrieved persons — while specifically excluding the broader category of taxpayers. As succinctly stated by the Commonwealth Court, “we see no purpose of the language of Section 17.1 of the [Home Rule] Act other than to limit the broad grant of general taxpayer standing provided in Section 14-1807(1) of the Code.” <em>Spahn, </em><a href="/a2d/922/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="922 A.2d 24" data-case-ids="8305829" data-case-paths="/a2d/922/0024-01">922 A.2d at 28</a>.

As we have concluded that Section 17.1 incorporated the concept of standing as set forth in <em>William Penn, </em>we turn to <em>William Penn </em>for guidance on this question. Under <em>William Penn, </em>a party is aggrieved if the party can show an interest that is substantial, direct, and immediate. <em>Id. </em>at 280. In order to be substantial, there must be some discernible effect on some interest other than the abstract interest all citizens have in the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 282.

These purposes while laudable, are no different from the abstract interest that all citizens have in the outcome of the proceedings.

      <em>Trust </em>in support of their argument that the concept of “aggrievement” has been expanded when civic associations are involved and civic associations should be granted standing in cases in which their mission or purpose is implicated. However, these cases are factually distinguishable from the matters before this Court. The lower courts determined that the groups involved would be aggrieved by the challenged decision under <em>William Penn </em>and did not indicate a grant of standing to civic associations generally. Thus, in <em>Society Hill </em>the court pointed out that the association was intimately involved in the negotiations for the preservation of facades of the townhouses in the Society Hill area and that the associations had participated in the public hearings. Furthermore, the association’s purpose was to promote preservation of historic buildings in the Society Hill area of Philadelphia. <em>Society Hill, </em><a href="/a2d/905/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="905 A.2d 579" data-case-ids="8468194" data-case-paths="/a2d/905/0579-01">905 A.2d at 587</a>. In <em>Pittsburgh Trust, </em>the court relied on the fact that the location of the Trust offices were within 200 feet of the proposed relocation of an arcade and that the Trust had made a substantial financial investment in the surrounding area before the court found that the Trust had standing. Contrary to the suggestion of appellants, <em>Society Hill </em>or <em>Pittsburgh Trust </em>do not support the assertion that a civic association does not have to meet the <em>William Penn </em>“aggrieved” party requirements in order to have standing.</p>

Additionally, according to the construction of that provision adopted by both the majority and Justice Baer, it removes the power of first class cities broadly to provide for taxpayer standing relative to zoning disputes. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 101-02, 977 A.2d at 1143; Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, at 118-19, 977 A.2d at 1153 (Baer, J.). One argument interposed against the enforceability of the act as interpreted thusly is that taxpayer standing within a first class city is a matter of purely local concern and, therefore, the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter’s provision in this regard may not be superseded by state law. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 39. The majority answers this contention by observing that standing to pursue a zoning appeal in the state’s Unified Judicial System has a statewide dynamic, as it defines the class of parties authorized to invoke the resources of the Commonwealth’s judiciary as a whole, including its appellate courts. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 103-04, 977 A.2d at 1144.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Thus, it is apparent that, although in <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>one sense Section 2 of Act 193 is limited to amending the specific powers of first class cities — or their governing bodies — on matters of purely local interest, in a broader sense that provision (and only that provision) touches on matters of statewide concern.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[301,605,1152,524]]]'>This is not to say that the General Assembly could never include two provisions in a single bill where only one has a statewide dynamic. Here, however, the two substantive sections of Act 193 address essentially unrelated topics, and the second section only controls access to a branch of the Commonwealth’s government. Under these circumstances, I would conclude that the latter provision is simply too far removed from the former to satisfy the germaneness test that this Court has developed in relation to Article III, Section 3’s single-subject rule.</p>
    <p id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[300,1152,1157,527]]]'>Finally, under the above analysis I would find that the bill violates the single-subject rule regardless of whether Section 2’s narrow definition of “aggrieved person” was intended to eliminate taxpayer standing as granted by Section 14-2807 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. This is because, either way, Section 2 grants standing to a city entity (the City Council) that did not previously have standing. Accordingly, I would decline to reach the statutory construction issue. In all other respects I join Justice Baer’s concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>

Although, for the reasons below, I ultimately find it unnecessary to determine whether the Legislature intended, through Section 2 of the bill, to eliminate taxpayer standing in first-class cities, and although I agree with the majority's observations concerning the statute's statewide effect, I do not believe it is necessary to predicate the statute’s enforceability in this respect on its non-local ramifications. As a general rule, the Legislature may restrict a city’s home rule powers by simply amending the appropriate enabling act, <em>see Ortiz v.
