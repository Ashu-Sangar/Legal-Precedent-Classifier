Respectfully, this view neither attempts to square itself with the PCRA nor does it address the fundamental question of arbitrariness. On the latter point, most, if not all, defendants would like as many avenues of review (including new lawyers with each round) as possible. It is difficult to see how it could ever be fair to allow some, but not all, of such defendants an extra round of attack. Certainly, the PCRA does not act so arbitrarily: the rules there apply to all defendants.
