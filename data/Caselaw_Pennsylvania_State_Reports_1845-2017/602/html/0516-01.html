Instead, Appellant argued that the so called “ten month rule” applied by the Secretary should be treated as a mere presumption that may be rebutted by a litigant who persuades the court that adding vacancies to the ballot less than ten months before the municipal election will not cause prejudice.

Appellant’s populist notion that all vacancies in public office should be resolved by election is a laudable democratic ideal but it is not the procedure codified in our Constitution. Instead, Article 5 § 13(b) provides that vacancies should be filled by election <em>only </em>when they occur more than ten months before the general election. This ten month rule serves its own democratic policy which we may not ignore. Potential candidates need time to decide to run and set up an election organization to effectuate the task of securing a place on the ballot. Undoubtedly, some individuals may be well-equipped to launch a campaign with minimal notice. But advance notice of vacancies equalizes opportunity, while the last-minute placement of an unexpected seat on the ballot tends to negate that equalization. Appellant’s argument that courts should apply an <em>ad hoc </em>rebuttable presumption analysis to the question of whether a vacancy should be filled <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>by election or gubernatorial appointment undermines the need for bright-line foreseeability and is therefore untenable.</p>

The mathematics are clear enough.” 493 A.2d at 688. In this case, Judge Heckler resigned on February 11, 2009, approximately nine months before the 2009 municipal election. Judge Heckler did not reach mandatory retirement age in 2009 and his judicial term was not scheduled to expire in 2009. Therefore, the vacancy his resignation created was “unanticipated” and this Court’s decision in <em>Jackson </em>controls. Appellant does not have a clear right to relief and the Commonwealth Court did not err in denying Appellant’s petition for writ of mandamus.</p>
