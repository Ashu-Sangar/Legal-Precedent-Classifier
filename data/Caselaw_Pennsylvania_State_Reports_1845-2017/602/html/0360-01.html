Hargrove was six months pregnant with Appellant’s child at the time. On April 1,1987, Riggins physically attacked Hargrove, causing serious injury, and threatened future harm. Two days later, Appellant learned that Riggins was in Hargrove’s Philadelphia neighborhood, and ran there, purportedly to protect Hargrove. When Appellant was running down North Lambert Street, he spotted Riggins sitting in a parked blue Cadillac in the middle of the street. As Appellant continued running toward the Cadillac, he began shooting his .38 caliber revolver at Riggins. Just as Appellant fired, 57 year-old Gordon Russell, who was walking down the street carrying groceries, passed between Appellant and Riggins, and suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the back. Immediately thereafter, Riggins fled the scene in her vehicle and Appellant fled on foot. Appellant was not apprehended until nearly two weeks later, and was charged with first degree murder and related offenses.</p>

Harrell testified that he observed Appellant holding a gun as he moved toward Russell, Riggins, and the blue Cadillac on North Lambert Street. He explained that he heard gunshots and then saw Russell fall to the ground. Harrell did not see any gunshots being fired from the Cadillac. Rivers testified that she was looking out the window of her residence when she saw a young boy shooting at a blue car. She corroborated Harrell’s testimony that no shots were fired from the vehicle. <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>While Rivers did not see the face of the shooter, the physical description she gave to police matched Appellant.

It noted that the fact that Appellant’s intended victim, Rig-gins, paid a portion of Appellant’s legal fees did not cause trial counsel to decline to call her as a witness. According to the trial court, trial counsel did not call Riggins to testify because her purported testimony, which indicated that Appellant fired the fatal shots by accident, was inconsistent with Appellant’s defense that Riggins was the shooter. The court further rejected Appellant’s contention that trial counsel was motivated only by the payment of fees. It relied on trial counsel’s October 4, 1989 letter to the court, which stated that he filed post-trial motions “as a matter of courtesy” because Appellant’s family lacked funds, and requested that the Commonwealth be charged with the costs of transcribing the notes of testimony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The PCRA court reiterated that such defenses were inconsistent with the defense theory that Riggins was the perpetrator. Moreover, the court emphasized that because Appellant had two days to “cool off’ after Riggins attacked Hargrove, there was little force to the defense of “passion and provocation.”</p>

Third degree murder is an unlawful killing of another person with malice as I defined it for you but with an intention to inflict grievous bodily injury on another person and not to take human life and yet as a result of the infliction of an injury, death does result. So, third degree murder includes any unlawful killing of a human being with malice but where no intention to actually kill exists or can reasonably and fully be inferred from the circumstances. So, if there is an unlawful killing where there’s wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences and a mind regardless of social duty but if no specific intention to kill can be inferred or collected, that is no intention to kill anyone can be inferred or collected from the facts, then the verdict should be guilty of murder in the third degree. Malice in murder of the third degree is the malicious design to do harm but not to kill. Third degree murder therefore is the unlawful taking of a human life with malice aforethought with no specific intention to kill another person but with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on another person and yet as a result of inflicting that injury death results.</blockquote>

Appellant’s first challenge is based on the assertion that the instruction improperly led the jury to believe that it could only find Appellant guilty of third degree murder if it found that he intended to inflict grievous bodily injury on another person, and death resulted. The trial court did not, however, expressly instruct the jury that such intent was mandatory for third degree murder, but instead included such intent as a valid means of establishing the requisite malice. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Here, the trial court’s instruction, when read as a whole, adequately informed the jury of the various ways of demonstrating the requisite malice in a manner sufficient to establish third degree murder. Moreover, the jury charge correctly explained that third degree murder “includes any unlawful killing of a human being with malice but where no intention to actually kill exists or can reasonably and fully be inferred from the circumstances.” N.T. 6/16/1998, at 459.

This claim is unpersuasive because a killing committed with the specific intent to kill can never constitute third degree murder. To the contrary, as the trial court instructed, first degree murder is statutorily defined as an “intentional killing,” which, in turn, is defined as “killing by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a), (d).

Respectfully, as noted, considering that trial counsel is now deceased, we fail to see the benefit of an evidentiary hearing as Appellant has not identified any witness who could establish that counsel, in fact, knowingly presented false witnesses in support of the misidentification defense. For example, Appellant has not submitted declarations from those eyewitnesses who testified on his behalf at trial that they falsely slated that Riggins was the shooter. Under these circumstances, even assuming the truth of the declarations provided, i.e., that counsel failed to adequately investigate whether Appellant shot the victim by accident, it is not self-evident that trial counsel's alternative course of presenting the defense of misidentification was unreasonable.

Furthermore, Appellant’s theory that trial counsel should have advocated that he committed a lesser offense has no support in the record.

Counsel’s only “tactic” was to avoid doing any work on this case in order to maximize the profit he ultimately received from the ever increasing fee that he was repeatedly asking his client’s mother, Ms. Hargrove and Ms. Riggins to pay.</blockquote>

I do recognize that there are good reasons to question Appellant’s version of the events, including that his primary witnesses are interested persons. Additionally, trial counsel is alleged to have done nothing in terms of investigation, yet he produced several witnesses from the local neighborhood at trial who testified that Erica Riggins was the shooter. <em>See </em>N.T., June 15, 1988, at 244-278 (testimony of Charlene McDaniels, Jamal Morrison, and Mary Morrison). There is thus a fair inference to be made that someone assisted counsel in identifying such witnesses. Such inferences, however, implicate basic matters of credibility which are properly resolved via fact finding.</p>
