Allegheny County Code, § 5-1101.02(0(2) (“Every referendum question must be binding. Nonbinding referendum questions are expressly prohibited.”). Rather than presenting a binding question, the court concluded that the Voter Referendum Question would be merely advisory.

As explained in detail below, Appellant first claims that the authority to set the rate of the Drink Tax is not solely within the province of County Council because the first sentence of § 2962(b) provides that County Council’s rate setting authority may be limited by, <em>inter alia, </em>the Home Rule Charter, which provides for referendum. Second, Appellant argues that the Drink Tax does not fall within <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>the final sentence of § 2962(b), which explicitly provides County Council with the exclusive authority to set the rates of taxation on residents.

Casey has admitted that, “if it were not for the introductory clause to the first sentence of § 2962(b), the sentence would appear to support the Board of Elections’ interpretation by placing the sole discretion for setting tax rates in the hands of the ‘governing body.’ i.e., County Council.” Casey Notice of Appeal to the Court of Common Pleas at unnumbered page 5. Casey claimed, “The introductory clause of the sentence, however, modifies the rule by making clear that Council’s power is subject not only to contrary provisions of State law, but also to contrary provisions of the County’s own Home Rule Charter.” <em>Id. </em>He contends that the Home Rule Charter limits the “governing body’s” authority to set rates of taxation because the Charter provides that “[t]he voters of the County shall have the power to propose ordinances by petition for consideration by voters of the County.” Home Rule Charter Art XII, § 2(a). He essentially argues that because the Home Rule Charter allows for voter referendum generally, then it follows that such referendum could <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>specifically limit County Council’s rate-setting authority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Given that County Council’s rate setting authority is limited under the introductory clause of the first sentence of § 2962(b), Appellant claims that the Voter Referendum Question, limiting the rate of the Drink Tax, would be binding.

The Home Rule Law defines “resident” to include any “person or other entity living in or maintaining a permanent or fixed place of abode in a municipality or conducting or engaging in a business for profit within a municipality.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 2902. Under these sentences, Appellant attempts to frame the Drink Tax as a tax on nonresidents in order to avoid the provision of § 2962(b) stating that the governing body has the exclusive authority to set the rates of taxation imposed upon residents.</p>
    <p id="b655-7" data-blocks='[["BL_655.7",655,[128,1719,1161,418]],["BL_656.1",656,[312,324,1153,786]]]'>In attempting to prove that the Drink Tax is not a tax on residents, Appellant develops the history underlying the distinction between residents and nonresidents. He notes that prior to the Home Rule Law, municipalities were limited by statewide statutes that dictated both the subjects and rates of taxes that municipalities could impose. One of the benefits of adopting home rule was that the Home Rule Law allowed municipalities to have complete authority in setting the rates <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>of taxation on residents, which provided greater flexibility on fiscal issues. Appellant emphasizes, however, that municipalities remained subject to statewide limits for taxation rates imposed on nonresidents. In addition to the second sentence of § 2962(b), Appellant notes that § 2962(f) provides that “[n]o provision of this subpart or any other statute shall limit a municipality which adopts a home rule charter from establishing its own rates of taxation upon all authorized subjects of taxation except those specified in subsection (a)(7),” which includes “[t]he fixing of the rates of nonproperty or personal taxes levied upon nonresidents.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 2962. Appellant asserts that the distinction between residents and nonresidents was intended to protect nonresidents who could not voice their opposition to unreasonable tax rates, as could residents, by voting the governing body out of office.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[313,1134,1154,949]]]'>Applying these terms to the Drink Tax, Appellant contends that the Drink Tax cannot be a tax on residents because County Council is subject to the General Assembly’s imposition of a rate cap of ten percent pursuant to 53 Pa.C.S. § 8602, <em>supra </em>note 1. Therefore, he argues that the Drink Tax cannot fall under the third sentence of § 2962(b) which states, “[t]he governing body shall not be subject to any limitation on the rates of taxation imposed upon residents.” He also argues that the Drink Tax cannot fall under the third sentence because it can be, and is, imposed on residents and nonresidents alike. Under Appellant’s logic, because the Drink Tax is not a tax on residents alone, the third sentence of § 2962(b) of the Home Rule Law does not prevent the rate of the Drink Tax from being limited by voter referendum. Therefore, if the rate of the Drink Tax can be limited by voter referendum, then the Voter Referendum Question would be binding, and thus permissible under the Allegheny County Code, in contrast to the holdings of the courts’ below.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[313,2108,1150,245]],["BL_657.1",657,[132,321,1152,192]]]'>As discussed in detail below, the County’s arguments also hinge on the three sentences of § 2962(b). In contrast to Appellant, the County concludes that the rate of the Drink Tax is within the exclusive authority of County Council because it is a tax on residents. If the rate of the Drink Tax is <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>within the authority of County Council, the County contends that any referendum attempting to set a limit on that rate is impermissible because it would be advisory, as decided by the courts below.</p>
    <p id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[132,545,1155,941]]]'>The County asserts that the first sentence of § 2962(b) merely states the general policy that the municipality may exercise any taxing authority that would be available to it if it were not a home rule municipality, unless prohibited by the constitution, a state statute, or the home rule charter. The County rejects Appellant’s implication that the inclusion of referenda procedures in the Home Rule Charter constitutes a prohibition regarding County Council’s authority to set the rates of taxation, as contemplated by the introductory clause of the first sentence of § 2962(b). The County observes that no provision of the Home Rule Charter prohibits County Council from setting the rate of the Drink Tax, but instead it merely permits ordinances to be enacted by referendum.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Therefore, the County asserts that because nothing in the first sentence of § 2962(b) indicates that a referendum could limit a governing body’s rate-setting authority, then any referendum attempting to set a rate limit would be merely impermissibly advisory.</p>

The County suggests that Appellant’s view of the term “resident” is erroneously synonymous with “voter.” Instead, the County argues that “resident” is broader, noting that it is defined to encompass “[a]ny person or other entity living in or maintaining a permanent or fixed place of abode in a municipality or conducting or engaging in a business for profit within a municipality.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 2902. The County argues that the definition in essence applies to anyone in<a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>volved in taxable, economic activity within the County including business travelers, students, and non-business travelers maintaining a “fixed place of abode,” which the County apparently interprets to include an overnight hotel stay. The only persons excluded from the term, the County suggests, would be day-trippers. Accordingly, the County asserts that the Drink Tax applies predominately to residents, under its interpretation of the term.</p>
    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.4",658,[303,753,1156,1334]]]'>Therefore, the County argues that the second sentence of § 2962(b), regarding tax rates on nonresidents, does not apply to the Drink Tax because the Drink Tax is not aimed specifically at nonresidents. The County, however, concludes that the third sentence, regarding residents, does apply to the Drink Tax because it falls almost exclusively on residents. It notes that the Commonwealth Court has prohibited referenda related to the rate of taxation on residents. Relying on <em>Musewicz v. Cordaro, </em><a href="/a2d/925/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="925 A.2d 172" data-case-ids="8303348" data-case-paths="/a2d/925/0172-01">925 A.2d 172</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2006), the County notes that the Commonwealth Court concluded that § 2962(b) superseded a provision in the relevant municipality’s home rule charter that required any millage rate increase in excess of five percent to be approved by a voter referendum. Concluding that a property tax constituted a tax on residents, the court held that referendum requirement constituted a limitation on the governing body’s authority to set the tax rate for residents, which conflicted directly with the final sentence of § 2962(b), stating “[t]he governing body shall not be subject to any limitation on the rates of taxation imposed upon residents.” The County argues that under the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Musewicz, </em>§ 2962(b) vests County Council, as the governing body, with the sole and exclusive authority to determine the rates of taxation, which makes a referendum to set limits upon the rates of taxation advisory, and thus impermissible under the Allegheny County Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

First, “voters of the County shall have the power to propose ordinances by petition for consideration by County Council.” Home Rule Charter, Article XII, § 1 (entitled “Agenda Initiative”). Section 2, entitled “Voter Referendum,” provides, “voters of the County shall have the power to propose ordinances by petition for consideration by the voters of the County.” Home Rule Charter, Article XII, § 2(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

All parties acknowledge the term “governing body” refers to County Council and does not encompass voters engaging in the referendum process. Therefore, the plain language of this portion of the sentence provides that County Council shall set the rate of taxation. There is no provision for that rate to be set by voter referendum. Indeed, Appellant Casey has admitted that without the opening provision of the <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>sentence, the tax rate would be within the exclusive authority of County Council.</p>

He claims that County Council’s ability to set the rate of taxation is limited by the phrase “[u]nless prohibited by ... provisions ... of its home rule charter” because the Home Rule Charter provides for voter referendum questions. The flaw in this reasoning is that the Home Rule Charter’s allowance of voter referenda simply does not equate to a prohibition against County Council setting the rate of taxation. Indeed, rather than prohibiting County Council from setting the rates of taxation, the Home Rule Charter charges County Council with the setting of tax rates in order to attain a balanced budget.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> The opening clause of the first sentence of § 2962(b) says nothing that suggests that County Council’s authority to set the rates of taxation could be limited by a later passed referendum, instead it speaks in terms of a prohibition of Council’s rate setting authority by a constitution, a charter, or a statute— none of which exists in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

As all parties agree that advisory referenda are not permissible under the Allegheny County Code, this referendum is likewise impermissible. Therefore, we conclude that § 2962(b) of the Home Rule Charter Law provides home rule municipalities with the authority to enact local taxes at any rate determined by the municipality’s governing body, which in this case is the Allegheny County Council, unless prohibited by the Constitution, another statute, or the home rule charter. In contrast, § 2962(b) does not suggest that a voter referendum could limit the governing body’s authority to determine the rate of taxation. Consequently, the Voter Referendum Question constitutes a nonbinding, advisory referendum because County Council has the authority, subject to any limitations placed upon it by the General Assembly, to set the rate of the Drink Tax. As the referendum question is advisory, it is impermissible under the Allegheny County Code. Allegheny County Code § 5-1101.2(C)(2).

After a hearing on the matter, the Court of Common Pleas affirmed the denial of the placement of the question on the ballot. The court based its affirmance on the same rationale used in the Voter Referendum case, finding the question to be advisory given that the power to set the rate of a tax is vested solely in County Council, not the voters. Indeed, the court filed one opinion addressing both referendum questions. Similarly, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision to keep County Council’s question off the November 2008 ballot, adopting the analysis of the Court of Common Pleas.

It notes that Article IX, § 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides that a home rule municipality “may exercise any power and perform any function not denied by this Constitution, by its home rule charter or by the General Assembly at any time.” The County, therefore, agrees with the Court of Common Pleas that the § 2962(b) vests the power to set rates of taxation with County Council. The County, however, challenges the court’s determination that the County Referendum Question constitutes an impermissible delegation of that legislative authority. The County, citing <em>Appeal of Locke, </em><a href="/pa/72/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="72 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="434662" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0491-01">72 Pa. 491</a> (1873), argues that the question is permissible because the County Referendum Question merely seeks to determine a state of facts upon <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>which an ordinance -will operate, and not to set policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Here, the County asserts, Ordinance 24 made mandatory changes in the tax policy, but made the changes dependent upon facts to be determined by the County Referendum Question.</p>

Therefore, the only fact to be determined by the voters was the method to maintain the levels either through the current mix of taxes or by abolishing the Drink Tax and increasing property taxes to obtain the same levels of revenue. Moreover, the County argues that the ordinance provides adequate standards for implementation because it is self-executing, dependent on the outcome of the referendum.</p>

A legislative body, according to the Appellees, should not be allowed to evade difficult policy choices.

Appellees observe that Article XII of the Home Rule Charter provides for three actions involving voters. First, it addresses “Agenda Initiatives” whereby voters can propose ordinances by petition to County Council. Second, the Charter provides for “Voter Referendum” where the voters, upon attaining a number of signatures at least equal to five percent of the number of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election, can place a question on the ballot. Finally, Article XII allows for amendments to the Home Rule Charter to be submitted for referendum by an Ordinance of County Council or by petition of voters.

Additionally, Appellees assert that County Council cannot confer on itself the power to initiate referendum as it attempted to do with Ordinance 23. Instead, Appellees argue that an amendment to the Home Rule Charter would be necessary to allow County Council to initiate referendum. Indeed, Appellees argue that allowing County Council to initiate referendum would change the form of government of Allegheny County, which would require an amendment to Article XII of the Home Rule Charter, addressing voter initiatives and referenda. Given that changes in the form of government are prohibited for five years following a prior change in government, 53 Pa.C.S. § 2929, Appellees argue that a new change in government would be time barred given the referendum in May 2005 to consolidate row offices in Allegheny County, which amended Article II of the Allegheny Home Rule Charter.</p>

In <em>Locke's Appeal, </em>the General Assembly passed an act allowing the residents of a ward in Philadelphia to determine if liquor licenses should be issued. The Act also provided for penalties for selling liquor without a license. The Court determined that, in enacting the legislation, the General Assembly did not improperly designate the power to make law regarding the licenses to the residents but instead merely provided for the residents to express their opinion on the issue of licenses. The court concluded that the vote did not make the law because the law already existed: “Indeed, it was not delegated to the people to <em>decide </em>anything. They simply declared their views or wishes, and when they did so, it was the <em>fiat </em>of the law, not their vote, which commanded licenses to be issued or not to be issued." <em>Id. </em>at 495-96 (emphasis in original).</p>
