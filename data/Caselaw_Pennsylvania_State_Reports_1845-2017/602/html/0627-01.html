The trial court granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment on the basis that the two-year statute of limitations for Marinari’s action began to run in 1983, when he was first diagnosed with pleural thickening, and that Marinari’s 1987 action was, therefore, untimely.</p>

As the Superior Court majority stated, “[a]ppellants and their late husbands had an opportunity to sue John Crane for increased risk and fear of cancer during the 1980s but failed to do so, despite the fact that both couples knew they were required to assert all claims for present and future harm within two years of the initial diagnosis of an asbestos-related injury.” <em><a href="/a2d/939/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="939 A.2d 388" data-case-ids="8302092" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0388-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/939/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="939 A.2d 388" data-case-ids="8302092" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0388-01">at 394</a>.

Although I acknowledge that the claim is different (inasmuch as an increased risk of developing cancer is a factually distinct injury from the actual development of cancer), I do not believe that this difference properly controls the outcome because the material point, in my view, is that this claim did not exist in the relevant time period during which the parties’ rights became vested. Specifically, when a party’s right to institute and maintain a suit arises, the legal landscape is fixed in the sense that recognized causes of action in favor of the injured party may not subsequently be removed. <em>See Ieropoli v.
