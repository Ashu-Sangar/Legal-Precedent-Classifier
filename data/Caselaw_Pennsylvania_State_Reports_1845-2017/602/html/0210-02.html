I argued that this Court should fill the void caused by legislative inaction by articulating a test for determining whether a peculiar assessment scheme would pass Uniformity Clause muster. In a footnote responsive to my concurring opinion, the Majority called my skepticism regarding the likelihood of legislative action “inexplicab[le],” and in substance argued that we should exercise judicial restraint by giving the legislature time to act in response to the <em>Clifton </em>opinion. <em><a href="/pa/600/0662-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="969 A.2d 1197" data-case-ids="4192574,7264164" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0662-01,/a2d/969/1197-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/600/0662-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="969 A.2d 1197" data-case-ids="4192574,7264164" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0662-01,/a2d/969/1197-01">at 1229, n. 44</a>.

The Court in <em>Clifton </em>quoted the concurrence, observing that “[mjore than three years ha[d] passed since it was announced that each state had to set standards and procedures for adjudicating the mental retardation of a defendant in a capital case ... no legislation ha[d] been passed to accomplish this.” <em>Clifton, </em><a href="/pa/600/0662-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="969 A.2d 1197" data-case-ids="4192574,7264164" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0662-01,/a2d/969/1197-01">969 A.2d at 1229, n. 44</a>. Accordingly, the Majority in <em>Clifton </em>argued, “While there may very well come a time when this Court will be obliged to fill a legislative void in this area, it is today’s decision that provides notice to the General Assembly to make any necessary amendments to the Commonwealth’s property assessment laws so as to ensure their constitutionality when applied in the various counties.” <em><a href="/pa/600/0662-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="969 A.2d 1197" data-case-ids="4192574,7264164" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0662-01,/a2d/969/1197-01">Id.</a> </em>The Court therefore concluded that we should give the legislature the opportunity to act.</p>

To deny the legislature this opportunity prior to any additional reassessment in Allegheny County is, in my view, “inexplicable.” As described below, to grant a stay could prevent substantial costs to the County and confusion to taxpayers, school districts, and counties across the state, with only a minor disadvantage to the prevailing Appellees who will have to wait a mere six months for enforcement of our decision, a relatively <em>de minimis </em>inconvenience given the past decade of property assessment disorder in Allegheny County.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[135,871,1159,574]]]'>As noted in my concurring opinion, the consequence of the failure to establish criteria for constitutional assessment will be that each of Pennsylvania’s sixty-seven counties, as well as the many municipalities within them, will be unsure whether their county’s current assessment is constitutional. <em>Clifton, </em><a href="/pa/600/0662-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="969 A.2d 1197" data-case-ids="4192574,7264164" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0662-01,/a2d/969/1197-01">969 A.2d at 1232</a>. Moreover, the hundreds of thousands of taxpayers and groups that would advocate on their behalf will be equally uncertain. Unnecessary lawsuits will be brought, leading to disparate decisions. Appeals will be taken, and at some point, perhaps three years from now, as was the case in <em>Miller, </em>this Court will again face this problem.</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[133,1469,1159,786]]]'>It is also worthy to look specifically at the case before us. Allegheny County has already conducted two assessments within 10 years, at the cost of millions of dollars that it and its taxpayers can ill afford. Now it is being called upon to conduct yet another assessment without the knowledge of what criteria it must meet to sustain a constitutional challenge. If history repeats itself, Allegheny County could find itself conducting a fourth assessment within several years, after either the legislature or this Court finally acts. The County and its taxpayers should not be subject to the costs of attempting to hit the moving target of constitutional uniformity, as defined first by the trial court, then by either an intermediate appellate court or this Court, or even as decided by the legislature during the pendency of the Allegheny County litigation.</p>

Moreover, I believe we can spare all of the parties and the trial court the burdens of this ongoing litigation by permitting the legislature to consider the adoption of statutory criteria.

While these disconcerting factors cannot permit this court to avoid the unpleasant duty of declaring unconstitutional a statute which violates one of the most fundamental principles of the State Constitution, yet they must be taken into consideration in determining whether the threatened emergency of serious proportions compels this court to invoke its general power to suspend or stay the operation of an injunction decree, on a modified basis, until the Legislature convenes in regular session, when it may pass the necessary enabling statute, so that in the interim the schools may have ample means to function without an injurious curtailment of revenue.</blockquote>
