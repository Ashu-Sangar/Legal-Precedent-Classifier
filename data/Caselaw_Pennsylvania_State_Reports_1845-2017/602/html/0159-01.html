In his brief, counsel stated that the question involved was: “whether there are any issues of arguable merit that could be raised on direct appeal presently before this court and whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.” Brief at 4. Counsel set forth the procedural and factual history of Santiago’s case, with citations to the record. Counsel stated that he had reviewed the entire record and concluded that Santiago’s appeal was wholly frivolous, as there were no meritorious issues to present. Counsel did not summarize his own review of the record with an eye toward possible appellate issues, but instead identified two challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence that the defendant himself had asked counsel to raise, and referred to testimony elicited at trial that is arguably supportive of Santiago’s claims. Counsel represented that he had informed Santiago that a petition to withdraw as counsel was being filed with the court; that he had forwarded a copy of the <em>Anders </em>brief to Santiago; and that he had advised Santiago of his rights to retain new counsel or to proceed <em>pro se.</em>

The Superior Court began by reviewing the three requirements that counsel must meet before he is permitted to withdraw from representation: First, counsel must petition the court for leave to withdraw and state that after making a conscientious examination of the record, he has determined that the appeal is frivolous; second, he must file a brief referring to any issues in the record of arguable merit; and <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>third, he must furnish a copy of the brief to the defendant and advise him of his right to retain new counsel or to himself raise any additional points he deems worthy of the Superior Court’s attention.

The court stated that “[a] proper <em>Anders </em>brief does not explain why issues are frivolous and does not develop arguments against appellant’s interests[,]” but rather, “articulates the issues in neutral form, cites relevant legal authorities, references appropriate portions in the record to aid the court’s review, and concludes that, after a thorough review of the record, the appeal is wholly frivolous.” <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Where the Commonwealth and counsel part ways is on the issue of whether this Court should require an attorney seeking to withdraw to explain in his or her brief why a client’s appeal is frivolous, as does the Third Circuit. The Commonwealth argues that Pennsylvania law in its current state neither requires nor prohibits such an explanation, but allows counsel to include such an argument in the brief at his or her discretion, and submits that this scheme should be left intact.</p>

In his brief in the case <em>sub judice, </em>counsel identified the claims that his client asked for inclusion in the brief and cited to testimony from the trial that arguably supported those claims. Counsel did not, however, advert to his own review of the record or flag anything in the record that he himself saw as having some chance of prevailing on appeal, but which he ultimately rejected as frivolous. Nor did counsel state that there were no such references for him to make.

In this context, we believe that there is real value in putting pen to paper. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, the task of articulating reasons can shed new light on what may at first appear to be an open-and-shut issue. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/488/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="488 U.S. 75" data-case-ids="1494770" data-case-paths="/us/488/0075-01">488 U.S. 75</a>, 81 n. 4, <a href="/us/488/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="488 U.S. 75" data-case-ids="1494770" data-case-paths="/us/488/0075-01">109 S.Ct. 346</a>, <a href="/us/488/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="488 U.S. 75" data-case-ids="1494770" data-case-paths="/us/488/0075-01">102 L.Ed.2d 300</a> (1988). It can also reveal to counsel previously unrecognized aspects of the record or the law and thereby provide a safeguard against a hastily-drawn or mistaken conclusion of frivolity. <em>See McCoy, </em><a href="/us/486/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="486 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="6218763" data-case-paths="/us/486/0429-01">486 U.S. at 442</a>, <a href="/us/486/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="486 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="6218763" data-case-paths="/us/486/0429-01">108 S.Ct. 1895</a>. In addition, we believe that it is often the case that the basis for an attorney’s opinion that an appeal is frivolous is not readily apparent, and that accordingly, counsel’s explanation will significantly assist the courts in passing upon the soundness of counsel’s conclusion, which, in turn, vindicates the right to counsel.</p>
