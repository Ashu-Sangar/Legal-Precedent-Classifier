As will be discussed in more detail below, a plaintiff pursuing a case under the malfunction theory can assert a successful strict product liability claim based purely on circumstantial evidence in cases where the allegedly defective product has been destroyed or is otherwise unavailable. Although the plaintiff does not have to specify the defect in the product, the plaintiff nonetheless must present evidence from which a jury can infer the elements of a strict liability action, beyond mere speculation. In this case, the plaintiffs sued numerous defendants that they alleged were liable for an explosion and fire in February 2001, at a particleboard plant. The only remaining defendant at this juncture is the manufacturer of the factory’s spark detection system, which plaintiffs allege malfunctioned when it failed to activate as intended, precipitating the catastrophe. The trial court granted summary judgment to the manufacturer of the spark detection system, and the Superior Court affirmed. We affirm the decision based on the standard principle of summary judgment that a plaintiff must establish a genuine issue of material fact as to each element of the plaintiffs cause of action challenged in the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. In this case, the defendant chai<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>lenged the plaintiffs’ ability to establish that the product’s allegedly defective condition existed when it left the manufacturer’s control, in light of the plaintiffs’ admission that the product functioned properly for ten years prior to the incident in question. Absent some evidence, direct or circumstantial, to explain how the product could both function properly prior to the accident and be defective at the time of delivery, the plaintiffs failed to meet the required element of a strict liability claim that the product was defective when it left the manufacturer’s control. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[134,958,1159,1412]]]'>In 1991, Allegheny Particleboard, Inc. (API) purchased a spark detection system from GreCon Electronics, Inc. (Manufacturer) for its Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania particleboard manufacturing plant. The system was designed with multiple sensors to detect sparks along a conveyor belt system carrying combustible raw materials. If the sensors detected sparks or a heat source, the system would respond by sounding an alarm, triggering a water deluge, and, at times, other measures, such as reversing the direction of the conveyor belt, depending on which sensor was triggered. API performed all maintenance on the system, save for one service call Manufacturer made to the plant in 1993. Indeed, the plaintiffs in this case admitted that the “evidence of record establishes that, prior to February 13, 2001, the [Manufacturer’s] detection system had functioned properly.” Plaintiffs Response to [Manufacturer’s] Motion for Summary Judgment, ¶ 13. In this regard, one of the named plaintiffs testified at his deposition that the sensors in question had activated properly during “numerous other fires” and a prior explosion at the plant.

It is alleged that sparks from that operation entered the plant through a gap in the wall and fell onto one of the conveyors transporting the combustible materials for the particleboard. Apparently, employees of the plant extinguished several areas of smoldering material inside the plant. Nonetheless, hours later, several of API’s plant employees saw a glowing ember the size of a small football on the conveyor. Based upon the location where the ember was observed, Plaintiffs assert that it would have passed at least the fourth and fifth sensors of the detection system. However, none of the five sensors activated a response to the ember. An explosion and fire resulted, killing Gregory Engelken and James Covert and severely injuring Plaintiffs Barnish, Bussard, and Johnson.</p>

General Motors Corp., </em><a href="/ark/287/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="287 Ark. 390" data-case-ids="1876604" data-case-paths="/ark/287/0390-01">287 Ark. 390</a>, <a href="/ark/287/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="699 S.W.2d 741" data-case-ids="1876604,1876618" data-case-paths="/ark/287/0390-01,/ark/287/0382-01">699 S.W.2d 741</a>, 743 (1985)(“Strictly speaking, since proof of negligence is not in issue, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>has no application to strict liability; but the inferences which are the core of the doctrine remain, and are no less applicable.”). First, the “occurrence of a malfunction” is merely circumstantial evidence that the product had a defect, even though the defect cannot be identified. The second element in the proof of a malfunction theory case, which is evidence eliminating abnormal use or reasonable, secondary causes, also helps to establish the first element of a standard strict liability case, the existence of a defect. By demonstrating the absence of other potential causes for the malfunction, the plaintiff allows the jury to infer the existence of defect from the fact of a malfunction. For example, by presenting a case free of abnormal uses, such as using the product for an unintended purpose, the plaintiff can demonstrate that the product failed to perform as a reasonable customer would expect; thus, that it malfunctioned. Similarly, by eliminating other reasonable secondary causes, a plaintiff allows the jury to infer that a defect in the product caused the malfunction, as opposed, for example, to operator error or failure to service the equipment. Similarly, by presenting a <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>case free of “abnormal uses” by the plaintiff and free of “other reasonable secondary causes,” a plaintiff can establish through inference from circumstantial evidence the second and third elements of a 402A case, that the alleged defect caused the injury (as opposed to another cause) and that the defect existed when it left the manufacturer’s control (as opposed to developing after the product left the manufacturer’s control).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

In such a case, no reasonable jury could infer that an unspecified defect caused a malfunction when the more likely explanation is the abnormal use. Similarly, if the plaintiffs theory of the case includes another cause for the malfunction such as a improper maintenance or substantial wear and tear from regular use, a reasonable jury could not conclude that the product was defective at the time of delivery when facts presented by the plaintiff suggest a cause for the malfunction unrelated to the alleged, unspecified defect.</p>

The age of an allegedly defective product must be considered in light of its expected useful life and the stress to which it has been subjected. In most cases, the weighing of these factors should be left to the finder of fact. But in certain situations the prolonged use factor may loom so large as to obscure all others in a case.

We note that the term '‘case-in-chief” is often used to signify the stage of trial where the plaintiff presents its case to the judge or jury.

In <em>Dansak, </em>the plaintiff, a convenience store employee, suffered injury while unloading glass bottles of soda, one of which was broken.

Indeed, this argument was suggested during oral argument before this Court; however, for purposes of reviewing a trial court's decision on a summary judgment motion, we are limited to the evidence properly before that court. Our review of the filings at the summary judgment stage do not reveal any suggestion that sensors four and five were not involved in the prior successful uses of the system. Instead, the testimony of Plaintiff Barnish suggests just the opposite, <em>see. supra, </em>at 540.</p>

This is my main point of difference, as I believe it was Appellant’s burden to address ten years’ wear and tear as an obvious possible cause of the malfunction. Indeed, I regard the prolonged-use factor in a malfunction-theory case, which the majority treats as dispositive, and the other-causes aspect, as being integrally interrelated. <em>Accord Barnish v.

I also differ with the majority to the degree it suggests that product inactivity or failure during expected lifespan is necessarily sufficient to create a jury issue, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 421-22, 980 A.2d at 547-48, since, for example, neither of these circumstances, in and of itself, accounts for the possibility that the system was damaged during its prolonged period of use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

For example, in this case, Appellants take the position that, as long as they do not mention any potential alternate causes for the failure of the fire suppression system at the pre-trial stage, apparently- no matter how obvious or likely the alternative causes, they are entitled to a jury trial. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for Appellants at 9-11. It is a plaintiff's burden, however, to advance a <em>prima facie </em>case of product defect, and, as the majority explains, malfunction theory functions merely as a principle channeling the use of circumstantial evidence and does not alter the overall burden allocation. Therefore, in a case in which the plaintiff relies on malfunction theory, where there are alternate causes which appear as or more likely as a possible product defect to have resulted in a malfunction, the plaintiff must address them in order to state a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>

Because of the multitude of factors that could affect a product during a decade of use, it seems to me that it would be very difficult for a plaintiff to create a jury issue under malfunction theory after such extended period. At a minimum, I believe, the plaintiff would need to present evidence demonstrating how the product was protected from damage, inspected, and maintained throughout the period of its use.</p>
