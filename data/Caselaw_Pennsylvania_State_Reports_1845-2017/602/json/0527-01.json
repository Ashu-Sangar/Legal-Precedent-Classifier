        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThis dispute arose out of Stephen X. Stephano\u2019s testamentary trust which was administered by his son, Constantine, and after Constantine\u2019s death, by Constantine\u2019s son, Stephen C.S. Stephen C.S. has passed away, and his son Daniel, appellant herein, has served as both executor of Stephen C.S.\u2019s estate and trustee of Stephen X.\u2019s- trust. Penelope Blechstein is appellant\u2019s aunt and Stephen X.\u2019s granddaughter.\nStephen X.\u2019s will created the trust, funded by the closely-held, family corporation, \u201cStephano Brothers.\u201d The will provided the trust would terminate on the death of certain listed individuals, at which time \u201cthe Trustees shall divide [his] estate into two equal parts.\u201d Original Record, Petition for Declaratory Judgment to Determine Nature of Penelope Blechstein\u2019s Interest, Nos. 58981 and 970526, Montgomery County Orphan\u2019s Court, Exhibit D (Stephen X.\u2019s Will), at 3. Constantine was given the power of appointment over his part of the trust estate, Id., at 3-4, which he exercised in the Fourth Item of his own will, stating, in pertinent part:\nBy virtue of the power granted to me by the will of my father, Stephen Stephano, ... I hereby appoint my son, Stephen C.S. Stephano, to receive all of the principal of the [residuary] trust established by that will, which I have the power to transmit; and direct that the said principal be paid, transferred and delivered to my said son and his heirs absolutely and forever, if he is living when the said trust terminates....\nId., Exhibit A (Constantine\u2019s Will), at 3. Additionally, Constantine appointed Stephen C.S. as beneficiary of Stephen X.\u2019s residuary trust, \u201csubject to the condition, ... that all ... dividends on one-third of the shares of the preferred stock ... herein appointed shall be paid to my daughter, Penelope S. Blechstein, for and during her life.\u201d Id.\nIn addition to the stock interest in Stephen X.\u2019s residuary trust, in the Third Item of his will, Constantine gave Stephen C.S. the stock he owned outright-at the time of his death. This devise was given \u201csubject to the condition ... that all of the dividends on all of the shares of preferred stock ... shall be paid to my daughter, Penelope S. Blechstein, for and during the term of her life.\u201d Id., at 2. This item further provided if Stephen C.S. did not survive Constantine, the stock would go to Stephen C.S.\u2019s male issue, with the same condition to pay dividends to Blechstein; only if Stephen C.S. had no male issue would the stock itself go to Blechstein, or to her surviving male issue, per stirpes.\nStephen X.\u2019s trust terminated in 1993, and litigation surrounding the trust and Constantine\u2019s will began in 1995. Blechstein claimed Constantine\u2019s will created a trust, of which she was beneficiary; she sought an account of Stephen C.S. as trustee. The trial court found Blechstein had standing to seek an account, but left open the question of whether Constantine\u2019s will, with the conditions to pay her dividends, created a trust in Blechstein\u2019s favor, and if so, the value to her. See Trial Court Opinion, 4/7/06, at 3 (citing Stephano Trust, 15 Fiduc.Rep.2d 348 (1995)).\nMost recently, appellant filed a petition for declaratory judgment to have the trial court determine the nature of Blechstein\u2019s interests. Appellant relied on In re Pollock\u2019s Estate, 306 Pa. 301, 159 A. 555 (1932), in which this Court held a bequest subject to the condition the beneficiary pay dividends to the decedent\u2019s wife for her lifetime was not a trust. Id., at 559 (\u201cIn all cases of acceptance of a gift made upon condition that the legatee pay certain debts or legacies, the legatee assumes a personal responsibility to pay; the relationship created is one of debtor and creditor.\u201d). Appellant contends Constantine did not intend to create a trust; the provisions in Constantine\u2019s will created a debtor-creditor relationship, or equitable charge.\nOn April 7, 2006, the trial court issued an opinion construing the two provisions of Constantine\u2019s will \u2014 the one devising the stock in Stephen X.\u2019s residuary trust to Stephen C.S., and the other devising Constantine\u2019s stocks to Stephen C.S., both with the obligation to pay Blechstein a portion of the stocks\u2019 dividends \u2014 as creating a trust for her benefit. In resolving these issues, the trial court noted, under Pollock\u2019s Estate, appellant was correct that the will created a debtor-creditor relationship between appellant and Blechstein. However, the trial court declined to follow Pollock\u2019s Estate. Instead, the court relied on the subsequently created Restatement of Trusts as instructing that Blechstein\u2019s position \u2014 that a trust was created for her benefit \u2014 was correct.\nSpecifically, the trial court relied on three comments in various enactments of the Restatement of Trusts distinguishing a trust from an equitable charge. See Restatement (First) of Trusts \u00a7 10 (\u201cAn equitable charge is not a trust.\u201d). First, the trial court cited Comment f to \u00a7 10 of the First Restatement, which provides, in relevant part:\n[Wjhere property is transferred to another with a direction to pay to a third person a certain sum out of the property or its proceeds, or \u201csubject to the payment from the property or its proceeds,\u201d or \u201cpaying from the property or its proceeds\u201d such sums, a trust and not an equitable charge is created, since the transferor thereby manifests an intention to impose a duty upon the transferee to deal with the property in part at least for the benefit of the third person.\nId., \u00a7 10 cmt. f. The trial court also relied on \u00a7 11, Comment b, which states \u201c[i]n the absence of other evidence a transfer of property \u2018upon condition\u2019 that it be dealt with in a manner beneficial to a third person indicates an intention to create a trust rather than an intention to make a transfer upon condition.\u201d Id., \u00a7 11 cmt. b. Finally, the trial court relied on \u00a7 5, Comment h of the Restatement\u2019s most recent version, which states property may be transferred \u201cby will to another person for the latter\u2019s own benefit but subject to the payment of a sum of money[,]\u201d in which case an equitable charge or lien on the property is created. Restatement (Third) of Trusts, \u00a7 5 cmt. h. The Restatement differentiates this relationship from one where the transferor directs \u201cthe particular property being transferred ... be used in part for the benefit of one or more third persons, in which case a trust is created.\u201d Id.\nThe trial court found Pollock\u2019s Estate and the Restatements irreconcilable, stating this Court did not have the benefit of the Restatement when it decided Pollock\u2019s Estate. It concluded because Constantine\u2019s will did not include a forfeiture provision if Stephen C.S. failed to pay dividends to Blechstein, and because the will instructed the dividends be used to benefit Blechstein, Constantine intended to create a trust for her benefit. The Superior Court affirmed in an unpublished memorandum adopting the trial court opinion. See In re Estate of Stephano, Nos. 1180 EDA 2006, 932 A.2d 267 & 1181 EDA 2006, 932 A.2d 267, unpublished memorandum at 4 (Pa.Super. filed July 12,2007).\nAppellant filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal in this Court, and we granted allocatur to address: \u201cWhether provisions in a will bequeathing property to a beneficiary subject to the condition that the beneficiary pays all dividends on a portion of the property to a third party for life created a trust for the third party\u2019s benefit, or a creditor/debtor relationship.\u201d In re Estate of Stephano, 597 Pa. 54, 950 A.2d 262 (2008). As this is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. See In re Hickson, 573 Pa. 127, 821 A.2d 1238, 1242 (2003).\nAppellant claims Pollock\u2019s Estate sets forth the applicable rule of law that \u201c[i]n all cases of acceptance of a gift made upon condition that the legatee pay certain debts or legacies, the legatee assumes a personal responsibility to pay; the relationship created is one of debtor and creditor.\u201d Pollock\u2019s Estate, at 559. Appellant argues the Superior Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s finding a trust was created. Both courts failed to follow Pollock\u2019s Estate, but instead applied the Restatement of Trusts, and appellant asserts that until the Restatement and its comments are formally adopted by this Court, it is not Pennsylvania law. Finally, appellant claims even if this Court were to apply the Restatements, a trust for Blechstein\u2019s benefit was not created because the trial court made incorrect assumptions in interpreting the Restatements\u2019 language.\nBlechstein contends the language in Constantine\u2019s will created a valid trust in her favor, and the trial court was correct in relying on the Restatement of Trusts because it was created after Pollock\u2019s Estate. Blechstein claims Stephen X. created his residuary trust knowing the stock may someday be sold, as did Constantine, and that Constantine would expect any income from stock proceeds to be paid to Blechstein; thus, she infers Constantine intended to create a trust and make her the beneficiary. Blechstein also attempts to distinguish Pollock\u2019s Estate by claiming it focused on an agreement between testator\u2019s son and wife that occurred after testator died.\nIn Pollock\u2019s Estate, this Court examined a bequest where the .testator gave 2,370 shares of stock to his son, \u201cprovided, however, and under the condition that he shall make payment of one half of all dividends that may be declared thereon of any kind or nature to my said wife for and during the term of her natural life.\u201d Id., at 556. There was no remainder-over in case of non-performance, but an absolute gift to the testator\u2019s son; thus, the Court found no trust was created. Id., at 559. Further, the Court found nothing in the will\u2019s language to suggest the testator intended to create a trust, and concluded the relationship created was one of debtor and creditor, ruling the debtor did not have to file an account of dividends he received from the stock. Id., at 559-60.\nAs in Pollock\u2019s Estate, the testator here, Constantine, did not intend to create a trust; his will created other trusts, showing he knew how to create a trust. He devised the stock to Stephen C.S. as an absolute gift, and there was no remainder-over if Stephen C.S. failed to pay Blechstein the dividends. Constantine\u2019s actions evidenced he did not intend to create a trust. See Stineman v. Stineman, 382 Pa. 153, 114 A.2d 137, 138 (1955) (testator did not create trust regarding certain property where other portions of will created trust, showing he knew how to create trust if desired); see also In re Estate of Pearson, 442 Pa. 172, 275 A.2d 336, 339 (1971) (testator\u2019s intent ascertained from will\u2019s language and scheme, circumstances when will was created, and facts; \u201ccanons of construction will be resorted to only if the language of the will is ambiguous or conflicting or the testator\u2019s intent is for any reason uncertain.\u201d).\nThis Court has not adopted the Restatement of Trusts, and the trial and Superior Courts erred in applying it instead of Pollock\u2019s Estate, which remains controlling precedent. See Commonwealth v. Millner, 585 Pa. 237, 888 A.2d 680, 693 (2005) (\u201cWe remind the Superior Court that its jurisprudential task \u2018is to effectuate the decisional law of this Court, not to restrict it through curtailed readings of controlling authority.\u2019 \u201d) Even had this Court formally adopted the Restatement, it does not clearly address the issue sub judice. The trial court held the Restatement\u2019s comments suggest a trust is created where property is transferred with direction to pay a third party a certain sum out of the property or its proceeds, but Constantine did not appoint or direct Stephen C.S. solely to distribute funds to Blechstein. Instead, Constantine made him the beneficiary of the devise of his stock interests, with the condition that specific income from the stocks\u2019 dividends be paid to Blechstein during her life.\nBecause Stephen C.S. received the primary benefit from the devise, he merely owed the duty to pay Blechstein the amount set out in Constantine\u2019s will; thus, a debtor-creditor relationship exits, and a trust was not created. To accept Blechstein\u2019s interpretation of Constantine\u2019s will would be to ignore his intent of devising the stock to Stephen C.S. and his heirs. Constantine clearly intended his son and his son\u2019s male issue to be the primary beneficiaries of the gift of the stock, providing Blechstein with money, designated by the dividends\u2019 worth, for her life.\nFurther, the Restatement\u2019s comments appear to differentiate between a devise of property to be \u201cdealt with\u201d to benefit a third party, in which case a trust can be found if consistent with the testator\u2019s intent, and a situation where the devisee retains the primary interest, in which case an equitable charge, or debtor-creditor relationship, is created. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts, \u00a7 10 cmts. f, g. Here, Constantine did not designate the stocks be \u201cdealt with\u201d in any particular manner, but provided that some of the dividends from the property devised to his son be paid to Blechstein. This establishes a debtor-creditor relationship, not a trust.\nWe reaffirm Pollock\u2019s Estate. Where property is bequeathed to a beneficiary with a condition to pay a third party a certain sum from the property, and the will\u2019s language and testator\u2019s intent do not clearly create a trust, a debtor-creditor relationship will be presumed. As the Superior Court did not follow Pollock\u2019s Estate, but improperly relied on the Restatement of Trusts, its finding that Constantine\u2019s will created a trust for Blechstein\u2019s benefit is reversed.\nOrder reversed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, and Justice TODD and JUSTICE McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion in which Justice SAYLOR and Justice GREENSPAN join.\n. The terms \"equitable charge\u201d and \"debtor-creditor relationship\u201d are used interchangeably by the parties and in some of the cited legal authority. Any technical distinction between these terms is irrelevant to the outcome of this case.\n. Blechstein cites a provision in Stephen X.\u2019s will providing any \u201cdividends, interest and income arising from proceeds of [a] sale or exchange\u201d of the devised stock, shall be held in trust under the same provision of his will dealing with the stocks\u2019 dividends.

        "text": "Justice BAER,\nconcurring.\nWhile I join the Majority\u2019s holding that the estates in question are controlled by In re Pollock\u2019s Estate, 306 Pa. 301, 159 A. 555 (1932), I write separately to express my belief that this holding should have a limited impact on the jurisprudence of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the Majority\u2019s comment to the contrary.\nAs noted by the Majority, this case involves testamentary gifts devised in 1945 from Constantine Stephano to his son, Stephen C.S. Stephano, and through Stephen C.S.\u2019s estate, to Daniel T. Stephano, Stephen C.S.\u2019s son (Appellant). Specifically, the gifts bequeathed to Stephen C.S. (and after his death, Appellant), were a number of shares of stock in a family-owned business. The stock was given on the condition, however, that certain portions of its proceeds be paid to Stephen C.S.\u2019s sister (and, therefore, Appellant\u2019s aunt) Penelope S. Blechstein (Appellee), for life. Appellant currently has control of the subject securities and the responsibility to pay the dividends from those securities to Appellee. Thus, the question presented in this appeal is whether Appellee is a creditor to the estates, with Appellant a debtor; or, whether the arrangement created a trust, with Appellant the trustee and Appellee the beneficiary.\nIn finding that these circumstances constitute a creditor-debtor relationship (also known as a equitable charge), the Majority cites as controlling In re Pollock\u2019s Estate, 306 Pa. 301, 159 A. 555 (1932), and rejects the application of the Restatements of Trusts by the courts below. In Pollock\u2019s Estate, this Court analyzed a situation analogous to the facts presented instantly. There, the testator gave 2,370 shares of closely-held stock to his son, provided that the son make payment of one-half of the dividends therefrom to his mother for the remainder of her life. Under those facts, this Court found that \u201c[i]n all cases of acceptance of a gift made upon condition that the legatee pay certain debts or legacies, the legatee assumes a personal responsibility to pay. The relationship created is one of debtor and creditor.\u201d Id. at 559.\nAs stated, I agree with the Majority that this case is in line with the facts of Pollock\u2019s Estate, and thus join its conclusion that Pollock\u2019s Estate controls disposition of this appeal. The Majority, however, in what may ultimately be construed as dicta, re-affirms the continued vitality of Pollock\u2019s Estate. In doing so, the Majority declines to mention or examine what effect, if any, the newly enacted Uniform Trust Code has upon Pollock\u2019s Estate. To that end, I respectfully take issue with the Majority because, as explained below, I believe that the outcome of this case could be different were the UTC applicable.\nAs noted by Senator Stewart J. Greenleaf, a supporter of Act 98, the primary purpose of adopting the UTC was to clarify the law surrounding trusts, and to make Pennsylvania probate law more uniform with our sister states, while simultaneously preserving our vast body of common law precedent. See Senate Journal, Jan. 24, 2006, at 1185 (comments of Sen. Greenleaf). To the extent, however, that caselaw is in conflict with the UTC, such caselaw has been expressly abrogated in favor of the newly-enacted statutory framework. 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7706.\nSpecifically regarding the formation of trusts, pursuant to the UTC, before a conveyance can be deemed a trust, inter alia, it must be a 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7731. Such conveyance, however, constitutes a trust only if:\ntransfer of property under a written instrument to another person as trustee during the settlor\u2019s lifetime or by will or other written disposition taking effect upon the settlor\u2019s death.\n(1) the settlor has capacity to create a trust;\n(2) the settlor signs a writing that indicates an intention to create the trust and contains provisions of the trust;\n(3) the trust has a definite beneficiary [...];\n(4) the trustee has duties to perform; and\n(5) the same person is not the sole trustee and sole beneficiary of the trust.\n20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7732. Importantly, trusts are \u201ccreated only if the trustee has duties\u201d towards third parties. 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7732, comment.\nOf course, and as this appeal certainly exhibits, certain factual scenarios may present difficulties in determining whether a settlor created a trust, or some other legal relationship, such as an equitable charge. The UTC is clear, however, that it applies only to express trusts, the requirements for which are contained in Sections 7731 and 7732. See 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7702, comment. More importantly, however, is that much of the UTC is taken or based upon the Restatement (Second) and Restatement (Third) (Tentative Draft) of Trusts. Specifically, the comment to Section 7702 recognizes that the UTC \u201cdoes not attempt to distinguish express trusts from other legal relationships with respect to property....\u201d Rather, should a situation arise where distinctions must be parsed out, the comment directs that the Restatement (Second) Sections 2 and 5 through 16C, and Restatement (Third) (Tentative Draft) Sections 2 and 5, be consulted. Id.\nRelevant to this appeal, Section 10 of the Restatement (Second), and Section 5 of the Restatement (Third) each explicitly state that equitable charges are not trusts. The comments to those sections then explain the difference between the two, and the reasoning for such a rule. For example, comment h to Section 5 of the Restatement (Third) explains:\nOrdinarily a transfer of property to another \u201csubject to\u201d the making of a payment or payments to a third person creates an equitable charge and not a trust, because the transferor does not thereby manifest an intention to impose a duty on the transferee to deal with the property itself for the benefit of the third person. If, however, property is transferred to another \u201cwith\u201d or \u201csubject to\u201d a direction that the payment or payments are to be made to a third person out of the transferred property or its product or proceeds, a trust and not an equitable charge is created. This is because the transferor manifests an intention to impose a duty on the transferee to deal with the property, in part at least, for the benefit of the third person.\nComment b to Section 10 of the Restatement (Second) echoes this distinction.\nConsistent with the rules and comments contained in the Restatements, the UTC directs that a devise constitutes a trust pursuant to Sections 7731 and 7732 when, inter alia: '(1) transferees are given property; (2) the instrument of transfer designated a definite beneficiary; (3) the transferee has affirmative duties regarding that property (exercised on behalf of the beneficiary); and (4) the same person is not sole transferee and sole beneficiary.\nIt appears that the facts of this case may well fit this framework. Indeed, Stephen C.S., and after his death, Daniel (Appellant), were given shares of stock in a family-owned business with the explicit obligation to pay proceeds from the securities to Appellee, Penelope Blechstein. To mirror the language of Sections 7731 and 7732, as to this life estate held by Appellee: (1) Appellant was given securities; (2) he was obligated to pay Appellee proceeds from those securities; (3) Appellee was the definite beneficiary of such a transaction; and (4) neither Appellant nor Appellee were the sole trustees and beneficiaries to the life estate.\nAccordingly, had the devise in question been drafted on or after the effective date of Act 98, November 6, 2006,1 believe that this appeal could have been resolved differently. To me, the language of Sections 7731 and 7732, coupled with the statutory references to the Restatements, which are to be employed when distinctions between trusts and other circumstances must be made, suggests that under the UTC, the testamentary devise at issue herein may have created a trust for Appellee\u2019s benefit. At the very least, the recent addition of the UTC to Pennsylvania statutory law undermines the Majority\u2019s re-affirmance of Pollock\u2019s Estate, and its conclusion that \u201c[Wjhere property is bequeathed with a condition to pay a third party a certain sum from the property, and the will\u2019s language and testator\u2019s intent do not clearly create a trust, a debtor-creditor relationship will be presumed.\u201d Maj. Op. at 534, 981 A.2d at 142. Thus, while I concur that, on the facts of this case and the status of the law as it existed in 1945 when the devise was created, a debtor-creditor relationship exists, I distance myself from the portion of the Majority Opinion that re-affirms Pollock\u2019s Estate beyond the effective date of Act 98.\nJustice SAYLOR and Justice GREENSPAN join this opinion.\n. The Majority\u2019s language is quoted infra, pages 532-33, 981 A.2d pages 141-42.\n. Act 98 of 2006, July 7, 2006, P.L. 625, effective Nov. 6, 2006, as codified, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7701, et seq. In fairness to the Majority, neither party nor the lower courts reference this new statute.\n. \u201cThe statutory text of the Uniform Trust Code is also supplemented by [the] Comments, which, like the Comments to any Uniform Act, may be relied upon as a guide for interpretation.\" 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7706, comment. See also 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1939 (permitting the consultation and use of comments to a statute in the application of that statute).\n. Again, I believe the use of the Restatements as at least instructive authority is proper when determining the nature of a devise under the UTC in light of the comment to Section 7702, supra p. 4.",
