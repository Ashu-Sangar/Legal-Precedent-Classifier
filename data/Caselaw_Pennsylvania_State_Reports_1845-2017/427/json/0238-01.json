        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellees, candidates of the Political Freedom Rights Party, filed nominating papers in Philadelphia for the offices of Mayor and several councilmen-at-large. These papers were rejected by appellants, the Philadelphia County Board of Elections, on June 30, 1967. Ten days later appellees brought a mandamus action in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County to compel the county commissioners to accept for filing the now contested nomination papers. The court below granted mandamus.\nThe issue before this Court, the proper construction of \u00a7951 (b) of the Pennsylvania Election Code of 1937, is one of first impression. In pertinent part, that section provides: \u201cIn the case of all . . . [non-state-wide] nominations, the number of qualified electors of the electoral district signing such nomination papers shall be at least equal to two per centum of the largest entire vote cast for any officer, except a judge of a court of record, elected at the last preceding election in said electoral district for which said nomination papers are to be filed, and shall be not less than the number of signers required for nomination petitions for party candidates for the same office.\u201d\nIn the 1963 Philadelphia municipal election the highest number of votes cast for a successful citywide candidate was 401,966 for the office of mayor, two per cent of which is 8,039. In 1965, 331,133 votes were cast for district attorney, the most successful city-wide candidate, two per cent of which is 6,622. Although appellees\u2019 papers contained over 12,000 signatures, the appellants insist that only 6,801 of these are valid. The issue thus posed is whether the \u201clast preceding election\u201d, employed by \u00a7951 (b) as the base year, has reference to the 1963 election or the 1965 election in which the office of mayor was not contested. If the former, appellees\u2019 papers were properly rejected by the county commissioners; if the latter, appellees must prevail.\nAppellants contend that 1963 is the \u201clast preceding election\u201d because the phrase \u201cfor which said nomination papers are to be filed\u201d modifies the word \u201celection.\u201d Such a construction would render \u00a7951 (b) nonsensical, for its language would then read: \u201cthe last preceding election for which said nomination papers are to be filed.\u201d Obviously, this construction would result in a conclusion that the Legislature juxtaposed two different temporal references, one to a prior election and one to the election for which the current papers are now being filed.\nFurthermore, even were we to accept the word \u201celection\u201d as the proper antecedent of the disputed phrase, we fail to see how this can help appellants. Obviously the words \u201csaid nomination papers\u201d refer to the ones filed for the upcoming election, not the last preceding one; and common sense tells us that these papers could not have been filed before they existed. In essence then, to succeed appellants must contend that the phrase \u201cfor which said nomination papers are to be filed\u201d modifies \u201cofficer\u201d not \u201celection.\u201d Basic rules of grammar refute this contention as well. The antecedent of the pronoun \u201cwhich\u201d must be a thing, place or event, while the proper pronoun referring to a person would be either \u201cwho\u201d or \u201cwhom.\u201d The provision in controversy does not read \u201cfor whom said nomination papers are to be filed.\u201d\nThe natural, logical reading of the phrase \u201cfor which said nomination papers are to be filed\u201d is as a modifier of \u201csaid electoral district.\u201d It is a basic postulate of good sentence structure to locate a modifying clause as close to its antecedent as possible, thus dictating the conclusion that \u201csaid electoral district\u201d is the intended antecedent. Given this conclusion, the \u201clast preceding election in said electoral district,\u201d i.e., the City of Philadelphia, must be the 1965 municipal election, the most recent election in which city-wide offices were contested. We therefore hold that \u00a7951 (b) employs as a base year the most recent election, regardless of the office involved, in the particular electoral district in question.\nAlternatively, appellants contend that, if their reading is not given to the phrase \u201cfor which said nomination papers are to be filed,\u201d that phrase becomes surplusage. It is clear, however, that this phrase was necessary to particularize which electoral district was referred to by the words \u201clast preceding election.\u201d Within this Commonwealth there is a multiplicity of overlapping electoral districts. Assume, for example, that in Philadelphia a councilmanic district is composed of wards #1 and #2, although a magistrate is elected solely by ward #1; that in 1968 ward #1 elected a magistrate as well as a councilman in conjunction with ward #2; and that there were no other elections during the period of 1963-67. The phrase in dispute makes it clear that, when magistrates are to be again elected in 1967, the proper total vote to use as a base would be that cast for magistrate even though the total vote cast by the voters in ward #\u00a11 for councilman might be greater, for only as to the magisterial election did the ward #1 voters elect a candidate for \u201csaid electoral district for which said nomination papers are to be filed.\u201d\n\u201cGood sense,\u201d according to appellants, also supports their position for they contend that the purpose of \u00a7951 (b) is to accurately test voter sentiment for independent candidates and that, for example, in a councilmanic campaign the minimum voter interest required by \u00a795.1 (b) to nominate an independent, third-party candidate should be measured by the last councilmanic election. Simply, appellants insist that the proper referent would be the highest total vote amassed by any councilman-at-large. Perhaps good sense would prompt such a result, but \u00a7951 (b) does not so provide, for it speaks of \u201cany officer.\u201d Thus, if in the last election the mayor received 450,000 votes and the most successful councilman-at-large 350,000, according to appellants\u2019 theory an independent councilmanic candidate would need to obtain signatures totaling two per cent of 350,000. However, \u00a7951(b)\u2019s use of \u201cany officer\u201d shows that a councilmanic candidate must obtain two per cent of 450,000. Furthermore, to the extent that \u00a7951 (b) is designed to insure minimal voter interest in an independent candidate, this function is served by the requirement that the number of signatures required for nomination shall at least be equal to that required of \u201cparty candidates for the same office.\u201d\nOne further point is pressed by appellants. Section 951(e) provides that: \u201cThere shall be appended to each nomination paper offered for filing an affidavit of each candidate nominated therein . . . In their answer, appellants asserted that only two of the 243 nominating papers had the requisite .affidavit. The court below, whose reasoning we adopt, adequately disposed of this contention: \u201c[C]ounsel for the plaintiffs stated to the court, without contradiction, that at the time the papers were presented to the board on March 29, 1967, plaintiffs were informed by the board that a separate candidate\u2019s affidavit need not be appended to each individual petition but that the two affidavits submitted were sufficient. Whether this statement was made or not, we would so rule. . . . [\u00a7951 (d) ] of the Code provides for the binding together of separate nomination petitions to constitute one nomination paper. Each separate petition is required to have appended to it the affidavit of a qualified elector with knowledge of the contents, the correctness of the residences, etc., but the requirement of . . . [\u00a7951 (e)] is that \u2018there shall be appended to each nomination paper offered for filing an affidavit of each candidate nominated therein.\u2019 It is our view that the 243 petitions, when bound together and numbered consecutively, became one nomination paper and required but one candidate\u2019s affidavit. Indeed, the purpose of such an affidavit is to give assurance that the candidate is eligible for the office sought, that he will not knowingly violate the law, and that his name is not presented elsewhere in nomination. One such affidavit with each nomination paper is sufficient; it is not necessary to submit 243 repetitious affidavits because the nomination paper consists of 243 petitions.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\nOn oral argument before this Court, counsel for appellants frankly admitted that the nomination petitions of the two major political parties are not subject to the type of scrutiny to which the papers of the Political Freedom Rights Party were subjected. In fact, it appears that the validity of the signatures on major party nominating petitions are never checked, although independent candidates always are. We would be remiss if we did not note our disapproval of such a practice.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagen concurs in the result.\nAppellants Paul D\u2019Ortona, John B. Kelley, Jr., William F. Boyle, Edward Cantor and Edgar Campbell filed in the court below a petition to intervene which was denied. In view of our disposition of this litigation and our treatment of all the points pressed by the intervenors, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the intervention petition was correctly denied.\nAct of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, \u00a7951 (b), as amended, 25 P.S. \u00a72911(b).\nLower courts faced with this language have reached conflicting conclusions. Compare, e.g., Hamilton\u2019s Nomination Papers, 7 Pa. D. & C. 523 (C.P. Clinton County, 1925) (supporting appellee\u2019s position) with Lavery\u2019s Nomination Papers, 4 Pa. D. & C. 437 (C.P. Erie County, 1923) (supporting appellant\u2019s position).\nWe here assume that the rejection of 5,238 signatures was correct, and thus find it unnecessary to treat the questionable manner in which the County Board of Elections disqualified nearly one-half of the signatories.\nAlthough not so articulated, appellants are obviously concerned about the phenomenon known as an \u201coff-year\u201d election. However, in many of our electoral districts the number of individuals reaching their majority increases each succeeding year. The Legislature, with \u201cgood sense,\u201d could certainly have decided that a better test of voter sentiment would be the most recent election rather than one of an earlier year -when the voting population was smaller.\nOnly the intervenors have raised this point.\nThis duality of standards obviously produces administrative chaos and offends equality of treatment.",

By a juggling of \u201cwhos,\u201d \u201cwlioms\u201d and \u201cwhiehes\u201d, the Majority Opinion leads the reader into a labyrinth of obscurity and confusion from which no enlightened exit is possible. Instead of speaking of \u201cpronoun antecedents,\u201d \u201cjuxtaposed different temporal references,\u201d \u201cbasic postulates\u201d and \u201cmodifying clauses\u201d the Majority might have looked at the intent of the statute which the Majority runs through an interpretive sausage machine from which it emerges looking like the bedraggled remnants of a bundle of Chinese laundry.\nWhile taking the reader by the hand through grammatical swamps, the Majority Opinion says that the \u201cantecedent of the pronoun \u2018which\u2019 must be a thing, place or event.\u201d I call attention to the biblical precedent that \u201cwhich\u201d is not confined to the antecedent of a \u201cthing, place or event.\u201d The Lord\u2019s Prayer begins: \u201cOur Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\u201d (Matthew 6:9; Luke 11:2)\nThe purpose of the statute we are here considering was to allow independent electoral groups to form a new party, but at the same time to compel a reasonable number of signatures before so drastic an alteration in the normal election procedure should be permitted. Our form of government is based on a two-party system. Of course, as I said before, independent groups of citizens have the right to be recognized when they feel they cannot express themselves through the two-party alignment. But election regularity and an intelligent evaluation of the desires of the electorate compel strict adherence to the rules laid down by the Legislature in the Pennsylvania Election Code.\nNow what did the Legislature say? It said, omitting what is not required in the interpretation, that: \u201cIn the case of all . . . [non-state] nominations, the number of qualified electors of the electoral district signing such nomination papers shall be at least equal to two per centum of the largest entire vote cast for any officer, . . . elected at the last preceding election in said electoral district for which said nomination papers are to be filed, and shall be not less than the number of signers required for nomination petitions for party candidates por the same office.\u201d Emphasis supplied)\nThe guide post in this stroll down legislative lane is \u201cshall be not less than the number of signers required for nomination petitions for party candidates POR THE SAME OPPICE.\u201d\nWhat is the same office involved here? The office of mayor. Cecil Moore is forming a new party to run for mayor, not anything else. The number of signatures he needs, therefore, should be compared with the total votes cast in an election when a mayor was being elected, not a District Attorney. In the last election for mayor, which was in 1963, the highest number of votes cast for mayor was 401,966. What is two per centum of 401,966? The answer is 8,039. Does Cecil Moore have 8,039 nominating signatures on his nomination? The answer is No. He has only 6,622. Thus he did not have enough signatures to qualify as a candidate for mayor on his new ticket.\nThat is all there is to it, and, therefore, I dissent.",
