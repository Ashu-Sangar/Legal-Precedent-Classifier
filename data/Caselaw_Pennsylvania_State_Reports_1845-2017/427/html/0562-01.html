The Authority first appealed the refusal of the Commission to dismiss it as a party respondent. The Superior Court quashed the appeal as being from an interlocutory order, inasmuch as no assessment had as yet been made against the Authority. The second appeal was from the Commission’s order assessing the Authority and Railways, jointly and severally, 30% of the costs incident to the construction of a new bridge to replace the existing one.

In further showing its lack of interest in Black’s Bridge, the Authority states that it has never operated any form of transportation over the bridge and that the Commission has no authority to require it to do so. In this regard, the Port Authority notes that §3 of the Port Authority Act places in it the power to determine by itself, exclusively, the facilities to be operated by it, and the services to be available to the public, and that the same section also grants to it the right to use any public road, street, way, highway, bridge, or tunnel for the operation of its transportation system within its service area.</p>

      <em>Delaware River Port Auth. v. Pa. P.U.C., </em>supra, §411, empowering tlie Commission to allocate costs in a highway-rail crossing situation, must be read in connection with §409. Section 109(a) defines the crossings with respect to which the Commission can assess certain costs under §411. Such crossings are those which involve the facilities of “a Public Utility engaged in the transportation of passengers or property”, i.e., a railroad or railway. The transportation utilities <em>concerned </em>for purposes of assessment under §411 are those whose facilities are constructed or located at such crossing. The fact that the Port Authority has no railway facilities located at Black’s Bridge crossing is clearly established by the evidence in this case and is not seriously disputed.</p>

The Authority, pursuant to the provisions of the Port Authority Act, §7.1 acquired by condemnation Railways’ “transportation system”, which is defined by §2(13) of the Act to mean “all property, real and personal, useful for the transportation of passengers for hire, . . This definition of a transportation system cannot in any manner be construed to include abandoned bridges and railway facilities. Whatever the provisions of the Authority’s condemnation resolution may be, such resolution cannot condemn any more than the Port Authority Act permits it to condemn. However, as to the intent and effect of such condemnation resolution, the stipulation of Railways and the Authority made in connection with this case is significant. These parties stipulated “that neither Black’s Bridge nor the street railway facilities thereon are included in the Pitts<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>burgh Railways Company’s inventory presented and introduced into evidence by the Pittsburgh Railways Company in the condemnation proceedings before the Board of Viewers in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County at 2580 April Term, 1964, which inventory Pittsburgh Railways Company contends represents the physical property of the Pittsburgh Railways Company which it contends was condemned by the Port Authority.” The Port Authority, accordingly, did not and could not acquire Black’s Bridge or Railways’ abandoned railway facilities associated therewith. The Authority, not having a rail facility situated at the Black’s Bridge crossing, can have no <em>concern </em>with such crossing within the meaning of §411 of the Public Utility Law.</p>

The Authority’s right to operate over these two routes was neither derived from nor dependent upon the certificates of public convenience relating thereto which had been issued by the Commission to Railways.

    <p id="b598-7" data-blocks='[["BL_598.9",598,[186,1471,1157,533]]]'>I agree with the majority that, although the Commission has the statutory authority to allocate costs of maintenance or reconstruction of “Black’s Bridge” crossing, it can do so as to the Port Authority only if that body is concerned with the particular highway-rail crossing in issue. I further agree that the Authority is not <em>at this moment </em>a concerned party and thus reject, primarily because of the discretion given to the Authority to choose its routes, any theory that the Authority has assumed a type of transferee liability.</p>

The majority has failed to appreciate the unique situation confronting this Court. As disclosed by the opinion of the Superior Court presently under review, <em>Allegheny County Port Authority v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, </em><a href="/pa-super/210/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="210 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="780224" data-case-paths="/pa-super/210/0001-01">210 Pa. Superior Ct. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=232%20A.2d%2054" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="232 A.2d 54">232 A. 2d 54</a> (1967), Railways was permitted by the Commis<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>sion in 1961 to discontinue<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> its street railway routes over Black’s Bridge and substitute buses thereon. Railways then operated buses over this bridge until 1963 when bus service was halted because of Commission imposed weight restrictions. Throughout this period it is evident that all concerned contemplated that Black’s Bridge would be rebuilt so that it would no longer constitute a safety hazard and that the reconstruction costs would be shared by Railways. The Authority then acquired Railways, upsetting these expectations. Certainly, if the Authority has no plans to operate transportation facilities over Black’s Bridge, it is not concerned with either the costs of maintenance or reconstruction. But just as certainly, the Authority should hot be permitted to disclaim all responsibility for maintenance and reconstruction if, the very day or soon thereafter Black’s Bridge is declared again fit for bus or rail service, it immediately begins to utilize the bridge. Yet this is what the majority opinion contemplates ) and the logical consequence of the great emphasis the majority places upon the Authority’s discretion as to routes is to create a situation where the Authority, with knowledge that the Commission contemplates assessment of costs of construction or reconstruction of a crossing being used by the Authority, could, relying on its discretion as to routes, discontinue service over the crossing to be assessed and then reinstate this very service after the improvements have been completed, all without contributing to the costs involved. I can find no legislative sanction in the act creating the Port Authority to permit such a blatant escape of costs which the Authority should bear.</p>

      <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>The missing factor, therefore, is the Authority’s intention as to future use of Black’s Bridge as reconstructed, an intention upon which we should not speculate. However, although the Commission may not <em>now </em>assess the Authority for maintenance of Black’s Bridge, the majority opinion also precludes any future assessment for reconstruction costs even if the Authority begins use of the bridge immediately upon the completion of renovation. I believe that the Commission’s discretionary. power to allocate costs among the parties concerned is broad enough, see <em>Allegheny County Port Authority v. Pennsylvania Public Utility </em>Commission, <a href="/pa-super/207/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="207 Pa.

I therefore dissent to that part of the majority opinion absolving the Authority from any future liability for reconstruction costs.</p>
