The instant appeal is from the granting of an injunction against the appellants, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local No. 174, AFL-CIO, and Austin Gr. Stafford, business manager of the union. Plaintiffs are D. H. Lay, Blain M. Mead, and Lewis L. Crippen, Commissioners of Warren County, Pennsylvania and, by virtue, of their offices,. Commissioners of the Rouse Estate. The Rouse Estate is a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of providing care for the poor of Warren County. The decree enjoined the union from picketing or committing <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>other acts which interfere with the present construction program for additions and alterations to the Rouse Hospital at Youngsville, Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[167,564,1152,534]]]'>The picketing arose out of the grant to R. D. Goss, Inc., of the electrical contract for the additions to the hospital. Goss, which had submitted the low bid, $73,-000, was the only nonunionized bidder. Negotiations between the union and Goss began, in which negotiations the union sought to get Goss to pay the union wage scale of $4.62. When he refused, the union peacefully picketed the construction at the Rouse Home. All work stopped when other union employees refused to cross the picket line.</p>

We hold that the interstate commerce involved is such that the case is arguably within N.L.R.B. jurisdiction, and that the federal preemption doctrine applies.</p>

      <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>Since 1958, tbe jurisdictional standard of the N.L.R.B. for nonretail enterprises has been the $50,-000 outflow-inflow standard. See <em>Siemons Mailing Service, </em><a href="/citations/?q=122%20N.L.R.B.%2081" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="122 N.L.R.B. 81">122 NLRB 81</a> (1958).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Defendants here have affirmatively proven, as they must, <em>City Line, </em>supra, that such amount is here met. Two recent Board cases establish that where the federal government provides partial financial support to a project, the Employer’s services rendered to such project constitute indirect outflow. <em>Browne and Buford, Engineers and Surveyors, </em>145 NLBB 765 (1963)<em>; Truman Schlup, Consulting Engineers, </em><a href="/citations/?q=145%20N.L.R.B.%20768" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="145 N.L.R.B. 768">145 NLRB 768</a> (1963). The reasoning stated in <em>Browne and Buford, </em>supra, at 766, is: “It is clear that a labor dispute disrupting services to these projects would have a serious and adverse impact on programs which are closely bound to the national interest. The Employer’s aforementioned services rendered to Kansas political subdivisions are in our opinion infused with at least as great a Federal interest as services rendered to other, private concerns whose operations in other respects meet the Board’s jurisdictional <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>standards. Accordingly, we consider the Employer’s services ... to be indirect outflow.” Those Board cases control here. The Goss firm was to render $73,000 worth of services on the Bouse Home project. Federal Hill-Burton funds accounted for a significant portion of the cost of the project. Thus, the $50,000 jurisdictional standard is met.</p>

    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.5",416,[202,1153,1159,696]]]'>Once it is established that activity is expressly or arguably within the jurisdiction of the N.L.B.B. as a violation of Section 7 or 8 of the National Labor Belations Act the general rule is well established that the doctrine of federal preemption applies, i.e., the jurisdiction of the state court is ousted and the jurisdiction of the N.L.B.B. is exclusive. <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v.

The reason behind the rule is stated in <em>Garmon, </em>at p. 244: “To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.”</p>
    <p id="b416-6" data-blocks='[["BL_416.6",416,[200,1860,1157,530]],["BL_417.1",417,[166,392,1149,98]]]'>Certain exceptions to the rule enunciated in <em>Garmon </em>have been developed.

    <p id="b417-4" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[162,501,1154,1027]]]'>Further, judicially created exceptions have also evolved. The landmark <em>Garmon </em>case, while extending the federal preemption doctrine to the labor law area, nonetheless indicated at pp. 243-4 that the States retained power to regulate “where the activity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act ... or where the regulated conduct touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.” Picketing of this kind can by no sort of rhetoric be termed a peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act. When speaking of peripheral concerns in <em>Garmon, </em>the Supreme Court cited <em>International Assn. of Machinists v. Gonzales, </em><a href="/us/356/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="356 U.S. 617" data-case-ids="6165713" data-case-paths="/us/356/0617-01">356 U.S. 617</a> (1958). That was a case of a truly peripheral concern, for the N.L.R.B. could grant only <em>partial </em>relief. Here, the Board could grant all the relief sought.</p>

Probably the chief such area is where there is violence involved. “This general rule does not take from the States power to prevent mass picketing, violence, and overt threats of violence.” <em>Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em><a href="/us/348/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="348 U.S. 468" data-case-ids="6931860" data-case-paths="/us/348/0468-01">348 U.S. 468</a>, 475 (1955); <em>United Automobile Workers of America v.

This exception is clearly inapplicable here. No one contends that the picketing was anything but <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>peaceful. The chancellor himself stated that “If the state can only act to preserve peace and to protect the person and property of its residents, then the preliminary injunction granted in this case should be vacated because the picketing sponsored by Defendant Union at the Rouse project was peaceful and involved no violence or threats of injury to persons or property.”</p>

The instant case presents none of the special circumstances of <em>Vaca v.
