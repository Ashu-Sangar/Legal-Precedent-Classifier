Ruling that this adopted daughter of the deceased son was not entitled to take as “issue”, this Court stated (p. 297) : “ ‘Issue’ is not synonymous with ‘children’. <em>‘Issue’ means issue of the body, </em>offspring, progeny, natural children, physically born or begotten by the person named as parent: [citing cases]” ’ ”</p>

Where the testator employs the terms “issue,” “children” and the like, the public policy of this Commonwealth, favoring both adoption and the complete integration of the adopted child into his adoptive family, dictates that the adoptive child share in the testator’s <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>bounty as would any natural child. Despite my continued adherence to this position, I believe that in this instance the testator’s use of the word “only” to modify the phrase “issue of the body of my niece and nephews” was sufficient to indicate his intent to exclude from his will adopted children. Appellant insists that to accomplish this purpose words in the negative, e.g., “the term issue shall not include adopted children of my niece or nephews,” are necessary. In our quest to determine testator’s intent, I am always loath to impose requirements that only specified language can be employed to achieve the desired result and would not do so here.</p>

However, this provision mandates the contrary conclusion: “(6) Adopted children. In construing a will making a devise or bequest to a person or persons described by relationship to the testator or to another, any person adopted before the death of the testator shall be considered the child of his adopting parent or parents and not the child of his natural parents: . . .” There is no indication in this sub-section of a legislative intent that a gift “to my grandchildren” should not include adoptive grandchildren and I would not, as does the majority, so hold.<a class="footnotemark">*</a>
