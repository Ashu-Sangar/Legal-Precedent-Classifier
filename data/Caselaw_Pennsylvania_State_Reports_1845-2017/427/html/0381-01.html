The lease, which was recorded, was for a term of two years.

Plaintiff, on January 8, 1965, instituted this action in equity to enforce his rights under the lease to him from the Engstroms dated August 23, 1962, to enjoin defendants from drilling, producing and marketing oil, and to require all of the defendants to render an accounting to him.</p>

Petition, <a href="/pa/368/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="368 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1230311" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0102-01">368 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%2024" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="82 A.2d 24">82 A. 2d 24</a>, and cases cited therein.” In the instant case, it appears, from the complaint, that “On or about June 28, 1963, the plaintiff was informed by attorney Samuel F. Bonavita, attorney for the defendants Engstrom, by letter dated June 28, 1963, that the defendants Engstrom considered the said gas and oil lease null and void, and terminated.” The plaintiff knew on or about June 28, 1963, that defendants Engstrom considered the lease terminated, and yet, in spite of the consistent disregard of plaintiff’s lease by the defendants Engstrom and the other defendants, the plaintiff did not file his complaint until January 8, 1965. The relevant events demonstrating a consistent refusal of the defendants to honor the plaintiff’s lease as recited above, clearly show the plaintiff to be properly chargeable with laches. The trial court aptly said: “In the instant case, the facts shown in the pleadings indicate that Plaintiff could have successfully enforced his rights on August 29, or at least by September 13, 1963. He could have enjoined Defendants Weldon from entering on the property and drilling for oil. He took no action but stood idly by, except for notice of his claim while Defendants Weldon carried out the term of their lease; drilled a well which proved successful and produced oil in paying quantities. Only then, after Defendants Weldon brought in a productive well and oil was being marketed from the property and royalties paid to Defendants Engstrom, did Plaintiff act to enjoin Defendants and enforce his <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>own rights. To allow the Plaintiff the remedy he seeks under the present circumstances would certainly be highly prejudicial to Defendants.”</p>

See, Brodt v. Brown, <a href="/pa/404/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="404 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1301554" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0391-01">404 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.2d%20152" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="172 A.2d 152">172 A. 2d 152</a> (1961) and Lutherland, Inc. v.

Plaintiff allowed Defendants Weldon to take the gamble of drilling. He stood by while they lived up to the terms of their lease, expended the time and money to drill a successful well and put it into production. He then filed his equity suit to oust Defendants and take over the property. Under the facts clearly appearing in the Complaint, it would certainly work an injustice to allow Plaintiff to proceed.”</p>
