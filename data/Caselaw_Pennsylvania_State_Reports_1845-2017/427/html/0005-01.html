Petrone was thirteen years of age, the economic straits of his family drove, him into the anthracite mines of Lackawanna County. After toiling for thirty-three years in the depth of the earth, extracting one of nature’s most useful minerals, Petrone found his strength ebbing, his step faltering, and his. lungs clogging. He soon learned that he was doomed by the fate which has caught up with countless coal miners. Anthracosilicosis had taken up. dread habitation in his chest.' He could not work — his days as a coal miner were over. Pie filed a claim petition for benefits under The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease-Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 566, as amended, §301 (e), 77 P.S. §1401 (e).' The workmen’s compensation referee, to which the petition was assigned, concluded, after taking evidence, that Petrone was totally disabled, even though he was still in the summertime of his life. He was forty-six. The referee awarded him total com<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>pensation. The Commonwealth appealed to the Workmen’s Compensation Board and the board reversed the decision of the referee, stating that “Although the claimant is suffering from anthracosilicosis and associated emphysema, he is capable of doing light work of a general nature.”</p>
    <p id="b31-3" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[157,732,1151,258]]]'>The claimant appealed to the court of common pleas and then the Superior Court, both of which affirmed the decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Board. Petrone appealed to this Court for an allocatur which was granted.</p>
    <p id="b31-4" data-blocks='[["BL_31.5",31,[156,1003,1151,370]]]'>The question to be decided here is whether a claimant for compensation is entitled to benefits under the heading of total disability if the only work he can perform is light work of a general nature, when no evidence has been presented, that light work, considering the worker’s physical disability, his limited education and vocational background, is available.</p>

To say that a man can do light work of a general nature is to indulge in language as loose as gravel on a hillside. To a husky longshoreman, lifting pianos might be light work; to a Milquetoast, pushing a wheelbarrow could be heavy work. Apparently Dr. Swartz realized the gelatinousness of his generalization so he probably attempted to give it some specificity by stating that the claimant could work as an elevator or as a power lawn mower operator. With these illustrations he went from the swamp of excessive generalization into the quagmire- of misleading specifics. With the ever-continuing substitution of hand-operated elevators by automatic elevators, what assurance can there be that Petrone can ever get a job running an elevator? And how many electric or gaso<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>line grass mowers are there in a mining community? Indeed, the writer of this opinion has seen many mining areas where there was no grass, much less power lawn mowers!</p>
    <p id="b32-4" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[226,628,1159,470]]]'>The Superior Court, in reviewing this case, generalized in much the same fashion as Dr. Swartz. It said: “However, where, as in the instant case, a claimant suffering from occupational disease is able to perform light work of a general nature, as distinguished from work of a specialized nature, continuously and steadily, it is presumed that such work is available and the claimant is not totally disabled within the meaning of the Act.”</p>
    <p id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.5",32,[224,1117,1159,374]]]'>This is a strange presumption. How does the fact that a person is capable of performing light work guarantee that light work is available? We said in the case of <em>Phila. City Pass. Ry. Co. v. Henrice, </em><a href="/pa/92/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="92 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="490948" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0431-01">92 Pa. 431</a>, at 434: that “A presumption should always be based upon a fact, <em>and should be a reasonable and natural deduction from such fact.” </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>

If the finding “capacity to perform light work” is to mean anything, there must be some evidence that light work exists. There was no evidence introduced at the hearing to show that Petrone could obtain work as an elevator or power lawn mower operator or, indeed any kind of light work. The record is as bare as the Sahara of trees that employers will hire men with the medical, educational and vocational background of Petrone. So far as the evidence reveals, Petrone is as economically totally disabled as if he had to live constantly in a wheel chair.</p>

That same doctor could, however, come to a different conclusion if he saw the patient in the depths of a coal mine laden with heavy equipment, bent under a low ceiling, coughing from bad ventilation and slipping from insecure footing. It is obvious that a one-legged man is only partially disabled at a desk addressing envelopes but entirely <em>hors de combat </em>in a quarry carrying blocks of stone.</p>

The fact that one is a swimmer does not legally or factually presume that there is available a river or even a swimming pool in the community in which he may swim. The original false step in the Superior Court’s reasoning was apparently taken in the case of <em>Consona v. R. E.

As illogical as was the original statement that if the person was capable of doing light work “it might be presumed” that the work would be available, the present statement of the Superior Court is even less rationally supportable. A wide ocean of non sequiturs separates <em>“might be </em>presumed” from “it <em>is </em>presumed”. Presumptions are dangerous suppositions to begin with. Certainly one would presume, without being a weather expert, that May, the traditional month of flowers, is <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>a month of warm weather.

For instance, the Superior Court, as already indicated, stated in the case of <em>Consona, </em>that when one is capable of doing light work, “it might be presumed that work of that nature would be available,” but in <em>Earley v.

    <p id="b35-6" data-blocks='[["BL_35.5",35,[185,1329,1151,305]]]'>A presumption of this character is like a false sign on the road which directs motorists over a cliff and, until the sign is torn down or changed, the cliff-tumbling continues.

    <p id="b35-7" data-blocks='[["BL_35.6",35,[185,1656,1152,576]]]'>In the case at bar, for instance, it is opposed to all reason and demonstrated phenomena to assume that the claimant here can go out into the labor market and compete, even for light work, with men having no such serious ailments as the ones which afflict Petrone and who have not been confined to the darkness of the mines for thirty-three years. To say that an employer would take a seriously disabled person in preference to one who is without physical infirmity is to indulge in fantasy which has no place in the realism of the law.</p>

If light work is available, it is easier for the defendant to prove its existence than for the claimant to prove its nonexistence. The Commonwealth in its brief practically conceded the correctness of this proposition when it said: “Thus an employee who is unable to do light work of a general character but only that of a selective nature, after being disabled by a disease compensable under the Occupational Disease Act, is entitled to compensation for total disability thereunder unless it appears that suitable work is available to such employee.”</p>
    <p id="b36-5" data-blocks='[["BL_36.4",36,[187,1052,1162,918]]]'>This same subject of available work was a matter for consideration in the administration of the Social Security Act, which provides that in order to be eligible for disability insurance benefits one must be unable to “engage in any substantial, gainful activity,” <em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7423" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="42 U.S.C. §§423">42 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7423" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="42 U.S.C. §§423">U.S.C. §§423</a>(c) and 416(i). Interpreting this provision the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania said: “It is not enough to suggest that a man might sell candy in a candy store or operate an elevator or become a watchman and perform any one of the almost infinite number of light jobs that can be conjured up. There must be a realistic showing not only that the plaintiff could do these jobs but also that there existed a reasonable opportunity for the plaintiff to engage in substantial gainful employment.” <em>Fedor v.

I am impelled to this conclusion by the view that the approach taken by federal decisions dealing with the analogous disability provisions of the Social Security Act is the one most consonant with justice and economic reality. Those cases adopt the rule that when a claimant is found physically capable of performing light work of a general character, the burden should be on the party from whom compensation is sought to show that such work is available to the claimant. <em>Baker v.
