After a jury trial in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County, verdicts of guilty were returned on all eleven bills; the trial judge imposed consecutive five to ten year sentences on eight of the eleven indictments, suspending sentence on the other three. On appeal these convictions were affirmed per curiam by the Superior Court, with Judges Jacobs and Hoffman dissenting.</p>

Of the actual perpetration of these crimes there can be no doubt. Nor was there any doubt that eight of them were committed by two men, one of <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>whom wag Gilbert Martell. At the time of appellant’s trial, Martell had already pled guilty to, and been convicted of, these crimes. The crucial issue posed at trial was the identity of Martell’s accomplice. Although the Commonwealth assembled an impressive array of eyewitnesses, all of whom testified that they were robbed by the appellant, Martell himself was unwilling to identify Pearson unequivocally until cross-examined,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and even then could be forced to admit only that he had previously identified appellant’s photograph. In order to buttress its case, the Commonwealth, over timely objection by defense counsel, introduced two wallets, allegedly taken from an apartment occupied by one T. B. Dixon. It was later shown that Dixon was in fact an alias, that Pearson was renting the apartment, and that the wallets belonged to victims of the robberies.</p>

      <em>worth, </em>it is clear that the wallets should not have been admitted into evidence, a <em>fact </em>conceded by the Commonwealth on oral argument before this Court. Nevertheless it is now argued that the admission of the wallets did not prejudice appellant because of the substantial number of eyewitness identifications produced at trial, and that therefore the unconstitutional search resulted only in a harmless error.

Ct. 824</a> (1967), the Supreme Court of the United Stated recently announced the test for determining whether a violation of the Federal Constitution can be harmless. Mr. Justice Black, writing for the Court, stated the new test as follows: “We hold . . . that before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. at 24</a>, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">87 S.

However, the <em>Chapman </em>opinion “adhere [s] to the meaning of . . . Fahy,” and announces that “there is little, if any, difference between our statement in Fahy . . . about ‘whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction’ and requiring the beneficiary of a constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.” <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. at 24</a>, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">87 S.

      <em>Fahy, </em>in order to show that a constitutional defect is harmless error, the Commonwealth must now demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.

This notion, that error is always harmless when it infects evidence which is merely cumulative, has been rejected not only by the Supreme Court, but by our own Superior Court as well. In <em>Fahy, </em>supra at 86, <a href="/us/375/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="375 U.S. 85" data-case-ids="11717703" data-case-paths="/us/375/0085-01">84 S.

However, far from the mere <em>introduction </em>of the wallets it becomes apparent from the record that the Commonwealth, as well as the trial judge in his charge to the jury, caused this illegally seized evidence to become the most crucial element of the prosecution’s case. Indeed, it can be said that the wallets were flaunted by the assistant district attorney.</p>
    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[208,941,1158,696]],["BL_75.1",75,[157,390,1150,98]]]'>The Commonwealth’s case, in the main, consisted of placing the eleven victims on the stand to recount the holdups in which they were robbed. At the close of each description, the witness then testifying was asked to identify the robber, whereupon he or she pointed to the appellant. Because the methods used by the holdup man, as well as his description, were practically the same in every case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> it soon became apparent that the same man, whoever he may have been, was involved in all the robberies. For this reason, after the first few victims testified, it is quite probable that the jury had become convinced of appellant’s guilt. In fact, to read the testimony of these eleven witnesses <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>is to be reminded of a broken record repeating the same few notes over and over again.</p>
    <p id="b75-3" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[156,499,1152,805]]]'>Apparently, the Commonwealth also realized the effect its case would have upon the jurors, and so, instead of presenting the victims in the order in which they were robbed, it strategically called as the first two witnesses the two victims whose wallets were found in Pearson’s apartment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In this way, the wallets would have the maximum effect upon a jury which was, at that time, probably more concerned with the identification of the appellant than with the description of the robberies themselves. Then, as the seemingly endless parade of witnesses continued, the natural tendency might be to become less and less interested in the eyewitness identification and more interested in hearing the description of a type of robbery with which this appellant could be connected.</p>
    <p id="b75-4" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[155,1316,1153,537]],["BL_76.1",76,[190,395,1155,581]]]'>If Pearson’s fate was at least partially sealed by having the first two witnesses identify, as theirs, wallets taken from the appellant’s apartment, that fate became all the more definite when these wallets were' opened, and the cards inside catalogued one at a time before the jury. We can see no reason whatsoever for the Commonwealth’s insistence that the contents of each card in both wallets be read into the record except to impress upon the jury that the wallets conclusively linked Pearson to the crimes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Moreover, the <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>assistant district attorney was not satisfied by simply reading tbe cards into tbe record once. During tbe direct examination of the F.B.I. agent whose men searched Pearson’s apartment, he again introduced the wallets, and this time asked the <em>agent </em>to read the cards found inside. Certainly, after such a display, the prosecution cannot be heard to say that there was no reasonable possibility that these wallets might have contributed to the conviction; and to argue that no such possibility existed <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>has even less merit.</p>
    <p id="b76-4" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[188,994,1157,850]]]'>What is perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this trial in general, and of the wallets in particular, comes not from the Commonwealth’s case itself, but rather from the charge to the jury. In the <em>Blose </em>case, supra, it- was argued, albeit unsuccessfully, that the error, committed when a witness was allowed to testify that a certain photograph of the defendant was a prison photograph, was rendered harmless when the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard that testimony. Yet here, far from cautioning the jury about the weight to be given the wallets, the trial judge actually singled out this evidence as worthy of its special consideration. To compound a trial error by emphasizing the tainted evidence in the jury charge would probably, by itself, be sufficient under <em>Chapman </em>to render the error not harmless.</p>

      <em>Chapman </em>test is to have any vitality, such a result is compelled. We fully realize that on retrial a new jury may still, acting reasonably, convict the appellant; but we reiterate that this is not the test for harmless error.
