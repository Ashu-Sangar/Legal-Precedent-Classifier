On January 28, 1965 the controller filed his annual report covering the Washington County treasury records for the calendar year 1964. This report indicated that a deficiency of $50,000 appeared on the treasury books when Stuart left office in January, 1964. Accordingly, the controller surcharged Stuart for this amount.</p>

Since he had been in office for only three business days in 1964, Stuart argued that he could not theréfore be liable for the deficiency. The controller filed preliminary objections to Stuart’s petition, and on June 28, 1965 a hearing on the petition was. held before the court en banc. The testimony at that hearing revealed that no one actually knew the true state of Washington County’s finances. Judge Sweet therefore ordered a court appointed accountant to conduct an independent audit of the treasury books for 1963 and 1964.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Pursuant to that audit, a second hearing was held on January 27, 1967, again before the court en banc. Finally, on February 15, 1967, the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County, responding to Stuart’s amended petition to strike the sur<a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>charge and vacate the judgment, filed an order refusing to strike the surcharge.

    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[153,501,1154,1457]]]'>Appellees urge that the present appeal be quashed because the order below refusing to strike the surcharge is interlocutory. We do not agree. Section 1730 of the Act of August 9, 1955, P. L. 323, 16 P.S. §1730 expressly provides that “the reports of the controller . . . shall be filed among the records of the court of common pleas of the county, and from the time of such filing <em>shall have the effect of a judgment </em>against the real estate of the officer who shall thereby appear to be indebted either to the Commonwealth or to the county.” (Emphasis supplied.) It is readily apparent from the words of this statute that as soon as the controller’s report surcharging Stuart was filed, the appellant, as a matter of law, had a judgment entered against him. So also, it is abundantly clear that when the hearing judge refused to strike that surcharge, the judgment continued to exist. We have always held that a lower court order permitting a judgment to stand is appeal-able by the judgment-debtor;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and, here, because of §1730 of the 1955 Act, the surcharge equals a judgment, and hence is also appealable. In fact, even before the 1955 Act was passed, this Court had held that county controllers’ reports had the effect of judgments and “can be questioned only as a judgment can be.” <em>Saint Paul Mercury Indemnity Co.'s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/325/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="325 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="1172323" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0535-01">325 Pa. 535</a>, 538, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.%209" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="191 A. 9">191 Atl. 9</a>, 10 (1937); <em>O’Gara v.

In the present case the “record” is the controller’s report itself, and it was held as far back as 1906 that a motion to strike the judgment resulting from the surcharge of a county official must be treated in exactly the same way that a motion to strike the judgment of a common pleas court would be treated. <em>Sunderlin’s Case, </em>16 Dist. 1004 (C.P. 1906). In <em>Sunderlin, </em>the surcharged officer pressed, as his reason to have the judgment stricken, that the auditor’s report was made without proper notice and was based on prejudice rather than legal testimony. The court held that these were defenses not based on patent record defects, and thus could not sustain a motion to strike.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In fact, the result of the audit conducted by the court appointed accountant shows clearly that, according to treasury records, a |50,000 deficiency does exist. It is true that the appellant’s arguments in support of his motion to strike are somewhat unclear, perhaps due to the emotional tone of his brief; but, as we unravel these arguments, they fail to allege any irregularities in the controller’s report itself. Stuart claims that he is not liable for any deficiency either (1) because the shortage can be traceable to a mere bookkeeping error, or (2) because the conduct causing the deficiency took place before he assumed office, or (3) because the pre<a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>yíóus controller’s reports, which he claims are conclusive, show no misconduct or deficiency upon which a surcharge could be based.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

In the first place, we fail to see how such an argument can support a motion to strike a judgment any more than Stuart’s other contentions can. Secondly, we believe that this argument is premature. Assuming that Stuart would be unwilling to rest on the eonclusiveness of the 1960-1963 controller’s reports, which do not surcharge him, to sustain his burden of proof, he may, if he desires, move the court to grant him j&gt;ermission to re-open the treasury records upon which these reports are based.
