At approximately 8:40 p.m., while the Tomasek motor vehicle was entering upon a grade railway crossing of the Monongahela Railway Company (Railway) in Newboro, Fayette County, the right front end of the Tomasek motor vehicle collided with the left front end of a locomotive of the Railway and, as a result of that collision, decedent was killed and his wife and brother seriously injured.</p>

All three actions were consolidated for trial and, after trial, the jury returned verdicts in favor of the Railway in the three actions against it and for the decedent’s personal representative in the two actions wherein he was an additional defendant. The court below denied new trials as against the Railway but granted new trials against decedent’s personal representative in the two actions wherein he was an additional defendant.

It is not urged in this respect that the trial court erred in what it did say but in what it did not say to the jury. Reading the instructions in their entirety we feel that the jury were given- to understand that as against the Estate <em>all </em>the testimony of both Marlene and William Tomaseis: was excluded on whatever phase of the accident; our examination indicates that the court made clear that <em>all, </em>not some, of their testimony was inadmissible <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>against the Estate. Had the court eliminated in their actions against the personal representative the question of contributory negligence, arising from the circumstances and testimony other than their testimony, it would have been in error. Moreover, the failure of trial counsel to specifically except to the alleged deficiency in the charge was fatal. See: <em>Lobalzo v. Varoli, </em><a href="/pa/422/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="422 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="1901696" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0005-01">422 Pa. 5</a>, 6, 7, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20634" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="220 A.2d 634">220 A. 2d 634</a> (1966). Under the instant circumstances, the court below erred in granting new trials.</p>

The orders of the court below granting new trials to William Tomasek and Marlene Tomasek against the decedent’s personal representative are reversed and judgments should be entered on the verdicts in such actions.</p>
