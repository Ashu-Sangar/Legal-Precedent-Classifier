According <em>to </em>this purchase-sell agreement, Galilee was to pay Kanter $35,000 of which $8,000 was to be paid in cash by the time of settlement and the balance of $27,000 was to be secured by a purchase money mortgage to be held by Kanter. Attached to and, by reference thereto, made a part of the agreement was an “addendum” under the terms of which Kanter agreed that, within 60 days of the settlement date, he would furnish the labor and materials necessary to make certain specified repairs and renovations to the building.</p>

Weiss-man agreed to secure $13,750 for Kanter provided that Kanter would assign to Weissman, or his nominee, the $27,000 purchase money mortgage to be executed by Galilee, this mortgage to be collateral security for the $13,750 loan. Weissman then had checks totalling $13,750 credited to Kanter’s bank account, settlement under the Galilee-Kanter agreement was effected and title was taken in the name of Galilee, a mortgage and a bond for $27,500 was executed and delivered and Galilee then executed a declaration of no set-off. This declaration recited, inter alia, that Galilee, as owner of the property covered by the mortgage, had received notice of the assignment about to be made of the mortgage and bond by Kanter, the mortgagee, to Esther Harrison (Weissman’s nominee), and that it then had “no charge, claim, demand, plea or set-off upon, for or <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>against” the mortgage and bond.

      <em>Thereafter, </em>Kanter failed to make the repairs and renovations which he had agreed to make under the provisions of the “addendum”. Galilee had to engage someone else to make the repairs and renovations and, from the date of the mortgage — January 3, 1961 — until June 2, 1961, Galilee did not pay either interest or principal on the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[161,923,1157,530]]]'>Esther Harrison, assignee, then entered judgment on the mortgage bond and issued an execution against Galilee’s property in the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County. On July 2, 1961, the court stayed a sheriff’s sale of the property on such execution and granted a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and Galilee let into a defense.

      <em>Quigley, </em>supra, upon which Galilee places great reliance, is not presently apposite.

The court below in <em>Quigley </em>believed the testimony that the mortgagee-assignor had told the assignee’s agent of the existence of the agreement and disbelieved the agent’s testimony that he had received no such notice. This Court, on the record in <em>Quigley </em>found that notice had been given to the assignee’s agent prior to the declaration of no set-off. In the case at bar, the record does not "reveal notice given of any claim which Galilee had against Kan ter, either by way of notice to Esther Harrison or Weissman, her attorney.</p>

Moreover, he saw this agreement before he entered into any transaction with Kanter. The agreement very clearly specifies' that it covered the purchase of the building “with certain improvements and repairs enumerated in the addendum attached hereto and made part of this agreement.” Thus, Weissman was aware that the consideration called for by the agreement, which was financed by the mortgage in question, was not based on the building alone but on the improvements and repairs as well. Weissman admitted he <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>saw the exterior of the building. This view alone would have put him on notice that the Church would not be paying |35,000 for an abandoned dilapidated factory building.

He said he did not know whether Kanter was to make all or only part of the improvements because he did not go into those details, stating that “as a lawyer and representing a client, and being interested myself, I was aware of the fact that a declaration of no set-off properly executed by the mortgagor would obviate any necessity for me knowing any facts about the interior.

Hay, <a href="/pa/91/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="91 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="488313" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0242-01">91 Pa. 242</a>, 246. While the party giving a declaration of no set-off will ordinarily be estopped to assert any defense or equity against an assignee who purchases the mortgage on the faith of it, it is well settled that such declaration will not operate as an estoppel where the assignee had actual notice of the defense or equity, <em>or where, as here, the circumstances under which he became assignee were such as to put him on inquiry. </em>‘To avail himself of such an estoppel upon the debtor, the assignee who sets it up, must show that either he or some prior assignee from whom he claims, was an assignee for value, and without notice’ . . .” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

In the case at bar, however, the agreement as to the improvements became an integral part of the transaction which was financed by the mortgage; the agreement had to do with the purchase of the building together “with certain improvements and repairs enumerated in the addendum attached hereto and made part of this agreement.” The mortgage clearly had to cover the improvements as well as the building itself.</p>

Superior Ct. 497</a>, cited in the Majority Opinion, supports rather than refutes the conclusion I have reached. In that case the court went to great pains to show that the knowledge of Schumaker — that the mortgagor would have a defense against the mortgagees in a suit on the mortgage if the latter did not complete the house — was not the knowledge of the assignee. Thus, the inference is obvious that if the knowledge could have been imputed to the assignee, the declaration of no set-off would not have been a bar.</p>

Since we are concerned here with whether Mrs. Harrison had actual knowledge of Kantor’s agreement to repair, what better evidence is there of such knowledge than the “curious” near identity between her discount and the estimated cost of this repair, $15,000. There can be little doubt that Mrs. Harrison would not lend more money on a building than she knew it to be worth. Nor can there be any doubt that this Court ought not to give her a windfall of over $13,000.</p>
