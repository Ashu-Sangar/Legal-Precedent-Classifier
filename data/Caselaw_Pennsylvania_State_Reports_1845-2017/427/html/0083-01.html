We hold that, absent a showing of incompetency or the presence of exceptional circumstances, counsel’s decision not to attack the confession binds his client. Our conclusion is premised not only upon the particular circumstances of this case, i.e., a confession which in great part was exculpatory and of aid to the defense, but also upon the peculiar considerations counsel must evaluate to decide whether an attack on his client’s confession should be launched. The line between a voluntary, and an involuntary confession is one composed of subtle gradations, see <em>Commonwealth v. Garrett, </em><a href="/pa/425/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="425 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="1906753" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0594-01">425 Pa. 594</a>, 599-601, <a href="/citations/?q=229%20A.2d%20922" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="229 A.2d 922">229 A. 2d 922</a>, 925-27 (1967); compounding this difficulty is the <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>congeries of reasons why counsel might choose not to attack the confession — a desire to make defendant appear cooperative, a hope that police testimony can be shaken on cross-examination or, perhaps, a belief that the version of the crime offered in the confession can be used to defendant’s advantage. A coupling of these two variables produces a complex decision which a layman is unequipped to make. Of necessity, the decision is one which must be made by counsel — a decision, once made, which binds the client.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

However, the opinion states that the suggestion to decapitate the photograph came from the court rather than the prosecution. The second misstatement concerns the display before the jury of a vial of decedent’s blood. Several times during trial the prosecution offered the vial into evidence and each time was rebuffed by the court below on the theory that the prosecution had yet to demonstrate its relevancy.

        <em> </em>The United States Supreme Court has quite clearly indicated that a knowing and understanding failure to raise a claim is <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>equivalent to a deliberate bypass. See <em>Fay v.

        <em> </em>One further point deserves brief mention. Prior to our decision in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Stevens v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/419/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="419 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1896928" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0001-01">419 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20613" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="213 A.2d 613">213 A. 2d 613</a> (1965) it could have been argued that appellant’s petition for correction of his sentence is premature since he has not yet served the minimum sentence imposed. For many of the reasons detailed in <em>Stevens </em>which prompted us to conclude that one may attack a sentence which he has not yet begun to serve, we now hold that an attack premised upon a claim that the petitioner’s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum is proper even though the minimum sentence has yet to be completed.</p>
