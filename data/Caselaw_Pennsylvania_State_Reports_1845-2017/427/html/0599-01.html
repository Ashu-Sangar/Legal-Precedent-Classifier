We approach such a task always mindful of the presumption that counsel is competent and with the realization that no one, be they members of Bench or Bar, relishes an opportunity to evaluate the product of another attorney. Yet both counsel and the courts must recognize that the main issue is whether the accused’s rights have been adequately protected; the defense counsel is not on trial but rather his aid is sought to further this inquiry.</p>

Sprangle insisted that trial counsel was incompetent for he (1) failed to produce a witness who allegedly observed the offense; (2) failed to elucidate for the jury the type of gun employed in the crime; and (3) introduced into evidence appellant’s prior criminal record. Rejecting each of these claims, we found that there existed a reasonable basis to support counsel’s chosen course — -(1) no purpose would have been served by attempting to uncover the missing witness for there was no showing that he would have been helpful to the defense, (2) discussion of the gun was unnecessary for appellant admitted the shooting and relied upon his claim of self-defense, and (3) introduction of the prior record was explained by the fact that, since Sprangle was testifying (and the record thus admissible to attack credibility), counsel hoped <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>to mitigate its impact upon the jury by revealing appellant’s history as part of his own case.</p>

The test is <em>not </em>whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record.

He contended that he had purchased the revolvers from an unknown source as an “investment.” While shooting pool, he was allegedly approached by Balser who wished to purchase the weapons. Balser then drove Washington to Washington’s home, obtained the guns and then, allegedly without Washington’s acquiesence, drove to a gas station and committed the first armed robbery. Washington insisted that his companions forced him to participate in the other robberies by threatening to reveal his role in the first robbery if he did not participate. Washington testified at trial that his statement confessing the burglary was obtained after he had been deprived of sleep, food and bathing facilities for eleven days and after his repeated requests for an attorney were denied. The trial judge then questioned the police officer who <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>denied “abusing” Washington and insisted that food was furnished when necessary.

Washington testified that he saw his attorney for approximately one minute in open court prior to trial. His attorney, having tried over 1,000 cases during his career (as of 1959), had no independent recollection of Washington’s trial although he assumed that he must have conversed with appellant for five to ten minutes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Counsel could recall no other contact with Washington and his memory could not be refreshed by a reading of either the Legal Aid file or the trial transcript.

Since the store owner did not testify that any of the revolvers found in Washington’s possession were stolen, the entire Commonwealth case rested upon Washington’s confession. Counsel’s failure to object to admission of this confession can be most easily explained by insufficient <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>preparation.
