Apparently no appeal was taken. On September 28, 1966 the Fayette County Court denied without appointment of counsel a petition brought under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §1180-1 et seq. (Supp. 1966). A second petition, also under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, was denied on July 11, 1967. Hughes asserted that he was without funds and requested the trial court to appoint counsel; he apparently was indigent for the court below did permit Hughes to proceed “as a poor person.” An in forma pauperis appeal was taken to this Court from the denial of Hughes’ second petition.</p>
    <p id="b426-9" data-blocks='[["BL_426.12",426,[204,1813,1156,589]]]'>Section 12 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act imposes a mandatory requirement upon the trial court to appoint counsel for the prosecution of an indigent’s post-conviction petition; since Hughes did not have counsel in either petition, we must vacate the order below and remand the record for appointment of counsel without reaching the merits of Hughes’ contentions.
