The assessment of a book by those testifying is a guide and an aid to the Court, more or less valuable and persuasive as the apparent knowledge and stature of the individual witness merits. The judge may not be motivated solely by his personal predilections but must strive as far as possible to be objective. Yet in his final wrestling with his soul he cannot put aside entirely his subjective determination. He must read the book himself, take into account the views of witnesses and the reviews of critics and the arguments of counsel, and then ultimately come up with his own reaction to his reading.

With their husbands away, some married ladies gain the officers’ sexual services by false night calls to the police dispatcher complaining of a ‘prowler.’ Chivalrous response by the prowl car is rewarded by amorous receptions.

Secondly, the Commonwealth argues that pandering may be found because one of the defense witnesses advertised “Candy” in a brochure which was “blatantly aimed at an audience solicited to purchase the various books for their prurient interest appeal only.” The man in question, however, was a witness, not a defendant and it was never suggested that any of the defendants were in any way responsible for the advertisement. Moreover, although this brochure did advertise “Candy” and other books which are legitimately classified as erotic literature it also contained advertisements for such books as the “American Everyday Dictionary” and Thoreau’s “Walden.”</p>

Frignito, Psychiatrist of the County Court of Philadelphia: “The most singular factor inducing the adolescent to sexual activities is pornography; the lewd picture, the smutty book, the obscenely pictured playing card, the girlie magazines . . . pornography fosters impure habits and desires . .'. it can cause sexually aggressive acts and in some instances lead to the slaying of the victim”. J. Edgar Hoover: “Sex-mad magazines are creating criminals faster than jails can be built to house them”. The late Dr. Benjamin Karpman, Chief Psychotherapist, St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington, D.C.: “. . . there is a direct relationship between juvenile delinquency, sex life and pornographic literature”. The National Council of Juvenile Court Judges, in a resolution: “The character of juvenile delinquency has changed as a consequence of the stimulation of salacious publications, being no longer the mischievous acts of children, but acts of violence, armed robbery, rape, torture and even homicide, for which the vicious publications condition the minds of our children”. Inspector Herbert Case, Detroit Police Department : “I have yet to see a sex murder case in the history of the Detroit Police Department but what I can show you obscene literature . . .” Detective Lt. Austin B. Duke, St. Louis County Police: “I have never picked up a juvenile sex offender who didn’t have this stuff with him, in his car or in his house”. <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>O. W. Wilson, Chicago Police Superintendent: “Obscene literature is a primary problem in the United States today.

The question of the propriety of the distribution of questioned literature should be left to the States where it was prior to 1787 and which no one at that time ever thought of transferring to the nation. In 1887 the Supreme Court acknowledged that it was the province of the legislative department of government to exercise the necessary police powers to stand guard over public morality: “The power to determine such questions (what is offensive to public morality) so as to bind all, must exist somewhere; else society will be at the mercy of the few, who, regarding only their own appetites or passions, may be willing to imperil the peace and security of the many, provided only they are permitted to do as they please. Under our system that power is lodged with the legislative branch of the government. It belongs to that department to exert what are known as police powers of the state, and to determine primarily what measures are appropriate or needful for the protection of the public morals, the public health, or the public safety.” <em>(Mugler v.
