The Trimble car collided with defendant’s car, with resulting injuries to plaintiff. The Trimble car was going south over the knob of a hill while defendant’s car was going north up the hill. The Trimble car was traveling 25 to 35 miles an hour. Defendant’s car was traveling at the bottom of the grade 25 to 35 miles an hour. According to the testimony of the defendant, halfway up the hill the rear of defendant’s car began to slide or skid to the left; he immediately released the accelerator, tried to straighten the car and succeeded in straightening it so that the rear of his car was across the center of the road (which had no center line painted thereon), and was <em>stopped </em>a foot or a foot and a half over the center of the road when the Trimble car came over the knoll. The Trimble car was there a car length or one and a half car lengths away from him. It had been raining that day and the road was damp.</p>

Defendant is a young man who immigrated to this country from Eumania some six years ago. He was questioned concerning his background, employment status, marital status, family relationship, and was then asked whether he was the sole support of his mother. This question should not have been asked by defendant’s counsel. However, plaintiff merely made a general objection on the ground that such question was <em>immaterial. </em>He gave no other reason, nor did he move for the withdrawal of a juror. There is considerable doubt whether this question and answer <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>was harmless or constituted prejudicial reversible error.
