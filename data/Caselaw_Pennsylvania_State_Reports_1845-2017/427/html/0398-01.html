No timely appeal was taken but a post-conviction petition was presented to the Erie County Court of Oyer and Terminer. This petition was denied and an appeal errone<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>ously taken to the Superior Court which thereupon certified the matter to our Court for disposition.</p>

(1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §1180-12 (Supp. 1966), the order of the court below is vacated and the record remanded for the appointment of counsel.
