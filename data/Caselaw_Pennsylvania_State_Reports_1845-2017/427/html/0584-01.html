In Item Seventh of his will he gave all his real estate (subject to his widow’s life estate in one-third thereof) and two-thirds of his residuary personal estate to his trustees, to hold in trust until the expiration of twenty-one years after the death of his last surviving child. The trustees were directed to pay the income to his children and to the descendants of his dead children per stirpes who were living at each distribution date, and upon expiration of the trust to pay the principal to his then living descendants, per stirpes. These provisions were subject to Item Ninth, in which testator gave each of his children a power to appoint by will his or her stirpal share of income and principal among his or her issue. Factually, the trust will continue <em>until July 15, 1985 </em>— twenty-one years after the death of the last survivor of testator’s children.</p>

However, all the parties concerned, including the present corporate fiduciary and the individual fiduciaries and the beneficiaries, knowingly took this chance — they all knew that the <em>Statute </em>(Act of 1917) clearly and unambiguously fixed the present and future rights of <em>all executors-trustees </em>to a <em>single </em>commission on principal, which such fiduciaries received and agreed to accept as <em>full </em>compensation for their combined executor and trustee fiduciary services, past, present and future.

Moreover, while a corporate fiduciary can probably prove its present costs as contrasted with its costs 25 years ago, how, <em>at this late date, </em>can such a fiduciary prove what service it rendered during a lengthy 25-50 year trust, when so many persons who handled the trust estate will have died or be unable to accurately remember details?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">*</a>”</p>

Moreover, the trustee, having received compensation or commission on principal for his services as executor and for his future services as trustee, was asking for a retroactive repeal of the statutorily prohibited double commission rule.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">**</a> The Court refused each and all of this on the grounds that repeal of the <em>double commission </em>rule would violate beneficiaries’ Constitutionally vested rights.

This Court reiterated the holding in <em>Williamson </em>that the Act of 1945, which repealed the double commission rule, could not Constitutionally be applied retroactively, nor could the Act of 1953, which went beyond mere repeal and affirmatively allowed the payment of double commissions on principal.

      <em> </em>except perhaps in an unjustifiably broad reading, they in no way control the question of interim commissions. No retroactivity problem is here presented for interim commissions relate only to the <em>time </em>of payment, a matter in which the beneficiaries have no constitutionally vested interest.</p>

Interim commissions should be allowed only on the basis of the worth of the services rendered and should not exceed the total value of the services rendered from the inception to the conclusion of the period of trusteeship. See Comment, “The Constitutionality of Retroactive Trustee Compensation Statutes in Pennsylvania,” <a href="/citations/?q=114%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20530" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="114 U.
