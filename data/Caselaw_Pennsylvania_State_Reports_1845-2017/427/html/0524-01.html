Mrs. Protyniak died on November 25, 1965, a resident of Erie County. In her short, clear will which was drawn by her attorney,. Mrs. Protyniak devised and bequeathed one-half of her residuary estate to her daughter, Marie Reed, and the other half to two of her grandchildren, Joseph W. Rahal and Frederick E. Rahal, who were the children of her other daughter, Katherine Rahal. Katherine Rahal was appointed executrix. Mrs. Protyniak was survived by Marie Reed and by Mrs. Rahal, and by testatrix’s two above-mentioned grandchildren, and also by three sons, William R. Atkins, Steve Protyniak and Theodore Protyniak, who are the contestants of the will and the present appellants.</p>

The Judge based his decision on his conclusion that testatrix suffered an insane delusion which caused her to draw her will differently from the way she would have drawn it if the insane delusion had not existed. Exceptions were filed to the Judge’s “Order and Opinion.” On April 7, 1987, the same Judge, sitting alone as the Court en banc, (1) reversed his prior decision, and (2) found that contestants’ evidence was not legally sufficient to prove that testatrix suffered an insane delusion at the time she executed her will, and (3.) sustained the validity of the will.</p>

Appellants’ voluminous testimony may be summarized by stating that their mother was of low intelligence; she could not read or write and had difficulty in using the English language and her native Ukrainian language; she did not like business and had not attended to business for at least a couple of years before her husband’s funeral, which was three days before her will was drawn; she was forgetful; she was sometimes hard to understand and on occasions made flighty statements; she had a weak heart and arteriosclerosis; at her husband’s funeral (a) she appeared to be dazed and (b) did not seem to recognize some of their friends, and (c) said that she had given her husband breakfast the morning he died and that he was suddenly taken by death, when neither of these facts was accurate. Furthermore, her family doctor testified that in his opinion she lacked testamentary capacity. On the other hand, virtually all of these statements and virtually all of the testimony produced by appellants was contradicted by witnesses for the proponents of the will. In particular, the lawyer who drew the will testified that the testatrix had testamentary capacity at the time she executed the will.</p>

Her attorney advised her to make her will, and when she agreed, sent her daughters out of the room. When her attorney discussed with her how and to whom she wanted to leave her property, she told him she wished to leave it the way it was thereafter bequeathed in her will. He then questioned her about not leaving anything to her sons. To this question she replied: “The boys got property, they have got their own homes, and the two daughters don’t have any, so I want it to go to them.” In fact, two of her sons did own their own homes, but the third son, Theodore Protyniak, did not — he lived with his mother-in-law in her home. One of testatrix’s two daughters, Marie Reed, did not own her own home, but the other daughter, Katherine Rahal (whose children were given one-half of testatrix’s estate) did. Testatrix’s answer and these facts are the basis for appellants’ contention that their mother had an insane delusion.</p>

When a will is drawn by an attorney who testifies as to decedent’s testamentary capacity and is proved by subscribing witnesses, the burden of proving lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence can be sustained only by clear and convincing evidence: <em>Thompson Will, </em>387 Pa., supra; <em>Williams v. McCarroll, </em>374 Pa., supra; <em>Higbee Will, </em><a href="/pa/365/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="365 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1225584" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0381-01">365 Pa. 381</a>, 382, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.2d%20599" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="75 A.2d 599">75 A. 2d 599</a>. While the testimony as to testatrix’s testamentary capacity was conflicting, appellants certainly did not prove by clear and convincing testimony the lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence or confidential relationship, and their evidence utterly failed to prove an insane delusion as that term is defined by the Courts.</p>
