On August 25, 1958, he consulted a doctor who referred him to the University of Pennsylvania Surgical Clinic which he attended, first as an out-patient on August 29, 1958, and later as an in-patient on September 1, 1958. At that time, Lynch authorized the removal of his right testicle and such surgery took place on September 4, 1958. Discharged from the hospital on September 11, 1958, he had another hospital examination on September 18, 1958 and he was told to return in November for chest X-rays. Lynch was not advised of the diagnosis of his condition other than the necessity of removing his right testicle. Prior and subsequent to the surgery, Lynch was regularly employed in work which required lifting of heavy objects. During October, 1958, he experienced pains in his back which radiated down his right leg, pains which he associated with the performance of his work.</p>

On November 4, 1958, he signed part B of the application which consisted of questions addressed to him by the Company’s medical examiner and his responses thereto. At that time the Company’s medical examiner gave Lynch a physical examination. Lynch stated, in response to the part B questions, that: (a) he was <em>then </em>in good health and able to perform his full duties; (b) he had been “last sick” in 1957 in Washington, D. C. with a cold of “few days duration”; (c) he had not lost time from <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>school or work because of poor health during the past five years; (d) he had not been treated or sought advice concerning any ailment or disease of the prostate, bladder, pelvic organs, kidneys, bones, glands, eyes, ears, cancer, tumor, ulcers, rheumatism, gout, arthritis or varicose veins; (e) in September, 1958, at the “Penna. Iiosp., Phila.” he had undergone a “Rt. inguinal herniorrhaphy”; (f) he had not had an electrocardiogram, X-ray examination, laboratory examination or tests and had not consulted a physician within the past five years for any reason not therein mentioned. After certifying he had read the answers in part B, Lynch stated, in writing, that such answers were “correctly written” as given by him, were “true and complete” and that there were no exceptions to such answers. Under the policy provisions, the statements made by Lynch were “deemed representations and not warranties”. (Exhibit, Rec. 7a).</p>

One week later, Lynch, complaining of chest, spine and leg pains, returned to the hospital as an out-patient and the following day — November 21, 1958 — -was given X-ray examinations which, <em>unknown to Lynch, </em>disclosed “extensive osseous metastatic disease”. Deep X-ray treatments were begun and continued almost daily until December 2, 1958. During this period, Lynch suffered nausea, vomiting, malaise and continued back pain and, during the last week of November, he ceased working.</p>

That amendment read as follows: “These amendments and declarations are to be considered as a part of the said application and subject to the agreements, covenants, and statements therein contained.

The said application, as amended, is correct and true, and I hereby ratify and confirm the statements therein made as of the date hereof.” The Company contends that Lynch knowingly gave false answers in part B of the application on November 4, 1958 and ratified such answers on December 2, 1958 by the execution of the amendment. The new rated policy was delivered on December 2, 1958.</p>

Urging a new trial, the Company contends: (1) the court erred in its jury instructions; (a) despite the court’s ruling that the application amendment dated December 2,1958, had been shown to have been attached to the policy and, thus, admissible in evidence and the Company’s reliance upon such ruling, the court, in its charge, permitted the jury to decide whether the amendment, <em>as a maMer of fact, </em>had been attached to the policy when delivered; (b) in permitting the jury to ignore the clear language of the amendment; (c) in permitting the jury to decide whether knowledge or misunderstanding on the part of the Company medical examiner vitiated Lynch’s obligation to give truthful answers; (2) the court further erred; (a) in refusing to withdraw a juror after Averlean Lynch’s counsel’s comment to the jury concerning the Company’s failure to call its agent as a witness and (b) in admitting in evidence two wedding pictures of Lynch and the appellee taken approximately five months prior to delivery of the policy.</p>

However, the evidence as to whether Lynch, when he made the statements, knew of their falsity or made them in bad faith falls short of the standard of proof upon which the entry of a judgment n.o.v. can be predicated. The record portrays Lynch as a young man with a meagre educational background who was advised to and did submit to an operation for the removal of a testicle to relieve a condition of “fullness” therein. Insofar as the record indicates, Lynch at least prior to the time when he executed the amendment to the application, did not know that the difficulty in the testicle and the radiating pains in his chest, leg and back arose from the on<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>set of a cancerous condition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The hospital diagnosis of his condition in September, 1958, was not revealed to him and, in fact, the first set of X-rays taken in November, 1958, were negative. On the record before us, Lynch was unaware of the presence of any malignant condition in his body and of the relationship between such condition and the necessity for the removal of his testicle. Lynch did reveal that he had been in the hospital in September 1958 although the application stated that such hospitalization was due to a “right inguinal herniorrhaphy”. In connection with the reason given by Lynch in the application for his hospitalization in September 1958, it should be noted that the Company’s medical examiner, who should have been alerted by the presence of the surgical scar and the absence of the right testicle, did not check the hospital record or make any effort to ascertain the <em>exact </em>nature and reason for the surgical procedure and, in fact, made no reference to the surgical scar in his report to the Company of his examination of Lynch. It is natural to wonder why, if the operative procedure did not alert a doctor to the possibility of an existent serious condition, Lynch should be held to knowledge of the existence of such condition. This record does not reveal the presence of any circumstances which show conclusively that, when Lynch made the statements, he <em>then </em>knew they were false and made them in bad faith such as to justify the entry of a judgment n.o.v. Whether Lynch had knowledge of the falsity of his statements and whether he acted in bad faith were questions clearly for resolution by a jury and not by the court below as a matter of law. In refusing to enter <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>judgment n.o.v. for this reason the court below acted properly.</p>

However, this was not known to the insured and, furthermore, the Company had had the insured examined by its medical examiner at the time. The jury could well have concluded that the insured had no intent to deceive. Cie<em>sielski v.
