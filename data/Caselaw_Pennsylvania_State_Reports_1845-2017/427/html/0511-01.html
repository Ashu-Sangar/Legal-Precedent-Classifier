Each of the defendants thereupon filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to plaintiff’s complaint, on the ground that “the complaint fails to state a cause of action in that it is a claim for defamation allegedly contained in a pleading filed with this Court.” In other words, defendants contend that they had an absolute privilege to raise or plead incendiarism by plaintiff as a defense in a suit by plaintiff to recover damages on his fire insurance policies and this defense can be raised by preliminary objections. Plaintiff thereupon filed preliminary objections<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> to defendants’ preliminary objections in the nature of a motion to strike, (1) alleging that defendants were precluded from raising this defense because of plaintiff’s acquittal of the crime of incendiarism, and (2) the defense of absolute (or limited) privilege cannot be raised by preliminary objections but must, under Rule 1045(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, be raised in the answer under “new matter.” The lower Court, we repeat, sustained defendants’ preliminary objections; overruled plaintiff’s preliminary objections and dismissed plaintiff’s complaints in trespass.</p>

Fort, </em>219 Pa., supra, the Court analyzed and reviewed at great length the authorities in this field and in an able Opinion pertinently said (pages 83-94) : “ ‘All charges, all allegations and averments contained in regular pleadings addressed to and filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, which are pertinent and material to the redress or relief sought, whether legally sufficient to obtain it or not, are <em>absolutely </em>privileged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>
      <em>However false and, malicious, they are not libelous. </em>This privilege rests on public policy, which allows all suitors ... to secure access to the tribunals of justice with whatever complaint, true or false, real or fictitious, they choose to present, provided only that it be such as the court whose jurisdiction is involved has power to entertain and adjudicate. The alleged libelous matter in the present case, being contained in a bill praying for an injunction, was relevant and material; consequently, <em>absolutely privileged. . . </em>the authorities, though differing as to when immunity is absolute, <em>are uniform that </em>
      <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>
      <em>when alleged libelous matter in pleadings is relevant and </em>pertinent, <em>there is no liability for uttering it. </em>Public policy requires this, even if at times the privilege of immunity for false and malicious averments in pleadings is abused. Justice can be administered only when parties are permitted to plead freely in the courts and to aver whatever ought to be known without fear of consequences, if a material and pertinent averment should not be sustained. Wrong may at times be done to a defamed party, but it is damnum absque injuria. The inconvenience of the individual must yield to a rule for the good of the general public.</p>

Both actions sought a recovery, under fire insurance policies issued by the insurance companies, for losses incurred by Greenberg by reason of a fire. Each insurance company filed an answer in those actions denying liability and alleging that the fire which damaged Greenberg’s property was the result of incendiarism on his part.</p>
    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.10",543,[152,1538,1154,746]]]'>Thereafter, Greenberg instituted two libel actions in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, a separate action against each insurance company alleging that by the answers filed in the assumpsit actions the insurance companies had falsely and maliciously libeled him. Each of the insurance companies then filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer under Pa. R.C.P. 1017(b) to Greenberg’s complaint averring that “the complaint fails to state a cause of action in that it is a claim for defamation, allegedly contained in a pleading filed with this Court.” The court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed Greenberg’s complaints. From these orders Greenberg has taken these appeals.</p>

Consequently, defendants’ <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>preliminary objections rely upon matters dehors the record and cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[161,490,1154,1296]]]'>Of particular relevance, is the Act of August 21, 1953, P. L. 1291, §1, 12 P.S. §1584(a) (Supp. 1966), which provides in pertinent part: “(2) In an action for defamation, the <em>defendant has the burden of proving, </em>when the issue is properly raised . . . (b) <em>The privileged character of the occasion </em>on which it was published.” (Emphasis supplied.) When this statute is read in conjunction with Rule 1045(b), it becomes obvious that the defense of privilege in a defamation action cannot be raised by preliminary objections. The majority hold that preliminary objections are proper because the complaints “showed on their face that plaintiff had no cause of action.” That is incorrect, for although the complaints disclose that the allegedly libellous statements were published in a pleading before a court of law and would seem to be privileged, a privilege may be abused. Indeed, the writer of the majority opinion stated in his concurring opinion in <em>Biggans v. Foglietta, </em><a href="/pa/403/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="403 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1299492" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0510-01">403 Pa. 510</a>, 516, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20345" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="170 A.2d 345">170 A. 2d 345</a>, 348 (1961), “It is very difficult if not impossible to tell from plaintiff’s complaint whether defendant abused and thus lost his right to absolute privilege, or if his privilege was conditional whether he violated his conditional privilege.”</p>
