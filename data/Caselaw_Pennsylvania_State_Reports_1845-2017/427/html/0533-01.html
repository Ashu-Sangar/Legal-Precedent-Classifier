    <p id="b558-6" data-blocks='[["BL_558.8",558,[186,819,1159,1348]]]'>In this action of trespass, even though it appears on the record that the original complaint was never served and appellant did not reinstate her complaint or obtain service on appellee in the time permitted by Pa. R. C. P. 1010, (See <em>Zarlinsky v. Laudenslager, </em><a href="/pa/402/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="402 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1296672" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0290-01">402 Pa. 290</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20317" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="167 A.2d 317">167 A. 2d 317</a> (1961) and <em>Marucci v.

R. C. P. 1030. It might appear that our rule imposes an undue burden upon a defendant by denying him the preliminary objection procedure. Nevertheless, it does assure the proper determination of the question of an affirmative defense by requiring a plaintiff to answer and by permitting the issue created thereby to be litigated independently of the merits. This can now be accomplished by invoking Pa. R. C. P. 1035, which became effective May 9, 1966 and, in effect, adopts the motion for summary judgment procedure provided for in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Since our rules now provide an expeditious manner by which all affirmative defenses as set forth in Pa. R. C. P. 1030 may be quickly determined, we see no reason to depart from the requirements of that rule.</p>
