L. 288, 19 P.S. §191.1 et seq., requesting the Governor of Pennsylvania to turn over Anthony Ripepi to the State of Maryland. Ripepi was indicted for assault with intent to murder and assault in violation of Article 27, §12, of the Annotated Code of Maryland. A copy of the indictment and an affidavit of Charles E. Moylan, the State of <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>Maryland’s attorney for tbe City of Baltimore, was attached to the extradition warrant.</p>
    <p id="b533-4" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[177,464,1152,690]]]'>The Governor of Pennsylvania issued his warrant and Ripepi was arrested in Allegheny County. Ripepi refused to be extradited and a hearing was held February 3, 1967,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. The Commonwealth offered in evidence a copy of all the requisition papers, which are in order, and the Governor’s warrant, and produced one witness, namely, James Tromberri. Tromberri testified that on the night of the alleged crime he was in a certain club in Baltimore, Maryland, and as he was leaving the club he was assaulted by a man whom he identified as Ripepi. The Commonwealth then rested its case.</p>

Dr. Ripepi testified, over objection of the Commonwealth, that on the evening of the day the crime was allegedly committed, Anthony Ripepi, the accused, was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, playing cards with the witness and two other individuals, from approximately 10:00 P.M. until 12:45 A.M. Ripepi then offered to call additional witnesses who would testify that Ripepi was not in Baltimore at the time of the commission of the crime but was in fact in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth’s objection to this testimony was sustained and at the conclusion of the hearing, Ripepi <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>was ordered extradited to Maryland. Ripepi filed exceptions and a petition for a rehearing. The exceptions were dismissed and the petition for a rehearing was denied. Ripepi thereafter appealed to this Court.</p>
