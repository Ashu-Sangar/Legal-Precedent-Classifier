Appellant then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which Avas denied; <em>U. S. ex rel. Rucker v. </em>Myers, <a href="/f-supp/200/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="200 F. Supp. 557" data-case-ids="27898" data-case-paths="/f-supp/200/0557-01">200 F.

Following this denial of certiorari, the appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. A hearing was conducted by the court below and appellant’s petition was dismissed. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[236,1274,1159,700]]]'>Appellant contends first, that “It is a violation of Petitioner’s 14th Amendment rights for a Hearing Judge on a Writ of Habeas Corpus to fail to order a fair and reliable hearing to determine the voluntariness of an alleged coerced confession in disregard of the principles of Jackson v. Denno, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. 368</a>, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">84 S. Ct. 1774</a>.”, and second, that “The standards for determining the voluntariness of a coerced confession once a Jackson vs. Denno type hearing is ordered, necessarily incorporate the principles of the Escobedo Doctrine even though the trial Avas held in 1958 and the Jackson vs. Denno request is not made until November, 1964.”</p>

Petitioner testified at length concerning the manner in which his incriminating statements were taken. We find no believable evidence on which a <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>finding of lack of free will, or the presence of coercion or force could be predicated in the obtaining of the statements. In this regard we find no fact based on which the jury could have given improper consideration to the question of voluntariness of the confession, and this we conclude from our own independent determination from the evidence before us.</p>

Without the record, we cannot determine whether appellant was entitled to a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing and, if so, whether that hearing could be held in conjunction with the habeas corpus hearing.</p>
