In 1963 appellants began to construct apartments on their properties. During. the course of this construction, these properties were assessed three times: on January 1, 1964, April 1, 1964 and July 1, 1964. Each assessment reflected the increase in value caused by the progressing construction. All three assessments were protested by appellants on the ground that the 1963 amendments to the Public School and First Class Township Codes prohibit the interim assessment of residential construction until the property has been occupied or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Board for the Assess<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>ment and Revision of Taxes of Montgomery County upheld the assessment of January 1, 1964 on the theory that it was actually an unfinished <em>annual </em>assessment and hence not governed by the <em>interim </em>assessment provisions of the Public School and First Class Township Codes. This ruling was affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County and is now the subject of Appeal No. 91. As for the April and July assessments, the board struck them down on the authority of the 1963 amendments, supra note 2.

These annual assessments are used to compute the tax due the following year.

It is certainly too late in the day to argue that the 1963 amendments qualify as valid tax exemptions.

There the taxpayer’s premise was that in a given taxing district the assessments will be somewhat less than the real market value and that in fact there will often exist a fairly consistent ratio of assessment to market value within the district. The issue on appeal involved how such a ratio could be shown by the taxpayer. The trial court held that the ratio could only be shown by reference to <em>comparable </em>property within the taxing district and that comparable meant “properties which are similar properties of the same nature in the neighborhood of the taxpayer’s property.” In reversing this decision on the ground that comparable property must mean <em>all </em>real property within a taxing district, we said: “the uniformity requirement of the Constitution of Pennsylvania has' been construed to require that all real estate is a class which is éntitled to uniform treatment.” See <em>McKnight Shopping Center, Inc. v.

However, the classification involved in <em>Jones &amp; LaughUn </em>was actually between real estate and machinery, not between taxable and nontaxable real estate. The case involved the construction of a 1953 amendment to The Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law which declared that certain kinds of machinery, tools and appliances were not to be included as part of the real estate for assessment purposes. Mr. Justice Eagen, writing for the Court, stated at several places in his opinion that the machinery and foundations involved in the appeal not only were not assessable, but were in fact not real estate at all.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This conclusion was reached <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>only after the Court rejected the application of the “assembled industrial plant doctrine” to tax assessments — an application which had previously been used to assess mills and manufacturies under the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Court also rejected for assessment purposes the common law doctrine of fixtures under which improvements attached to the land must be considered real estate.

Accordingly, there must be some way to tell <em>when </em>it is worth more, and how much more it is worth. It would not only be unworkable as a practical matter to force an assessor to keep detailed records of all conditions that might affect the market value of a piece of land, but, ironically, were such a task dictated by our constitution as a prerequisite for an interim assessment, the vagueness and guesswork involved in <em>that </em>system would likely spawn the very untrammeled discretion that appellants fear. As a result, the Legislature has wisely directed that interim assessments be based on a barometer of increased value that is not only easy to read, but is also likely to give an accurate and fair measurement: the presence of physical improvements on the property. The basic interim assessment law does not classify real estate. It merely sets up a scale on which property is to be valued. No class is favored; and all real estate is subject to the same interim assessment statute provided its value increases on the measuring scale set up by the Legislature.</p>

However, since that case did not involve a challenge based on the <em>uniformity </em>clause, it is not controlling here. Appellants attempted to dispose of the case by arguing that it dealt with a reassessment of <em>finished </em>construction, and that had the statute been construed to allow reassessments on <em>unfinished </em>structures it would have been declared unconstitutional. Specifically, appellants’ position is this: If the assessor can assess unfinished construction, there is no limit to the number of times a man’s property can be valued each year. As a result one taxpayer may be assessed each month, while his neighbor is assessed only once a year. To dispose of this contention we need only point out that an attack on a statute’s constitutionality, based upon a discriminatory <em>application, </em>cannot be successful without proof of such discrimination. No such proof has been offered.</p>

Although no duplicate was made in September 1963, there do exist tax duplicates for September 1962, and it is on the basis of this valuation (probably as an unimproved lot) that the appellants will be taxed if no interim assessment is made.
