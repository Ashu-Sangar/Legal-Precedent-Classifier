In civil cases, however, the extreme caution and the unusual degree of persuasion required in criminal cases do not obtain. Even though the result may impute a crime, the verdict should follow the preponderance of the evidence, <em>Somerset County Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v.

However, this position has been repudiated in most instances. See Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940), Yol. IX, §2498. The rule generally followed in most jurisdictions in such situations is that the criminal act need only be (established by a fair preponderance of the evidence. See Wigmore on Evidence, supra. This was the rule adopted in Pennsylvania nearly a century ago in a case where, like here, recovery was sought on a fire insurance policy and the defense of arson was pleáded to defeat the claim. <em>Somerset County Mutual Fire Ins.
