K. Thompson. From the time Noel fell asleep some miles west of the si'tiis of the accident until after the accident he had no recollection of what had happened. Thompson, an experienced Greyhound bus driver en route at the time in his own private motor vehicle from Cleveland, Ohio to Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, was proceeding in an easterly direction on the Turnpike. According to him, the highway was “clear and dry” and “visibility was very good.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> He arrived at the scene of the accident very shortly after it occurred. When he arrived he saw the tractor lying upside down with its “wheels <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>still in motion”, the tractor driver (Puckett) crawling out of the broken windshield and the other occupant of the tractor (Noel) lying to the right of the tractor. On the berm of the Turnpike was a parked tractor-trailer, facing in an easterly direction, the rear of which “seemed to be damaged” but whose “upper marker lights were still lit”. “Twenty to thirty feet” east of the tractor-trailer was the upset tractor “facing west” and, between the two vehicles, lying on the ground was Noel. Thompson did not see the accident, knew “nothing except what [he] recounted” in court and, at the scene of accident, had talked only to Noel.</p>

In addition to claiming they were vicariously liable for Puckett’s actions, Gnau and Tynan were charged with negligence in: (1) failing to enforce the Interstate Commerce Commission’s regulations, supra; (2) failing to hire a competent driver; (3) failing to relieve Puckett when they knew or should have known that he was fatigued and unable to operate the tractor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <em>How </em>did this accident occur? While it is obvious that an accident occurred, it is the <em>manner </em>of happening of this accident that is difficult to ascertain from this record. Noel claims that the tractor driven by Puckett collided with the rear end of the tractor-trailer then parked off the highway and on the berm. The sole evidence of record is Thompson’s testimony that <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>the <em>front </em>of the tractor was damaged<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and that the rear end of the tractor-trailer “seemed” to be damaged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The record establishes that the tractor collided with <em>something </em>and that, as a result of such collision, it was overturned. However, it does not follow, except by conjecture and speculation, that the tractor collided with the tractor-trailer. Noel made no attempt to show the presence or absence of any other vehicular traffic at the time on this heavily trafficked highway nor to describe, through Thompson, the location and the extent of the damaged areas on the two vehicles thus, possibly, furnishing a link between the damage to the tractor and the damage to the tractor-trailer. Strangely enough, the record is completely silent as to the presence of a driver or other occupant of the tractor-trailer and it must be noted that the upset tractor was twenty to thirty feet <em>beyond </em>the location of the tractor-trailer. Moreover, the record does not tell us whether the upset tractor was on or off the highway. All that this record reveals is that there was some undescribed damage to the front of the tractor and to the rear of the tractor-trailer and, from such evidence, Noel asks the fact finder to conclude that the tractor, proceeding in an easterly direction, left the travelled portion of the highway, for some unexplained reason, and struck a parked tractor-trailer located on the berm of the highway. Such evidence does not meet even the most minimal standard of proof required by our case law to show <em>how </em>this accident occurred. Unlike <em>Cuthbert v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/417/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="417 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1893962" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0610-01">417 Pa. 610</a>, 614, 615, <a href="/citations/?q=209%20A.2d%20261" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="209 A.2d 261">209 A. 2d 261</a> (1965) and <em>Marrazzo v.

The fact that better circumstantial evidence could have been obtained by comparing “the location and extent of damage on the two vehicles” does not alter this observation. Nor does the “strange silence” of the record as to the presence of an occupant of the parked rig.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Indeed I believe careful analysis shows that the majority’s determination that the trier of fact resorted to conjecture rather than reasonable inference is merely the majority’s dissatisfaction with the quality of evidence produced in light of what <em>appeared </em>to be available.

This citation falls woefully short of supporting its conclusion. In <em>Johnston, </em>plaintiff was injured when a mixture of kerosene and gasoline exploded as he was filling a highway lantern. Plaintiff’s theory was that defendant had negligently placed this highly explosive mixture instead of solely kerosene, a much less volatile fluid, in the tank from which plaintiff had drawn his lamplighting fluid.
