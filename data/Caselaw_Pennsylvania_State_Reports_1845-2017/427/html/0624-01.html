(Terminals), to restrain the construction of a cold storage warehouse as part of a port complex known as the Packer Avenue Marine Terminal. The Storage Companies operate cold storage and refrigerated facilities in the same area wherein this marine terminal is to be constructed with joint financing by the City and the Authority and the marine terminal will be leased to Lavino and the cold storage warehouse unit to be located therein will be leased to Terminals. The gravamen of the Storage Companies’ complaint is that, insofar as the Authority is concerned, the proposed construction offends the General State Authority Act (Act of March 31, 1949, P. L. 372, §4, as amended, 71 P.S. §1707.4) which proscribes the exercise of the Authority’s power to construct any project which, “in whole or in part, shall duplicate or compete with existing enterprises serving substantially the same purposes” and the contemplated project will duplicate and compete with the Storage Companies’ present cold storage and refrigerated facilities.</p>

Pa. R. C. P. 2103(b) provides: “Except when the Commonwealth is the plaintiff or when otherwise provided by an Act of Assembly, an action against a political subdivision may be brought in and only in the county in which the political subdivision is located.” Under that Rule, it is argued that the City cannot be sued in any county other than Philadelphia County and, if the Authority cannot be sued other than in Dauphin County, then of necessity, two separate actions involving identical issues would have to be instituted by the Storage Companies in two separate counties.</p>

Appellees suggest <em>Memer </em>is inapposite: first, because the Department of Highways was <em>the </em>dispensable party and Merner could have obtained complete satisfaction in Dauphin County; second, any possible conflict between the venue provisions and the Authority statute was not considered by our Court. The court below distinguished <em>Memer </em>on the ground that therein “the head of an executive department of the Commonwealth” and “an instrumentality of the Commonwealth” were involved whereas in the case at bar “an instrumentality of the Commonwealth” and “a political subdivision of the Commonwealth” are involved as to which the Buies of Civil Procedure provide for specific venues.

L. 1019, 46 P.S. §551 that every statute shall be construed to give effect to all of its provisions, the majority opinion gives no weight to the phrase “in all courts.” If §4 of the Act creating the Authority were intended merely to waive sovereign immunity, then this phrase would be surplusage; obviously, this additional phrase was employed by the Legislature to indicate that the usual venue rules governing suits against Commonwealth instrumentalities were not to be applied to the General State Authority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Given this legislative waiver of venue, Rule 1503(c) does not govern this case and suit can be brought in Philadelphia County.</p>

It is true that the State Public School Building Authority, a defendant in <em>Merner, </em>was created by a statute containing a provision equivalent to the one in controversy, and <em>Merner </em>can be read to imply that the School Authority was protected by Rule 1503(c) from Bucks County venue.

The Department of Highways, another defendant, also submitted preliminary objections based upon Rule 1503 and both the Authority and the Department were held to be indispensable parties. There is no comparable statute permitting the Department to be sued “in all courts.” Thus the argument that the statutory waiver of venue would permit suit against the School Authority was never pressed and was irrelevant to our disposition for the suit was improperly brought against the Highway Department, an indispensable party.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>
