At a jury trial in February, 1966 the prosecution’s principal witness was Norton Wilder, .a Philadelphia policeman. Wilder testified that, while acting as undercover agent on October 18, 1965, he was introduced to Carter by an informer and that appellant sold to the informer in Wilder’s presence and for Wilder $86 worth of heroin. LaForrest Russell, an agent for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, testified that, while sitting in a car parked a half block away, he observed Wilder, appellant and the informer in conversation at the time and place of the alleged sale. Russell stated that although he was unable to see the narcotics transaction, he did recognize Carter. Between October 18, 1965 and appellant’s arrest on December 15, 1965 neither Wilder nor Russell had further contact with appellant as far as the record shows. Thus the identification of appellant by both witnesses was based solely on a single meeting.</p>

      <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>the Supreme Court of the United States reversed a conviction for illegal transportation of narcotics because of the government’s refusal to disclose at trial the identity of an informer who was a material eyewitness to the alleged illegal act. As in the instant case, the informer in <em>Roviaro </em>was the only material witness to the alleged narcotics transaction besides the police and the accused himself. On the other hand, there were several circumstances in <em>Roviaro </em>that differ from those present here. To begin with the government admitted in <em>Roviaro </em>that the informer, when confronted with the accused at the police station following the accused’s arrest, denied having met the accused before. Secondly, none of the four policemen who testified against Roviaro was in a position both to see and hear the entire narcotics transaction as was Officer Wilder. Thirdly, the accused did not testify in <em>Roviaro, </em>so that it is not certain whether the testimony he would have sought from the informer would have tended to establish mistaken identity, entrapment or some other defense. Finally, in <em>Roviaro </em>there is a suggestion that the police officers had been acquainted with the accused previous to the alleged narcotics transaction so that there identification did not depend on a single observation of the accused.</p>

Far more significant to our consideration, we believe, are <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>the following statements by the Supreme Court of the United States of the principle under which <em>Roviwro </em>was decided: “A further limitation on the applicability of the privilege arises from the fundamental requirements of fairness.

We shall consider each of these arguments in some detail.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that the significance of this distinction is substantiated by three lower federal court decisions interpreting <em>Boviaro: United States v. Coke, </em><a href="/f2d/339/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="339 F.2d 183" data-case-ids="883837" data-case-paths="/f2d/339/0183-01">339 F. 2d 183</a> (2d Cir. 1964); <em>United States v. Simonetti, </em><a href="/f2d/326/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="326 F.2d 614" data-case-ids="114998" data-case-paths="/f2d/326/0614-01">326 F. 2d 614</a> (2d Cir. 1964) (per curiam) ; and <em>Washington v.

In our view, however, the decision of none of these cases turns directly on the “sole eyewitness” distinction. Thus in <em>Coke </em>the informer merely introduced the government agent to the defendant who was identified by witnesses other than the police, and the <em>informer </em>did not observe the entire transaction;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> in <em>Simonetti </em>the <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>court failed to describe the circumstances which led it to hold the informant’s testimony would have been merely “cumulative” and therefore that his identity need not be revealed; in <em>Washington </em>the informer’s identity had apparently been revealed to the defense and the sole issue was whether the government was itself required to call him to the witness stand. Considered apart from recent federal interpretations of the rule, we believe the fact that police had a somewhat better opportunity to observe the alleged crime and its perpetrator here than in <em>Roviaro </em>is not a circumstance sufficient to justify nondisclosure in the instant trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Elemental to our concept of fairness, as well as that embodied in the federal constitution, is the awareness that the testimonial perspective of police officers is conditioned by the “often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.” <em>Johnson v. United </em>States, <a href="/us/333/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="333 U.S. 10" data-case-ids="6156920" data-case-paths="/us/333/0010-01">333 U.S. 10</a>, 14, <a href="/us/333/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="333 U.S. 10" data-case-ids="6156920" data-case-paths="/us/333/0010-01">68 S. Ct. 367</a>, 369 (1948). This awareness makes us reluctant to permit the establishment of facts crucial to criminal guilt solely by police testimony based on a single observation <em>where testimony from a more disinterested source is available. </em>Thus, while disclosure might not be necessary in a case where police evidence as to crucial facts was corroborated by <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>neutral witnesses, we are unwilling to do so in a case like the instant one.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[187,488,1164,1891]],["BL_87.1",87,[154,384,1151,251]]]'>The other distinctions relied upon by the Commonwealth are: (1) that Carter, unlike Roviaro, failed to show what the relevance and helpfulness of the informer’s testimony would be; (2) that “the issue of entrapment, so important to the holding of <em>Roviaro </em>was never at issue here”; and (3) that any prejudice caused <em>to </em>Carter by the failure to disclose the informer’s identity was cured by the jury charge concerning the absence of a material witness, whereas no such charge was given in <em>Roviaro. </em>As to the first asserted distinction, we believe that the Commonwealth is simply wrong in its conclusion that informer’s testimony in <em>Carter </em>need not be deemed as relevant and helpful as that in <em>Roviaro. </em>Indeed, since Carter took the witness stand and established the nature of his defense, whereas the nature of Roviaro’s defense was left open to conjecture, we believe that the relevance and helpfulness of the testimony sought by appellant was clearer than that sought by Roviaro. The fact that entrapment was a possible defense in <em>Roviaro </em>and not here hardly seems to us to have a bearing on the materiality of the informer’s testimony; the Commonwealth’s brief fails to explain why a defense of entrapment, as opposed to one of mistaken identity, more clearly requires the revelation of all available and material eyewitness testimony. Finally, in our judgment, the jury instruction here falls pitifully short of being an adequate substitute for the testimony of the informer. This conclusion is strongly supported by the absence from similar federal and state decisions of any suggestion that the prejudice of nondisclosure of an informer may be so cured. For, given the widespread recognition by courts that nondisclosure of the identity of informers is of immense value to law enforcement authorities in the successful prosecution of many <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>types of crime, we have little doubt that substitution of a corrective instruction for nondisclosure would long ago have become standard practice in cases like the instant one if indeed it comported with requirements of fair trial.</p>
    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[150,657,1156,1502]]]'>More troublesome than the Commonwealth’s attempt to distinguish <em>Roviaro </em>from the instant case, is its policy argument in favor of the maximum restriction of the disclosure rule. Relying in part on the report of President Johnson’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, “The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society”, the Commonwealth insists that the use of informers is a virtually indispensable adjunct to the enforcement of the narcotics laws. This, it is argued, is because narcotics offenses are “consensual”, i.e., crimes in which the “victim” is a willing participant, and in which, therefore, no person is likely to initiate a police investigation as is the victim or the family of a victim of murder, rape or robbery. Thus it is only someone involved in the narcotics traffic, as an addict or otherwise, who is able to provide enforcement authorities the initial information without which they would be helpless. Disclosure of the identity of an informer, not only terminates his usefulness to police, the Commonwealth continues, but also inhibits other individuals from becoming informers, because of the retribution often visited on disclosed informers by their criminal associates. This fact combined with the other difficulties of enforcing the narcotics laws, concludes the Commonwealth, requires a broader privilege to withhold disclosure of an eyewitness informer in narcotics trials than would normally obtain.</p>

We do not believe, however, that our notions of jurisprudence permit the prosecution to be the arbiter of the value to the defense of the testimony of a prospective witness. Under an adversary system of justice, each side is deemed uniquely suited to determine whether the testimony of a particular witness will advance its cause.</p>

        <em>Roviaro </em>involved the reversal of a conviction under federal law; the decision was an exercise of the United States Supreme Court’s supervisory power over federal courts, rather than a constitutional ruling. See <em>McCray v.

Nonetheless, the <em>Roviaro </em>Court indicated clearly that “fundamental requirements of fairness” played a significant role in its decision, <a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">353 U.S. at 60</a>, <a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">77 S.

Moreover, the widespread adherence to the minimum requirements of <em>Roviaro </em>in the courts of our sister states, see Annot, 76 A.U.ll. 2d 262, 280 et seq. (1961), coupled with the similarity of the fairness concepts underlying <em>Roviaro </em>and the Pennsylvania eyewitness rule, impels us to accept <em>Roviaro </em>as highly persuasive authority. The Commonwealth, apparently <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>recognizing these considerations, does not urge us to ignore <em>Roviaro </em>merely because that decision was not reached by a constitutional route.</p>
