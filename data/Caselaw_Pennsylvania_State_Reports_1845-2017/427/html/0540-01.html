The Commonwealth thereafter moved for a summary judgment under Pa. R. C. P. 1098. After an answer was filed by appellants and argument on the motion was heard, the court below, in the exercise of its discretion, entered a judgment in essence commanding the appellants: (1) to discontinue the discharge of sewage into the waters of the Commonwealth and (2) to construct such sewage treatment works as may be necessary for the treatment of sewage. Appellants now appeal to our Court from the action of the lower court maintaining that mandamus should not issue where it is apparent that the writ will be futile and ineffectual by reason of the inability of a respondent to comply therewith, and cites as their authority: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

In that case we were confronted with the problem of authorizing the allocation of money from a fund which was no longer in existence.

There is no indication in the pleadings that appellants have exhausted every possible avenue in an effort to find some way of financing this sewage construction. The problem of water pollution has deeply troubled our federal and state governments for many years. In response to these problems there have been and will continue to be a number of governmental programs designed to alleviate these conditions. New methods of financing in this area are being developed constantly for those who heretofore have been unable to raise the necessary funds. Moreover, while we recognize that the procuring of suitable financing may be fraught with many difficulties, the appellants still have not demonstrated to our satisfaction that it would <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>be a “futile act” to require them to comply with the order of the court below.</p>

Here there is no showing of a clear abuse of discretion by the lower court. The inability of appellants to obtain financing to plan and construct sewer facilities to abate the sewage discharge is not a defense to a mandamus action, but rather may be a factor to be considered and evaluated by the court in any proceeding by the Commonwealth to enforce the judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The continued failure of appellants to take immediate action to abate the discharge of sewage into the Casselman River can only serve to enhance the probability of a deleterious effect to those exposed to the contamination.

    <p id="b569-5" data-blocks='[["BL_569.6",569,[162,721,1155,1081]]]'>As the lower court opinion correctly notes: “The motion for summary judgment admits the allegations in the defendants’ answer to the complaint in mandamus and also the allegations in defendants’ answer to the motion for summary judgment. . . .” Thus, examining the allegations contained in appellants’ answer, allegations that must be accepted as true, the following is clear. Although appellants admit that they have not yet complied with the Water Board’s order, they claim that this failure has resulted from their complete inability to raise the essential funds by any lawful means. Specifically, they aver (1) that they have no funds on hand; (2) that the Borough does not have sufficient borrowing capacity under law to raise this money; (3) that the only possible way to raise the money would be by the issuance of non-debt revenue bonds which can only be issued upon the request of the Water Board, which request has not been made; and (4) that therefore the ordered project cannot be financed at this time “in any manner.”</p>

I fail to find any authority whatsoever for such a principle. In fact, appellee’s own brief is rife with statements that seem to admit financial impossibility as a defense. For example, on page 12 of its brief appellee states: “The appellants have not alleged any facts to show that it was financially impossible to comply with the .order of the Board.” Not only is this statement absolutely incorrect, but it also implies quite strongly that appellee does indeed recognize this defense of financial impossibility. Moreover, the majority opinion itself contains similar language, quoted, supra.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

But the <em>statements of law </em>contained therein <em>are </em>still very much applicable to the present controversy. As this Court there noted: “It is a fundamental principle that mandamus will not issue, as a rule, where it is apparent that the writ will be futile or ineffectual by reason of the inability of the respondent to comply therewith.” Whether financial inability to comply should be equated with futility, in any given case, must be determined by the court in its discretion. See <em>Erie County, </em>supra. The obvious import of this discretionary standard is that the court must determine how close the financial hardship comes to equalling futility. Therefore, unless the trial court judge be possessed of some clairvoyant power, I fail to see how he could grant summary judgment in a case where the defendant pleads facts, which if proven would establish a <em>complete </em>lack of finances, and the <em>total </em>impossibility of performance. It is quite true that the appellee has alleged facts which indicate that the appellants have <em>not </em>exhausted all possible means. However, conflicting allegations merely create material issues of fact which must be resolved before the trial <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>court can possibly exercise its discretion, and cannot be resolved on the basis of pleadings alone.</p>

D. 1987, §3, 35 P.S. §691.3, and would <em>“sanction </em>the harmful discharge of sewage into the waters of the Commonwealth.” (Emphasis supplied.) To allow a borough to escape the harshness of mandamus only upon a clear showing that it cannot possibly comply with the order is certainly not a sanctioning of pollution. Somehow, the majority incorrectly assumes that as a result of this defense being available, every township, borough, city, etc., will be able to successfully assert it. Furthermore, when the majority, in this same footnote, says that accepting appellants’ defense would “put our Court in the anomalous position of rendering ‘futile and ineffectual’ a clearly defined public policy as enunciated by the legislature. . . .” it obviously fails to realize that by calling “futile” the attempt of one borough to pay for something with funds it does not possess, no one is suggesting that it would be futile to enforce the public policy of beeping our waters clean.</p>
