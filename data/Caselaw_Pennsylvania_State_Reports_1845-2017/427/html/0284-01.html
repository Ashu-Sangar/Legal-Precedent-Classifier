Each juror selected unequivocally indicated he was free from bias, had not formed any opinion and would enter the trial with an open mind, free from the influence of anything he might possibly have read or heard in connection with the case. Not one of the jurors selected was challenged for cause and there is nothing in the record to indicate that any such cause did exist.
