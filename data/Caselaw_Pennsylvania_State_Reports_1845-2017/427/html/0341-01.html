Appellants thereafter filed a petition to open the judgment, alleging that the loan was usurious, and that $3,500 was paid to appellee on account of the obligation, for which credit was not received. A hearing on the petition and rule was held on March 15, 1966, and on May 16, 1966, the court signed an order discharging the rule. This appeal followed.</p>

The court below found as follows: “The record discloses, according to Mr. D’Andrea, one of the defendants, that the Jay-Bee Plumbing and Heating Company, Inc., (hereinafter referred to as Jay-Bee), was in financial.need and that it was unable to negotiate, based on its own assets, a loan in the amount required. Negotiations were then conducted initially through one Mr. Howard Lipkin who in turn introduced the defendants and others interested in Jay-Bee to plaintiff. Certain properties belonging to the defendants, inter alia, were to be pledged as security for the loan, some in Pennsylvania and some in New Jersey. Mr. D’Andrea owned one share of stock <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>in Jay-Bee and the balance of stock in Jay-Bee (20 shares total) was owned by a Mr. LaSassa and his wife. At the time of the transaction, Jay-Bee had approximately fifteen jobs, of varying size, running in Pennsylvania and New Jersey; the loan was required, according to Mr. D’Andrea, because the ‘company needed the money.’ In addition, the record discloses, according to Mr. D’Andrea, that the money borrowed was actually used by Jay-Bee.</p>

On the same date, a written agreement was entered into between plaintiff, Jay-Bee, the defendants and Mr. and Mrs. LaSassa. In this agreement, the defendants and the other individual signatories were designated as sureties for a $25,000 loan to be made to Jay-Bee, payable within one year, with interest at the rate of 2% per month; the loan was to be repaid in eleven $500 installments and a final installment of $25,500, a total of $31,000. The agreement further provided for an optional method of repayment which is not material to the issues presented in the instant case.

L. 364, art. Ill, 15 PS §2852-313, to avoid the defence of usury, but that the appellees, as individuals, were not prevented by §313 from asserting the defence of usury. The court consequently held, under the Usury Act of May 28, 1858, P. L. 622, §2, 41 PS §4, that all amounts paid in excess of 6% simple interest should be credited on the principal sum of •|2900 and opened the judgment in order that the amount, if any, remaining due might be determined.</p>

The Superior Court properly decided in that case that: “. . . individual accommodation parties and guarantors of a true corporate obligation are precluded from interposing the defense of usury.” As was said by the Superior Court in <em>Roby, </em>and which is applicable in the instant case: “An individual who signs a note as an accommodation party to a corporation so that corporation can obtain a loan, is entitled to no more protection than the corporate borrower whom he accommodates.

I, too, would so style the issue were it not for the fact that I strongly believe the time has come to eliminate the distinction between primary obligors and accommodation parties for purposes of determining which individuals may raise the defense of usury. As I view the statutes prohibiting the charging of interest in excess of six per cent, except to corporations, <em>no individual, </em>whatever may be the hat he wears, can be forced to pay such interest. I reach this conclusion not only because I think it is dictated by our strong public policy against usurious interest rates, but also because the current doctrine, as formulated by two recent Superior Court cases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> is totally unrealistic and, as a practical matter, unworkable.</p>

If he is found to be the primary obligor, he may avail himself of the usury defense; but if he is merely a surety or an accommodation party to a legitimate corporate loan, he is bound just as is the corporation. The genesis of this test in Pennsylvania can be found in <em>Walnut Discount Co. v. Weiss, </em><a href="/pa-super/205/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="205 Pa. Super. 161" data-case-ids="771551" data-case-paths="/pa-super/205/0161-01">205 Pa.

The parents of this sole stockholder were named on the loan agreement as “guarantors”. Thus, when the corporation defaulted and these guarantors resisted payment of any interest <em>over </em>six per cent, the lender <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>contended that they should be bound just as would be the corporation whose obligation they guaranteed. In striking down this contention, the Superior Court noted that this corporation was specially formed to borrow money, that the so-called “guarantors” were really the true borrowers, and that the entire transaction was engineered by the parents to bail their son out' of financial disaster. Of course, although the issue was not decided, the clear implication of this decision was that a true surety to a legitimate corporate loan could not raise the defense of usury. Such implication .blossomed into a true holding in <em>Raby v. Commercial Banking Corp., </em><a href="/pa-super/208/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="208 Pa. Super. 52" data-case-ids="776789" data-case-paths="/pa-super/208/0052-01">208 Pa.

This case involved a legitimate loan to an established construction company, and an accommodation. party having no financial interests in that company. It was held that Maude Raby, the accommodation party, was bound to repay the full amount of the loan with <em>all </em>interest.</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[177,1413,1159,912]]]'>'. Whatever may have been the wisdom of the rule set down in <em>Raby, </em>it first appeared easy to apply. Perhaps this was so because the facts in <em>Weiss </em>and <em>Raby </em>represented the very opposite poles of the problem. Unfortunately, filling in the grey areas has clearly demonstrated the unworkability of this rule. In the present case, for example, the majority has decided that these facts fall on the <em>Raby </em>side of the line. It is true that the corporate borrower here, Jay-Bee Corp., was not created just to borrow money. But, the majority seems to ignore completely the significant fact that while <em>Raby </em>concerned a surety who had no connection whatsoever with the corporation, the accommodation parties here are the <em>sole stockholders </em>of Jay-Bee. When in fact the corporation and the sureties are really but one entity, a distinction based solely on the label “accommodation party” is meaningless.</p>

For purposes of the availability of a usury defense, any rule of law requiring courts to distinguish between primary obligors and accommodation parties can only lead to inconsistent decisions and haphazard line drawing, especially in the face of clever money lenders, complicated refinancing of previously existing loans, family corporations, and prefabricated corporate shells.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

However, a test designed to make judges and fact finders “tilt at windmills” is often indicative of a more fundamental defect. The fundamental defect present in the <em>Weiss-Baby </em>test goes to the very heart of this Commonwealth’s public policy against usury, for it assumes that certain individuals may still be compelled to pay interest in excess of six per cent. Since 1858 a borrower could recover any interest paid in excess of the lawful rate. The Act of May 28, 1858, P. L. 622, §2, 41 P.S. §4, originally contained <em>no </em>exceptions to that rule. Today, §313 of the Business Corporation Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> contains the <em>only </em>exception relevant to this case. The words of that statute are clear: “No business corporation shall plead or set up usury ... as a defense . . . .” These words say <em>nothing </em>about an individual who acts as surety for a corporate loan. As to such a party, the basic 1858 law still ap<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>plies. And well it should. In each of the three cases discussed in this opinion thus far, one fact remains constant: an <em>individual </em>is asked by the money lender to reach into his own pocket and pay interest at a usurious rate. It should be immaterial whether the lender originally <em>expected </em>a corporation to pay the loan, or whether the individual was always the prime target. The usury statute must concern itself with actuality, not expectations.</p>

So also have we said that it is the duty of this Court to examine the substance of a transaction, as well as the form. To do this adequately required that we strip away the shackles of the parol evidence rule in order to uncover usury. <em>Simpson v. Penn Discount Corp., </em>supra. We have gone behind false recitals of inflated principal to uphold the usury statute. <em>Fitzsimons v. Baum, </em><a href="/pa/44/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="44 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="484269" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0032-01">44 Pa. 32</a> (1863). In <em>Richman v.

Finally, renewed judgments which cleverly incorporated usurious interest have been declared violative of the statute. <em>Moll v. Lafferty, </em><a href="/pa/302/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="302 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1129071" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0354-01">302 Pa. 354</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20557" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="153 A. 557">153 Atl. 557</a> (1931). In all these cases this Court has remained conscious of the fact that “usury is generally accompanied by subterfuge and circumvention of one kind or another to present the color of legality, . . .” <em>Simpson v. Penn Discount Corp., </em>supra. Yet, by the rule which the majority has approved today, we have carved out a single area of usury where the subterfuge, so vigorously uprooted in the past, is now permitted to blossom with flowers of the brightest colors.</p>

The lender’s plea that such a rule would foreclose loans to small corporations is simply without merit. If a lender balks at loaning money to a company because of its allegedly weak financial structure, such a lender can certainly require sufficient collateral, advanced by individuals if that is desired, to <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>insure the return of principal as well as the legal rate of interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> On the other hand, if <em>more </em>than this amount is sought by the lender, his recourse must be to the Legislature for a revision of the lawful interest rate vis-a-vis individual sureties to corporate obligations.
