Stevens (Stevens) for personal injuries sustained by Elizabeth Mallesky and property damage inflicted on the Mallesky home, allegedly, as the result of a motor vehicle, owned and operated by Stevens, striking the Mallesky home in the early morning of October 9, 1964. Stevens then filed a complaint to bring upon the record, as an additional defendant, Andrew <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>Hritz, Jr. (Hritz) who, allegedly, also struck the Mallesky home with his motor vehicle in the early morning of October 9, 1964. Hritz, after taking certain depositions, moved for a summary judgment under Pa. R. C. P. Rule 1035. The court below granted this motion for summary judgment and dismissed Hritz from the proceedings. From the judgment so entered the instant appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[204,830,1157,318]]]'>Rule 1035, in pertinent part, provides as follows:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">

According to the complaint in the Mallesky-Stevens action, at the time and place of the accident the Stevens motor vehicle left the highway and struck the Mallesky home and, according to the complaint in the Stevens-Hritz action, Hritz’s motor vehicle left the highway and struck the Mallesky home. The record indicates that, if the Mallesky home was struck by the Stevens motor vehicle, such event took place prior to the striking of the Mallesky home by the Hritz vehicle, if the latter did strike the Mallesky home.</p>

Stevens, although empowered to do so under Eule 1035 (b), supra, did not take any depositions or serve any opposing affidavits. The court below, pursuant to Eule 1035 and upon the deposition of Elizabeth Mallesky, entered the judgment of which Stevens now complains.</p>

In <em>Rodich, </em>supra, we said: “In the instant case, two separate incidents occurred and two separate actions are pending for the resolution of the issues arising from the two separate occurrences. Each of the separate defendants should be responsible for damages which resulted from his negligence, if any.” (p. 156) While Malleskys, insofar as the instant record indicates, have not instituted a trespass action against Hritz, it is clear beyond question that the cause of action in Mallesky-Stevens and the cause of action in Mallesky-Hritz are unrelated causes of action and the cause of action declared upon in the instant case is not the same cause as de<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>dared in Mallesky-Stevens.

Rule 1035(b) governing summary judgments mandates that such judgment should be granted only if “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” The deposition of Mrs. Mallesky clearly stated that the Hritz vehicle did not strike her home and in fact, to a point some thirty feet in front of her house, tracked. the passage carved by Stevens’ automobile. Simply, no damage was done to the persons or property of the Malleskys by the Hritz automobile.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Since it is obvious from <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>a reading of Mrs. Mallesky’s deposition that the Hritz car created no compensable injury, there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and Hritz was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[176,621,1156,1079]]]'>Our Rule 1035(b) is in all material particulars identical to Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Reference to federal cases is therefore appropriate and clearly supports this result. For a number of years the Third Circuit Court of Appeals followed what Professor Moore has termed the “unfortunate”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> rule that affidavits or depositions could not penetrate well pleaded allegations. See, e.g., <em>Frederick Hart &amp; Co. v. Recordgraph Corp., </em><a href="/f2d/169/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="169 F.2d 580" data-case-ids="1193324" data-case-paths="/f2d/169/0580-01">169 F. 2d 580</a>, 581 (3d Cir. 1948). This doctrine nullified one of the prime purposes of a summary judgment proceeding— to pierce the pleadings. Therefore, in 1963, Federal Rule 56(e) was amended to state: “When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” This amendment was incorporated verbatim into our Rule 1035(d).</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[174,1710,1152,424]]]'>Stevens could thus not rely upon allegations in his third-party complaint that Hritz had also caused damage to the plaintiffs and was compelled, upon penalty of summary judgment, to support his allegations by affidavit or otherwise. The trial court was required to conclude that the Hritz vehicle was not responsible for any of the damage claimed in the Mallesky complaint and properly granted summary judgment.</p>
