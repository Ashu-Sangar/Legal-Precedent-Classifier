Seiber, Esquire, when the decedent visited Mr. Seiber’s office on October 28, 1963, for the purpose of preparing a new will. This will then remained in the custody of Mr. Seiber. There were some notations made on the will by the decedent and others made by Mr. Seiber, all for the purpose of assisting in the preparation of a new will for the decedent. This new will was executed on November 8, 1963. Neither the original nor a copy of this November 8, 1963 will was in existence when the testator died. On December 3, 1963, the testator duly executed a codicil to the will dated November 8, 1963.</p>
