    <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.10",339,[188,1535,1150,422]]]'>Raymond was convicted of killing William Powell, a Philadelphia City policeman. The Commonwealth contended that at the time Powell, while in plain clothes, was engaged in the investigation of vice, and Raymond, unaware of his identity, enticed him to leave a bar and go to a nearby house for the purpose of robbing him. A fight ensued, during which Powell was fatally shot.</p>
    <p id="b339-7" data-blocks='[["BL_339.11",339,[189,1970,1149,204]],["BL_340.1",340,[195,401,1156,590]]]'>At trial in order to establish plan, motive and design, the Commonwealth, during its case in chief, offered evidence to show that exactly one week before the Powell killing, Raymond had lured another in<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>dividual, Osyp Sudomlak, from a bar to the same house, under similar circumstances, where he assaulted and robbed him. In his own trial testimony, Raymond unequivocally denied any involvement in the Sudomlak crime. On cross-examination he was asked, inter alia, if he had not previously admitted to John Bright, an agent of the parole board of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that he had assaulted and robbed a retired bartender (Sudomlak fitted this description). Raymond replied, “Mr. Bright is a damn liar if he says I did say it.”</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[195,1002,1156,258]]]'>In rebuttal, the Commonwealth offered Bright as a witness, who testified that he had interviewed Raymond in the Philadelphia county prison and Raymond told him about robbing and assaulting a retired bartender about one week before the Powell killing.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[193,1273,1157,369]]]'>When this interview took place, Raymond was already under indictment for the Powell killing and had retained counsel to defend him.

This position is based on two related, yet independent, grounds: (1) That Raymond’s rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were violated by the evidentiary trial use of the incriminating statements elicited from him by an agent of the prosecuting authorities in the absence of already retained counsel after he had been indicted, citing <em>Massiah v. United States, </em><a href="/us/377/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="377 U.S. 201" data-case-ids="6166804" data-case-paths="/us/377/0333-01">377 U.S. 201</a> (1964); and (2) That the interview by Bright arranged by the prosecuting authorities, without notice to and in the absence of his counsel, was so unfair that it violated due process of law, and any evidence emanating there<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>from was constitutionally tainted. It is argued that this is particularly so because: (a) Raymond had been advised by his attorney not to answer any questions in his absence, and this advice was given in the presence of the same prosecuting officers who arranged the Bright interview;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (b) Bright was told by Raymond during the early stages of the interview involved that he had counsel who told him not to answer any questions concerning the crime in his absence.</p>
    <p id="b341-3" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[179,871,1152,427]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v. Coyle, </em><a href="/pa/427/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="427 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1910387" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0072-01">427 Pa. 72</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20542" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="233 A.2d 542">233 A. 2d 542</a> (1967), we discussed the impact of <em>Massiah </em>and concluded that any ruling therein absolutely banning post-indictment police questioning in the absence of defense counsel need not be applied retroactively. Since the instant trial occurred years before the decision in <em>Massiah </em>was announced, the view on this point, expressed in <em>Coyle, </em>is controlling here.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[181,1310,1149,251]]]'>In evaluating the merit of Raymond’s argument that the evidence under discussion was obtained by unfair conduct on the part of the prosecuting authorities, all of the attending circumstances disclosed by the record must be considered.</p>

      <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>From Raymond’s own description of the interview during his trial testimony, these facts clearly appear: (1) Raymond was informed, before any questioning began, of Bright’s identity, his official position and the fact that he worked “for the state and the police” as “an in-between man”; (2) Raymond was aware he didn’t have to answer any questions and was also told by Bright, “It is your right” not to say anything; and (3) at least insofar as the present record is concerned Raymond’s statements were not coerced or in any sense involuntary.</p>
    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[193,984,1155,633]]]'>Assuming arguendo, that the initial action of the prosecuting authorities in sending Bright to see Raymond, without prior notice to his counsel, was “unfair” as that term is understood by the average layman, it is the “legal” unfairness, or the quantum of due process, present in the interview itself which is the paramount and pivotal point to be considered in deciding if constitutional rights were violated. In view of Raymond’s own trial testimony, described before, and the complete absence of any indication that his statements were not freely self-determined, we are not convinced that unfairness in a constitutional sense occurred.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[192,1637,1157,260]]]'>Raymond additionally contends that in any event he is entitled to a post-trial independent hearing, and judicial determination of the voluntariness of his statements to Bright, citing, <em>Jackson v.

While no specific objection to the use of Bright’s testimony on the ground of involuntariness was interposed at trial, counsel certainly indicated during the cross-examination of Bright and the questioning of Raymond during his testimony in sur-rebuttal, that all of Raymond’s statements to <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>Bright were compelled and given under fear that if he didn’t answer Bright’s questions, Raymond would be imprisoned for parole violation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This in our opinion was sufficient to raise the issue. Compare <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">supra.</a></p>
    <p id="b343-4" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[187,666,1153,851]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that a post-trial “Jackson” hearing is unnecessary, because the court below in its opinion accompanying the order dismissing the post-trial motions made a factual finding, that Raymond’s statements on the occasion involved were voluntary and this determination satisfied the requirements of <em>Jackson. </em>A simple answer to this argument is that where <em>Jackson </em>applies, not only is an independent judicial determination of the voluntariness issue, required, but also a full hearing on the question separate and apart from the jury, gee <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">supra,</a> and <em>Townsend v.
