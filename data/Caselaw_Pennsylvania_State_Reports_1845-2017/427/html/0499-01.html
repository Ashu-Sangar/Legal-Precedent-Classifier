L. 1198, as amended, 52 P.S. §1396.4 et seq.), pursuant to a confession of judgment clause contained in the bond instrument. Petitions to strike the judgments off the record were filed in each of the cases in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County at the Commonwealth Docket. They were dismissed.

The answer to this depends on what interpretation is to be given to the following language of that bond instrument: “And Further, the principal and surety abovenamed, upon the happening of any default on the conditions and obligations assumed under this bond and the declaration of a forfeiture by the Secretary of Mines and Mineral Industries, the period for appeal provided by the Act having expired, authorize and empower the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or any other attorney of any Court of Record in Pennsylvania, or elsewhere, by him deputized for the purpose, to appear for and confess judgment against them in favor of the Commonwealth with or without defalcation, with costs of suit, release of errors, without stay of execution, and the principal and surety doth also hereby waive the holding of an inquisition of any real estate that may be levied on by virtue thereof. <em>And for the doing of these acts, this instrument or a copy thereof, attested as aforesaid, shall he full warrant and authority,”</em>

No attestation as to its being a true and correct copy was attached. Thus, the question arises: Was the filing of such an unattested copy authorized by the above-quoted language of the bond under which the confession of judgment was entered? The Insurance Company contends that the phrase “attested as aforesaid” applies to the copy authorized to be filed and that unless the copy is so attested compliance with the confession of judgment clause has not been made. In reply, the Commonwealth, argues that the term “Attested as Aforesaid” merely refers back to the instrument or bond itself, that is, the original, and that so long as it was attested to, then a true and correct copy thereof is sufficient to authorize the confession <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>of judgment. The lower court agreed. We find no reason for disagreement with this conclusion. A logical reading of the language shows that the term “attested as aforesaid” was not intended to qualify or condition the kind of copy to be filed but was intended to insure that the original bond itself should be attested, and that a true and correct copy of the bond so attested could be filed in place of the original. The Insurance Company sees much danger in this conclusion in that it foresees the possibility of simultaneous filing of the same bond in every county merely by filing a copy in each of the counties, and, in such a case, the debtor would have to petition in each of the counties involved. However, this effect would not be avoided merely by having an attestation to the authenticity of the filed copy because it also could be so simultaneously filed. Furthermore, as pointed out by the Commonwealth, even where only the original is permitted to be filed, the judgment can be certified to the other counties within the Commonwealth.</p>

The Commonwealth in its confession of judgment averred that “defendants have neglected and failed to comply with the requirements of the said Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act, with respect to the lands affected by open pit mining operations for which the said bond was executed and delivered by the defendants. . .”. The Insurance Company claims the Commonwealth should have stated the particular requirements of the Act which had not been met. In <em>Park-Main Co. of Penn., Inc. v.

    <p id="b527-2" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[143,594,1158,793]]]'>The third ground of attack made by the Insurance Company is that the Commonwealth, in its confession of judgment, failed to aver that the period of appeal had expired. The bond merely states that upon the happening of any default and a declaration of forfeiture by the Secretary of Mines and Mineral Industries, the period of appeal provided by the Act having expired, judgment may be confessed against the obligor. There is no express requirement for a statement that the period of appeal provided for must have expired, and since on the face of the record there is nothing to indicate that any appeal was filed or pending (and in actual fact no appeal had been taken), no determination that judgment was prematurely confessed can be made.</p>

The surety insists that the disputed phrase, “attested as aforesaid,” modifies “copy” thus requiring that the copy be attested, while the Commonwealth insists that only a copy of the attested original is required. Appellants’ position is perhaps the more logical reading for, as we said in a different context, “it is a basic postulate of good sentence structure <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>to locate a modifying clause as close to its antecedent as possible. . . .” <em>Moore v.

If good sentence structure is thus to hold sway, “attested as aforesaid” modifies “copy” and appellants’ insistence upon an attested copy is supported by the language of the bond instrument.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[225,803,1158,374]]]'>Ambiguity also lurks in the phrase “the period for appeal provided by the Act having expired.” The bond instrument leaves unexplained whether the parties intended that expiration of the appeal period should be an express condition upon the right to confess judgment, in which case an averment to that effect would be necessary.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[225,1188,1156,685]]]'>Two well established legal maxims would thus seem to dictate that the petition to strike should have been granted.

The averment of default in the confession of judgment — “defendants have neglected and failed to comply with the requirements of the said Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act, with respect to the lands affected by open pit mining operations for which the said bond was executed and delivered” — is no more informative than a bare allegation that a default exists for which the surety is liable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Therefore, if even minimal specificity is required in an averment of default, the Commonwealth’s averment is not sufficient.

However, the averment held sufficient in <em>Park-Main </em>was that the defendant had failed to perform several covenants (to pay rentals and taxes) in its lease and the covenants breached were pleaded with sufficient specificity that the court could determine whether the lease did authorize confession of judgment for such a breach.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> To make <em>Park-Main </em>authority for the majority’s position, the allegation there would have stated merely that de.fendant “breached a covenant in the lease.”</p>
