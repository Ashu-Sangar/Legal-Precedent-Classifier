Addressing the <em>crimen falsi </em>issue, the Superior Court panel, in an unpublished decision, reweighed the five factors addressed in <em>Randall, </em>and vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for a new trial. Given its disposition, the panel did not reach the issue of appellee’s alibi witness. On the <em>Randall </em>question, the panel agreed with the trial court that factors one, four and five weighed in favor of the Commonwealth, <em>i.e., </em>in favor of admissibility, but took issue with the trial court’s weighing of factors two and three. Regarding the third factor — the defendant’s age and circumstances — the panel found that commission of a <em>crimen falsi </em>at the age of twenty-two could not be <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>held against appellee, and therefore this factor was neutral, instead of weighing in favor of the Commonwealth as the trial court had concluded. And finally, with respect to the second factor — the likelihood of the defendant’s record having a greater tendency to prejudice the defendant by showing a criminal propensity rather than to discredit — the panel disagreed that this factor merely weighed in favor of appellee, but insisted instead that it weighed heavily in appellee’s favor, indeed to the extent of “extreme prejudice.” Super.

While the parties and the lower courts agree that the first <em>Randall </em>factor — the degree to which the prior conviction reflects on veracity — favors admissibility since the prior offense was <em>crimen falsi </em>in nature, the Commonwealth argues that the second factor — the likelihood of a greater tendency that the criminal record will prejudice the defendant by showing criminal propensity — should not weigh as heavily as the Superior Court panel weighed it in favor of appellee. The Commonwealth does not contest that there was a potential for prejudice to appellee, but maintains that the test is whether the prejudice is outweighed by probative value, and in the Commonwealth’s view, the remain<a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>ing factors reveal the probative value of the prior offense in the instant matter.</p>
    <p id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.5",646,[262,420,1159,789]]]'>Moreover, the Commonwealth insists that the likelihood of improper prejudice was low in this case because the prosecutor’s references to the prior offense were few and brief, and because the prosecutor specifically argued to the jury that the crime was relevant only to assess appellee’s truthfulness on the stand, and not to show his criminal propensity. The Commonwealth further notes that the single prior offense at issue would have less of a tendency to cause an unfair prejudicial effect than was present in several other Pennsylvania reported decisions where multiple prior offenses were deemed admissible for purposes of impeachment, despite the potential to suggest criminal propensity. <em>See, e.g., Rivera, </em><a href="/pa/603/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="983 A.2d 1211" data-case-ids="4197501,7294605" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0340-01,/a2d/983/1211-01">983 A.2d at 1228</a> (“we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in determining that Appellant’s [five] previous <em>crimen falsi </em>adjudications were more probative than prejudicial.”).</p>

In support of this argument, the Commonwealth again cites <em>Rivera, </em>where this Court concluded that the trial court acted within its discretion in determining that juvenile adjudications involving <em>crimen falsi </em>were more probative than prejudicial. And, with regard to factors four (strength of case) and five (existence of alternate means of impeachment), the Commonwealth explains that this case came down to a credibility determination between appellee and the Commonwealth’s chief witness — two accused criminal confederates — who had starkly different versions of the events, and therefore appellee’s prior conviction was essential to the Commonwealth’s case. Along these lines, the Commonwealth notes that there was no other direct impeachment evidence available to the government. Thus, the Commonwealth maintains that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the Com<a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>monwealth to introduce, and then make reference to, the single prior <em>crimen falsi </em>for impeachment purposes only.</p>

According to this framing of the issue before this Court, the bulk of appellee’s argument concerns the proper weighing of the prejudicial effect and probative value of his prior <em>crimen falsi </em>conviction. Appellee thus focuses his attention on the second factor of the five-factor analysis — the likelihood of a greater tendency of the defendant’s criminal record to smear him by showing his criminal propensity. Appellee then attempts to support the panel’s reweighing of this factor by looking primarily to caselaw from outside of this Commonwealth and other Superior Court precedent to make the point that evidence of a prior conviction for the very same crime for which a defendant is being tried contains an inherent suggestion of criminal propensity. Appellee maintains that since the evidence against him was not overwhelming, the admission of the prior offense in this instance was particularly damaging and prejudicial. Appellee concedes that the credibility determination was the central issue at trial. Nonetheless, appellee discounts precedent relied upon by the trial court for the proposition that the need to introduce evidence of prior <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions is high where the jury must decide whether to believe a single Commonwealth witness or a single defense witness in order to reach a verdict.

      <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>Here, the Superior Court panel recognized that the trial court correctly identified and considered the governing substantive law: the <em>Randall </em>line of cases setting forth the requisite factors governing the admission of remote <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions. Nor did the panel, or appellee for that matter, suggest that the trial court’s judgment was manifestly unreasonable, the product of partiality, prejudice or ill-will, clearly erroneous, or represented a misapplication, or overriding of, Pennsylvania law. Rather, in overturning the trial court, the panel appears to have reweighed the probative value of appellee’s prior <em>crimen falsi </em>offense and its potential prejudicial effect by reapplying the requisite five-factor analysis on its own assessment, and then determined that the trial court abused its discretion because the panel, analyzing a cold record, reached a different conclusion. The panel’s approach and determination cannot stand.</p>
    <p id="b649-4" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[213,1167,1153,898]]]'>The difference between the trial court’s analysis and that of the Superior Court fundamentally is not a matter of legal error on the part of the trial court, but a reflection of differences in judgment in weighing and reweighing the same identified factors, yet reaching different conclusions. On the record here, where the trial court considered all factors in light of the case that unfolded before it, and where measures were taken, both by the trial court and the prosecutor, to ensure that the <em>crimen falsi </em>evidence was not misunderstood or misused, it cannot be said that the trial court’s decision suffers from such a lack of support that it is clearly erroneous. This is particularly so where there is no real dispute that of the five enumerated considerations in <em>Randall, </em>only one, a factor which was addressed and weighed by the trial court, has been argued to counsel against the trial court’s discretionary decision. At least three of the remaining four factors counsel in support of the trial court’s discretionary ruling.</p>

The vesting of discretion allows for flexibility in balancing factors, according to the circumstances. Thus, for example, there is certainly some force in appellee’s argument that, when the prior crime involves the same basic offense currently being <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>tried, there is a greater likelihood that a juror might lapse into viewing the prior crime as indicating a propensity for that particular type of crime. But, on the other hand, here, there was but one prior offense; obviously, the greater the number of prior <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions, the greater the danger of assuming propensity. And, the trial court took specific measures to deter the jury from considering the <em>crimen falsi </em>as establishing propensity. Appellee’s argument that admission of his <em>crimen falsi </em>could have been particularly harmful because the case came down to the credibility of two witnesses and the evidence thus was not overwhelming misses the complexity of the trial court’s discretionary task. If the <em>crimen falsi </em>undermined appellee’s case because the jury used it as a basis to discredit his testimony — which is how the evidence was posed to the jury by both the prosecutor and the judge — that was a proper use, properly “prejudicial” to appellee’s case, and not a basis for exclusion. Moreover, in understanding the totality of the circumstances affecting the trial court’s decision, it should be remembered that the Commonwealth’s prime witness was subject to impeachment as well, on multiple grounds, which obviously increases the importance, to the Commonwealth, of a similarly well-established form of impeachment. The point, we reiterate, is not how an appellate court might balance all of these factors, but rather, whether the trial court’s balancing so departs from what is reasonable that it can be set aside.</p>

The court found that the prior conviction reflected on appellee’s veracity and that appellee was old enough at the time of the conviction to have appreciated the consequences of his actions. Further, the court found that the Commonwealth’s case relied on D.M.’s testimony of the events, which conflicted with appellee’s account. Therefore, the court concluded, the Commonwealth’s need to use the prior conviction as impeachment evidence was high because alternative means of attacking appellee’s veracity were minimal. As noted, the court instructed the jury to limit its consideration of appellee’s prior <em>crimen falsi </em>offense to the sole purpose of assessing the credibility and weight of his testimony, and the Commonwealth specifically argued that the evidence was offered only to impeach appellee’s credibility.</p>

Notably, the panel cited former Chief Justice Nix’s dissenting opinion in <em>Randall </em>when it stated, without underlying support, that “the probative value of a conviction when an individual is in his early twenties is small” and, as a result, held that its value in the five-factor analysis was “neutral and neither weighted] in favor nor against introduction of the prior conviction.” Super.

Under Evidence Rule 609(d), in a criminal case, even evidence of an adjudication of juvenile delinquency “may be used to impeach the credibility of a witness if conviction of the offense would be admissible to attack the credibility of an adult.” Consistently, there is no support in Pennsylvania law for the proposition that the probative value of a young adult offender’s conviction “is small.” Indeed, former Chief Justice Nix <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>did not comment about the intrinsic probative value of a youthful conviction in his <em>Randall </em>dissent, but rather, what he believed was the arbitrary nature of the <em>Randall </em>majority’s <em>per se </em>rule of admissibility with a 10-year cutoff; the dissent’s examples spoke about the relevance of the prior conviction in several different scenarios. <a href="/citations/?q=528%20A.2d%201826" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="528 A.2d 1826">528 A.2d at 1330-31</a>.

Rule 609, are quite distinct. Thus, while subsection (d)(2) of the corresponding federal rule limits the admissibility of juvenile adjudications to those of witnesses other than the defendant, subsection (d) of the Pennsylvania rule, as stated, contains no such limitation, but specifically allows the use of juvenile adjudications for impeachment purposes.

Such an approach, then, is in substantial tension with the underlying philosophy and concerns as expressed in the earlier cases, as well as with Rule 609(b)’s goal of providing an essential check on the introduction of prior-crimes proofs which do not bear directly upon the question of guilt or innocence. Accordingly, I believe that Pennsylvania courts should recognize that Rule 609(b)(1), by its terms and for valid reasons, is restrictive in nature.</p>
