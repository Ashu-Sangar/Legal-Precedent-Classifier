    <blockquote id="b254-6" data-blocks='[["BL_254.6",254,[316,604,1105,311]]]'>(1) Where Section 708(c) of the Right-[t]o-Know Law specifically provides that a “financial record” is not exempt from disclosure on the basis that it contains a “trade secret” or “confidential proprietary information,” is this explicit provision nullified by the earlier-enacted Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b254-7" data-blocks='[["BL_254.7",254,[316,943,1104,312]]]'>(2) When public funds are funneled through middlemen before reaching their intended beneficiaries, are the records documenting this flow of public funds “financial records” required to be disclosed under the current version of the Right-[t]o-Know Law, as they were under the prior version of the law?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b254-8" data-blocks='[["BL_254.8",254,[316,1283,1105,356]]]'>(3) Are historical rates paid by Medicaid managed-care organizations (MCOs) “confidential proprietary information” and “trade secrets,” when the rates from one year do not reveal the rates for future years, and when most of the MCOs have already disclosed such rates to a subcontractor who negotiates rates with their competitors?</blockquote>
