Standing is a legal interest that “empowers a defendant to assert a constitutional violation and thus seek to exclude or suppress the government’s evidence pursuant to the exclusionary rules under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.” <em><a href="/a2d/718/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="718 A.2d 265" data-case-ids="11683785,356216" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0265-01,/pa/553/0076-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/a2d/718/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="718 A.2d 265" data-case-ids="11683785,356216" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0265-01,/pa/553/0076-01">at 266</a> (citations omitted).

The expectation of privacy is an inquiry into the validity of the search or seizure itself; if the defendant has no protected privacy interest, neither the Fourth Amendment nor Article I, § 8 is implicated. <em>See Commonwealth v. White, </em><a href="/pa/459/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="459 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="481008" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0084-01">459 Pa. 84</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="459 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="481008" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0084-01">327 A.2d 40</a>, 42 (1974). In essence, while a defendant’s standing dictates when a claim under Article I, § 8 may be brought, his privacy interest controls whether the claim will succeed — once a defendant has shown standing, “[h]e must, in short, having brought his claim, demonstrate its merits by a showing of his reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises.” <em>Peterson, </em>at 618 (citation omitted).</p>

This argument is without merit, and we of course are not <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>bound by precedent from a panel of the Superior Court. In <em>Boulware, </em>the defendant was charged with robbery and filed a motion to suppress evidence, which included a sweatshirt seized from his home. At the suppression hearing, he presented no evidence, and had no automatic standing as robbery was not a possessory crime. The Commonwealth presented no evidence pertaining to his arrest or seizure of the sweatshirt — accordingly, the trial court suppressed the evidence, and the Superior Court reversed, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant had not shown standing.</p>

Privacy expectations are “preliminary” in the sense that their absence renders all that follows irrelevant. Indeed, in all of these cases, the Commonwealth presented evidence sufficient to allow disposition of the defendant’s claim — in each case, the Commonwealth’s evidence showed the defendant lacked any protected privacy interest, and the defendant failed to effectively rebut that evidence. We were not dealing with the peculiar situation in which the Commonwealth refused to call a single witness.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Rather, each case dealt with the court’s post-hearing analysis of a claim’s merits and the significance of a defendant’s privacy interest in conducting that inquiry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> None of these cases involved the <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>order in which evidence is presented, or the shifting of burdens, and one should not read them as commenting on those issues.</p>

Consequently, the court was forced to decide the motion based solely on which party bore the burden of production, the burden of “going forward with the evidence,” which, as the Superior Court noted, are basically synonymous terms. The allocation of that burden is clear — the Commonwealth must prove the constitutional rights of the accused were not violated by the search. The allegation is that unlawful detention led to the search, but if the evidence shows there was no expectation of privacy in the area searched, the prosecution has met its burden and need not go further. The lawfulness of the detention becomes irrelevant, as constitutional error cannot inure to the benefit of the expectation-less accused. To overcome that result, the accused has the burden of showing such an expectation did exist. If the accused does so, the search is again at issue, and the prosecution must prove its constitutionality.</p>

However, as it relates to the parties’ presentation of evidence, our cases and the Rules of Criminal Procedure make clear that the Commonwealth has the burden of production, to give the court evidence allowing that conclusion.

In this regard, I would note that courts are often imprecise when addressing burdens of proof. <em>See generally </em>John Calvin Jeffries, Jr. &amp; Paul B. Stephan III, <em>Defenses, Presumptions, and Burden of Proof in Criminal Law, </em><a href="/citations/?q=88%20Yale%20L.J.%201325" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="88 Yale L.J. 1325">88 Yale L.J. 1325</a>, 1329 n. 8 (1979) (commenting that the term “burdens of proof’ is sometimes used indiscriminately to refer either to burdens of production or persuasion and that, sometimes, unfortunately, burdens are misaligned on account of such loose usage). Thus, this Court’s previous depictions of a burden upon defendants to “prove” a legitimate expectation of privacy should not necessarily be regarded as a fully realized elaboration of the nature and extent of that burden, particularly in the absence of a developed explanation. Certainly, it would be more consistent with this Court’s admonition that the burden of persuasion rests on the Commonwealth, <em>In re L.J., </em><a href="/pa/622/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="622 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="4280631" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0126-01">622 Pa. 126</a>, 146-47, <a href="/pa/622/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="79 A.3d 1073" data-case-ids="4280631,7305477" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0126-01,/a3d/79/1073-01">79 A.3d 1073</a>, 1085 (2013), to treat the defendant’s burden in addressing privacy expectations as one of going forward with the evidence (or as one of production contingent on the Commonwealth’s previous satisfaction of its burden of production),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> rather than as a “judicially <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>created exception to the general rule that the burden of persuasion is on the Commonwealth.” Majority Opinion, at 368 n. 5, 106 A.3d at 701 n. 5.

As the majority observes, it may be the case that the Commonwealth’s evidence demonstrates a defendant’s privacy interest, for example, where an officer testifies that he removed contraband from the defendant’s person. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 369 n. 6, 106 A.3d at 702 n. 6. On the other hand, if, in satisfying its initial burden of production, the Commonwealth demonstrates that contraband was remote from the defendant and his property, the defendant should be required to at least go forward with evidence demonstrating his privacy interest. This sort of burden-shifting paradigm is common in the adjudicatory setting. <em>See, e.g., 500 James Hance Ct. v. Pa.

I would also note that there is a good argument to be made that a threshold focus, before assessing hearing burdens, should be on the sufficiency of the suppression motion in the first instance. <em>See generally </em>William E. Ringel, Searches and Seizures Arrests and Confessions § 20:12 (2d ed.2014) (discussing hearing burdens allocated ‘‘[i]f the moving papers provide sufficient information to require a suppression hearing”). Additionally, most jurisdictions distinguish between warrant-based searches and warrantless ones, in terms of burden allocation. <em>See <a href="/pa/613/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="33 A.3d 555" data-case-ids="4206000,7270550" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0238-01,/a3d/33/0555-01">id.</a> </em>("A defendant generally has the burden of showing a constitutional infirmity if a search or seizure was carried out pursuant to a warrant, while the burden of proof is on the prosecution if the police acted without a warrant.”). It is an unfortunate consequence of the nature of the adjudicatory process that the Court is most often unable to assess regimes with interrelated facets in a comprehensive fashion, toward the end of enhancing fairness and efficiency. To the degree that burdens of proof are an appropriate subject of rulemaking, perhaps that forum might offer a better change for a broader assessment of available options.</p>
