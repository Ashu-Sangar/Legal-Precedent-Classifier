Based upon evidence recovered from the trash pulls, including plastic “baggies” containing residue of both cocaine and marijuana, the police obtained a search warrant, which was served and executed at appellee’s residence on March 25, 2009, by Officer Grove and North Middleton Township Police Detective Timothy Lively. During the search, the officers found two baggies, each containing roughly ten grams of marijuana, and $700 cash in the drawer of a dresser in the master bedroom; in a shoebox on top of the same dresser, the officers found a used “bong,” two marijuana pipes, a grinder (commonly used to separate marijuana seeds and stems from the leaves that are smoked), an open package of “Philly Blunts,” empty baggies of various sizes, and the “end portion of a joint.” Searching the basement of the residence, the officers found a small bag of marijuana inside a freezer and a “bud” of marijuana in a small woven basket.</p>
    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[269,1701,1149,517]]]'>During the search, the officers also found a used marijuana pipe and an electronic scale covered with marijuana residue on top of the refrigerator in the kitchen. Detective Lively looked for cell phones in the residence because drug dealers and users commonly use cell phones to communicate and arrange transactions. He seized two cell phones, one of which he found on the kitchen table near where appellee was during the search; appellee asked him several times “why her cell phone was being taken.” Appellee was arrested, along with Dallas Conrad and Norman Koch.</p>

When the prosecutor began to question Detective Lively about his interpretation of the text messages on appellee’s cell phone, defense counsel, at sidebar, objected to the messages as hearsay, describing them as “unreliable because the phone was shared between two people” and protesting against the detective “read[ing] a conversation between two people that have not been called as a witness [sic]....

    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[225,524,1151,681]]]'>The court ruled that Detective Lively could testify about his impression of the messages on appellee’s phone to show that, in the prosecutor’s words, “[appellee’s] phone was used in drug transactions, and, therefore, it makes it more probable than not when [appellee] possessed this marijuana that she did so with the intent to deliver as opposed to personal use.” Defense counsel reiterated his objection, arguing that admission of the contents of the messages invited speculation by the jury as to “who is making those calls,” and was prejudicial to appellee in regards to both the PWID and conspiracy charges. The court overruled appellee’s objection but agreed to provide a cautionary instruction based on the outcome of Detective Lively’s testimony regarding the text messages. <em>Id. </em>at 76-79.</p>

During both direct and cross-examination, Detective Lively testified that although the messages were in a phone that appellee had asserted she owned, he could not determine whether appellee had been the correspondent in the purported drug sales messages.

Appellee filed a post-verdict motion challenging admission of the content of the text messages as inadmissible hearsay.

The trial court denied appellee’s post-verdict motion and sentenced her to 23 months of supervised probation.

Appellee also claimed that the text messages were improperly admitted because: “Although the District Attorney was clear that the text messages were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, once admitted into evidence, the jury was then left to guess at which if any text messages were sent and received by [appellee] and then speculate on whether or not [appellee] was involved with delivering narcotics. In addition, certain text messages were clearly evidencing drug transactions; it was not a coincidence that [appellee] was then convicted of [PWID].” Appellee’s Brief to Superior Court, at 16-20. In response, the Commonwealth posited, as the trial court had, that questions of authorship of the text messages went to the weight of the evidence. Regarding appellee’s hearsay claim, the Commonwealth hewed to its position that the messages were not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show appellee’s intentional involvement in selling drugs, not through the messages’ content, but by the fact that she was actively engaged in making arrangements using her cell phone.

The messages themselves did not <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>contain any “contextual clues” like those in <em>F.P., </em>and the mere fact that appellee admitted the phone itself was hers did not establish that she had been an active correspondent in these particular drug sales text messages.

The panel added that the improper admission of the messages was compounded by their being used as the basis for an expert opinion by Detective Lively that appellee was using her cell phone to arrange drug sales via text messaging. And, according to the panel, the messages could not be admitted under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. The panel again concluded that admission of the unauthenticated hearsay messages was not harmless error: “The prejudicial effect of the improperly admitted text message evidence was so pervasive in tending to show that [appellee] took an active role in an illicit enterprise that it cannot be deemed harmless. Even with the improperly admitted evidence, the jury only found [appellee] liable as an accomplice.” For this independent reason, the panel held that a new trial was required. <em><a href="/pa/614/0697-02" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="39 A.3d 996" data-case-ids="4206433,4207047,7315882,7315893,7315918" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0697-02,/pa/614/0698-01,/a3d/39/0996-01,/a3d/39/0996-02,/a3d/39/0996-03">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/614/0697-02" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="39 A.3d 996" data-case-ids="4206433,4207047,7315882,7315893,7315918" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0697-02,/pa/614/0698-01,/a3d/39/0996-01,/a3d/39/0996-02,/a3d/39/0996-03">at 1005-07</a>.</p>

The purpose of the detective’s testimony was to deconstruct and interpret the slang that was used in the <em>messages </em>— i.e., their very text — to explain to the jury what was said out of court in the messages. And, of course, it just so happened that what the detective discerned in the messages was evidence of the very crimes with which appellee was charged. Thus, the detective opined that the text messages evidenced drug sales in a manner that implicated appellee, even though the detective admitted he could not prove she had been a correspondent. Appellee distinguishes <em>Glover </em>because, in that case, the notebook containing dates and sums was described as only possibly (not surely) indicating drug sales activity and was proffered not to prove the truth of its contents, but to show only “that these types of records were kept and were in [Glover’s] possession.” <a href="/pa-super/399/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="399 Pa.

Lawyers with trial experience know that when a party has classic hearsay evidence that it knows is harmful to the opposing party, but cannot actually identify a theory to overcome exclusion on hearsay grounds, a common fallback position is to declare that the out-of-court statements are not being offered for their truth. Counsel in such circumstances recognize that if they can manage to get the evidence admitted this way, the party’s cause will be advanced, irrespective of reliability or relevancy. But, the required analytical response to this facile fallback position is: if the hearsay is not being offered for its truth, then what exactly is its relevance? And, assuming some such tangential relevance, does the probative value of the evidence outweigh the potential for prejudice? In this case, the inquiry is not difficult because the only relevance of this evidence — drug sales text messages on appellee’s cell phone — is precisely for the truth of the matter asserted, and we have little doubt that that is precisely how the lay jury construed it.</p>

The prosecutor conceded that he sought to admit the message contents as substantive evidence probative of appellee’s alleged intent to engage in drug sales activity. And that is certainly how the jury would construe the messages. It requires a suspension of disbelief to conclude that the messages had any relevance beyond their substantive and incriminating import, especially because they served as a platform for the crucial expert testimony of Detective Lively. Furthermore, as the panel below recognized, the Commonwealth’s evidence of appellee’s intent to deliver, without the truth revealed in the messages (via the expert testimony of the detective), was negligible. Simply put, the messages were out-of-court statements that were relevant, and indeed proffered, for a purpose that depended upon the truth of their contents, as probative of appellee’s alleged intent to deliver. Accordingly, appellee’s hearsay objection had merit and, in light of the paucity of other evidence that she possessed illegal drugs with the intent to deliver, the trial court’s abuse of discretion in admitting the message contents was not harmless error.</p>

While our rules, in this regard, may appear to be vulnerable to the criticism that they are more reflexive than analytical, it should be noted that trial judges are invested with discretion to exclude evidence (including statements containing implied assertions), where the probative value is outweighed by dangers of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading jurors. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 403.</p>

In such an undertaking, however, it would also be worth considering the perspective that implied assertions arising out of performance-based or instrumental verbal conduct (such as drug solicitations) should be treated as non-hearsay, at least where the assertive quality of the speech fairly can be viewed as subordinate to the instrumental aspect. <em>See, e.g., </em>Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, 4 Fed.
