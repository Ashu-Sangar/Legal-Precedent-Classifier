Instead, construing its task as determining the applicable statute of limitations, the court examined the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6801(c),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which requires the Commonwealth to institute proceedings for the forfeiture of <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>seized property “forthwith,” and 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(5),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which imposes a two-year statute of limitations for commencement of forfeiture proceedings.

During this period, the individual — who may be innocent of any criminal wrongdoing and unlearned in the law — may have no indication that a minimal window of opportunity is closing on his ownership of the subject property. In cases (such as this one) where the property owner is charged with a crime, moreover, it seems unlikely that the defendant would be primarily concerned with recovering the seized property during his period of jeopardy, as his most pressing concern would appear to be avoiding criminal punishment.

The majority’s solution is to impose a 30-day statute of limitations under a “waiver” rubric. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 590-91, 107 A.3d at 717. Waiver precepts, however, ordinarily pertain when the aggrieved party could have raised an issue at an earlier proceeding that actually occurred, but failed to do so. Here, there was no earlier <em>in rem </em>proceeding relative to the seized property, and hence, the majority is left to resort to a jurisdictional “tail” pertaining to the <em>criminal </em>matter which, although associated with the seizure in terms of the underlying facts, is nonetheless a distinct type of legal proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Indeed, there is nothing in Rule 588 that purports to contextualize a motion for return of property within any criminal proceeding, as it clearly contemplates a motion made even where no criminal charges are filed. As such, application of the 30-day jurisdictional period as an overlay upon Rule 588 is unsupported by the rule’s text, highly attenuated, and contrary to the general precept that legal authorization for property forfeiture should be strictly construed. <em>See Commonwealth v. $2,52348 in U.S. Currency, </em><a href="/pa/538/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="538 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="475521" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0551-01">538 Pa. 551</a>, 556-57, <a href="/pa/538/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="649 A.2d 658" data-case-ids="475521,7872763" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0551-01,/a2d/649/0658-01">649 A.2d 658</a>, 660-61 (1994).</p>

If the Commonwealth wishes to settle title without waiting for the owner to file a Rule 588 motion, it has recourse to the Forfeiture Act. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S., Part IV, Chapter 68.

If a defendant in such circumstances files a Rule 588 motion for the return of property, I see no reason why the motion should not be adjudicated on its merits.

The legislature, to augment the protections against unlawful taking of personal property by the government enshrined in our state and federal constitutions, has crafted a substantive legal framework in the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6801 (“Forfeiture Act”), and the Disposition of Abandoned and Unclaimed Property Act, 72 P.S. § 1301.1, <em>et. seq. </em>(“Unclaimed Property Act”), to limit the circumstances under which the Commonwealth may terminate a person’s ownership interest in property in its <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>possession.

      <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>Accepting as true the assertions of the parties with respect to what transpired below, the Commonwealth did not commence a forfeiture proceeding -within 2 years after seizure of Appellee’s money; thus, under the plain terms of Section 6801(d), the Commonwealth, at present, continues to be merely the custodian of this money. The effect of the majority’s interpretation of Rule 588, however, appears to be the creation of a new substantive right of ownership in the Commonwealth of seized property whenever a person from whom the property is seized by police fails, for whatever reason, to file a motion for return of property under Pa.R.Crim.P. 588 within a 30-day period after seizure, and, as here, neither criminal charges nor forfeiture proceedings are ever commenced by the Commonwealth.</p>

Further, the Unclaimed Property Act requires that all property in the custody of a public officer or political subdivision which has become abandoned and unclaimed be physically transferred to our state Treasurer, who is obligated to publish annual lists of such property in order to facilitate an owner’s claim for its return. <em><a href="/pa/583/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="880 A.2d 523" data-case-ids="687717,8936770" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0544-01,/a2d/880/0523-01">Id.,</a> </em>§§ 1301.11-1301.13. Consequently, in the absence of a <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>forfeiture proceeding or pending criminal matter, the money seized from Appellee should have been turned over to the Treasurer 5 years after it was seized from Appellee. However, apparently these procedures were not followed in this case.</p>
    <p id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[209,533,1149,800]]]'>Under these circumstances, then, the majority’s restrictive construction of Rule 588, <em>de hors </em>its text, and in opposition to the principle that our Rules of Criminal Procedure should be administered in a manner as to secure fundamental fairness, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 101(B), has essentially foreclosed Appellee’s ability to use the judicial process to seek return of his property, thereby effectively transferring legal title therein to the Commonwealth. Consequently, as the practical effect of the majority’s interpretation is to bestow upon the Commonwealth a substantive right to the acquisition of seized property under these circumstances, contrary to the Forfeiture Act and the Unclaimed Property Act, it conflicts with the principle that our rules are to be construed only to effectuate the exercise of substantive rights, and not for the diminution of those rights. <em>Morris, Fowler, supra.</em>
