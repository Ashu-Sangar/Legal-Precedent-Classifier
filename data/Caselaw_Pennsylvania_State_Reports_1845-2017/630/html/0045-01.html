      <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>In discovery, Hirsch tendered the report of an electrical engineer, Richard W. Wunderley, P.E., who had been retained to render an opinion concerning Duquesne Light’s role in the events giving rise to the funeral home’s destruction. In his analysis, the engineer initially dismissed the hypothesis that the electric company’s line crew had misconnected wires when restoring power. <em>See </em>Engineer’s Report, EFI Global, dated August 23, 2010, at 6 (“The improper connection hypothesis at the single phase mast head was eliminated after the evidence examination and further discovery information was received.”). Mr. Wunderley advanced another theory, however. He posited that, during the downing of the utility pole, a primary line consisting of wires (or conductors) carrying high-voltage electricity from a substation had contacted stepped-down secondary lines transmitting lower-voltage current to the funeral home, causing an “over voltage/over current condition” in the electrical system interior to the funeral home and touching off a short-circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The engineer indicated that Duquesne Light’s subsequent reenergizing of the damaged electrical system heated the metal panel box to an extreme temperature, igniting the attached wood backing. <em>See id. </em>at 2, 6.</p>

Furthermore, Mr. Wunderley asserted that the extensive damage to the utility pole and lines at the crash site afforded Duquesne’s line crew ample notice of a substantial likelihood that the high-voltage primary conductors contacted the lower-voltage secondary lines. <em>See id. </em>at 7 (“The potential for damage inside the funeral home due to the physical damage to the service connections and probable contact between the 4000 volt primary and secondary conductors was <em>a compelling reason and cause to inspect </em>the metering equipment in the funeral home prior to reenergizing the single phase service.” (emphasis added)); Engineer’s Supplemental <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Report, EFI Global, dated August 31, 2010, at 3 (referencing the conditions outside Hirsch’s premises as presenting <em>“strong/compelling evidence ... that should have caused Duquesne Light to inspect </em>the electrical system in the funeral home prior to reenergizing the electric service.” (emphasis added)). Moreover, had an inspection been undertaken prior to restoration of power, the engineer stated, the damage to the electrical panel would have been discovered and the fire averted. <em>See </em>Engineer’s Report, EFI Global, dated August 23, 2010, at 7-8 (“Because Duquesne Light failed to inspect the electrical system, ... the above events/conditions resulted in a catastrophic failure and fire.”).</p>
    <p id="b89-4" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[239,946,1151,626]]]'>At the close of discovery, Duquesne Light pursued summary judgment. The electric company rested its motion squarely on the premise that <em>“[t]he only basis </em>asserted for liability is that before restoring power, the Duquesne Light crew should have entered the locked Funeral Home in the middle of the night, gone to the basement, and inspected the customer’s electrical panel.” Brief in Support of Summary Judgment at 4 (emphasis added).

Althaus v. Cohen, </em><a href="/pa/562/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="562 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="225970" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0547-01">562 Pa. 547</a>, 552, <a href="/a2d/756/1166-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="756 A.2d 1166" data-case-ids="11244912,225970" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/1166-01,/pa/562/0547-01">756 A.2d 1166</a>, 1168 (2000). The electric company’s <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>essential position was that the service point establishes a firm line of demarcation between the responsibilities of an electric service provider and the customer — if a failure occurs on the utility’s side, it may bear responsibility, and certainly the company has the obligation to make reasonable inspections of its own equipment up to the service point. But if any failure occurs on the customer side, Duquesne asserted, it can be the customer’s — and only the customer’s — responsibility, and under no circumstances is an electric service provider obliged to inspect private electrical systems internal to serviced premises.</p>

      <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>It makes perfect sense for tort law to impose a duty upon a utility to install, inspect and maintain its own equipment in a safe condition. It makes no sense to extend the utility’s duty to the customer’s equipment. If Duquesne Light were to be required to enter the Funeral Home and inspect electrical facilities before restoring power, which items of equipment should it inspect? The panel box only? What about fuses and circuit breakers? Should Duquesne Light take the cover off the panel box and check the connections in the back? What about the wires carrying power throughout the building? What about the toaster in the kitchen? Once the line of demarcation between the utility’s equipment and the customer’s equipment is crossed, there is no logical limit to the utility’s potential responsibility.

To evidence notice, on Duquesne Light’s part, of a dangerous condition <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>within the funeral home, Hirsch referenced the circumstances which, in Mr. Wunderley’s opinion, generated a “compelling reason” to inspect the meters inside the premises. Engineer’s Report, EFI Global, dated August 23, 2010, at 7. These included the downed, broken high-voltage lines with which the electric company’s work crew was confronted, as well as a tripped circuit breaker at a substation connected to the pole’s transformer, indicative of a power surge. <em>See </em>Response in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment at ¶¶ 5, 11 (citing Deposition of Joseph G.

    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[281,971,1152,1174]]]'>As to duty, Hirsch eschewed Duquesne Light’s vision of a rigid line of demarcation between the responsibilities of an electric company and the customer. According to Hirsch, none of the cases relied upon by the electric company involved circumstances in which an electric service provider should have foreseen the sequence of events causing harm. In light of the circumstances known to the utility’s line crew when members restored power to the funeral home, Hirsch argued that damage to the building’s electrical system was eminently foreseeable to them. Along these lines, the funeral business owner stressed that Duquesne was a litigant in a prior case involving a line-crossing, overvoltage scenario. <em>See Wivagg v. Duquesne Light Co., </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/73/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="73 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 694" data-case-ids="4577698" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/73/0694-01">73 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 694</a> (C.P. Allegheny 1975). In response to Duquesne’s protestations about entering customer premises, Hirsch highlighted a passage from the “Duquesne Light Schedule of Rates and Service Installation Rules” indicating that utility representatives have a right of access to customer premises to read meters, for inspection and repairs, and for any other purposes incident to service. <em>See, e.g., </em>Appendix to Response in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment at Ex.

In this regard, Hirsch highlighted that it and Duquesne Lighting maintained a business relationship beneficial to both parties, acknowledged the high social utility of electric service, stressed its proffer that the risk of an overvoltage scenario is foreseeable (including the expert report of Mr. Wunderley), alluded to the catastrophic consequences of an uncontrolled fire, indicated that the burden of conducting an electrical inspection is modest in comparison to the harm, and urged that the overall public interest in terms of the preservation of lives and property would be advanced by recognition of an affirmative duty to inspect. <em>See </em>Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment at 17-21.</p>

While Duquesne Light and the dissenting opinion authored by Mr. Justice Eakin invoke the <em>Milton </em>line of decisions, they point to no statement or developed reasoning appearing in that opinion or any other Pennsylvania case reflecting an informed, judicial holding that the general service-point demarcation obviates the common-law duty to take reasonable measures to avert harm to others occasioned by one’s own conduct in the face of actual or constructive knowledge of an unreasonable risk. Indeed, the Superior Court in <em>Adams </em>apprehended that this question simply is not addressed through application of the general service-point rule as articulated in <em>Milton. See Adams, </em><a href="/pa-super/69/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="69 Pa.

In this regard, moreover, Hirsch aptly references the principle that the holdings of the decisions must be read against their facts. <em>See, e.g., Maloney v. Valley Med.

Parenthetically, given that the <em>Adams </em>court cautioned that its opinion (and implicitly <em>Milton, </em>upon which <em>Adams </em>relied) should not be read to insulate electric companies from the common-law duty in issue, the dissent's basis for citing <em>Adams </em>as supporting the contrary proposition is unclear. <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion, at 70-71, 106 A.3d at 43-44 (Eakin, X).</p>

Nowhere in its submissions does the utility specifically deny that an electric service provider, on actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition of electrical equipment inside a customer's premises proximate to downed wires, should refrain from restoring power, at least pending the undertaking of reasonable efforts to notify an affected customer.</p>

Moreover, to the degree that the Superior Court's <em>Althaus </em>assessment appears to be abstract, conclusory, and debatable, this would seem to be attributable, at least in part, to the absence of a concrete record-based foundation to support an informed treatment of substantially mixed public policy considerations. Parenthetically in considering this litigation from an overview perspective, we do recognize there are fairness concerns on both sides. For example, on the one hand, Hirsch did not specifically focus its pleadings and submissions in the common pleas court on warnings, and, indeed, it has not sought to amend the complaint although it has pursued a substituted theory of liability resting on different factual premises. Furthermore, Mr. Wunderley’s opinion about the probability of an overvoltage event is stated in somewhat conclusory terms, with nothing empirical to bolster his assessment as to the degree of likelihood.</p>

This Court has no idea how likely it is, when mixed-voltage utility lines fall proximate to a structure, that a power surge may impact the building’s electrical system. Certainly, the probability may depend upon such factors as the position of the lines on the ground and the general efficacy of controls interposed in the electrical infrastructure, such as control switches and circuit breakers. <em>See, e.g., </em>17 AmJur. Proof of Facts 2d § 643 (2014) (explaining that "[i]n view of the great destructive capabilities of electricity, it is to be expected that many controls would be imposed on distributors" and "[p]ole-top automatic switches and automatic circuit breakers have been in practical use since 1912”). According to Mr. Wunderley's report, however, the engineer considers a surge to be a materially likely outcome, and Duquesne Light’s summary judgment effort simply was not orchestrated in a fashion which would reasonably put counter-considerations into play.

Thus, our order did not indicate that we would consider the secondary aspect of the Superior Court’s holding that Duquesne Light had, in the alternative, a duty to warn Hirsch of the danger presented by its reconnection of electrical service to Hirsch’s damaged electrical system. Consequently, I do not fault Duquesne Light for what the majority characterizes as a failure to adequately acknowledge this second basis of the Superior Court holding, and to address it in its brief. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 48, 106 A.3d at 29 (“It is material to bear in mind from the outset, however, that [Duquesne Light’s] portrayal of the issues fails to adequately address the Superior Court’s formulation of electric-company duties, in the alternative, to ... <em>at a minimum, to warn a customer, </em>under the facts alleged.” (emphasis original)); <em>id. </em>at 64, 106 A.3d at 39 (observing that Duquesne Light “fails to deal squarely with” the issue of its duty to warn); <em>id. </em>at 69, 106 A.3d at 42 (“Since Duquesne Light has failed to adequately confront the common law duties invoked by Hirs[c]h or the warnings dynamic tempering the Superior Court’s ruling, we have little basis to assess whether the electric company might be accorded immunity from such duties, or whether a requirement to warn might be unreasonable.”).
