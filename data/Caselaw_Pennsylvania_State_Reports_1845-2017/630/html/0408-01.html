Juveniles’ Brief at 20-22 (discussing research including the Pennsylvania Juvenile Court Judges’ Commission’s report entitled <em>The Pennsylvania Juvenile Justice Recidivism Report: Juveniles with Cases Closed in 2007, 2008, or 2009 </em>at 85 (Nov. 2013), <em>found at </em>Appendix to the Juveniles’ Brief at A153 (stating that the recidivism rate for juvenile sexual offenders to commit another sexual offense is less than two percent)). The Juveniles contend that registration therefore should not be tied to the offense but instead to an individualized assessment of the likelihood of reoffense.</p>

Instead, they contend that registration could have the opposite result because it erects obstacles for rehabilitation and impedes a child’s pathway to a normal productive life through continuously reinforcing the unlikely supposition that the youth has “a high risk of committing additional sexual offenses.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.11(a)(4). The Juveniles argue that children subject to registration requirements suffer various irreparable harms, including difficulty obtaining housing, employment, and schooling, and suffer resulting psychological effects which can lead to depression and personal safety risks. They contend that lifetime registration as a sex offender contradicts the underlying purpose of Pennsylvania’s juvenile justice system, which emphasizes rehabilitation to allow children to become productive members of society.</p>

Indeed, a primary purpose of SORNA is to inform and warn law enforcement and the public of the potential danger of those registered as sexual offenders. Moreover, even without this language, the common view of registered sexual offenders is that they are particularly dangerous and more likely to reoffend than other criminals. <em>See, e.g., B.B. </em>at 19 (“Common sense, as well as our society’s perception of Megan’s Law registrants, would lead an average person of reasonable intelligence to conclude that there is something dangerous about the registrant.”); Juveniles’ Brief at 20 (referencing research regarding public perceptions of sexual offenders).

Instead, the juvenile offender is automatically designated a sexual offender solely as a result of the delinquency adjudication under Section 9799.12 (defining “juvenile offender” and “sexual offender”) and 9799.13 (entitled “Applicability”), with the attendant presumption of a high risk of reoffense.
