The following is a summary of the facts pertinent to the issues raised on collateral review. Prior to 2000, Appellant served a sentence in Ohio for aggravated assault against a former girlfriend whom he had accused of having sexual relations with one of his brothers. In late April 2000, Appellant’s new girlfriend, Angelina Taylor, and her two-year-old son moved from Ohio to live with Appellant at 26 Hager Street in Lancaster. Appellant’s mother, sisters, brothers, and the girlfriend and children of Appellant’s brother, Spanky Davido, also resided there. On Sunday morning, May 14, 2000, an argument arose between Appellant and Ms. Taylor deriving from his suspicion that she had engaged in oral sex with Spanky Davido.</p>

Trial, 12/5/01, at 59. Ms. Taylor begged Appellant to stop hitting her and asked Appellant’s sister for help. When Appellant’s sister told Appellant to stop beating Ms. Taylor, Appellant cursed at her and ordered her to leave. Ultimately, all of Appellant’s relatives left the residence, taking Ms. Taylor’s son with them, leaving only Appellant and Ms. Taylor inside. At 7:52 a.m., shortly after leaving the residence, Appellant’s sister called 911 from a pay phone several blocks away. After identifying herself as a <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>neighbor, she reported that a man was beating a woman at 26 Hager Street.</p>

The officers arrived at the residence shortly before 8:00 a.m., but all was quiet. They knocked at the front and back doors, but no one answered. They opened an unsecured window in the front of the house, announced themselves and listened for any response, but heard nothing. The officers radioed police dispatch for information regarding the 911 caller or for the phone number within the residence. The officers were told by dispatch that the 911 call had come from a pay phone and that no phone number was listed for the address. The officers heard a phone ringing inside but the call was not answered. Responding to a “gut feeling” that someone inside might be injured or otherwise in need of assistance, one officer entered the residence through an unsecured window, unlocked a deadbolt on the front door, and admitted the other officer. N.T. Trial, 12/5/01, at 84. The officers continued to announce themselves and their reason for being there, and proceeded to conduct a floor-to-floor, room-to-room search for any injured person who might have been in need of assistance.</p>

He ran along a rooftop, jumped onto a car parked in an adjacent alley, and then ran to the home of Michele Gray. He informed Ms. Gray that he had beaten Ms. Taylor, and that he had fled when he had heard the police in the house. He also told her that at the time he fled, Ms. Taylor had been pale, motionless, unresponsive, and having trouble breathing.</p>

Her eyes were open but she was completely unresponsive and having difficulty breathing. The officers called for emergency response personnel, who took the victim to the hospital. The police then secured the scene and obtained a search warrant for the residence.</p>

In the trauma unit, a rape-kit examination was conducted, which revealed numerous lacerations, bruises and abrasions inside and outside the victim’s vagina. A large quantity of motile sperm was removed from inside her vagina as well. The victim never regained consciousness and her brainstem herniated from the swelling inside her head. The victim was pronounced brain-dead at 4:55 p.m. on May 14, 2000, and was removed from life-support the next day, after her identity had been established and her parents, who had been contacted in Ohio, arrived at the hospital and gave their consent to end life-support.</p>

At first, Appellant denied strangling the victim, but he later admitted that he had choked her with his hands, while denying that he used a cord or other ligature device. He theorized that the bruising on the victim’s neck could have come from her shirt, because he had pulled on it. He admitted slapping the victim but denied hitting her with a closed fist. When asked about the bruises on her body and <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>face, he stated that the victim had fallen down the stairs from the second floor to the first floor and had landed on her face. He later explained that he and the victim had been standing near the top of the steps and that she had grabbed his shirt. He further stated that he then turned around and grabbed at her, and “she flew over my head like a dream” and tumbled down the steps face-first. N.T. Suppression Hearing, 3/28/01, at 55; N.T. Trial, 12/10/01, at 677.</p>
    <p id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[230,765,1149,638]]]'>Appellant also explained that the bruises to the victim’s pelvic area had been caused earlier during the weekend when he had thrown a football at her and had accidentally hit her in the groin. He theorized that the sperm inside the victim had been deposited the evening before, when she had engaged in consensual sex with him in the bathroom of a movie theater. He told police that the victim had been hoping to become pregnant, and so, after the sexual encounter in the theater bathroom, she had kept her legs up in the air for some time to aid the impregnation process. He also related that they had engaged in consensual sex twice more the prior evening, once in the car, and once in the bedroom, before the fight started.</p>

He stated that when he later heard the police enter, he carried her to the back bedroom on the third floor, and then fled the residence because he was scared. At that point during the questioning, Appellant asked the detective whether the police were “allowed to just walk in like that,” and the detective answered that “with [Ms. Taylor] being hurt like she was,” and having received a call that a woman was being beaten, “they [the officers] could check to make sure everything was okay.” N.T. Trial, 12/10/01, at 673-74. Appellant later filed an unsuccessful motion to suppress his statements to police on the basis that they had not been knowing and voluntary. Appellant did not seek suppression of any evidence on the basis that it had been seized during, or as the derivative result of, an illegal entry and search of the residence by the police.</p>

He testified that the blunt force trauma or “massive repeated impacts” to the head were delivered with “a tremendous amount of force ... in excess of hundreds of G’s of force” that caused “twisters” and “shearing injury, going directly to the center of the brain,” resulting in bleeding and massive swelling of the brain that eventually crushed the brain stem and killed the victim. <em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">Id.,</a> </em>12/7/01, at 450-52.

Appellant argues that the circumstances simply did not support a reasonable belief that a crime had been committed, much less that someone inside the residence was in need of assistance. Appellant acknowledges that the 911 call informed the police “that there was a domestic disturbance at 26 Hager Street.” Appellant’s Brief at 13. Appellant then grounds much of his argument that probable cause and exigent circumstances were lacking on the trial testimony of one of the responding officers, who related that, after receiving no response at the front and back doors, the officers “both just had a gut feeling that something was not right there.” N.T. Trial, 12/5/01, at 84. Appellant dismisses the legal effect of the report of screaming and an assault on a woman, noting that the 911 call was placed anonymously and that the police saw nothing to corroborate the information the caller had provided. Appellant suggests that these circumstances should have raised an inference that the 911 call was erroneous or a prank and that no crime had occurred and no emergency existed.</p>

The court quoted with approval counsel’s PCRA testimony that, “at the end of the day [whether the cause of the hemorrhage was an aneurysm or a shearing injury] wasn’t an important issue ... because, at best, it probably gave us an eggshell victim, and I’m not sure where that got us anyway.” N.T.

Appellant’s Brief at 66. The gravamen of Appellant’s claim is that Ms. McGarrity testified that she observed abrasions, contusions, and lacerations in the victim’s vaginal area when, according to Appellant, only abrasions and contusions actually existed. Appellant cites definitions contained in a forensic pathology textbook to establish that abrasions are less severe injuries than lacerations, and on that basis, he alleges that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately cross-examine or otherwise impeach Ms. McGarrity. Appellant further argues that counsel’s ineffectiveness affected the guilt phase of his trial, because had the “inconsistency” in Ms. McGarrity’s testimony been properly rebutted, he likely would not have been convicted of rape. Appellant’s Brief at 68. Appellant additionally claims that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him at the penalty phase because “the rape conviction established the sole aggravating factor” found by the jury to support the sentence of death. <em>Id. </em>at 69.

N.T. Trial, 12/11/01, at 857-58. Appellant testified in his own defense at trial that he and the victim had engaged in consensual sex several times in the hours before the altercation started.

However, I am also persuaded by the Court’s exigent circumstances analysis, which I would supplement with the following point. The Court states that the “anonymity” of the 911 call (a call later revealed to have been made by appellant’s own sister) reporting probable domestic abuse and giving police the address was “not fatal” to establishing exigent circumstances. In my view, even though the caller did not identify herself, the police reasonably could understand <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>the call as being from an ordinary citizen reporting an incident out of concern for another’s life and wellbeing. In short, the caller did not suffer from any apparent motive to falsify; there was no <em>quid pro quo </em>for the information so provided as there might be, for example, with a criminal informant seeking leniency. Many of the cases involving concerns with anonymous calls involve drug crimes or other circumstances implicating the criminal underworld. “Concerned citizen” calls reporting criminal activity to police, on the other hand, are generally understood as having a modicum of reliability and credibility. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 3.4(a), at 266-73 (5th ed.2012) (collecting cases and concluding that “when an average citizen tenders information to the police, the police should be permitted to assume that they are dealing with a credible person in the absence of special circumstances suggesting that such might not be the case.”).</p>

That said, in the totality of circumstances, a call like the one made here stands on its own merits and specifics. Ultimately, the context of the information matters. See <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Torres, <a href="/pa/564/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="564 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1276824" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0086-01">564 Pa. 86</a>, <a href="/a2d/764/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="764 A.2d 532" data-case-ids="11164461,1276824" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/0532-01,/pa/564/0086-01">764 A.2d 532</a>, 545-48 (2001) (Castille, J., concurring and dissenting). In this case, the specifics and context did matter, leading police straight to the victim, although not in time to save her life. As the Court indicates, the volatility and violence of domestic abuse demands that reports to police, even if anonymous, must be taken seriously and acted upon rapidly.

The FCDO obviously does not like this restriction. Nevertheless, the federal district court, perhaps duped by the FCDO, looked the other way. The FCDO certainly knew, if the district court judge did not, that the Commonwealth had no effective federal appellate remedy from a ruling that — whether intended by the district court or not— was contemptuous of Pennsylvania state processes and was designed to subvert this Court’s rules concerning PCRA discovery.</p>

[T]he incremental insinuation of the FCDO into Pennsylvania capital cases has been remarkable in its stealth and pervasiveness. The FCDO has designated itself the <em>de facto </em>State Capital Defender’s Office, involving itself not only in virtually all capital PCRA litigation, but also in direct capital appeals, and even, in one instance, as <em>amicus curiae </em>on behalf of a foreign nation, Mexico, in support of a Mexican national who murdered three people. No authority — state or federal— appointed the FCDO to take on this statewide role, and no authority has approved the arrangement. Pennsylvania does not have a statewide capital prosecutor’s office; and notably, in a great many capital cases, the chief law enforcement officer of the Commonwealth, the Attorney General, echoed by county prosecutors, has taken the position that the FCDO should not be permitted to continue in Pennsylvania capital cases without proving its specific federal authorization to do so.</blockquote>

In a corollary argument, Appellant claims that Kauffman had a poor reputation for truthfulness in the community, and that had counsel investigated, he would have discovered witnesses to so testify, and that counsel’s failure to do so rendered his assistance ineffective. The PCRA court did not address this corollary claim in its opinion accompanying its order denying relief.

Among other things, Dr. Sutherland identified Appellant as a Gypsy by birth and heritage. According to Dr. Sutherland, Gypsies are nomadic clans with a long history of persecution, which has made their culture very insular and distrustful of non-Gypsies. Specifically, she testified that Gypsies "have learned to be secretive and to avoid non-Gypsies as a way of survival.” N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/23/09, at 129. She testified that the clans are patriarchal, and that Appellant’s grandfather had been the leader of the clan to which Appellant initially belonged. Appellant’s father, as the eldest son of the clan leader, had been next in line to become clan leader. Appellant’s father, however, had mental and behavioral problems which caused him to fall out of favor with the patriarch. The clan splintered, and Appellant’s immediate family became a clan unto itself, led by Appellant's father. That clan was shunned by the members of the larger clan who suddenly moved to another state. This shunning reportedly had a profound emotional impact on Appellant, particularly because Appellant’s father died soon after the schism erupted, and the mantle of clan leader fell upon Appellant, who was only fifteen at that time. This circumstance reportedly caused him much stress over the next ten years of his life, as his immediate clan remained shunned by the larger group and he had very little experience in the leadership skills necessary to keep his clan functioning as an organized unit. In addition, Dr. Sutherland testified that oral sex is a major taboo among members of the Gypsy culture, <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>and that members of a clan may be shunned by other Gypsies for engaging in oral sex.</p>
