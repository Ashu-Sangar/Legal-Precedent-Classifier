Further, the Superior Court acknowledged the revocation court imposed its sentence in consideration of the fact probation, along with drug treatment, proved to be an ineffective rehabilitation tool for Pasture, and the revocation court recognized it needed to protect society, particularly “unsuspecting and innocent children,” from Pasture’s future antisocial conduct.</p>

Specifically, the Superior Court concluded the revocation court did not actually have an in-depth knowledge of Pasture since it had been four years since Pasture had last appeared before the court and the revocation court made no inquiry into any changes in Pasture’s personal life and situation which may have occurred during that span of time. The Superior Court also rejected the revocation court’s statement it was necessary to protect minor children from Pasture’s drug induced actions since, although Pasture may have committed his previous crimes while intoxicated, there was no evidence his drug use while he was on probation resulted in Pasture committing any sex offenses.</p>

The Superior Court acknowledged a court may generally dispense with a PSI if it otherwise has sufficient information allowing it to impose a fully informed sentencing decision. <em>See Pasture, supra. </em>However, the panel concluded “[h]ere, the information heard by the court and its questions to [Pasture] during the revocation hearing do ‘not approach the level of thoroughness afforded by a properly crafted [PSI].’ ” <em>Pasture, </em>No. 811 EDA 2009, <em>slip op. </em>at 18 (citation omitted). The panel acknowledged the revocation court heard evidence regarding Pasture’s gunshot wounds, employment as a caretaker for an elderly woman, participation in out-patient drug rehabilitation, attendance at court-mandated sex offender therapy, and prior criminal history with the court. However, the Superior Court concluded the court heard no information regarding Pasture’s “education, employment history, family relationships, interests and activities, residence history, or information about resources available to assist [Pasture]. The court also did not indicate that it had received or considered any reports from counselors at [Pasture’s] drug rehabilitation or sex offender treatment programs.” <em>Id., slip op. </em>at 18-19.

At initial sentencing, all of the rules and procedures designed to inform the court and to cabin its discretionary sentencing authority properly are involved and play a crucial role. However, it is a different matter when a defendant reappears before the court for sentencing proceedings following a violation of the mercy bestowed upon him in the form of a probationary sentence. For example, in such a case, contrary to when an initial sentence is imposed, the Sentencing Guidelines do not apply, <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>and the revocation court is not cabined by Section 9721(b)’s requirement that “the sentence imposed should call for confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense as it relates to the impact on the life of the victim and on the community, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721. <em>See Commonwealth v. </em>Reaves, <a href="/pa/592/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="592 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="3556321" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0134-01">592 Pa. 134</a>, 150, <a href="/pa/592/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="923 A.2d 1119" data-case-ids="3556321,8311597" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0134-01,/a2d/923/1119-01">923 A.2d 1119</a>, 1129 (2007) (citing 204 Pa.Code. § 303.1(b) (Sentencing Guidelines do not apply to sentences imposed as result of revocation of probation)).</p>

      <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>However, following revocation, a sentencing court need not undertake a lengthy discourse for its reasons for imposing a sentence or specifically reference the statutes in question. Simply put, since the defendant has previously appeared before the sentencing court, the stated reasons for a revocation sentence need not be as elaborate as that which is required at initial sentencing. The rationale for this is obvious. When sentencing is a consequence of the revocation of probation, the trial judge is already fully informed as to the facts and circumstances of both the crime and the nature of the defendant, particularly where, as here, the trial judge had the benefit of a PSI during the initial sentencing proceedings. <em>See </em>Walls, <a href="/pa/592/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="592 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="3556713" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0557-01">592 Pa. at </a>574 n. 7, <a href="/pa/592/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="926 A.2d 957" data-case-ids="3556713,8375627" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0557-01,/a2d/926/0957-01">926 A.2d at </a>967 n. 7 (“Where [PSI] exist[s], we shall continue to presume that the sentencing judge was aware of the relevant information regarding the defendant’s character and weighed those considerations along with mitigating statutory factors.”). Contrary to the Superior Court’s suggestion in the instant case, there is no absolute requirement that a trial judge, who has already given the defendant one sentencing break after having the benefit of a full record, including a PSI, must order another PSI before fashioning the appropriate revocation sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In fact, Pasture originally received a mitigated-range sentence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and the bulk of his sentence was probationary in nature. Despite this, he failed to adhere to the conditions imposed upon him, and the trial court, upon revocation of the probation, imposed a lengthier sentence, which was within the statutory bounds. We emphasize a trial court does not necessarily abuse its discretion in imposing a seemingly harsher post-revocation sentence where the defendant received a lenient sentence and then <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>failed to adhere to the conditions imposed on him. <em>See Reaves, </em><a href="/pa/592/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="592 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="3556321" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0134-01">592 Pa. at </a>138 n. 5, <a href="/pa/592/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="923 A.2d 1119" data-case-ids="3556321,8311597" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0134-01,/a2d/923/1119-01">923 A.2d at </a>1122 n. 5. In point of fact, where the revocation sentence was adequately considered and sufficiently explained on the record by the revocation judge, in light of the judge’s experience with the defendant and awareness of the circumstances of the probation violation, under the appropriate deferential standard of review, the sentence, if within the statutory bounds, is peculiarly within the judge’s discretion.</p>
    <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[281,813,1150,849]]]'>In the instant case, the record confirms that the revocation court judge, who had previously presided over Pasture’s plea, Megan’s Law II, and original sentencing hearings, was in possession of a PSI from the initial sentencing proceedings and heard evidence at the revocation hearing regarding Pasture’s conduct while he was on probation. Thus, the revocation court was provided with sufficient information to make a fully informed sentence following the revocation of Pasture’s probation. Additionally, the revocation court explained the court’s attempts to address Pasture’s rehabilitative needs through probation in conjunction with drug treatment had failed, and despite the fact Pasture’s probation officer had afforded him numerous opportunities to conform to the terms of his probation, Pasture continued to use prohibited substances similar to the ones he had used when he committed his prior sex offenses against children.</p>
    <p id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.6",492,[280,1698,1151,472]]]'>Based upon the above, we find the Superior Court misapplied certain sentencing provisions, leading it to give insufficient deference to the revocation court’s imposition of the sentence following the revocation of Pasture’s probation and improperly vacate the judgment of sentence imposed upon Pasture by the revocation court. Therefore, we vacate the Superior Court’s order and reinstate Pasture’s judgment of sentence entered on February 12, 2009. Jurisdiction relinquished.</p>
