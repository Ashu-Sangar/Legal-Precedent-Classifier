In his estimation, these pellets caused damage to the centers of the victim’s brain which controlled her autonomic nervous functions, thereby causing the death of both the victim and, because of the cessation of the victim’s blood circulation, her unborn fetus. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 165; 173-78.

Dr. Smith agreed that it was, therefore, possible that this impact could have caused tissue and blood to have been propelled back through the channel created by the shot and into the barrel of the gun; however, he believed the angle of the gun at the time the wound was made minimized the amount of blowback, and, thus, he opined that one would not expect to find as much blood or tissue as would be present if the wound was inflicted straight into the skin, i.e., with the gun barrel held at a 90 degree angle thereto. <em>Id. </em>at 170-72,186-92.</p>

The court found that the only other rule of procedure which could possibly apply to render J.B.’s claim waived was Pa.R.A.P. 302(a), which provides that “[ijssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.” Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).

Next, the court found that the juvenile court “addressed J.B.’s weight of the evidence arguments in its Pa. R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion,” by incorporating, in that opinion, its prior findings of fact from its order of April 13, 2012 and its reasons for adjudicating J.B. delinquent, set forth in its opinion of April 20, 2012. <em>In re J.B., </em><a href="/a3d/69/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="69 A.3d 268" data-case-ids="7307310" data-case-paths="/a3d/69/0268-01">69 A.3d at 276</a>.

Lastly, to the extent that the court considered <em>In re R.N. </em>to have any continuing viability after <em>In re D.S., </em>the court distinguished that decision, noting that, in that case, the juvenile did not raise any defenses or arguments at the adjudication hearing, whereas the court found that, by contrast, J.B., in his closing argument to the juvenile court, “presented precisely the same arguments ... that he now asserts on appeal in support of his weight of the evidence claim.” <em><a href="/a3d/69/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="69 A.3d 268" data-case-ids="7307310" data-case-paths="/a3d/69/0268-01">Id.</a> </em>Consequently, the court reasoned that, because J.B. had raised these arguments before the juvenile court, Rule 620(A)(2) did not require him to raise them again in a post-dispositional motion.</p>

The Commonwealth first argues that the panel below improperly found <em>In re R.N. </em>to no longer be good law and <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>thereby purported to overrule it, which, as a panel of the Superior Court, it could not do as one panel of that tribunal cannot overrule another panel. The Commonwealth asserts that, under <em>In re R.N., </em>a juvenile is required to raise an issue before the juvenile court, or it is waived for appeal. The Commonwealth posits that our Court’s decision in <em>In re D.S. </em>did not overrule <em>In re R.N. </em>since <em>In re D.S. </em>dealt with the issue of the proper preservation of a sufficiency of the evidence claim, not a weight one. Thus, the Commonwealth reasons <em>In re R.N. </em>still remains good law with respect to the necessity of presenting weight claims to the juvenile court for preservation, and, because J.B. did not file a post-dispositional motion presenting the claim, even though optional, his claim is waived.</p>

By contrast, according to the Commonwealth, there is no similar constitutional concern implicated in a weight of the evidence claim. Additionally, the Commonwealth points out J.B. is currently detained in a secure facility so he could seek relief for waiver of his claim by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, whereas the juvenile in <em>In re D.S. </em>could not. Finally, the Commonwealth notes that a weight of the evidence claim does not involve a pure question of law, but, rather, challenges the trial court’s exercise of discretion; hence, in its view, it logically follows there must first be a decision of the trial court in which it exercised its discretion by ruling on the weight of the evidence, so that an appellate court may review it.</p>

In the Commonwealth’s view, a closing argument is undertaken to convince the fact-finder to make an initial determination in favor of the arguing party, based on the evidence of record and suggested credibility determinations; whereas, a post-hearing motion asks the trial judge to examine the record and determine whether a prior determination offends the court’s sense of justice. The Commonwealth argues that to judicially allow a closing argument to substitute for a post-decisional motion, as the Superior Court has done, would be an exercise in procedural rulemaking which usurps our Court’s authority to exclusively promulgate rules governing juvenile court procedure pursuant to Article V, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In sum, the Commonwealth contends that J.B. never presented his claim to the juvenile court, and that, consequently, we should find it waived.</p>

Echoing the rationale of the Superior Court decision below, he argues that the filing of a post-dispositional motion was optional in his case; finding his claim waived would cause a harsher result than for a similarly-situated adult defendant, and the juvenile court addressed his weight of the evidence claim in its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion so there is no impediment to appellate review. J.B. avers that the Commonwealth’s attempt to distinguish <em>In re D.S. </em>on the grounds that it involved the sufficiency of the evidence is unavailing since “each [of these cases] deals with [the] juvenile court process and the constitutional right to due process more generally, and not with the type of appeal brought before this court.” Appellee’s Brief at 15.</p>

It is uncontested that J.B. did not file a post-dispositional motion raising this claim, although post-dispositional motions are deemed optional under Pa.R.J.C.P. 620. Further, we agree with the Commonwealth that J.B. could not raise a weight of the evidence challenge in his closing argument. In the context of a juvenile matter, a weight of the evidence claim may not be raised via closing argument, inasmuch as it is a matter of plain logic that a claim that an adjudication of delinquency is against the weight of the evidence presupposes that the juvenile court has <em>already </em>made such a final adjudication. Closing argument by a juvenile in a delinquency proceeding, which takes place prior to final adjudication, is geared towards convincing the trier of fact that the evidence adduced at the hearing does not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the juvenile was delinquent of the criminal offenses charged. By contrast, a weight of the evidence challenge in a juvenile matter assumes the evidence was sufficient to adjudicate the juvenile delinquent beyond a reasonable doubt, but asks the juvenile court to reassess its adjudication to determine whether certain facts of record are <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>so weighty that they warrant the grant of a new adjudication hearing.</p>

The question, then, is whether this manner of presentation, coupled with the fact that the juvenile court ruled on it in its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, sufficiently preserved his claim for appellate review. The Juvenile Rules of Court Procedure do not, at present, specify how a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent must present a weight of the evidence claim to the juvenile court so that the claim is preserved for appellate review. However, in a procedurally identical matter, our Court, in <em>Widmer, supra, </em>addressed, in the context of criminal proceedings, a similar gap in the procedural rules governing presentation and appellate review of a weight of the evidence claim. Therein, our Court unanimously refused to find a criminal defendant’s weight of the evidence claim waived where it was raised in the defendant’s statement of matters complained of on appeal and ruled on by the trial court.

In 1994, the Rules of Criminal Procedure were amended to make such motions optional, which allowed a defendant, once his or her judgment of sentence became final, to bypass the filing of such motions altogether and proceed immediately to file a direct appeal. To achieve this result, Pa.R.Crim.P. 1410, now renumbered as Pa. R.Crim.P. 720, was promulgated by our Court and became effective January 1, 1994. This rule provided, in relevant part, that a defendant retained the right to make an optional post-sentence motion after a verdict of guilty had been rendered and sentence pronounced, but that “[i]ssues raised before or during trial shall be deemed preserved for appeal <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>whether or not the defendant elects to file a post-sentence motion on those issues.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 1410(B)(1)(c). However, neither that rule, nor any other Rule of Criminal Procedure, required the filing of a post-sentence motion to present a weight of the evidence claim to the trial court, so that it could consider the claim in the first instance. The rules were altogether silent on this subject, even though “challenges to the weight of the evidence can never be raised ‘before or during trial’; rather such challenges can only be raised <em>after </em>trial.” <em>Widmer, </em><a href="/a2d/689/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="689 A.2d 211" data-case-ids="11924045,11924062,468626,468670" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0211-01,/a2d/689/0211-02,/pa/547/0136-01,/pa/547/0137-01">689 A.2d at 213</a> (Cappy, J., concurring) (emphasis original).

Although only 11 years old, J.B. was charged as an adult, and he subsequently filed a decertification petition to transfer his case to the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County.

The Superior Court held that requiring J.B. to accept responsibility for the conduct he was alleged to have committed in order to obtain decertification would require him to effectively admit his guilt of the particular offenses charged, and, thus, violated his Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. <em>See <a href="/a3d/26/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="26 A.3d 485" data-case-ids="7277589" data-case-paths="/a3d/26/0485-01">id.</a> </em>Consequently, the court remanded for a new decertification hearing, which, after the recusal of Judge Motto, was held before Judge John Hodge of the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County.

In <em>Widmer, </em>this Court was faced with a situation where a Superior Court panel found a weight of the evidence claim to be waived since it was not presented in post-sentence motions, but was raised for the first time in the appellant’s Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement. Concluding there was some ambiguity in then Pa.R.Crim.P. 1410 as it related to preserving weight of the evidence claims, and the circumstances in <em>Widmer </em>were otherwise distinguishable from precedent upon which the Superior Court panel had relied in finding waiver, this Court reversed and remanded, concluding the appellant should be permitted to file a motion for a new trial <em>nunc pro tune </em>under then Pa.R.Crim.P. 1410(B)(l)(a)(iv). However, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the text of Pa.R.J.C.P. 620, and particularly as supported by its Comments, sets forth a proper, clear mechanism providing for juveniles to present their weight challenges to the juvenile court, and J.B. should have been aware of the preservation requirements.</p>

The Comment to Pa.R.J.C.P. 620 specifically contemplates that juveniles may opt to preserve weight of the evidence claims in postdispositional motions and provides "motions alleging that the court's findings were against the weight of the evidence are to specify why the findings were against the weight of the evidence.” Pa.R.J.C.P. 620 cmt.</p>
