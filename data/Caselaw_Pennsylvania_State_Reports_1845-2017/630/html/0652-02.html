    <p id="b703-5" data-blocks='[["BL_703.5",703,[214,418,1151,1098]]]'>In December 1994, Appellant was charged by information with three counts of criminal homicide for the shooting deaths, on July 20, 1994, of his girlfriend, Beth Ann Anderson; their 18-day-old daughter, Melanie Watkins; and Ms. Anderson’s nine-year-old son, Charles Kevin Kelly, Jr.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The FBI coordinated a search for Appellant, placing him on the ten most wanted fugitive list in March 1995. Appellant was arrested in New York City in May 1995, and, on August 3, 1995, Pittsburgh Detectives Dennis Logan and Richard McDonald drove him back to Allegheny County to stand trial for the murders. Prior to trial, Appellant filed an omnibus motion seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>to suppress inculpatory statements he had made to the detectives on the trip from New York City to Allegheny County. At the ensuing hearing, Appellant testified that he had not discussed the murder charges against him with the detectives during the trip and had not signed a statement purporting to bear his signature. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion, concluding that the issue raised by Appellant did not present a constitutional question, but rather, was a question of credibility, reserved for the jury. <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Suppression Hearing, 12/9/96, at 73-101.</p>

The Commonwealth presented the following testimony: (i) Monique Kohlman had been on the phone with Ms. Anderson when Appellant arrived at Ms. Anderson’s home; Ms. Kohlman spoke briefly with him by phone, heard sounds of a struggle, called the police at Ms. Anderson’s request, and then went to the home where she observed the victims’ bodies; (ii) Ronnie Williams, one of Ms. Anderson’s neighbors, saw Appellant, whom he recognized as Ms. Anderson’s boyfriend, on the porch of Ms. Anderson’s home shortly before the murders; (iii) the police officers who responded to the report of a shooting described their observations and processing of the crime scene; (iv) Leon Rozin, M.D., a forensic pathologist who performed autopsies of the victims, determined that each had died of multiple gunshot wounds from bullets fired at close range; (v) Dr. Robert Levine, from the Allegheny County Crime Lab, determined that all the spent cartridge casings at the scene were from the same semi-automatic .22 caliber firearm; (vi) Keith Platt, a friend of Appellant, was threatened by Appellant when, following the murders, he declined Appellant’s request to ask several mutual acquaintances to repay money they allegedly owed Appellant; (vii) Detective Logan summarized a statement Appellant made in which he admitted that he had killed the three victims, and claimed that the killings were not premeditated, but rather were prompted by Ms. Anderson’s spurning of his marriage proposal and his jealousy of another man.</p>
    <p id="b704-7" data-blocks='[["BL_704.5",704,[272,1861,1150,481]]]'>The defense theory at trial was that drug dealers had committed the murders in retaliation against Appellant for his failure to pay for a drug transaction. Appellant testified on his own behalf, denying involvement in the murders, asserting that all the Commonwealth’s witnesses were lying, and contending that the detectives had fabricated his inculpatory written statement and forged his signature on that statement. Two character witnesses testified for the defense regarding Appellant’s reputation as a peaceable, non-violent person.</p>

      <a id="p667" href="#p667" data-label="667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*667</a>The jury found Appellant guilty of three counts of first-degree murder. Following a penalty hearing, on December 13, 1996, the jury found two aggravating circumstances relative to all three victims: Appellant was convicted of another offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10); and Appellant was convicted of another murder, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll). In addition, the jury found a third aggravating circumstance respecting the murders of the two child victims: the victim was less than twelve years of age, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(16). The jury also found the “catchall” mitigating circumstance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). More specifically, at least one juror found the following mitigating factors with regard to all three victims: Appellant was non-violent until July 20, 1994; was known to attend church; and has the ability to love. With regard to the murder of his daughter Melanie Watkins, at least one juror found an additional mitigating circumstance: Appellant loves his daughters. Finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances as to each murder, the jury determined that Appellant should be sentenced to death. The court formally imposed the three death sentences and, on direct appeal, this Court affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

The PCRA court then issued an order dismissing seventeen of Appellant’s claims and scheduling an evidentiary hearing on the remaining four claims. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Order, dated 2/13/09.

The first is a memorandum of an FBI interview, conducted on January 27, 1995, with Solomon Givens, Appellant’s friend and associate in the drug trade, who was serving a term in federal prison on drug and firearms charges. When speaking with the FBI agent, Mr. Givens suggested several locations where Appellant might be found, and also stated that he had received information from an unnamed girlfriend that the murders had been committed by someone else as “payback” to Appellant because he had “stiffed” someone in a drug deal. FBI Memorandum, dated 1/27/95, from Special Agent William Turner (Exhibit EE of Appellant’s Appendix to PCRA Petition, at 39-41, and Defense Exhibit Q before PCRA Court). The second document is an FBI memorandum stating that a drug dealer named E-Man, “probably E-Man Jeffries,” was “ripped off’ by Appellant, and “possibly put a contract out on [Appellant,] and might have information concerning him.” FBI Memorandum, dated 3/9/95, from Special Agent Lawrence E. Likar (Exhibit EE of Appellant’s Appendix to PCRA Petition, at 372-74, and Defense Exhibit S before PCRA Court).

Had the jury heard and accepted Dr. Woods’s opinion testimony that Appellant’s demeanor and behavior at trial were a result of his brain injury, the theory goes, jurors might have been less put off by Appellant; more disposed to accept his humanity, if not to like him; and more likely to find that the mitigating factors at least balanced the aggravators. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 46-50.

Given the three aggravating factors found by the jury and the factual circumstances supporting those three factors in this triple murder case, we cannot conclude that, even if the psychiatrists’ testimony summarized above had been presented at the penalty phase, there is a reasonable probability that a juror would have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed, or were as weighty as, the aggravating circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Gibson II, </em><a href="/pa/610/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="19 A.3d 512" data-case-ids="4202141,7281011" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0332-01,/a3d/19/0512-01">19 A.3d at 531</a> (noting that, where there is substantial aggravation, it may be particularly difficult to prove <em>Strickland </em>prejudice). <a id="p693" href="#p693" data-label="693" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*693</a>Thus, Appellant has failed to establish <em>Strickland </em>prejudice for this ineffectiveness claim.</p>

During the penalty phase, trial counsel presented the following witnesses. Appellant’s mother, Carla Watkins, a registered nurse, testified that she raised Appellant as a single mother following her separation from her husband; that Appellant saw his father only occasionally; that he never went to public school, but rather she enrolled him in military school where he did well; that he fathered a daughter born in 1991; and that he left home at seventeen years of age, choosing to get a job but always keeping in touch with her.

From these records, Dr. Woods opined that Appellant suffered symptoms of neglect as a child because his mother was working so hard as a single parent, trying to provide him with financial support, schooling, and safe circumstances. This neglect “over time escalated into increasing difficulty ... [leading] to drug use as an adolescent.” In military school, Appellant did “relatively well,” although his mother withdrew him suddenly for unknown reasons. Similarly, as shown by his discharge summary from the KIDS program, Appellant was “pulled out of the program” although there were “no issues with him in the program.” On cross-examination, Dr. Woods opined that because of Appellant’s multiple moves and different academic environments within the several schools he attended, he experienced a childhood of chaos.

One page indicates that, for unclear reasons, Appellant’s mother suddenly withdrew him from the Military Academy in December 1982, when he was thirteen years of age. The KIDS discharge record shows only that, in June 1985, Appellant’s mother withdrew him from the program for financial reasons. The only other information regarding the KIDS program consists of newspaper articles, none of which mentions Appellant. The police records show that Appellant was arrested in New Jersey twice: first, in October 1989 for resisting arrest, with possible subsequent charges for assault and drug possession; and second, in August 1991, for driving under the influence and drug possession. The records do not indicate how the charges were resolved.

The Commonwealth stresses that the prosecutor’s comments did not address how the victims’ family members were affected by their murders. In addition, the Commonwealth posits, the argument was a permissible rebuttal to the mitigation defense, “a reasonable counter-balance to the defense appeal for mercy,” as well as testimony from various defense witnesses that Appellant was the sweetest person one witness had ever known, that he performed drug rehabilitation community service, that he cares for his daughter and was never violent. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that Appellant has not shown that the commentary resulted in a fixed bias on the part of the jury, or impeded the jury’s ability to weight the evidence objectively. This is particularly so, the Commonwealth adds, given the <a id="p705" href="#p705" data-label="705" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*705</a>strength of the aggravators.

      <a id="p706" href="#p706" data-label="706" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*706</a>The prosecutor’s penalty phase summation, however, is obviously more problematic. The prosecutorial instinct to compare and contrast <em>effects </em>— i.e., if the defendant makes a case in mitigation centering on his own positive values and character, it should be offset by the effect of his conduct on the victims and their families — may be a natural one, but prosecutors are officers of the Court, bound by the law, and the law at the time of this trial did not allow victim impact evidence of any sort, much less the sort that would support the prosecutor’s commentary here. Telling a jury what it is you are not allowed to present about the victims and their families — commentary that obviously has no basis in the record — is an indirect method of doing that which is strictly forbidden. The trial court will charge the jury on the law respecting penalty phase deliberations; summation is not for the prosecution, or the defense, to explain what is <em>not </em>in a case. In our view, then, this particular commentary was indeed subject to objection, and if objected-to, the objection should have been sustained. Nevertheless, mindful of the fact that the defaulted objection involves attorney commentary and the fixed bias standard attending that analysis, and the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice standard attending the present collateral claim, we cannot say, in light of the substantial evidence in aggravation, that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the penalty hearing would have been different had counsel objected. <em>Gibson II, supra.</em>

The prosecutor was characterizing — not inaccurately — Appellant’s actions at the time of his offenses.

But, the <em>Strickland </em>question is not whether there were grounds for an objection, but whether counsel, in essence, was obliged to object and request a <em>Simmons </em>charge in order to ensure a fair trial. Other parts of the record make clear that trial counsel was attuned to the <em>Simmons </em>issue. <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra. </em>In any event, for purposes of decision, we may assume that counsel could and should have objected; in our view, Appellant has not proven <em>Strickland </em>prejudice arising from the failure to request a <em>Simmons </em>charge.</p>

Prior to the penalty phase, the court, the prosecutor, and trial counsel discussed the matter of future dangerousness and a <em>Simmons </em>instruction. The court noted that, while a life sentence means life without parole, there is also “the concept of executive clemency,” pursuant to which a life sentence could be subject to commutation. The court further noted that, if the jury questioned the meaning of a life sentence, it was “entitled to know the whole answer,” which included an understanding of executive clemency. N.T. Penalty Phase, 12/13/96, at 619-21. Trial counsel made clear that he was not going to address the issue of life without parole, but was going to use the term “life sentences.” When asked directly by the court about the issue of future dangerousness, trial counsel responded: “I am not getting into the issue of life without parole. I’m happy for you to say life period.” <em>Id. </em>at 619.

Because I refused to see, you know, either one — whether the Commonwealth or counsel’s doctor, but in order for you to come to the proper conclusion — ... I have an issue with ... the Defender’s Office in Philadelphia, pertaining to expert witnesses.” N.T. PCRA hearing, 11/18/09, at 212-13. The Commonwealth notes that, given the finding of competency, Appellant is competent to object to the testing his counsel seeks to force upon him and, in any event, it is not <a id="p732" href="#p732" data-label="732" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*732</a>clear how productive a forced evaluation would be; thus, the PCRA court did not err in denying the FCDO motion.</p>

Throughout the proceedings below, and indeed continuing into this appeal — where Appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>application for exercise of King’s bench jurisdiction, which this Court denied on February 25, 2013— Appellant and the FCDO have engaged in a disagreement concerning whether Appellant had any relevant mental health issues, and whether counsel should pursue those issues, given Appellant's disagreement with that course. Ultimately, counsel was permitted to pursue the issues, notwithstanding Appellant’s disagreement, and all were deemed either meritless or insufficient to require collateral relief.</p>
