    <p id="b660-8" data-blocks='[["BL_660.9",660,[272,1438,1150,902]]]'>Respectfully, the reasoning of the Superior Court’s opinion here is largely the acknowledgement of the “recidivist theory” from case law which that court is constrained to follow. However, this precludes any meaningful discussion of the distinction arising in the present case, which is not addressed in the cited cases. In so doing, the Superior Court’s decision must be read as implementing a new rule of law that, where a defendant has not been previously sentenced under § 9714(a), he is not eligible to receive a sentence under § 9714(b), regardless of the empirical applicability of that section. <em>See Commonwealth v. Armstrong, </em><a href="/a3d/74/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="74 A.3d 228" data-case-ids="7305126" data-case-paths="/a3d/74/0228-01">74 A.3d 228</a>, 239-42 (Pa.Super.2013). The Superior Court relied primarily on <em>Shijfler, </em>which involved a sequence of events different from those at hand; while I did not participate in that decision, I do not read it as creating such a broad notion, <em>i.e., </em>that the failure to sentence under § 9714(a) forever precludes sentencing under § 9714(b).</p>

Its application is not jumbled by ambiguity: it applies if “at the time of the commission of the current offense” the defendant had two or more “convictions” from “separate criminal transactions.” The statutory scheme is straightforward and unambiguous — at the time of the present crime, how many prior convictions does the defendant have? At the time he committed the crime at issue here, appellee had at least two such convictions and they were not from the same criminal transaction. As the answer here is two, and they were not for the same criminal transaction, § 9714 applies.</p>

Such advocacy on the merits that I offer is not to express what the outcome of this case should be, but is meant only to highlight that appellee presents a colorable argument. I dissent solely to note that if the recidivist theory is to render clear statutory language irrelevant, under this previously unaddressed scenario, it should not happen through the back door of adopting a portion of a Superior Court opinion.</p>
