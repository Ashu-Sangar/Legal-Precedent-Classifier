At the penalty phase, the jury found one aggravating circumstance <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>and multiple mitigating circumstances, determined the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and sentenced appellant to death. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[235,545,1150,748]]]'>Appellant and Antwain Robinson took a bus from Lancaster to Columbia to visit appellant’s cousin, Tyrone Hunter, and to attend a local rap performance at a venue near Hunter’s apartment. Appellant and Robinson drank alcohol and smoked marijuana throughout the night, walking between Hunter’s apartment and the venue several times. At some point, appellant took Hunter’s handgun from his apartment and hid it in a nearby alley. At the venue, appellant interrupted Cornell Stewart and John Wright’s rap performance by grabbing Wright’s microphone. As a result, appellant and Wright got into a physical altercation wherein Wright hit appellant at least once. Security separated them, and escorted appellant and Robinson out the front door and Wright and Stewart out the back door.</p>

One of the shots fatally struck Stewart in the head. Appellant and Robinson fled the scene and asked a friend for a ride to Lancaster. During the trip, appellant made incriminating statements to all occupants of the vehicle, including Robinson, their friend, and two other women, and instructed them not to talk.</p>
    <p id="b229-7" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[236,1812,1149,530]]]'>Appellant was charged with Stewart’s homicide, the attempted homicide of Wright, and unlawful possession of a firearm. The unlawful possession charge was severed for trial. The Commonwealth filed notice of an aggravating circumstance and intent to seek the death penalty. Appellant filed a pre-trial motion seeking suppression of any evidence relating to his use and handling of Hunter’s handgun on occasions prior to the night of the murder and evidence of an unrelated altercation days earlier during which he sustained an injury to his lip. The trial court denied the motion.</p>

    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[272,579,1149,929]]]'>At trial, appellant’s defense theory was to negate specific intent to kill by arguing he was in the heat of passion from the altercation with Wright and also had diminished capacity due to voluntary intoxication. Appellant sought to admit a report from his expert, a toxicologist; the report contained appellant’s detailed account of his alcohol and drug consumption on the night of the murder. The expert was also prepared to testify about all the facts in his report, including appellant’s statements. The Commonwealth brought a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the report and preclude the expert from testifying to any of appellant’s statements. Defense counsel objected, asserting the expert should be permitted to testify about all the facts on which he relied in rendering his opinion regarding the psychological and physiological effects of appellant’s alcohol and drug consumption, including appellant’s statements. The trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion and limited defense counsel to using hypothetical questions based on record evidence.</p>

Appellant timely filed a post-sentence motion to modify his sentence to life imprisonment, alleging the jury failed to check the blank on the verdict slip indicating the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The trial court denied the motion, finding the jury meaningfully weighed the mitigating factors against the sole aggravating factor as indicated by the individual polling of the jury on the record.

Juror 32 generally stated she could follow the law and would listen to argument with an open mind. <em>Id., </em>at 378-79.

When asked, “[A]re you telling us that you would have a difficult time, even if justified by law, standing and saying yes, the sentence here should be death?[,]” she replied, “Probably, yeah, then I would, yes.” <em>Id., </em>at 372. Additionally, when asked if she had personal beliefs that would make her incapable of imposing a death sentence, she replied, “Okay. Yes, I can’t do that____I cannot put him to death, no.” <em>Id., </em>at 375. When defense counsel further explained a death sentence is not automatic upon conviction for first degree murder, she stated she “would give him life instead of death probably[,]” <em>id., </em>at 381, and when the court asked, “[I]f the law says ... you are required to vote for death, ... are you still going to say, no, it’s a life prison sentence, regardless of what the testimony or the evidence was during the penalty phase?[,]” she again concluded she “would probably still send him to life[,]” <em>id., </em>at 383.

Appellant argues such evidence was irrelevant since he never claimed the facial injury was caused by Wright, and to the extent such could be found relevant, its relevance was outweighed by its undue prejudice. Further, appellant alleges the evidence permitted the jury to assume he had been in a recent fight and to infer he must have asked for the handgun not simply to use it but to retaliate against the individual who caused the facial injury.</p>

Hunter’s testimony about appellant’s pre-existing lip injury was admissible to rebut appellant’s claims that Wright caused the injury. Whether appellant was injured during his altercation with Wright was indicative of the severity of the beating, which, in turn, was probative as to whether appellant was operating under the heat of passion required to reduce his culpability. The jury never heard how appellant sustained this pre-existing injury; it only heard Hunter’s testimony as to appellant’s appearance prior to his fight with Wright, which did not necessarily imply he sustained the injury from another prior fight but simply indicated Wright did not cause it. The evidence did not impugn appellant’s character, nor was it prejudicial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>

There is a distinction between an expert using basic facts provided by laymen to form an expert opinion, versus one who simply parrots out-of-court statements in court, thereby acting as a conduit for hearsay. In this case, there were no toxicology screens or tests performed on appellant. The expert’s report was simply appellant’s firsthand narrative of the events on the night of the murder and a detailed account of his drug and alcohol consumption that night. Had the expert been permitted to testify to the facts contained in his report, he would have been merely relaying testimony appellant would have given had he taken the stand. Pennsylvania’s Rules of Evidence do not provide a mechanism for a criminal defendant to decline to testify and to avoid the rules of evidence by using an expert <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>witness to introduce his story into the record.
