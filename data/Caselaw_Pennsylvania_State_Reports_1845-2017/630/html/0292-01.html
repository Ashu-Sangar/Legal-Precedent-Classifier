Additionally, lengthy arguments were conducted during trial but outside the hearing of the jury on Wal-Mart’s motions to strike portions of the testimony of Appellees’ experts.

Notwithstanding WalMart’s inclusion of the phrase “purported class action” in the issue presented for review, the propriety of the certification of the class in the first instance is not before the Court in this appeal. Notably, however, much of Wal-Mart’s challenge to the method of trial is premised upon its contention that the class never should have been certified because Appellees did <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>not present sufficient, class-wide “common” evidence of contract formation, breach, or unjust enrichment. Moreover, Wal-Mart asserts that the trial court’s class certification, the jury verdict, and the Superior Court affirmance all improperly relied upon “sham statistics and baseless extrapolations of [Appellees’] expert witnesses, Drs. Baggett and Shapiro[,]” regarding “Wal-Mart’s time clock and cash register records.” Appellants’ Brief at 27, 30. In short, Wal-Mart asserts that Appellees’ statistical and extrapolation evidence was flawed in that it failed to show “that class members, on a class-wide basis, missed breaks, took shortened breaks or worked off-the-clock.” <em>Id. </em>at 18-19.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[279,968,1150,1010]]]'>More specifically, Wal-Mart claims that the time clock and cash register records did not show that employees had been forced to miss breaks or work off-the-clock, and that Appellees’ expert analysis reaching the opposite conclusion was based on faulty assumptions that failed to account for the actual practices of Wal-Mart and its employees. Specifically, Wal-Mart claims that the analysis regarding rest breaks failed to account for “voluntary” missed breaks, and that the analysis regarding off-the-clock work failed to account for the alleged fact that it was not uncommon for cashiers to log into and operate cash registers under another employee’s name. Thus, Wal-Mart asserts that the class was overbroad, that appellees had not shown proper proof of Wal-Mart’s liability as to each “purported” class member, and that Wal-Mart had been subject to a “trial by formula” that denied Wal-Mart its right to due process in violation of Pennsylvania law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellants’ Brief at 18-19.

      <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>Wal-Mart employees (characterized as “associates” in WalMart’s employee handbooks and other written policies) are required to “punch” time clocks. During orientation for new employees, employee handbooks are distributed that, among other things, inform employees that they are entitled to paid rest breaks and that they will be paid for all hours worked. Additionally, all employees are informed, through a variety of means, about Wal-Mart’s rest break policy, known as PD-07, and its off-the-clock work policy, known as PD-43. The rest break policy states that a paid, 15-minute break will be given to an employee who works between three and six hours, and that an additional paid, 15-minute break will be given to an employee who works more than six hours. The rest break policy requires that employees take full, uninterrupted breaks, and warns that disciplinary action may result if an employee misses breaks or takes breaks that are either too long or too short. Wal-Mart’s off-the-clock work policy provides that it is against company policy for any employee to perform work without being paid, and that employees will be compensated for all work performed.</p>

Beginning in 1999, Wal-Mart conducted approximately ten regional internal audits that indicated widespread rest break violations, such as missed breaks, breaks that were too long, or breaks that were too short. In 2000, Wal-Mart conducted the “Shipley Audit,” which was national in scope and included an examination of time clock and cashier log-in records. The Shipley Audit revealed that in one week, across 127 Wal-Mart stores, including five in Pennsylvania, more than 60,000 rest break violations had occurred. The Shipley Audit showed that an average of two rest breaks per week per employee were either missed or shortened at every store. The results were reported to top-level Wal-Mart executives, and on February 10, 2001, Wal-Mart eliminated its policy requiring employees <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>to clock out and clock back in for each rest break.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Additionally, there was evidence that, prior to 2003, it was possible for Wal-Mart cashiers to log in to and operate cash registers even if they were “off-the-clock.” In 2003, Wal-Mart instituted a “lock-out” system whereby no employee who was off-the-clock could log in to a cash register. However, the system permitted managers to override lock-outs, <em>i.e., </em>to enable an off-the-clock employee to log in to and operate a cash register.</p>

Scott Baggett, Ph.D., and Martin M. Shapiro, Ph.D., who had analyzed Wal-Mart’s own business records regarding hours worked, breaks taken, and wages paid to each employee, as well as the results of the Shipley Audit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> At trial, Dr. Baggett testified that he had been provided the hourly employee time clock, rest break, and payroll records for all 139 Wal-Mart stores in Pennsylvania for the period from 1998 through early 2006, which amounted to 46 million individual shifts. Dr. Baggett further testified that the data <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>provided had been incomplete, and that statistical extrapolation from the data revealed that, in fact, 52 million individual shifts had occurred during that time period; he testified that his computation of that total had been formulated within a reasonable degree of statistical certainty. Dr. Baggett also explained his methodology for determining how many rest breaks should have been earned over the course of those 52 million individual shifts, and how many rest breaks had been missed. Among other things, this undertaking required calculating numbers for the period from February 2001 to 2006, during which time actual rest break data was no longer available, due to the 2001 change in Wal-Mart’s policy that eliminated the requirement for employees to clock out and clock back in at the beginning and end of rest breaks. Dr. Baggett explained that his method for extrapolating the total amount of breaks that had been missed but unrecorded included baseline calculations of the number of known, recorded missed breaks that had occurred prior to the 2001 change in rest break time clock policy. Based on these extrapolations, coupled with the average rate of pay for hourly Wal-Mart employees, all of which had been calculated within a reasonable degree of statistical certainty, Dr. Baggett testified that the total damages to Wal-Mart hourly employees for missed rest breaks during the relevant time period had been $68,412,107. Dr. Baggett also testified that, although he could not tell from the data why any individual rest break had been missed, he presumed rest breaks had not been missed voluntarily because Wal-Mart’s policy prohibited employees from missing or working through scheduled rest breaks.</p>

Dr. Shapiro stated that he had compared the WalMart time clock, payroll, and rest break computer databases, and found numerous recorded instances of employees actively logged in to cash registers or computer-based learning terminals during times when they had simultaneously been clocked out for a break or had been clocked out of a shift altogether. He added that the total amount of such off-the-clock work hours decreased significantly after Wal-Mart instituted its <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>“lock-out” policy in 2003. Dr. Shapiro had been provided with time clock and cash register log-in data for sixteen Pennsylvania Wal-Mart stores for the period from 2001 to 2006. In his testimony, Dr. Shapiro explained how he had extrapolated from that data to determine the average total number of hours of off-the-clock work performed by all hourly employees at all Pennsylvania Wal-Mart stores during the period from 1998 to 2005. He calculated that the unpaid earnings for all WalMart employees working off-the-clock during the relevant period was $2,993,063.32, and testified that his computation had been formulated within a reasonable degree of statistical certainty.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[280,968,1152,901]]]'>Appellees also presented the expert testimony of organizational psychologist and statistician, Frank Landy, Ph.D., who testified that Wal-Mart had promised all its employees, through a variety of means, that paid breaks were a benefit of employment with Wal-Mart, and that its employees understood and expected that all breaks were to be paid breaks. In discussing the Shipley Audit, Dr. Landy testified that WalMart stores had used daily “time adjustment slips” to correct known rest break violation errors. He explained: “Adjustment means that the associate actually comes in and says, no, no, I actually did get my break; I just forgot to swipe in [and] out for [it].” Dr. Landy testified that only approximately 10% of the total number of rest break violations had been corrected through time adjustment slips, which led him to the conclusion that “the magnitude of this problem even after they correct it for honest mistakes is big.” <em>See Braun, </em><a href="/a3d/24/0875-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="24 A.3d 875" data-case-ids="7280047" data-case-paths="/a3d/24/0875-01">24 A.3d at 932</a> (quoting Dr. Landy’s trial testimony).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Principally, Dr. Martin took issue with Dr. Baggett’s premise that an employee’s failure to clock out and clock back in from a rest break indicated a missed rest break, as well as his conclusion that no missed breaks were voluntary. In Dr. Martin’s opinion, Dr. Baggett had used “bad” data to account for missing data, which is “statistically improper.” With respect to Dr. Shapiro’s methodology, Dr. Martin criticized his assumption that cashiers did not routinely log in to cash registers under another employee’s name.

Damages were assessed based on a computation of the average rate of an employee’s pay (about eight dollars per hour) multiplied by the number of hours for which pay should have been received but was not.

Wal-Mart maintained "Time Clock Archive Reports” that showed total hours worked and total breaks taken by every employee for every shift worked. Wal-Mart's "Time Clock Punch Exception Reports” showed missed, inadequate, or overly-long breaks for all employees. These business records were used by Wal-Mart primarily for purposes of calculating payroll, and were analyzed by Appellees' experts. At the class-certification stage, Dr. Baggett testified that he had analyzed some 24,000 individual employee work shifts in twelve Pennsylvania WalMart stores between March 1998 and December 2000, and had concluded that some 40% of hourly workers had not received the number or duration of rest breaks to which they had been entitled. Dr. Baggett stated that his analysis squared with the results of the Shipley Audit. In challenging class certification, Wal-Mart presented the deposition testimony of its own expert to explain that the evidence relied upon by Appellees' experts to show missed breaks was not reliable because an employee’s failure to clock out and clock back in from any given break did not necessarily indicate that the employee had failed to take a break. In certifying the class, the trial court ruled that "the discrepancies in testimony [regarding the accuracy/reliability of the business records] will undoubtedly be an issue for jury determination at trial.” Trial Court Opinion, 12/27/05, at 11.</p>

Dr. Landy also testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that Wal-Mart store managers earned significant year-end bonuses for maximizing profits, the key to which was keeping payroll costs down by intentionally understaffing their stores and forcing employees to miss breaks and work off-the-clock. He opined that a store manager could earn a $1300 annual bonus by simply shaving one minute per week per employee from a store's payroll obligation. He further explained that if a manager could shave one hour per week per employee from a store’s payroll obligation, the annual bonus would be $82,000.

He opined that Wal-Mart’s "preferred scheduling” program was the "root cause” of understaffing in the stores. There is a correlation, Dr. Landy stated, between understaffing and employees’ ability to receive breaks: the more understaffed the stores, the greater the pressure on managers not to provide breaks and on employees not to take breaks. He explained how the pressure to reduce payroll costs led to understaffing. Dr. Landy noted that the Wal-Mart store-manager-bonus system had a “negative effect” on compliance with Wal-Mart’s policies on breaks and pay. Lastly, Dr. Landy testified that after Wal-Mart conducted its Shipley Audit, Wal-Mart eliminated the requirement that employees punch the time clock for rest breaks; he opined that Wal-Mart eliminated "smoking gun" evidence of its policy violations to limit its liability.</blockquote>

Although I take no issue with the majority’s observation that the burden of proof may be relaxed to some degree in wage-and-hour cases, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 309-10, 106 A.3d at 666-67, the latitude extended in this case is of an untenable magnitude. Here, the Appellee class was permitted to effectively project the anecdotal experience of each of six testifying class members upon thirty-thousand other members of the class at large, to extrapolate abstract data concerning missed and mistimed “swipes” from 16 Pennsylvania stores to 139 others, to overlay discrete data taken from several years’ experience across a distinct four-year period, and to attribute a single cause to missed and mistimed swipes, all despite indisputable variations across store locations, management personnel, time, and other circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The sorts of gross generalizations and assumptions which permitted the simple averaging and extrapolations offered up by Appellees’ expert witnesses to stand in support of the conclusion that some tens of millions of missed or mistimed swipes reflected rest breaks foregone on account of payroll pressure exerted from the Wal-Mart boardroom would never hold up to peer review as a matter of science.
