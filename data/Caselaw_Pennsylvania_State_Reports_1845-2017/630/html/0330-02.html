Simons had been drinking all day prior to this engagement, but testified that he did not drink at the Jenkintown Road residence. Senger, however, testified that all three men drank beer while at the Jenkintown Road residence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Senger rode in the front passenger seat, while decedent sat in the back rear passenger seat. None of the men fastened their seatbelts. Simons testified that he was, in fact, drunk when he left the party, and admitted that this was not the first time he had driven his friends home drunk.</p>

Simons testified that the police car made a U-turn and began following Simons with its lights and siren activated. Simons admitted that instead of pulling over, he fled, as he was “scared of getting a DUI.” Deposition of Scott Simons, 9/10/2009 at 18. Senger testified that when Simons initially “floored his car,” he was not aware <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>that police were pursuing the car. Deposition of Matthew Senger, 12/4/2009 at 28. Senger estimated that Simons was driving “well over 100” miles per hour. <em>Id. </em>at 34. Simons then arrived at Senger’s home, and as goodbyes were exchanged, Senger noticed reflections of police lights in the windows of nearby homes. Before Senger could exit the vehicle, Simons again floored it and shut off his headlights. Senger testified that both he and decedent then asked Simons to slow down, as they were aware of a dip in the road ahead. Simons, however, continued at a high rate of speed and ultimately hit the dip in the road. The car was sent airborne and crashed into trees and a parked pickup truck. Simons and Senger suffered minor injuries, while decedent was ejected from the vehicle and thrown 20 feet therefrom, suffering a catastrophic brain injury, along with other injuries.</p>

The vehicle is then seen turning onto Garfield Avenue, as Officer Howley radioed in that he was pursuing a red Mustang travelling northbound on Garfield.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Officer Howley made the turn onto Garfield and reported that the car had been traveling at a high rate of speed, and he suspected the driver was driving under the influence. Lt. Karl Knott, Officer Howley’s supervising officer, ordered Officer Howley to stay with the Mustang. At approximately 3:50 a.m., Officer Howley radioed that he had lost the car. At approximately 3:51 a.m., Officer Howley received a radio call indicating that the Mustang had crashed into a house on Meyer Avenue. Officer Howley arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and immediately radioed for EMS to respond to the scene. The video established that seventy-four seconds passed between the moment Officer Howley activated his lights until he deactivated the lights. Simons’ car, however, was only visible on the recording for sixteen seconds.</p>

Appellants alleged that Appellees caused the death of decedent when Officer Howley negligently, recklessly, and willfully initiated and failed to terminate a high speed pursuit of Simons’ vehicle. After the completion of discovery, Appellees moved for summary judgment based upon governmental immunity, citing to the Political Division Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act), 42 Pa.C.S. § 8541, which states “[ejxcept as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no local agency shall be liable for any damages on account of any injury to a person or property caused by any act of the local agency or an employee thereof or any person.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8541.</p>

The officer’s relationship to the fleeing suspect must be viewed in light of the broader relationship to the safety of the community he or she serves. Any duty of protection the officer has is lessened as soon as the driver flees rather than complying with a request to stop. The second factor weighs against imposing a duty, as the social utility of a police officer’s attempt to apprehend a person suspected of violating the law is beyond dispute. Turning to the third factor, it is evident that there is a risk of injury to the fleeing driver, and it is foreseeable that drivers who refuse to pull over when alerted to do so may be injured in their attempt to elude an officer. Fourth, the consequences of imposing a duty upon officers are burdensome, as that may prevent the apprehension of dangerous criminals and further encourage flight. Finally, the public has a preeminent interest in ensuring that roadways remain safe from dangerous drivers and criminals and that police officers are empowered to enforce the law.</blockquote>

      <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>First, as we indicated in <em>Lindstrom, </em>“a law enforcement officer is a protector of all members of the public.” <em>Lindstrom, supra </em>at 397. We must, therefore, view the first factor, the relationship between the officers and passengers in a fleeing vehicle, in the broader context of the relationship the officer has to the community he or she serves. <em>Id. </em>An officer’s relationship to the community he or she serves hinges on the officer’s ability to keep the members of the community safe from criminals, including dangerous drivers. Accordingly, where, as here, the officer was unaware of the presence of a passenger in a fleeing vehicle, this first factor weighs against imposing a duty.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[270,992,1149,261]]]'>As we found in <em>Lindstrom, </em>the second factor weighs against imposing a duty, as “the social utility of a police officer’s attempt to apprehend a person suspected of violating the law is beyond dispute.” <em>Id. </em>This social utility is not curtailed by the addition of an unknown passenger in a fleeing vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[270,1295,1147,371]]]'>As to the third factor, we acknowledge that we found in <em>Lindstrom </em>that it is foreseeable that a fleeing driver may be injured in his attempt to elude an officer. <em>Id. </em>Instantly, because injury to an unknown passenger is not foreseeable, we find that the nature of the risk imposed and the foreseeability of the harm incurred to an unknown passenger weighs against imposing a duty on pursuing officers.</p>
    <p id="b386-7" data-blocks='[["BL_386.6",386,[270,1707,1151,631]]]'>The fourth factor weighs heavily against imposing a duty on officers. Imposing a duty on officers to unknown passengers in a fleeing vehicle would present an unworkable burden on officers, essentially halting police pursuits. The decision to pursue a fleeing vehicle is one that must be made in a matter of seconds. To require officers to not only establish the presence of passengers, but also discover the relationship of the passengers to the fleeing driver, would be unmanageable in the necessarily fast-paced environment of law enforcement. Moreover, officers, fearing the risk of civil liability, would be less likely to initiate pursuit, which would likely encourage criminals to flee.</p>

      <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>Finally, as we found in <em>Lindstrom, </em>“the public has a preeminent interest in ensuring that roadways remain safe from dangerous drivers and criminals and that police officers are empowered to enforce the law.” <em>Id. </em>These factors, when weighed against one another, militate heavily against imposing a duty on officers to unknown passengers in a fleeing vehicle. Appellants fail to meet the threshold requirement of the Tort Claims Act, and therefore, we need not determine whether this claim falls within the vehicle liability exception found in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(1). <em>See, Lindstrom, supra </em>at 398.</p>

As noted above, in <em>Lindstrom, </em>we held that police officers were protectors of <em>all </em>members of the public, but concluded that an officer’s duty to a driver is lessened when the driver flees. As a passenger is not in control of the fleeing vehicle, a police officer arguably has a greater duty of protection to the passenger than to the driver. Yet, a police officer’s relationship with a passenger whose presence in a fleeing vehicle is known to the officer, but whose relationship to the driver is not, still must be considered in light of the broader relationship to the safety of the community at large. In my view, where the passenger’s relationship to the driver is unknown, and the officer has no reason to believe the passenger’s presence in the car is not voluntary, an officer’s duty to protect the members of the public and the community he serves predominates. For this reason, I conclude the first <em>Althaus </em>factor weighs slightly against the imposition of a duty either to passengers whose presence in the vehicle is unknown to police or to passengers whose connection to the driver is unknown to police.</p>
