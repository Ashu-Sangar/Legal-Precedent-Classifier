After careful review, we hold that the insureds’ negligence claim was not barred by the gist of the action doctrine, as the claim was based on an alleged breach of a social duty imposed by the law of torts, and not a breach of a duty created by the underlying contract of insurance. We additionally conclude that the insureds were not required to obtain a certificate of merit in order to proceed with their negligence suit against the professional engineer, since they were not patients or clients of the engineering company which employed him. Consequently, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>

Once the paneling was detached, Mr. Bruno discovered two areas of black mold growing on the block walls underneath, which were in proximity to leaking water pipes.</p>

In response, on October 6, 2007, Erie sent an adjuster to his home to view the mold. The adjuster took no action at that time, but, instead, returned on October 8, 2007 with an engineer employed by Appellee, Rudick Forensic Engineering Company (“Rudick”), which had been retained by Erie to investigate the mold problem, determine its severity, and ascertain the extent to which remediation was required. After the adjuster and the engineer examined the mold growth, Mr. Bruno requested that the adjuster authorize payment of the policy limits — $5,000—in order to have the mold tested. In response to Mr. Bruno’s request, the adjuster and the engineer informed Mr. Bruno that “the mold was harmless and that they should continue tearing out the existing paneling [and] that health problems associated with mold were a media frenzy and overblown.” Complaint, 8/30/10, at ¶ 19. The adjuster refused payment on the basis that he lacked authori<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>zation to pay the claim, and he additionally asserted that no determination as to coverage had been made.</p>

These actions revealed more leaking pipes and additional areas of mold growing on the walls beyond that which was initially discovered.</p>

Even though the engineer performed tests of the mold, he did not disclose those results to the Brunos, nor did he or the adjuster apprise the Brunos of the true hazard to human health posed by the mold, or indicate that it should be removed or remediated.</p>

By January 2008, Angela Bruno’s physical condition had deteriorated to the point that she developed severe coughing, difficulty breathing and clearing her throat, and intense headaches.

Finally, in April 2008, Erie made a <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>$5,000 payment under the mold endorsement of the homeowners’ policy.</p>

    <p id="b125-5" data-blocks='[["BL_125.5",125,[236,1236,1151,737]]]'>The trial court sustained Erie’s preliminary objections, noting that, under the Superior Court’s formulation of the gist of the action doctrine, the critical distinction between a breach of contract action and a tort action is that “the former arises out of ‘breaches of duties imposed by mutual consensus agreements between particular individuals,’ while the latter arises out of ‘breaches of duties imposed by law as a matter of social policy.’” Trial Court Opinion, 5/24/2011, at 2 (quoting <em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Abbott Furnace Co., </em><a href="/a2d/972/1232-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="972 A.2d 1232" data-case-ids="7299054" data-case-paths="/a2d/972/1232-01">972 A.2d 1232</a>, 1238-39 (Pa.Super.2009)).

Thus, the court reasoned that, because privity of contract was not required in order for the Brunos to proceed on their professional liability claim against Rudick, they were obligated to file a certificate of merit within 60 days of filing their complaint and, since they did not do so, the court struck this claim from their complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The court found that “the gravamen of [the Brunos’] action against Erie Insurance sounds in contract — not in tort.” <em>Bruno, </em>at 15. The court determined that the Brunos’ relationship with Erie “arose out of — and is defined by — the Homeowner’s Insurance Policy.” <em>Id. </em>at 16. The court noted that, after the Brunos discovered the mold, they took action under the terms of this policy by initiating a claim for mold and water damage, after which Erie, in accordance with its obligations under the terms of its policy, sent its adjuster and the engineer from Rudick to investigate. The court reasoned that if Erie improperly performed its investigation, then Erie breached its contractual duty to the Brunos under the policy. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court deemed the allegations against Erie made in the Brunos’ negligence claim to involve breaches of Erie’s contractual obligations and not breaches of a broader societal duty arising out of the social policies furthered by the law of torts. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the court opined that “ ‘the nature of [the Brunos’] action [against Erie Insurance] as a whole’ is a contractual one and any duty Erie Insurance owed to [the Brunos] was defined by the terms of the Homeowner’s Insurance Policy.” <em>Bruno, </em>at 18 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>

The court concluded that Section 323 was inapplicable to the instant matter because, in the court’s view, the adjuster was performing services for Erie to determine if it was responsible <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>for paying the claim under the policy, and, hence, he did not undertake to render any services <em>to the Brunos.</em>

The court, employing a policy-based analysis, determined that accepting the Brunos’ contention would be “antithetical to the purpose behind the certificate of merit requirement” articulated by our Court, which was to “ ‘devise an orderly procedure that would serve to identify and weed non-meritorious malpractice claims from the judicial system efficiently and promptly.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 23-25 (quoting <em>Worrier v.

The court noted that our Court in <em>Bilt-Rite, supra, </em>recognized that engineers may be found professionally liable to third parties when it is foreseeable that the information the engineers provide to a client will be used and relied on by the third party. Hence, the court considered it an absurd result to require that a party who is in direct contractual privity with the engineer provide a certificate of merit when bringing a claim predicated on the engineer’s alleged provision of negligent advice, whereas a third party bringing a suit based on that very same advice would be relieved from filing such a certificate. The court found that these considerations, coupled with the plain language of Rule 1042.3, which applies to “any action based upon an allegation that a licensed professional deviated from an acceptable professional standard,” mandated that third parties like the Brunos “must support their professional liability claims with a certificate of merit.” <em>Bruno, </em>at 25 (quoting Pa.R.C.P. 1042.3).</p>

The Brunos characterize all of these actions as “well outside” the scope of Erie’s contractual duties, inasmuch as the contract of insurance did not require Erie to determine the mold’s toxicity, or to render advice about whether Mr. Bruno should continue to remove the paneling in light of its discovery. The Brunos maintain that, because Erie’s liability under the policy, by its terms, only required it to pay up to $5,000 for direct physical loss to the property and additional living expenses in connection with the presence of mold, it was “of no contractual importance whether the mold discovered ... was toxic, [or] non-toxic.” Therefore, they reason, it was improper for the Superior Court to conclude that the duties purportedly breached by the acts of Erie’s adjuster and engineer in rendering advice about the mold’s toxicity were “ ‘defined by the terms of the contract,’ ” Brunos’ Brief at 30 (quoting <em>Bruno, </em>at 16).

However, as <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>commerce became more sophisticated, certain cases began to arise where injuries occurred during the course of business relationships between parties, such as horses being drowned during transportation or injured during shoeing, customers of incompetent barbers sustaining disfiguring facial injuries during shaving, patients suffering grievous bodily injury from shoddy surgical practices, and homes being rendered dangerous or uninhabitable as the result of carpenters’ lack of skill in performing construction.

These actions eventually evolved to the point that they became the exclusive vehicle for parties to pursue remedies for breaches of executory promises in their contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 382-84.</p>

A bewildering array of decisions followed from those tribunals as they attempted to distinguish tort and contract actions, but they offered no clear principle of demarcation.

One night, the plaintiff put his horse out to pasture on his lands, but, because of the absence of fencing, the horse wandered onto the defendants’ land and tumbled to its death in the quarry. The plaintiff commenced an action to recover the value of the loss of the horse, which he asserted resulted from the defendants’ negligence.

The Brunos’ claim against Erie for its alleged actions at issue in this appeal, quite simply, is not based on Erie’s violation of any of these contractual commitments. The Brunos do not allege that Erie failed to pay the $5,000 it was obliged to pay by the policy for the costs of testing and remediation of damage to the property, and, indeed, the parties agree that Erie did, in fact, pay the Brunos the $5,000 it owed under the policy for these purposes.</p>

Consequently, these allegations of negligence facially concern Erie’s alleged breach of a general social duty, not a breach of any duty created by the insurance policy itself.

A certificate of merit is not, therefore, required for professional liability actions brought by plaintiffs who are not patients or clients of a licensed professional.

The explanatory note to the 2008 amendments, which yielded the present version of the relevant language in Pa.R.C.P. 1042.1(a), plainly states that one of the purposes for this amendment was “to make clear that Rule 1042.1 <em>et seq. </em>... applies to claims by or on behalf of patients or clients <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>against licensed professionals.” Pa.R.C.P. 1042.6, comment.

Rudick clearly did not provide medical care to the Brunos, so the Brunos were not patients of Rudick. Moreover, and critically, according to the allegations in their complaint, the Brunos did not engage, employ, or retain Rudick to provide engineering services to them; rather, Rudick was retained by <em>Erie </em>for the purpose of providing engineering services to Erie to evaluate damage to the Brunos’ home caused by the mold. Consequently, as the Brunos did not engage, employ, or retain Rudick directly, they may not be considered clients of Rudick, and, therefore, they were not required under Rules 1042.1 and 1042.3 to file a certificate of merit. As a result, we reverse the order of the Superior Court affirming the order of the trial court dismissing the Brunos complaint against Rudick on this basis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a>

The Pennsylvania Association for Justice ("PAJ”) has submitted an <em>amicus </em>brief in which it recognizes the utility of the gist of the action doctrine in preventing contract claims from being brought as tort actions; however, PAJ cautions that the doctrine, in its current form, does not provide a clear and understandable tool to separate genuine contract claims from tort ones, nor does the doctrine acknowledge that there are some situations where certain relationships may be established by contract, such as physician and patient, and landlord and tenant, but actions taken in the course of the contractual relationship may also give rise to tort liability in addition to a claim for breach of contract. Because of the potential confusion in the application of this doctrine, PAJ advocates using only the traditional pretrial tools afforded by the rules of civil procedure, such as motions for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment, to weed out putative tort claims that are not actionable. Alternatively, PAJ urges that our Court restrict the application of the gist of the action doctrine to situations "where ... the only basis of a tort duty is in a contract between the parties <em>and. ... </em>where the duty does not involve larger social policies embodied in the law of torts.” PAJ Brief at 12 (emphasis original).</p>

    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[272,375,1151,902]]]'>I agree in full with the majority’s analysis concerning a certifícate of merit. I also agree the “gist of the action” doctrine does not bar the present action because statements concerning toxicity are outside the scope of the insurance policy, but I write separately to caution against what I deem troublesome language. To the extent the majority is perceived to “paint with a broad brush,” suggesting any negligence claim based on a contracting party’s manner of performance does not arise from the underlying contract, <em>see </em>Majority Op., at 114, 106 A.3d at 69-70, I must disagree. In some cases, such as here, that may be the case. However, synthesizing case law to stand for such a broad pronouncement does not comport with the “gist of the action” doctrine — an inherently circumstantial analysis. <em>See eToll, Inc. v.
