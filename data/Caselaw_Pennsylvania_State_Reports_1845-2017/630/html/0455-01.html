As noted, the meaning and reach of <em>Kean </em>was the focus of both parties and both courts below, so a <em>precis </em>of the decision is warranted. The video recording in <em>Kean </em>did not involve a police agent or Cl entering a home, a hidden police camera, or indeed any police involvement at all in the recording. Rather, in <em>Kean, </em>the defendants were a husband and wife charged with sexual offenses and criminal conspiracy involving the wife’s sexual activity with two male juveniles, which occurred with the husband’s knowledge, consent, and observation. When the couple’s relations with the juveniles soured, the juveniles decided to videotape their future encounters with the wife in hopes of using the tape to extort funds or as proof that the sexual activity was consensual if the wife later claimed otherwise. Eventually, however, one of the juvenile’s mothers learned of the tape, obtained it, had a relative watch it, contacted state police, and ultimately <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>turned it over to a state police officer.

The lead opinion by Judge Beck, which garnered a majority for virtually all of its substance except for the dispositive conclusion specific to the facts in that case, stressed the need for the judiciary to “keep pace with the threat to privacy engendered by new electronic devices [and] the dangers posed by the increasingly widespread dissemination of videocameras and videorecorders among the general public.” <a href="/pa-super/382/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="382 Pa.

Commonwealth’s Brief at 9-13. For present purposes, the aspects of the Commonwealth’s briefing that matter (given the audio recording precedents of this Court) are that the Cl was equipped by police with the wearable camera for the purpose of recording a drug buy that both the police and the Cl expected to transpire on a public street corner, and was not purposefully sent by police to appellee’s home. Then, at the prearranged corner, unexpected to the police, appellee picked up the Cl in his car, drove the Cl to his own home, and brought the Cl inside. The surreptitious filming of the drug deal then occurred in appellee’s home.</p>

To appellee, if such “untrammeled” government activity is permitted without a <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>warrant based upon probable cause, the right to privacy in the home will be threatened; and citizens’ reasonable expectation of privacy in the home must be protected from what appellee calls “repugnant” government intrusion without probable cause.</p>

First, as noted, neither party argues the case in terms of the distinctions between federal constitutional law and Article I, Section 8. Rather, both accept <em>Kean </em>as the governing constitutional decision, and argue from that platform with no additional analyses specific to the Pennsylvania constitutional experience. Second, the evidence here involves video images alone, without audio. Since no “communication” was intercepted, the Wiretap Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">8</a> is not at issue facially, nor do the parties argue that it applies; this appeal thus raises a strictly constitutional query involving the hidden video camera. Third, there is no suggestion that the Cl’s entry into appellee’s home was unlawful: he was invited across the threshold by appellee, who drove him there from the pre-arranged street corner. There was no breaking of doors, or evidence that the Cl rummaged about the home once inside. Fourth, appellee has not suggested that there is anything unlawful in a police agent, such as a Cl, using a hidden camera to record evidence <em>per se. </em>Thus, for example, appellee does not argue that if this prearranged drug sale had occurred, and was surreptitiously filmed, on the street corner where appellee and the Cl met, suppression would still be warranted. Instead, appellee’s argument for suppression focuses on the fact that the video recording occurred in his home, without his knowledge. And, finally, appellee has never alleged that the police employed a ruse designed to invade the privacy of appellee’s home in order to defeat the warrant requirement. Instead, the situation, and the Superior Court’s ultimate holding, appears to <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>have engendered a <em>per se </em>rule: absent a warrant, neither police nor a police agent may use a hidden camera in a suspect’s home, regardless of how the camera arrives there.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[275,477,1150,1535]]]'>Notwithstanding the exclusive focus of the parties and courts below on the <em>Kean </em>decision, we do not view <em>Kean </em>as a particularly helpful starting point. For one thing, the factual circumstances in <em>Kean </em>— non-police actors deliberately invading the privacy of the defendants’ bedroom to set up a video camera to record all of the events therein, with police involvement consisting only of viewing the privately-recorded tape after one of the boy’s mothers voluntarily gave the video to a state trooper — are not particularly relevant to the situation here, where a Cl was deliberately outfitted by police with a hidden camera on his person for purposes of recording a drug buy outdoors and in public, but who then was unexpectedly taken to and inside the drug dealer’s home to complete the buy. And, moreover, the core of the broad and dramatic language from <em>Kean </em>seized upon below — that “nowhere is the right to privacy more firmly established than in a private residence” — is unexceptional. It is beyond dispute that the right to privacy has its greatest power in the home, and this has been part of our legal tradition for centuries. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. U.S., </em><a href="/us/357/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="357 U.S. 301" data-case-ids="6162465" data-case-paths="/us/357/0301-01">357 U.S. 301</a>, 306-07, <a href="/us/357/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="357 U.S. 301" data-case-ids="6162465" data-case-paths="/us/357/0301-01">78 S.Ct. 1190</a>, <a href="/us/357/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="357 U.S. 301" data-case-ids="6162465" data-case-paths="/us/357/0301-01">2 L.Ed.2d 1332</a> (1958) (“From earliest days, the common law drastically limited the authority of law officers to break the door of a house to effect an arrest.

What the parties and the courts below should have found, however, is a line of cases from this Court arising in the obviously analogous circumstance of warrantless audio surveillance, jurisprudence spanning over a decade. Indeed, given that <em>Kean </em>discussed the first case in this line, <em>Commonwealth v. Blystone, </em>from 1988, the failure to perceive the relevance of these cases is inexplicable. We think an exploration of the reasoning developed in the cases is therefore helpful in framing the decisional inquiry here.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[216,792,1151,1113]]]'>In the audiotaping cases, this Court has divided on two distinctly articulated constitutional viewpoints. On one hand, several Justices have reasoned that a defendant who voluntarily reveals incriminating information or actions to another person runs the risk of it being revealed to authorities, whether by oral recounting or by electronic recording and transmission, and therefore surrenders any reasonable expectation of privacy in those expressions or actions, wherever they may take place. That position was represented by the 5-2 majority in <em>Blystone, </em>the Court’s first encounter with this issue. Other Justices, beginning with the dissenters in <em>Blystone, </em>have maintained that Pennsylvania’s tradition of providing greater constitutional protection of privacy than does the Fourth Amendment means, in this area, that any form of governmental or law enforcement “eavesdropping,” even with the consent of one party (like a Cl), cannot be reasonable.

      <em>Blystone </em>was a capital murder in which the Court upheld the admission at trial of a recorded conversation between Blystone and a police informant, who had consented to wear a wire.

The majority opinion by Mr. Justice McDermott noted that the question was settled that one-party consensual interceptions do not violate the Fourth Amendment, but also stressed that the federal precedents did not necessarily control the state constitutional analysis, since the states are free to interpret their charters more broadly. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that the key inquiry remained the same as under Fourth Amendment principles: i.e., whether the defendant could claim a “reasonable expectation of privacy” that was violated by the challenged action: “To determine whether one’s activities fall within the right of privacy, we must examine: first, whether appellant has exhibited an expectation of privacy; and second, whether that expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.” <a href="/pa/519/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="519 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1813568" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0450-01">549 A.2d at </a>87 (citing <em>Katz v.

At the same time, <em>Brion </em>stressed that the central holding in <em>Blystone </em>remained the law, explaining that, “[w]e found no constitutional defect in [the Wiretap Act] because Blystone had no reasonable expectation of privacy once he chose to disclose his confidence to the informant.” But <em>Brion </em>then reemphasized, as had <em>Schaeffer, </em>the different calculus where police conduct invades the privacy of the home, repeating the same dramatic phrasing from <em>Shaw </em>that was emphasized in the <em>Schaeffer </em>OISA: “Upon closing the door of one’s home to the outside world, a person may legitimately expect the highest degree of privacy known to our society.” 652 A.2d at 287-89.</p>

From the perspective of the person suffering the intrusion, it little matters if the mistake is that of the judge issuing the warrant or that of the officer executing it. As we have explained, cases like <em>Brion </em>focused upon police conduct designed and intended to intrude upon — or to invite an intrusion upon — the privacy of the home.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">12</a> In this case, unlike in <em>Edmunds </em>or in <em>Brion, </em>there is no such underlying error by police or magistrate; the “intrusion” was at appellee’s invitation.

In the seminal case of <em>Edmunds, </em>for example, the police may have acted in good faith upon the warrant, but the warrant was itself invalid because it was not supported by probable cause; a judicial branch officer erred, causing an unlawful intrusion.

To allow the judicial branch to participate, directly or indirectly, in the use of the fruits of illegal searches would only serve to undermine the integrity of the judiciary in this Commonwealth. From the perspective of the citizen whose rights are at stake, an invasion of privacy, in good faith or bad, is equally as intrusive.
