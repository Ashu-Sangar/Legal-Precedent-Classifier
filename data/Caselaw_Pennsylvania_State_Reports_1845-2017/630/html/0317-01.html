In my opinion, the prospect that a traffic court jurist failed to cooperate in an administrative review of traffic court operations falls into the “vast majority of circumstances.” Thus, I believe that deferring to the Judicial Conduct Board for the investigation and resolution of the allegations of misconduct against Judge Solomon is the appropriate course in the present context.</p>

Letter dated March 9, 2012, <em>introduced as </em>AOPC Hearing Exhibit C. <em>See </em>N.T., June 21, 2013, at 156 (reflecting that the exhibit was admitted into evidence). Yet, the ensuing report by Chadwick, which was made public, quoted some of Judge Solomon’s remarks and more generally summarized the substance of the interviews, thus rendering the promised confidentiality illusory. The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (“AOPC”) now suggests that use of the term “confidential” was nothing more than a device to dissuade interviewees from attempting to have counsel present, and that its sole purpose was to protect the federal prosecution from taint, and not to protect the confidentiality of the interviewed judges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

We certainly agree that we will not take a prosecutorial stance.”), the AOPC’s counsel proceeded to present witnesses who testified that Judge Solomon refused to cooperate and lied during the administrative review — including William Chadwick, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 36-37 (“Q: What did your operational review conclude as to Judge Solomon, Mr. Chadwick.... A: Well, I concluded that she had lied to us. I concluded that she had not cooperated.”), and one of his associates, <em>see id. </em>at 107 (“Q: Do you remember [Judge Solomon] saying, I will not cooperate? A: Yes.”) — and to cross-examine Judge Solomon during her testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 191-205. Later, the AOPC submitted papers to this Court complaining that it would be “prejudiced” if it could not respond to Judge Solomon’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with its own proposed findings and conclusions, together with “[r]esponsive [argument” responding to the advocacy submitted by Judge Solomon on her own behalf. <em>See </em>Motion to Vacate at 6-7. In its proposed conclusions of law, the AOPC offered that, at the June 21, 2013, hearing, the witnesses called by the AOPC testified credibly, but Judge Solomon’s testimony was “not credible.” <em>See id., </em>Exhibit A, at 15-18.</p>

The immediate goal of the review was to secure and preserve evidence, to facilitate full cooperation with the federal investigation, and to reestablish the probity of Traffic Court operations. The administrative review was to be supervised by the newly appointed Administrative Judge of the Traffic Court, the Honorable Gary S. Glazer, Judge of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas.

The JCB also represented that it was pursuing an investigation of Judge Solomon in light of the FJD Report, even though such an investigation by the Board presumably is confidential.

Employing the King’s Bench authority is discretionary and, in cases of judicial misconduct for which Article V, Section 18 provides a disciplinary mechanism, the exercise of discretion is appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances. The separate <em>Bruno </em>matter focused largely upon the residual role of the Court in a case in which a sitting jurist is charged with felonious offenses (in <em>Bruno, </em>relating to conduct on the bench), a circumstance that raises the prospect of an interim suspension pending resolution of the criminal charges.

Const, art. V, § 18(d). By contrast, the central issue in dispute involving Judge Solomon is whether an inquiry into a jurist’s compliance with administrative directives from this Court (here, relating to cooperation with the FJD’s efforts to reform the Philadelphia Traffic Court) is a task best undertaken by this Court’s Special Master, or whether the Court should defer to the judicial disciplinary mechanism of the JCB and the CJD.</p>

It appears that, while this matter was pending, and unbeknownst to the Court, the JCB and Judge Solomon have settled the judicial disciplinary issue arising under Article V, Section 18 of the Constitution. Thus, on December 5, 2014, the Board and Judge Solomon filed a post-submission communication informing the Court that, Judge Solomon having <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>waived the confidentiality that would otherwise apply to JCB proceedings, the Board’s investigation has “concluded” and has “resulted in a dismissal of the complaint filed in relation to Judge Solomon, with a Letter of Caution,” which is “a private warning of judicial misconduct.” The post-submission communication does not detail the precise nature of the complaint the Board actually pursued and what its findings were; from the judicial disciplinary point of view, the matter will remain confidential, as mandated by Article V, Section 18(a)(8) (“All proceedings of the board shall be confidential except when the subject of the investigation waives confidentiality.”).</p>

In my view, the notion that the Court must, or even should, defer to the investigation and outcome of the judicial disciplinary apparatus in a case involving whether a member of the minor judiciary has defied this Court’s administrative directive is misguided. We do not know, for example, if the JCB found as fact that Judge Solomon did not defy our authority; or, if the Board instead found that she did defy the Court but, in the Board’s estimation, such defiance was excusable or <em>de mini-mus. </em>Or, it could be that, given the JCB’s limited resources, resolution by agreement seemed to be the best resolution. Indeed, we do not even know the standard by which the Board measures defiance, assuming Judge Solomon’s alleged defiance was the focus of the Board’s endeavor. I think the Court, and the public, have a right to know precisely what happened in this instance, and the confidential process and outcome resolving the judicial disciplinary matter here is insufficient. I cast no aspersions on the Board’s action in this matter; it has a different constitutional charge and responsibility. But, I do believe the situation here demonstrates the unforeseen consequences arising from the amendment to Article V, Section 18(a)(8) of the Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>Furthermore, the Court has confronted similar situations in the past and has acted to vindicate the authority of the Court and to assure the proper functioning of the judicial system. <em>See, e.g., In re Assignment of McFalls, </em><a href="/pa/568/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="568 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="163770" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0228-01">568 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="795 A.2d 367" data-case-ids="163770,9423277" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0228-01,/a2d/795/0367-01">795 A.2d 367</a>, 373 (2002) (common pleas judge failed to comply with judicial assignment; Court imposed thirty-day suspension without pay as “proper response” to jurist’s defiance and, additionally, referred matter to JCB); <em>In re Avellino, </em><a href="/pa/547/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="547 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="468684" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0398-01">547 Pa. 398</a>, <a href="/a2d/690/1144-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="690 A.2d 1144" data-case-ids="11926111,468684" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/1144-01,/pa/547/0398-01">690 A.2d 1144</a>, 1145-46 (1997) <em>(‘Avellino II”) </em>(judicial <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>officer refused to comply with assignment to preside over criminal trials in “felony-waiver program” of court of common pleas; three-month suspension without pay appropriate remedial sanction). This is not a typical case of alleged judicial misconduct. To the extent <em>Bruno </em>applies at all — except to reaffirm our authority — the circumstances of Judge Solomon’s alleged resistance to the FJD’s reform efforts, and by extension her supposed defiance of the legitimate authority delegated by this Court, if proven, are certainly “extraordinary” and require, in my opinion, further action to vindicate our authority-</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[229,898,1152,788]]]'>Given the nature of the JCB resolution, any information gathered by the Board will remain confidential and the Court has no opportunity to make a reasoned decision whether its administrative authority has been vindicated. If our historical and constitutional powers of supervision are to be effective, when affronts to our authority occur, such as that alleged here of Judge Solomon, it is essential, at a minimum, to develop a factual record of the matter which would be available to this Court. In this vein, I reiterate the observation of the Justices of the Court in 1862 on its King’s Bench power, which is equally applicable in this context: because the Court’s authority “is a trust for the people of Pennsylvania, judges have no right, from motives of ease and convenience, to surrender, weaken, or obscure, by judicial refinements, one single one of the powers granted.” <em>Chase v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/41/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="41 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="480039" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0403-01">41 Pa. 403</a>, 411 (1862).</p>
