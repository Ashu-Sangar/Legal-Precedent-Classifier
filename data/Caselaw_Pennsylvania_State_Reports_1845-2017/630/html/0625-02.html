      <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>The Defender Association of Philadelphia, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>advances several arguments in favor of affirmance. First, it claims that the plain text of the statute supports the Superior Court’s holding because the mandatory sentence reflected in subsection (a)(1) is phrased in the singular (“a minimum sentence of at least ten years”). The Defender Association contends that, even if the statute is ambiguous in this respect, it should be construed in favor of the accused under the rule of lenity. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1); <em>Commonwealth v. Booth, </em><a href="/pa/564/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="564 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1276796" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0228-01">564 Pa. 228</a>, 234, <a href="/a2d/766/0843-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="766 A.2d 843" data-case-ids="11139536,1276796" data-case-paths="/a2d/766/0843-01,/pa/564/0228-01">766 A.2d 843</a>, 846 (2001) (noting that, under the rule of lenity, any doubt about a penal statute’s meaning is resolved in favor of the accused). Next, it argues that subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) should be construed similarly given that they share crucial statutory language, as they both set forth the penalty for a person convicted of a crime of violence. Further, the Defender Association maintains that an offender establishes his status as a recidivist only one time per criminal episode, and hence, only allowing one mandatory minimum sentence per criminal episode is consistent with the recidivist philosophy adopted by the courts in construing Section 9714. Finally, the Defender Association suggests that the interests of justice are better served by a single enhancement for each criminal episode as this would allow more flexibility at sen<em>tencing </em>— e.g., a court could sentence a second-strike offender convicted of two crimes of violence to an aggregate of 15-to-30 years, rather than having to choose between 10-to-20 years or 20-to-40-years.</p>

Here, it is not necessary to revisit <em>McClintic </em>since, as noted, we are construing a materially different statutory provision. In particular, subsection (a)(2) contains the phrase, “such crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions,” which does not appear in subsection (a)(1). This is important because the phrase was critical to the <em>McClintic </em>majority’s understanding that (a)(2)’s sentence enhancement applies to only one of the crimes of violence committed by a third-strike offender during a criminal transaction. In this regard, McClintic reasoned as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AdC" data-blocks='[["BL_669.5",669,[256,1170,1115,1166]]]'>The question we must now address is whether each crime of violence requires its own sentence enhancement____ To answer this question, we look to the language of Section 9714(a)(2), which provides that where the person had, at the time of the current offense, i.e., crime of violence, “previously been convicted of two or more <em>such crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions,” </em>the sentence enhancement applies. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(a)(2) (emphasis added). Use of the word “such,” a demonstrative adjective, refers to an antecedent, or a category of things previously mentioned. The category of things previously mentioned is “current offense,” which we have defined as “crime of violence.” <em>Use of the word “such” before the clause “crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions” serves to limit the current offense or crimes of violence to which the sentence enhancement applies to those “crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions.” </em>Thus, close examination of the specific statutory language, the polestar of all statutory construction, reveals that the legislature intended to apply sentencing enhancements for all crimes arising from a criminal transaction, rather than for each individual crime within such transaction</blockquote>

The subsection is set forth in full in the text above. In material part, it states that “[a]ny person who is convicted ... of a crime of violence shall, if at the time of the commission of the current offense the person had previously been convicted of a crime of violence, be sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least ten years[J” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(a)(1). The Defender Association attempts to cast this language as either clearly supporting only a single sentence enhancement, or, at a minimum, reflecting an ambiguity requiring resort to the rule of lenity. The textual <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>support for such contention is primarily found in the singular phrase, “a minimum sentence of at least ten years.”</p>
    <p id="b672-5" data-blocks='[["BL_672.5",672,[275,417,1150,948]]]'>We do not agree that the singular nature of this phrase either reflects a legislative intention that only one of a series of crimes in a criminal episode be subject to the mandatory minimum sentence, or is sufficient to create a genuine ambiguity. First, giving determinative weight to the singular nature of the word “a” would be in tension with the Statutory Construction Act. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1902 (“The singular shall include the plural, and the plural, the singular.”). Additionally, a straightforward reading of the statutory text reveals that the sentence enhancement is required so long as the defendant meets two prerequisites: he previously committed a crime of violence, and his current offense is a crime of violence. Appellee independently satisfied both of these prerequisites as to all four crimes of violence he committed in 2002, and therefore, subsection (a)(1) requires that “a minimum sentence” be imposed upon him as to each. Unlike subsection (a)(2), moreover, subsection (a)(1) does not contain any separate limiting language that may be read to preclude such an outcome.</p>

The General Assembly is certainly aware that a defendant may be sentenced for multiple crimes simultaneously. In the context of mandatory minimum sentencing, moreover, it has, on at least one occasion, acted to impose limitations upon multiple sentences where it favors such limitations. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1(b) (with regard to mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses committed with a firearm, specifying that an aggregate sentence may not exceed the statutory maximum under the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act).

Determining that the sentence enhancement applied just once to all crimes committed during a single incident, we held that “each strike that serves as a predicate offense must be followed by sentencing and, by necessary implication, an opportunity to reform, before the offender commits the next strike.” <em><a href="/pa/589/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="909 A.2d 1241" data-case-ids="2572454,8461677" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0465-01,/a2d/909/1241-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/589/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="909 A.2d 1241" data-case-ids="2572454,8461677" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0465-01,/a2d/909/1241-01">at 1252</a>. Because the appellant’s two crimes of violence for which the trial court had imposed third-strike minimum sentences were committed during the same criminal transaction, without sequential convictions, sentences, and opportunities to reform, we held that the sentence did not comport with the recidivist philosophy.</p>

    <p id="b677-6" data-blocks='[["BL_677.6",677,[216,1169,1151,1175]]]'>In addition, Section 9714(a)(1) contains language which indicates that the legislature intended this section also to reflect the recidivist philosophy that guided this Court in <em>McClintic. </em>This provision requires that the court provide “second-strike offenders” with a warning of the consequences of a third strike, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years of total confinement. The Majority’s construction of Section 9714(a)(1) requires a trial court to impose multiple mandatory minimum sentences, outside of the trial court’s discretion and therefore without explanation or justification tied to specific circumstances, which, if imposed consecutively, would exceed the sentence applicable to a third-strike offender, whenever a district attorney has charged, and the defendant has been convicted, of multiple overlapping crimes of violence arising in a single criminal episode. Having interpreted Section 9714(a)(2) to require a single sentence enhancement per criminal episode, and having noted specific statutory language in support of that interpretation, I am not persuaded that we should interpret these sections differently. The recidivist philosophy that animated <em>McClintic </em>was held to permit one enhancement per criminal episode; a result that should apply equally to second as well as third-strike offenders.</p>

      <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>I acknowledge that Appellee’s criminal episode included horrific crimes and that the trial court herein, which imposed consecutive minimum terms for each of Appellee’s crimes of violence committed during the 2002 criminal episode, explained in its opinion that the sentence was within the statutory maximum and that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the enhancements in Section 9714(a)(1). Applying a single mandatory sentence enhancement to all crimes of violence committed in the single incident would maintain the recidivist philosophy we have consistently applied when interpreting the sentence enhancements contained in the recidivist sentencing statute while continuing to permit the trial court, within its discretion, to impose the precise sentence Appellee received. I would have no objection to that given the underlying facts.</p>
