        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from a Superior Court Order vacating appellee\u2019s judgment of sentence for theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, criminal conspiracy, and corruption of minors, and remanding for a new trial. The Superior Court panel concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the probative value of appellee\u2019s prior crime of dishonesty (crimen falsi) substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. For the following reasons, we reverse the order below and remand for the Superior Court to consider appellee\u2019s remaining claim regarding appellee\u2019s proposed alibi testimony.\nI.\nOn April 20, 2012, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint against appellee alleging that on April 4, 2012, appellee and two co-conspirators, Barry Martell and D.M., a juvenile, stole parts and equipment from RES Coal Company in Goshen Township, Clearfield County, and later sold the stolen parts to a local salvage yard. On October 4, 2012, appellee filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the Commonwealth from impeaching him with evidence of his 1998 crimen falsi conviction which resulted from appellee\u2019s guilty plea, at twenty-two years of age, to a single third-degree felony count of receiving stolen property. Acknowledging the specific list of five factors reiterated by this Court in Commonwealth v. Randall, 515 Pa. 410, 528 A.2d 1826 (1987), to be considered in determining whether remote crimen falsi adjudications \u2014 i.e., those that are more than ten years old \u2014 are admissible as more probative than prejudicial, the trial court found that the balance of those factors weighed in favor of admitting appellee\u2019s single crimen falsi conviction for impeachment purposes. Specifically, the trial court considered:\n(1) the degree to which the commission of the prior offense reflects upon the veracity of the defendant-witness; (2) the likelihood, in view of the nature and extent of the prior record, that it would have a greater tendency to smear the character of the defendant and suggest a propensity to commit the crime for which he stands charged, rather than provide a legitimate reason for discrediting him as an untruthful person; [ (]3) the age and circumstances of the defendant; [ (]4) the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case and the prosecution\u2019s need to resort to this evidence as compared with the availability to the defense of other witnesses through which its version of the events surrounding the incident can be presented; and [ (]5) the existence of alternative means of attacking the defendant\u2019s credibility.\nId. at 1328 (quoting Commonwealth v. Roots, 482 Pa. 33, 393 A.2d 364, 367 (1978), abrogated in part as stated in Commonwealth v. Rivera, 603 Pa. 340, 983 A.2d 1211 (2009)). The trial court determined that factors one, three, four, and five weighed in favor of the Commonwealth, enhancing the probative value of appellee\u2019s crimen falsi conviction, while only the second factor weighed in appellee\u2019s favor, increasing the potential improper prejudicial impact of appellee\u2019s prior conviction. With this analysis, the trial court denied appellee\u2019s motion in limine.\nAt trial, D.M., testifying for the Commonwealth, stated that appellee was involved in the theft and that D.M., Martell and appellee had all agreed to steal the items and sell them for cash. Appellee then took the stand in his own defense in support of a claim of total innocence, stating that he was unaware of the theft, and that Martell and D.M. stole the items without his knowledge or participation. At the close of his testimony, and in the presence of the jury, the prosecutor asked the trial court to take judicial notice of appellee\u2019s prior crimen falsi conviction. N.T., 10/22/12, at 201.\nThereafter, the parties proceeded immediately to closing arguments. Appellee\u2019s counsel did not address appellee\u2019s prior crimen falsi conviction during his closing, but instead, counsel vigorously attacked D.M.\u2019s credibility, employing no unusual points of impeachment. Thus, counsel argued that D.M. was not telling the truth, that his testimony was from a corrupt and polluted source, and that it should be received with great caution because D.M. had an interest in the outcome of the case, having admitted to being a thief and being involved in the crime at issue. Id. at 206, 210. In a similar attempt to persuade the jury not to accept appellee\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor made use of appellee\u2019s prior conviction in his closing argument as follows:\nI argue to you that, you know, who\u2019s telling the truth and who\u2019s being factually correct and honest with you people is an issue for [you to] decide, but after the [Commonwealth \u2014 or, after the defendant testified, the [Commonwealth introduced a prior conviction of the defendant for a crime called receiving stolen property.\nAnd I offered that, or am allowed to offer that, to you because receiving stolen property\u2019s called a crimen falsi, a crime of dishonesty. So I don\u2019t say, hey, the defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property in the past; therefore, he must have done it this time. I say to you that the defendant was convicted in the past of a crime of dishonesty so, therefore, you can consider that when you decide who\u2019s telling the truth, who\u2019s being honest or dishonest.\nId. at 232. Appellee lodged no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument.\nImmediately following closing arguments, the court issued its jury instructions, which included its instruction regarding the treatment of appellee\u2019s prior crimen falsi conviction. The court stated:\nNow, there was evidence here tending to show that the defendant has a prior criminal conviction. And I\u2019m talking about the record introduced by the [C]ommonwealth as to his prior conviction of receiving stolen property, all right.\nNote that this evidence about that prior conviction from 1998 is not evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. You must not infer guilt from the evidence of that prior conviction. This evidence may be considered by you for one purpose only. That is, to help you judge the credibility and weight of the testimony given by the defendant as a witness in this trial.\nSo in considering the evidence of that prior conviction, you may consider the type of crime committed and how long ago it was committed, and how it may affect the likelihood that the defendant has testified truthfully in this case.\nId. at 246-47. Neither party objected to this instruction.\nFollowing trial, the jury found appellee guilty of theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, criminal conspiracy and corruption of minors. The trial court later sentenced appellee to an aggregate term of twenty-one to sixty months of imprisonment, and appellee appealed to the Superior Court.\nOn appeal, appellee raised two evidentiary issues: he claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting his prior crimen falsi conviction, and in prohibiting the testimony of appellee\u2019s alibi witness. Addressing the crimen falsi issue, the Superior Court panel, in an unpublished decision, reweighed the five factors addressed in Randall, and vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for a new trial. Given its disposition, the panel did not reach the issue of appellee\u2019s alibi witness. On the Randall question, the panel agreed with the trial court that factors one, four and five weighed in favor of the Commonwealth, i.e., in favor of admissibility, but took issue with the trial court\u2019s weighing of factors two and three. Regarding the third factor \u2014 the defendant\u2019s age and circumstances \u2014 the panel found that commission of a crimen falsi at the age of twenty-two could not be held against appellee, and therefore this factor was neutral, instead of weighing in favor of the Commonwealth as the trial court had concluded. And finally, with respect to the second factor \u2014 the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s record having a greater tendency to prejudice the defendant by showing a criminal propensity rather than to discredit \u2014 the panel disagreed that this factor merely weighed in favor of appellee, but insisted instead that it weighed heavily in appellee\u2019s favor, indeed to the extent of \u201cextreme prejudice.\u201d Super. Ct. Op. at 14. Based on the panel\u2019s disagreement with the trial court regarding these two out of the five relevant factors, the panel concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of appellee\u2019s prior crimen falsi conviction. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nII.\nIn support of the trial court\u2019s discretionary evidentiary ruling, the Commonwealth argues that the admission of appellee\u2019s prior conviction was proper according to the relevant five-factor analysis set forth by this Court in Randall. The Commonwealth contends that the sole purpose of admitting the prior conviction was to impeach appellee\u2019s credibility since he took the stand as a witness in his own defense, and his testimony, claiming non-involvement, was the only direct evidence of such non-involvement, and the testimony of the lone eyewitness presented by the Commonwealth directly contradicted appellee\u2019s account. While the parties and the lower courts agree that the first Randall factor \u2014 the degree to which the prior conviction reflects on veracity \u2014 favors admissibility since the prior offense was crimen falsi in nature, the Commonwealth argues that the second factor \u2014 the likelihood of a greater tendency that the criminal record will prejudice the defendant by showing criminal propensity \u2014 should not weigh as heavily as the Superior Court panel weighed it in favor of appellee. The Commonwealth does not contest that there was a potential for prejudice to appellee, but maintains that the test is whether the prejudice is outweighed by probative value, and in the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the remaining factors reveal the probative value of the prior offense in the instant matter.\nMoreover, the Commonwealth insists that the likelihood of improper prejudice was low in this case because the prosecutor\u2019s references to the prior offense were few and brief, and because the prosecutor specifically argued to the jury that the crime was relevant only to assess appellee\u2019s truthfulness on the stand, and not to show his criminal propensity. The Commonwealth further notes that the single prior offense at issue would have less of a tendency to cause an unfair prejudicial effect than was present in several other Pennsylvania reported decisions where multiple prior offenses were deemed admissible for purposes of impeachment, despite the potential to suggest criminal propensity. See, e.g., Rivera, 983 A.2d at 1228 (\u201cwe conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in determining that Appellant\u2019s [five] previous crimen falsi adjudications were more probative than prejudicial.\u201d).\nFurther addressing the third factor, the Commonwealth argues that a twenty-two-year old individual should be regarded as responsible and accountable for his actions, and that appellee\u2019s age at the time of his prior crime should not be regarded as lowering the probative value of the evidence in this case, but should actually weigh in favor of admissibility. In support of this argument, the Commonwealth again cites Rivera, where this Court concluded that the trial court acted within its discretion in determining that juvenile adjudications involving crimen falsi were more probative than prejudicial. And, with regard to factors four (strength of case) and five (existence of alternate means of impeachment), the Commonwealth explains that this case came down to a credibility determination between appellee and the Commonwealth\u2019s chief witness \u2014 two accused criminal confederates \u2014 who had starkly different versions of the events, and therefore appellee\u2019s prior conviction was essential to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Along these lines, the Commonwealth notes that there was no other direct impeachment evidence available to the government. Thus, the Commonwealth maintains that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce, and then make reference to, the single prior crimen falsi for impeachment purposes only.\nIn response, rather than make a specific argument as to how the trial court might have abused its discretion, appellee insists that:\n[T]he only issue before this Honorable Court is whether the probative value of [appellee\u2019s] 1998 Receiving Stolen Property conviction substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect after [appellee] testified he did not steal, did not receive stolen property and did not conspire with others to steal property.\nAppellee\u2019s Brief at 4. According to this framing of the issue before this Court, the bulk of appellee\u2019s argument concerns the proper weighing of the prejudicial effect and probative value of his prior crimen falsi conviction. Appellee thus focuses his attention on the second factor of the five-factor analysis \u2014 the likelihood of a greater tendency of the defendant\u2019s criminal record to smear him by showing his criminal propensity. Appellee then attempts to support the panel\u2019s reweighing of this factor by looking primarily to caselaw from outside of this Commonwealth and other Superior Court precedent to make the point that evidence of a prior conviction for the very same crime for which a defendant is being tried contains an inherent suggestion of criminal propensity. Appellee maintains that since the evidence against him was not overwhelming, the admission of the prior offense in this instance was particularly damaging and prejudicial. Appellee concedes that the credibility determination was the central issue at trial. Nonetheless, appellee discounts precedent relied upon by the trial court for the proposition that the need to introduce evidence of prior crimen falsi convictions is high where the jury must decide whether to believe a single Commonwealth witness or a single defense witness in order to reach a verdict. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 8 (citing Commonwealth v. Palo, 24 A.3d 1050 (Pa.Super.2011)).\nAppellee makes no attempt to support the panel\u2019s holding regarding the third factor, ie., that a crime by a twenty-two year old ought not to be used against him thereafter because of his age. Notwithstanding, appellee insists that the Superi- or Court\u2019s ruling should be affirmed because the probative value of his prior crimen falsi conviction did not substantially outweigh its potential prejudicial effect.\nIII.\nWe hold that the Superior Court panel\u2019s decision cannot stand, because the panel paid insufficient deference to the discretionary decision of the trial court, and is not otherwise supported by Pennsylvania law. \u201cWhen reviewing the denial of a motion in limine, this Court applies an evidentiary abuse of discretion standard of review.... It is well-established that the admissibility of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court, and such rulings will not form the basis for appellate relief absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Rivera, 983 A.2d at 1228 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Superior Court may reverse an evidentiary ruling only upon a showing that the trial court abused that discretion. Commonwealth v. Laird, 605 Pa. 137, 988 A.2d 618, 636 (2010). A determination that a trial court abused its discretion in making an evidentiary ruling \u201cmay not be made \u2018merely because an appellate court might have reached a different conclusion, but requires a result of manifest unreasonableness, or partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will, or such lack of support so as to be clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Commonwealth v. Sherwood, 603 Pa. 92, 982 A.2d 483, 495 (2009)). Further, discretion is abused when the law is either overridden or misapplied. Commonwealth v. Randolph, 582 Pa. 576, 873 A.2d 1277, 1281 (2005).\nOur review of the Superior Court\u2019s assessment of the trial court\u2019s discretionary decision, of course, is not deferential, but plenary and de novo. This Court is in the same position as the Superior Court when reviewing discretionary trial level determinations. Moreover, we are mindful that the question is not how we might have balanced the Randall factors had we been presiding over the trial. The question is whether the trial court\u2019s balancing fell within its discretionary authority.\nHere, the Superior Court panel recognized that the trial court correctly identified and considered the governing substantive law: the Randall line of cases setting forth the requisite factors governing the admission of remote crimen falsi convictions. Nor did the panel, or appellee for that matter, suggest that the trial court\u2019s judgment was manifestly unreasonable, the product of partiality, prejudice or ill-will, clearly erroneous, or represented a misapplication, or overriding of, Pennsylvania law. Rather, in overturning the trial court, the panel appears to have reweighed the probative value of appellee\u2019s prior crimen falsi offense and its potential prejudicial effect by reapplying the requisite five-factor analysis on its own assessment, and then determined that the trial court abused its discretion because the panel, analyzing a cold record, reached a different conclusion. The panel\u2019s approach and determination cannot stand.\nThe difference between the trial court\u2019s analysis and that of the Superior Court fundamentally is not a matter of legal error on the part of the trial court, but a reflection of differences in judgment in weighing and reweighing the same identified factors, yet reaching different conclusions. On the record here, where the trial court considered all factors in light of the case that unfolded before it, and where measures were taken, both by the trial court and the prosecutor, to ensure that the crimen falsi evidence was not misunderstood or misused, it cannot be said that the trial court\u2019s decision suffers from such a lack of support that it is clearly erroneous. This is particularly so where there is no real dispute that of the five enumerated considerations in Randall, only one, a factor which was addressed and weighed by the trial court, has been argued to counsel against the trial court\u2019s discretionary decision. At least three of the remaining four factors counsel in support of the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling.\nBut, it is not a matter of merely counting up factors. The vesting of discretion allows for flexibility in balancing factors, according to the circumstances. Thus, for example, there is certainly some force in appellee\u2019s argument that, when the prior crime involves the same basic offense currently being tried, there is a greater likelihood that a juror might lapse into viewing the prior crime as indicating a propensity for that particular type of crime. But, on the other hand, here, there was but one prior offense; obviously, the greater the number of prior crimen falsi convictions, the greater the danger of assuming propensity. And, the trial court took specific measures to deter the jury from considering the crimen falsi as establishing propensity. Appellee\u2019s argument that admission of his crimen falsi could have been particularly harmful because the case came down to the credibility of two witnesses and the evidence thus was not overwhelming misses the complexity of the trial court\u2019s discretionary task. If the crimen falsi undermined appellee\u2019s case because the jury used it as a basis to discredit his testimony \u2014 which is how the evidence was posed to the jury by both the prosecutor and the judge \u2014 that was a proper use, properly \u201cprejudicial\u201d to appellee\u2019s case, and not a basis for exclusion. Moreover, in understanding the totality of the circumstances affecting the trial court\u2019s decision, it should be remembered that the Commonwealth\u2019s prime witness was subject to impeachment as well, on multiple grounds, which obviously increases the importance, to the Commonwealth, of a similarly well-established form of impeachment. The point, we reiterate, is not how an appellate court might balance all of these factors, but rather, whether the trial court\u2019s balancing so departs from what is reasonable that it can be set aside.\nBeyond the panel\u2019s failure to observe the jurisprudential limitations of the abuse of discretion standard of review, the Superior Court approach and decision are inconsistent with Pennsylvania law. Evidence to impeach the credibility of a witness is admissible so long as it is relevant to that purpose and not otherwise barred. Pa.R.E. 607(b). Under settled law, evidence that a witness has been convicted of crimen falsi is generally admissible, unless the conviction (or release from confinement, whichever is later) is more than ten years old. Pa.R.E. 609(a), (b). It is only when the crimen falsi conviction is more than ten years old, as it is here, that evidence of the conviction becomes conditioned on the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighing its potential prejudicial effect. Pa.R.E. 609(b)(1). The five Randall factors then guide that discretionary determination.\nHere, the trial court concluded that evidence of appellee\u2019s prior crime was admissible because, although the prior conviction might suggest criminal propensity to the jury, each of the other relevant factors weighed in favor of the Commonwealth. The court found that the prior conviction reflected on appellee\u2019s veracity and that appellee was old enough at the time of the conviction to have appreciated the consequences of his actions. Further, the court found that the Commonwealth\u2019s case relied on D.M.\u2019s testimony of the events, which conflicted with appellee\u2019s account. Therefore, the court concluded, the Commonwealth\u2019s need to use the prior conviction as impeachment evidence was high because alternative means of attacking appellee\u2019s veracity were minimal. As noted, the court instructed the jury to limit its consideration of appellee\u2019s prior crimen falsi offense to the sole purpose of assessing the credibility and weight of his testimony, and the Commonwealth specifically argued that the evidence was offered only to impeach appellee\u2019s credibility.\nThe Superior Court panel agreed that the conviction reflected upon appellee\u2019s veracity and that the Commonwealth needed the evidence to attack appellee\u2019s credibility. Nevertheless, the panel disagreed, apparently as a matter of law, with the weight that the trial court afforded to appellee\u2019s age at the time of the prior conviction and the weight afforded to the similarity between the prior and instant crimes in determining prejudice, again apparently as a matter of law. Notably, the panel cited former Chief Justice Nix\u2019s dissenting opinion in Randall when it stated, without underlying support, that \u201cthe probative value of a conviction when an individual is in his early twenties is small\u201d and, as a result, held that its value in the five-factor analysis was \u201cneutral and neither weighted] in favor nor against introduction of the prior conviction.\u201d Super. Ct. Op. at 10-11 (citing Randall, 528 A.2d at 1331 (Nix, C.J., dissenting); United States v. Norton, 26 F.3d 240, 244-45 (1st Cir.1994); and United States v. Williams Ogletree, No. 11 CR 203-3, 2013 WL 66207, at *7 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 4, 2013)). Additionally, the panel held that the trial court \u201cunderstated\u201d the \u201cextreme\u201d prejudicial effect of appellee\u2019s single 1998 conviction in light of the similarities with the charges that appellee was facing. According to the panel, \u201c[i]t [wa]s hard to imagine how the jury would not have inferred that [appellee] had a propensity to commit the instant offenses because of his prior conviction.\u201d Super. Ct. Op. at 14. So then, because, in the panel\u2019s view, this \u201cextreme\u201d prejudicial effect outweighed the probative value of the prior crimen falsi, the panel concluded that its admission was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\nThe panel\u2019s idiosyncratic approach is not supported by Pennsylvania law. The prejudicial effect of a prior conviction is not assessed in a vacuum; an appellate court should not only consider the purpose for which the evidence is introduced, but the actual use made of the evidence and also the jury instructions that accompany the admission of evidence. See Commonwealth v. LaCava, 542 Pa. 160, 666 A.2d 221, 229 (1995). Here, the jury was specifically instructed that the prior conviction was not evidence of appellee\u2019s guilt and that the jury was required to consider it for the limited purpose of judging the credibility and weight of the testimony given by appellee as a witness in this trial. There is no reason to believe that the jury did not follow the trial court\u2019s instruction. See id. at 228 (jury presumed to follow trial court\u2019s instruction regarding limited purpose of evidence).\nFurthermore, the panel appears to have created a new standard for admitting evidence of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes with respect to the youth of the defendant, which is at odds with the controlling rule of evidence. Under Evidence Rule 609(d), in a criminal case, even evidence of an adjudication of juvenile delinquency \u201cmay be used to impeach the credibility of a witness if conviction of the offense would be admissible to attack the credibility of an adult.\u201d Consistently, there is no support in Pennsylvania law for the proposition that the probative value of a young adult offender\u2019s conviction \u201cis small.\u201d Indeed, former Chief Justice Nix did not comment about the intrinsic probative value of a youthful conviction in his Randall dissent, but rather, what he believed was the arbitrary nature of the Randall majority\u2019s per se rule of admissibility with a 10-year cutoff; the dissent\u2019s examples spoke about the relevance of the prior conviction in several different scenarios. 528 A.2d at 1330-31. The remaining cases cited by the Superior Court panel are from other jurisdictions, as the Commonwealth accurately notes. The Superior Court\u2019s decision on this point appears to reflect \u2014 and to greatly expand upon \u2014 the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent focus on youth as an element diminishing culpability in criminal matters. See, e.g., Miller v. Alabama, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012) (Eighth Amendment prohibits mandatory sentence of life without parole for juvenile murderers); and Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010) (Eighth Amendment prohibits sentence of life without possibility of parole for juvenile convicted of non-homicide offense).\nThis appeal, however, poses a non-constitutional issue involving settled principles of Pennsylvania evidentiary law, and a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion under those principles. There was no need, or warrant, for the Superior Court to seek to innovate a novel standard for admitting a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, particularly one based on federal sources, since the applicable Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence and the corresponding federal rule, F.R.E. Rule 609, are quite distinct. Thus, while subsection (d)(2) of the corresponding federal rule limits the admissibility of juvenile adjudications to those of witnesses other than the defendant, subsection (d) of the Pennsylvania rule, as stated, contains no such limitation, but specifically allows the use of juvenile adjudications for impeachment purposes. Thus under Pennsylvania law, prior adult convictions of crimes of dishonesty remain fair game for impeachment in appropriate circumstances.\nThe Superior Court\u2019s decision is reversed and the case is remanded to that court to decide appellee\u2019s remaining evidentiary issue. Jurisdiction is relinquished.\nJustice McCAFFERY did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice EAKIN and BAER, TODD, and STEVENS join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3921(a), 3925(a), 903(a)(1), and 6301(a)(l)(i), respectively.\n. There is no issue before the Court respecting the manner by which the prior conviction was introduced.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent.\nEvidentiary rule 609(b) requires exclusion of a prior stale crimen falsi conviction unless the conviction\u2019s \u201cprobative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect[.]\u201d Pa.R.E. 609(b)(1) (emphasis added). This balancing test is a loose encapsulation of factors that were originally mentioned in Commonwealth v. Roots, 482 Pa. 33, 393 A.2d 364 (1978), and repeated in Commonwealth v. Randall, 515 Pa. 410, 528 A.2d 1326 (1987). The rule\u2019s commentary indicates that 609(b) \u201cbasically tracks what was said\u201d in Randall. Id., Official Cmt. Still, the text obviously predominates over any associated commentary as well as the decisional law purportedly incorporated by the commentary. Accord Mitchell Partners, L.P. v. Irex Corp., 617 Pa. 423, 435-36, 53 A.3d 39, 46-47 (2012) (applying a similar approach to statutory text). Thus, I believe that courts should focus primarily on the text of Rule 609(b)(1).\nAs I read the rule, it chiefly implicates the second Randall factor. That factor balances the potential for the evidence to \u201csmear the character of the defendant and suggest a propensity\u201d to commit the crime, against its tendency to \u201cprovide a legitimate reason for discrediting\u201d the witness. Randall, 515 Pa. at 413, 528 A.2d at 1328. To my mind, these are essentially the same as \u201cprobative value\u201d and \u201cprejudicial effect,\u201d albeit the latter are more concisely phrased. In this regard, the Commonwealth\u2019s only valid use of a prior conviction in this context is to suggest the defendant\u2019s untruthfulness as a witness, see Roots, 482 Pa. at 37, 393 A.2d at 366, and hence, it is only in this manner that the conviction can properly be deemed probative. See Commonwealth v. Bighum, 452 Pa. 554, 566, 307 A.2d 255, 262 (1973). As such, notwithstanding the commentary, Rule 609(b)(1) principally carries forward the second of the five Randall factors.\nI make this observation because it seems to me \u2014 and the present case illustrates the point \u2014 that use of the five factors as a framework for disposition has begun to overshadow the rule\u2019s actual meaning and intent. A review of earlier cases which contributed to the formulation of Rule 609(b) reveals that the Court was not satisfied simply to give wide discretion to trial courts to use an open-ended, multi-factored balancing test subject to extremely deferential review. Rather, the rule had its origin in cases, such as Bighum, which were mainly concerned with closely channeling the common pleas courts\u2019 exercise of discretion in view of the danger that a defendant might be unfairly prejudiced by prior bad-acts evidence. Big-hum observed that, \u201c[w]here the defendant has no other means by which to defend himself, it would be particularly unjust to subject him to the introduction of prior convictions.\u201d Bighum, 452 Pa. at 567, 307 A.2d at 263.\nWithin this context, factors other than the second one, such as the age and circumstances of the defendant or the existence of alternative means of attacking the defendant\u2019s credibility, were more peripheral than central, as they served to guide the ultimate determination of whether the probative value did, in fact, significantly outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice. Accord Roots, 482 Pa. at 39, 393 A.2d at 367 (summarizing Bighum as representing an effort \u201cto limit the admission of this type of evidence to situations where its introduction was of essential evidentiary value to the prosecution and not unreasonably unfair to the defense\u201d); see also Bighum, 452 Pa. at 565 n. 7, 307 A.2d at 262 n. 7 (\u201cThe vortex of the storm of disagreement seems to focus upon the balance between the probative value of this type of evidence as it bears on the credibility of the defendant as a witness as opposed to the prejudicial effect that such evidence has upon the jury.\u201d (citing Note, Other Crimes Evidence At Trial: Of Balancing And Other Matters, 70 Yale L.J. 763 (1961))). Additionally, the Court was viewing the admission of stale other bad-acts evidence with great circumspection. See, e.g., Roots, 482 Pa. at 41, 393 A.2d at 368 (suggesting that this type of evidence has a \u201chighly inflammatory potential\u201d); Bighum, 452 Pa. at 566, 307 A.2d at 262 (recognizing \u201cthe tendency of a normal juror to accept testimony of prior convictions as a basis for finding a predisposition to commit the crime charged\u201d).\nIn this arena, excessive deference to common pleas courts can be harmful, as it tends to undermine the rationale and purport of the earlier cases and restrict the provision of meaningful guidance to such tribunals. Such an approach, then, is in substantial tension with the underlying philosophy and concerns as expressed in the earlier cases, as well as with Rule 609(b)\u2019s goal of providing an essential check on the introduction of prior-crimes proofs which do not bear directly upon the question of guilt or innocence. Accordingly, I believe that Pennsylvania courts should recognize that Rule 609(b)(1), by its terms and for valid reasons, is restrictive in nature.\nIn determining whether probative value substantially outweighs prejudicial effect, it should be noted, first, that the danger of unfair prejudice can be significant, particularly in a situation where the defendant\u2019s only means of defending himself is to testify. See Bighum, 452 Pa. at 567, 307 A.2d at 263; Commonwealth v. Spruill, 480 Pa. 601, 606, 391 A.2d 1048, 1050-51 (1978) (\u201cEvidence of prior criminal activity ... is probably only equaled by a confession in its prejudicial impact upon a jury. Thus, ... courts should be ever vigilant to prevent the introduction of this type of evidence under the guise that it is being offered to serve some purpose other than to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the charged crime.\u201d (emphasis removed)). On the other hand, while any crimen falsi conviction undoubtedly has some probative value, that value is somewhat diminished in the Rule 609(b) category of cases, since by definition the category only includes stale convictions \u2014 meaning they are more than ten years old. Where, as here, there is only one stale prior offense, it cannot demonstrate a pattern of dishonesty. Hence, in such a circumstance the probative value is diminished even further.\nThe trial court recognized that the probative value did not outweigh, let alone substantially outweigh, the prejudicial effect. Indeed, the court recognized that the second Randall factor \u2014 again, the primary one for Rule 609(b)(1) purposes\u2014 weighed in Appellee\u2019s favor, and particularly so because the identity of the prior crime with the offense charged would have the effect of suggesting criminal propensity, which is forbidden. See Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1); Commonwealth v. Hairston, 624 Pa. 143, 157, 84 A.3d 657, 665 (2014) (citing Commonwealth v. Lark, 518 Pa. 290, 543 A.2d 491 (1988)). Other courts have also considered the enhanced potential for prejudice when the prior crime is the same as the present one. In United States v. Sanders, 964 F.2d 295 (4th Cir.1992), the federal appellate court explained:\nAdmission of evidence of a similar offense often does little to impeach the credibility of a testifying defendant while undoubtedly prejudicing him. The jury, despite limiting instructions, can hardly avoid drawing the inference that the past conviction suggests some probability that [the] defendant committed the similar offense for which he is currently-charged. The generally accepted view, therefore, is that evidence of similar offenses for impeachment purposes under [Federal] Rule 609 should be admitted sparingly if at all.\nId. at 297-98 (quoting United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 418-19 (4th Cir.1981)) (emphasis added); accord State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 525 S.E.2d 246, 249 (2000); State v. Redmond, 803 N.W.2d 112, 124 (Iowa 2011) (\u201c[0]ur case law has continually cautioned against admitting prior convictions which are similar to the defendant\u2019s current charge for fear the jury will assume the defendant\u2019s guilt by inferring the defendant acted in conformity with his past conduct.\u201d).\nAs noted, the trial court here recognized this same possibility, and on that basis, ruled that the second Randall factor weighed in Appellee\u2019s favor. See supra note 2. Yet the court ultimately determined, based on other Randall factors, that the prior conviction was admissible. See Hoover, No. CP-17CR-451-2012, slip op. at 7. Thus, the court rested its decision on the premise that, under Rule 609(b)(1), all five Randall factors stand on essentially the same footing. I would find this to constitute a misapplication of the governing law \u2014 again, the actual text of Rule 609(b)(1) \u2014 and thus, an abuse of discretion. See Commonwealth v. Wright, 621 Pa. 446, 462, 78 A.3d 1070, 1080 (2013) (recognizing that a misapplication of the law amounts to an abuse of discretion); Majority Opinion, at 610-11, 107 A.3d at 729 (same).\nAccordingly, I would affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order awarding a new trial, and to the degree the intermediate court\u2019s decision reflects an emphasis upon the weighing process, I support its efforts to provide guidance to the common pleas courts consistent with earlier prevailing decisions of this Court.\n. In Commonwealth v. Rivera, 603 Pa. 340, 983 A.2d 1211 (Pa.2009), by contrast, there were five prior crimen falsi offenses. Moreover, all such prior offenses were of a vastly different nature than the offense for which the defendant was on trial. See id. at 368, 983 A.2d at 1229. In terms of assessing prejudice, the importance of the present identity of the prior offense with the offense charged is discussed below.\n. The trial court explained that, because Appellee was \"charged with the same crime as his past conviction,\u201d the admission of his prior conviction \"is more likely to suggest criminal propensity.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hoover, No. CP-17-CR-451-2012, slip op. at 5 (C.P. Clearfield March 21, 2013). In a similar vein, the Superior Court expressed that the prejudice\nwas extreme as the prior conviction entered into evidence was for the same offense with which Appellant was presently charged and was substantially similar to the other four charges. It is hard to imagine how the jury would not have inferred that Appellant had a propensity to commit the instant offenses because of his prior conviction. Although there was some probative value in the introduction of the prior conviction, it does not substantially outweigh the prejudice of its introduction.\nCommonwealth v. Hoover, No. 55 WDA 2013, slip op. at 14, 93 A.3d 510 (Pa.Super.2013).",
