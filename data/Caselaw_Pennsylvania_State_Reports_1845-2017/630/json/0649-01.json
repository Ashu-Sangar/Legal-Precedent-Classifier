        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 21st day of January, 2015, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED. The issues, as stated by Petitioners, are:\n(1) When this Court held in Everhart v. PMA Insurance Co., 595 Pa. 172, 938 A.2d 301 (2007), that a waiver is not required for a commercial insured to reject stacked uninsured and underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage, did the Superior Court, as a matter of first impression, commit legal error by requiring a waiver for a commercial insured to reject non-stacked UM/UIM insurance when interpreting a nearly identical provision of the same statute (the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law)?\n(2) Did Judge Panella correctly find in his dissent that the trial court\u2019s unquestionably erroneous jury instruction, that a signed waiver form is required for a commercial insured to reject stacked UM/UIM coverage, impermissibly disregarded Everhart and unfairly allowed the jury to base liability on conduct regarding a waiver form that was not required for rejection of stacked coverage?\n(3) Did the Superior Court dilute the burden of proof for punitive damages contrary to hornbook law, by holding that a plaintiff need not demonstrate more than an intentional tort to submit the question of punitive damages to the jury?",
