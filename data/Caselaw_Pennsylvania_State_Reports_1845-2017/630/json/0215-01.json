The issues are:\n(1) Where Section 708(c) of the Right-[t]o-Know Law specifically provides that a \u201cfinancial record\u201d is not exempt from disclosure on the basis that it contains a \u201ctrade secret\u201d or \u201cconfidential proprietary information,\u201d is this explicit provision nullified by the earlier-enacted Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act?\n(2) When public funds are funneled through middlemen before reaching their intended beneficiaries, are the records documenting this flow of public funds \u201cfinancial records\u201d required to be disclosed under the current version of the Right-[t]o-Know Law, as they were under the prior version of the law?\n(3) Are historical rates paid by Medicaid managed-care organizations (MCOs) \u201cconfidential proprietary information\u201d and \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d when the rates from one year do not reveal the rates for future years, and when most of the MCOs have already disclosed such rates to a subcontractor who negotiates rates with their competitors?\nThe Prothonotary shall establish parallel briefing tracks for this case and Dental Benefit Providers, Inc. v. Eiseman, No. 132-34 EAL 2014, and the two cases, though not consolidated, shall be listed for argument at the same Court session.",
