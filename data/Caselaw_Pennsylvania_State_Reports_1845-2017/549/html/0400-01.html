In <em>Chambers </em>we held that any reliance by the prosecution upon religious writings to support the imposition of the death penalty is reversible error. In both cases, the problem was that the prosecutor made reference to considerations outside the death penalty statute to argue for imposition of the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[232,1020,1161,1078]]]'>Recognizing that no defendant is entitled to a perfect trial, but all defendants are entitled to a fair trial, our inquiry when considering prosecutorial closing arguments must be whether the remark in question jeopardized the fairness to which the defendant is entitled. Here, the remarks crossed the line. The prosecutor invited the jury to sentence this defendant to death in order to compensate for the alleged evils perpetrated by stereotypical liberal judges who routinely allow criminals to go free. The implicit argument is that if the jury does not take control of the case by imposing the death penalty, the liberal judges will intervene and somehow release the defendant. A second implicit argument is that imposing the death penalty in this case is a way to set the balance straight by compensating for the harm that has been done by the stereotypical liberal judges. Clearly such injustices, be they real or imagined, have nothing to do with this case, and the linking of a death sentence in this case with a perceived failing of the criminal justice system, dehors the record, was calculated to inflame the jury and might well have done so, thus constituting reversible error.</p>

The evidence at trial established that on August 29, 1982 at approximately 11:45 p.m., Eddie Colon led the victim to the basement of a house on North Orianna Street in Philadelphia where appellant, the co-defendant, and a friend of appellant were waiting. Appellant initially beat the victim because he believed that the victim was a snitch and that the victim owed him money for drugs. Appellant then took a knife and repeatedly stabbed the victim. When the victim attempted to escape, appellant’s co-defendant grabbed the victims's hair and stabbed the victim in the back. After the victim’s body was disposed of in an old church, appellant ordered everyone present at the house to clean up the blood. An autopsy showed that the victim was stabbed twelve (12) times in the back and eight (8) times in the chest. A more detailed account surrounding appellant's conviction is set forth in this Court's opinion affirming appellant's judgment of sentence of death on direct appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Thus, the jury was presented with evidence that would have allowed it to consider appellant's age as a mitigating circumstance. Moreover, this Court has already found that appellant made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to present mitigating evidence.

If the prosecutor’s reference to liberal judges was viewed in a vacuum, I may agree with the majority’s holding on this issue. However, when evaluating whether a prosecutor’s comments were improper, we must look at the context in which they were made. <em>Commonwealth v.

Also, the prosecutor emphasized that it was the jury’s duty to exercise that power in accordance with the law. The prosecutor’s comment about “liberal judges” does not alter the message being conveyed by the prosecutor that the jury must follow the law when rendering its decision on appellant’s sentence.
