The Commission found Bowman presented sufficient evidence that he was better qualified than Gibson and was discriminated against on the basis of non-merit factors, i.e., the selection of a female. They found that Bowman had “spent nearly nine years at [Ricketts Glen], a significantly more geographically demanding park with more exposure to the camping public than the park in which [Gibson] spent her time.” Commission Opinion at p. 6.

I agree, however, that the Commonwealth Court erred by reversing the Commission. Just because the Commonwealth Court had found a single factor—additional enforcement experience—which weighed in Gibson’s favor, it was incorrect to hold that the Commission’s decision was not based on substantial evidence. <em>See Bethenergy Mines, </em><a href="/pa/531/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="531 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1834345" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0287-01">531 Pa. at 293</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="531 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1834345" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0287-01">612 A.2d at 437</a> (the fact that contrary evidence exists does not mean that an administrative adjudication is not based on substantial evidence).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

An agency opinion needs to contain sufficiently detailed findings of fact, together with a coherent legal discussion, so that the Commonwealth Court can perform a meaningful review. Any less would frustrate the legislative intent, in addition to providing agency panels with a means of nullifying the effect of legislation, because it would enable an agency to shield its decisions from review by drafting opinions in generalized and conclusory terms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

In particular, the Commission determined that Bowman should prevail because his experience in a larger park made him the more qualified candidate. The adjudication does not explain why that experience makes a significant difference. The agency’s rationale merely recites broad, generalized phrases like “experience at a larger park” and “dealing with the public”, which provide too little information for the reviewing court to do its job.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

It can only determine whether Bowman’s large park experience (or Gibson’s enforcement experience) is substantial by reading the transcript, finding more information and deciding how much weight to give to particular experiences and training. Given its conclusion that there was adequate evidentiary support for the Commission’s conclusion, it seems that the majority did this.</p>

The agency adjudication needs to make sense standing alone. Thus, while the reviewing court must still review the record for substantial evidence, the court should do so to verify that the evidence is there: it should be evident from the adjudication why particular evidence is significant. That is not the case here. Therefore I believe that the only appropriate disposition we can make in this case is to remand it to the Civil Service Commission.</p>

The Commonwealth Court also erred in stating that Bowman had presented no evidence that Gibson's enforcement experience did not make her the better candidate. Bowman presented evidence of his own training and practical experience. His argument was that, taken as a whole, and compared with the sum total of Gibson's experience and training, Bowman's background made him so superior a candidate that the affirmative action plan did not apply. Bowman was not required to prove his case by disparaging every item in Gibson's resume.</p>
