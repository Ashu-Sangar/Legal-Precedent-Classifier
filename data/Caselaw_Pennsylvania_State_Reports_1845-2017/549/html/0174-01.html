Based on this purchase, police secured a search warrant for 3229 Fontain Street on January 30, 1992. Later that day, police conducted another cocaine purchase, this time from Donald Carlton, using a marked ten dollar bill. Shortly after the purchase, police saw Donald Carlton leave the house. They radioed a team of backup officers, who were waiting to execute the search warrant. The backup officers arrested Donald Carlton and immediately thereafter executed the search warrant.</p>

The officers did not announce their purpose before entering the house. Upon entering the house, police arrested Joseph Carlton, who was sitting in the dining room with two vials of crack cocaine in his possession. In various parts of the house, police also found a .38 caliber revolver and ammunition, a bag containing 147 additional vials of crack cocaine, a Wells Fargo identification card for Joseph Carlton showing an address of 3229 Fontain Street and a Pennsylvania Department of Welfare card in the <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>name of Donald Carlton.

Apart from this argument, there is no mention of Donald’s residence and there is no apparent awareness on the part of the court or counsel that Donald's residence may have been relevant to meet the threshold requirement that he had a legally cognizable privacy interest in the residence at 3229 Fontain Street as a part of his claim that the execution of the search warrant was defective.

Because they made two undercover drug purchases from two different sellers, the police officers knew that there was more than one member of this criminal enterprise. In addition to that, Officer Kittles’ purchase of crack cocaine five minutes earlier was clear evidence that the occupants of the house were actively involved in selling crack cocaine at the time the police approached the house. This, combined with the fact that the police arrested Donald Carlton on the street after he was spotted three or four houses away, leads to exigent circumstances that render it unreasonable to require the police to stand on the porch waiting and announcing their purpose. Considering the close proximity of Donald Carlton’s arrest, it was reasonable for the police to conclude that the other person selling drugs from the house would know that his partner in crime had just been arrested and would proceed to destroy evidence inside the <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>house. Announcing their purpose before entering was therefore unnecessary for the police.</p>

The police feared that the suspects had detected their surveillance, and began making arrests and seeking search warrants. Before they obtained search warrants, the police saw one suspect getting in his car and attempting to leave his apartment complex. The police arrested the suspect outside and decided to gain immediate entrance into the appellant’s apartment. They knocked on the outside door to a shared entrance in the defendant’s apartment building and rang the bell for the defendant’s apartment. When the defendant opened the door, the police yelled, “Police, open up!” When the defendant opened the outer door, the police seized him and threw him against a wall and told him that they were in the process of obtaining a warrant.</p>
    <p id="b278-6" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[218,1306,1161,734]]]'>The officers then took the defendant back to his apartment and conducted a sweep search for their own protection. Forty-five minutes later, they learned that a search warrant had been approved. They searched the apartment and recovered numerous vials of crack cocaine and a triple-beam scale in the apartment. The Superior Court held that the manner of the police officers’ entry into the apartment was proper due to the existence of exigent circumstances. Although there was no evidence that the defendant in the apartment was aware of the co-defendant’s arrest outside, the arrest occurred outside, in broad daylight, and close to the defendant’s apartment. Based on these facts, the Superior Court concluded that exigent circumstances negated the need for the police officers to announce their purpose before entering.</p>

When they arrived at <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>the defendant’s house, they knocked on the door and announced in a loud voice that they were police.

When Donald <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>Carlton did not return to the house from his walk, during which time he might have been making another drug transaction on a street corner, the individuals inside the house were likely to become suspicious. Indeed, they might have seen the arrest take place because it happened very close to the house. Finally, Officer Kittles’ purchase of crack cocaine five minutes before the police executed the warrant clearly alerted the police that occupants of the house were currently involved in drug trafficking at the time that the police officers executed the warrant. Based on these circumstances, the present case involved exigent circumstances that did not exist in <em>Newman, </em>which is not controlling here.</p>
    <p id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[211,970,1163,626]]]'>Joseph Carlton also argues that our holding in <em>Chambers </em>mandates suppression of evidence here. However, the facts of <em>Chambers </em>are inapposite to the present case. <em>Chambers </em>involved three defendants selling cocaine from inside a residence. Police officers executing a search warrant knocked on the front door of the house, and when one defendant began to open the front door, a police officer with his gun drawn forced the door open, pushed him backwards, and pointed his gun at him. Once inside the house, the officer identified himself as a police officer and told the defendant that they had a search warrant for the house. The officer ordered the defendant to stand against a wall and told him not to move.</p>
    <p id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[211,1621,1158,254]]]'>In determining whether the police officers’ conduct was reasonable under the circumstances, this Court held that the police in <em>Chambers </em>violated the knock and announce rule because there was no justification for their conduct, stating the following:</p>

Because there were no exigent circumstances in <em>Chambers, </em>and the police forced entry into the house without identifying themselves as police officers as the defendant began to open the front door, the facts in <em>Chambers </em>are vastly different from the present case. The police in the present case acted reasonably, and when Joseph Carlton did not open the door after twenty to thirty seconds, the officers acted appropriately.</p>

I do not agree. Although exigent circumstances justified their immediate entry into the house, the police officers in this case determined that waiting twenty or thirty seconds before entering was best. This was more than they were legally required to do. As stated previously, this Court upheld a finding of exigent circumstances in <em>Stanley </em>even though the officers waited for approximately one minute after announcing their identity.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[205,1295,1157,628]]]'>Contrary to the defendant’s arguments, this reasonable waiting period does not negate the existence of exigent circumstances. I do not find it to be unreasonable that police officers preparing to enter a house known to be a drug storage and trafficking facility, might choose to wait a short period of time before going inside. Although the exigencies of this case justified the immediate entry into the house, the police made a tactical decision to announce themselves before entering a potentially deadly situation. Their conduct in this case demonstrates that even in the face of exigent circumstances, the police afforded the defendants more notice and time to respond than they were constitutionally required to give.</p>

Nevertheless, predicting when a drug trafficker or user will attack <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>the police with deadly force is impossible. Bulletproof vests alone cannot adequately protect the police. They must be permitted to assess all of the attendant circumstances and rely on their experience to make such decisions.

Accordingly, I would hold that the trial court did not err when it denied Joseph Carlton’s motion to suppress the evidence seized inside 3229 Fontain Street.</p>
