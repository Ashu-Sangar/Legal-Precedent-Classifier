She ran to the window and observed a driverless car drift across the street and come to rest in front of her home. Inside, slumped over the front passenger seat, was the dead body of Andre Graves.</p>
    <p id="b679-5" data-blocks='[["BL_679.4",679,[174,659,1153,311]]]'>The police arrived within minutes. They observed that Graves had two bullet holes in the back of the head, and a large exit wound under his right eye. A third bullet was later found to have grazed his skull. Blood was splattered away from Graves and toward the dashboard in front of him and the seat to his side, both of which were riddled with bullet holes.</p>

Two copper bullet casings, consistent with the bullets which had killed Graves, were found in the rear passenger compartment, and additional casings were located under the driver’s seat and in the street nearby. Two bullets were embedded in the front passenger dashboard and door beside the victim. Two additional bullets were recovered by the police from the homes of Albritton’s neighbors and fragments of a fifth bullet lay on the street next to where the car came to rest. Forensic examination revealed that all of the bullets were fired from the same gun.</p>

Cofer stated that at the time of the murder, he, Graves and Appellant were returning from an unsuccessful search for members of a West Philadelphia gang, the “Boys from the Bottom”. Graves had been seeking revenge against the gang members for a beating he had suffered at their hands the previous afternoon, and was in the front passenger seat. Cofer was in the driver’s seat. Appellant sat alone in the back.</p>

When I turned, I saw [Appellant] shooting Andre Graves in the back of the head.” Cofer stated that he saw Appellant fire at least three rounds from a black handgun into Graves from point blank range.</p>

Appellant exited the back seat and fled to the nearby apartment of his girlfriend, Thiasa Cox (“Cox”). Cofer chased after Appellant and inside Cox’s apartment confronted him with Graves’ murder. Appellant responded that Graves “could have got us rocked” (i.e. killed). In a subsequent confrontation Appellant asserted that the murder was justified because Graves had informed “The Boys” that Appellant “was doing all the shooting at them.”</p>
    <p id="b680-6" data-blocks='[["BL_680.5",680,[247,1077,1161,584]]]'>At Appellant’s trial, several witnesses testified that Appellant had been trying to locate Graves on the day of the murder. One witness testified that Appellant owned a black .45 handgun, and that on the day of the murder the witness handed the gun to Appellant. Appellant was still carrying the gun at the time he joined Cofer and Graves. Another witness recalled seeing Cofer, Graves and Appellant in the car, with Appellant in the rear seat, Graves in the front and Cofer driving. Witnesses present at Cox’s apartment testified that Appellant had blood on his knee when he entered, and that he was extremely agitated and nervous.</p>

In the penalty phase, the jury found two aggravating circumstances: 1) that by shooting the victim as he sat next to Cofer, as well as by doing so in a residential neighborhood and hitting two occupied homes, Appellant knowingly created a grave risk to others when he murdered Graves;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and 2) that Appellant had a significant history of committing violent felonies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The jury determined that these aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances (that Appellant had a troubled childhood <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>and Appellant’s age at the time of the murder).

The Commonwealth presented evidence which showed that Graves was unlawfully killed by multiple gunshots fired into the back of his head, and that Appellant fired the gun. The use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim’s body establishes the degree of intent necessary to support a first degree murder charge. <em>Id. </em>at 171, <a href="/a2d/666/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="666 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="12043856,458423" data-case-paths="/a2d/666/0221-01,/pa/542/0160-01">666 A.2d at 226</a>. Additional evidence of premeditation could be found in testimony that Appellant was looking for Graves earlier in the day and that Appellant took a gun with him without revealing the fact to Graves and Cofer, and in Appellant’s explanation to Cofer of his motive for killing Graves. The evidence is clearly sufficient to support a finding of first degree murder.</p>

At trial, however, Cofer attempted to recant his prior statements. The Commonwealth introduced Gofer’s statement to the police, his prior testimony and two letters written by Appellant to Cofer, in which Appellant pressed Cofer to recant or risk being branded a “snitch”.

Appellant claims that this effect was magnified by the Commonwealth’s closing argument, when the prosecutor argued to the jury:</p>
