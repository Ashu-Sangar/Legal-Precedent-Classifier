    <p id="b711-12" data-blocks='[["BL_711.11",711,[166,1106,1152,366]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from a memorandum decision of the Commonwealth Court which affirmed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County denying a petition for return of property and granting forfeiture to the Commonwealth. The property in question is $100 in currency that was seized from the appellant, James Mosley, at the time of his arrest. The factual background of the case is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b711-13" data-blocks='[["BL_711.12",711,[164,1500,1156,636]]]'>On July 15, 1991, an officer of the City of Philadelphia Police Department observed what appeared to be a sale of illegal drugs. He saw Richard Merrill deliver currency to Mosley, whereupon Mosley handed Merrill a silver foil bundle. The officer approached the two men, but Mosley immediately fled. Merrill was arrested and the bundle was seized. The bundle contained ten packets of a controlled substance, phencyclidine, commonly known as PCP. It had a street value of $100. Mosley was located and arrested the following day. At the time of his arrest he had $100 with him, and this sum was seized. He was subsequently charged with possession of a controlled substance, and possession with intent to deliver.</p>
    <p id="b711-14" data-blocks='[["BL_711.13",711,[163,2164,1153,202]],["BL_712.1",712,[252,315,1159,733]]]'>On October 19, 1992, Mosley was adjudged not guilty of the foregoing charges. Thereafter, however, he remained imprisoned at Graterford State Prison on unrelated charges. The Defender Association of Philadelphia filed on his behalf a <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>petition for return of property seeking recovery of the $100 that had been seized. A hearing on the petition was scheduled. The trial court sent Mosley a letter informing him that he could either attend the hearing in person or answer interrogatories and send them to the court in lieu of his attendance. The court explained that the interrogatories would be accorded the same weight as live testimony, and that they would set forth questions relating to his ownership of the property and the circumstances under which it was seized. The court stated that the cost of transportation to the hearing, consisting of a $43 sheriffs fee, would have to be paid in advance by Mosley if he chose to personally attend. Based on this information, Mosley elected to rely on the interrogatories to support his claim.</p>
    <p id="b712-5" data-blocks='[["BL_712.4",712,[252,1069,1160,836]]]'>A very brief hearing on Mosley’s petition was held on September 22, 1993, at which time responses to the interrogatories were submitted to the court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Another hearing was held on September 24, 1993, whereupon Mosley’s petition for return of property was denied.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> At the same time, the court granted forfeiture to the Commonwealth pursuant to the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6801-6802. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6801(a)(6)(i)(A) (providing for forfeiture of money derived from illegal drug transactions). In support of its decision, the trial court issued an opinion stating that an oral motion for forfeiture had been made by the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The motion relied on the criminal complaint fact record describing the circumstances leading to Mosley’s arrest, including the seizure of drugs and the lab report analyzing those drugs as phencyclidine. An appeal of the trial court’s order ensued, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed.</p>
