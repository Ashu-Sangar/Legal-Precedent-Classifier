Sprague, Esq. are members of the PBA, a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation. They sought under the provisions of the Nonprofit Corporation Law, 15 Pa.C.S. § 5101 <em>et seq., </em>access to certain documents regarding evaluations of statewide judicial candidates made by the Judicial Evaluation Commission (“JEC”). The JEC is an independent commission, created and funded by the PBA, which independently evaluates candidates for judicial office.</p>
    <p id="b556-6" data-blocks='[["BL_556.7",556,[229,1174,1161,364]]]'>In early February 1997, the JEC announced its evaluations of the judicial candidates for the 1997 primary election. Shortly thereafter, Lewis and Sprague, invoking their status as PBA members, demanded that the PBA produce a range of thirty different categories of documents which they assumed were in the possession of the PBA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> They made their demands pursuant to 15 Pa.C.S. §§ 5508(b) and 5793.</p>

The PBA identified a published list of the PBA membership and offered to make available a computerized listing of its members. It also made a timely delivery of the estimated budget and the account of expenditures relating to the JEC and the minutes of its House of Delegates and Board of Governors.</p>

      <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>Lewis and Sprague then commenced this action against the PBA and Mundy in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County on March 11, 1997 as an application to compel inspection of documents. The PBA and Mundy asserted that: (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the application; (2) venue was improper in Lancaster County and only proper in Dauphin County, the county where the PBA’s registered office is located; (3) the relevant statutes did not authorize relief against a natural person so that Mr. Mundy should be dismissed; and, (4) the PBA had given to the applicants every document “to which a member of the PBA, acting for a proper purpose, would be entitled.” The lower court ruled, without explanation, that the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County was a proper venue for the suit but did not address the questions of subject matter jurisdiction or the dismissal of the claim against Mundy.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[195,1192,1152,367]]]'>Thereafter, Lewis and Sprague subpoenaed JEC’s records as well as documents in the possession of various JEC members and JEC investigative panel members. The PBA and JEC witnesses moved to quash the subpoenas. The court declined to enforce the subpoenas with the result that neither JEC nor its counsel appeared at the evidentiary hearing on April 10,1997.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[193,1586,1154,416]]]'>Following said evidentiary hearing, the court granted Lewis and Sprague’s application, concluding that they had met the standards of 15 Pa.C.S. § 5508 for the requested inspection. An appeal to Commonwealth Court was taken. Upon agreement of the parties, the lower court later stayed its order pending appeal. This court then exercised expedited plenary jurisdiction under its king’s bench powers, 42 Pa.C.S. § 726. We reverse.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[196,2047,1155,311]]]'>The first issue is whether venue was properly granted in this case.

The phrase “records of proceedings” is not defined in the statute.

The plain meaning of the phrase, therefore, could permit a member’s access to duly authorized minutes of official action of the board of directors of a nonprofit corporation but could, for example, exclude <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>access to a variety of documents, such as correspondence and draft documents.</p>

The corporate records required to be kept under § 5508(a) are the identical records that a member has the right to inspect pursuant to 15 Pa.C.S. § 5508(b). The statute does not define “record of the proceedings,” but it is apparent from the context of the statute that the phrase refers to a memorialization of official action taken by the members, directors and any other body of the nonprofit corporation. This is much more limited than the interpretation suggested by the Appellees’ argument, which would encompass all documents that came into existence during the process of preparing for the evaluation of judicial candidates.</p>

The common law rule was later codified as part of the Business Corporation Law of May 5, 1933. Section 308(B) of that early law provided that a shareholder had the right to examine the share register, books or records of account, and <em>records of the proceedings </em>of the shareholders and directors.</p>

We noted that a director stands in a fiduciary relationship to the corporation and, therefore, is entitled to all the information available to enable him to perform his duties to the shareholders. We found that the Business Corporation Law of 1933 “did not limit him, in the examination, as it limited the stockholder” whose right extended only to inspection of the share register, books or records of account, and records of the proceedings of the shareholders and directors. Since the phrase “records of proceedings” also appears in 15 Pa.C.S. § 5508(b), this analysis undercuts Appellees’ argument that they were entitled to all the documents they had requested.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The Appellees attempt to distinguish this case from <em>Strassburger </em>because § 5508(b) includes a right to inspect the records of proceedings of an other body of the nonprofit corporation. The Appellees argue that <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>by statute, the members of a nonprofit corporation have been granted broader powers than shareholders of a for-profit corporation. Although § 5508(b) extends to an other body of a nonprofit corporation, it does not expand the categories of documents that may be inspected by a member. Records of proceedings were included in the 1933 version of the Business Corporation Law and the same language appears in the Nonprofit Corporation Law of 1988.</p>
