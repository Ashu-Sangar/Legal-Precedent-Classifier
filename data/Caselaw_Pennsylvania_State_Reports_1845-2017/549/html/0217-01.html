Appellant asserts that contrary to the plaintiffs in <em>E.J.M, A McD. </em>and <em>Seto, </em>she is not arguing that the failure to timely file her action was the result of a disability. Appellant here asserts that the repression of her memory of the assaults was not a disability, but rather, it was a natural reaction as a young child to the trauma she experienced because of the sexual abuse. Appellant argues that it was the nature of the injury itself which caused her to suffer the repression of the event, and thus, the discovery rule should apply.</p>

Here appellant attempts to distinguish herself from those plaintiffs by boldly claiming that her repression of the memory of the original injury is not an incapacity; rather, she contends that it is the injury itself.

Appellant attempts to fit herself within this rule by simply declaring that the battery she suffered as a child was so traumatic that it was essentially unknown to her until the memory resurfaced.

We note that this portion of the trial court’s order was in error as the minority tolling provision of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5533 was not in effect in 1969 when the alleged injury occurred. As the complaint is for an action in battery the appellant should have filed her action within two years of 1969. The minority tolling provision was not effective until 1984. It cannot revive a cause of action which accrued and expired prior to its effective date. To clarify the record the statute of limitations expired in this case in 1971. Although the trial court was in error on this point it does not affect our disposition of this matter. We further note that the Superior Court did not adopt this portion of the triad court opinion in its opinion affirming the grant of summary judgment.</p>

The Majority’s analysis is faulty because, assuming <em>arguendo </em>the validity of Appellant’s repressed memory theory, a jury could find that she experienced a natural consequence of sexual child abuse, i.e., a contemporaneous dissociation and repression of all awareness of the offensive contact, such that she was reasonably unaware of her injury until her memory of the events returned many years later. However, I believe any discussion of the discovery rule, here, is academic because Appellant has failed to produce evidence of facts essential to her claim.

Most glaringly, Appellant has failed to produce any affidavit or expert report that would enable a fact finder to evaluate her claim of repressed memory. As emphasized by Appellee, Appellant’s discussion of her anticipated expert testimony concerning dissociation and repression is wholly inappropriate because it is not part of the record. The record contains only Appellant’s testimony concerning her experiences.

Our determination is based in part on our understanding of the rationale for the discovery rule in <em>Ayers v. </em>Morgan.1<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>1 The Supreme Court reasoned the Ayers’ Claim could not be barred because the defendant’s conduct set in motion objective “laws of nature” which prevented Mr. Ayers from ascertaining the cause of <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>his abdominal pain: since defendant had sewn him up as part of the treatment, “he could not open his abdomen like a door and look in” to discover the cause of his pain. Similarly, in this case the testimony of the psychiatrist called by plaintiff as an expert established that as a matter of scientific fact the defendant’s therapy impaired the judgment and mental processes of Mrs. Greenberg in a way that was analogous to, if subtler than, the surgeon’s sewing up of Mr. Ayers’ abdomen. Thus, the plaintiff presented competent and unrebutted testimony that as a result of the operation of the “laws of nature” in connection with [the defendant’s] treatment, which laws we understand to comprise the psychiatric as well as the physiological, she was precluded from discovery. At issue is the objective effect of the defendant’s treatment on discoverability by a reasonable person, not the impact on discoverability of the plaintiffs mental deficiencies apart from that treatment.</blockquote>

      <em>Id. </em>at 768-69 (citations omitted). The <em>Greenberg </em>rationale is equally applicable here. At issue is the objective effect of the alleged abuse on a reasonable person’s ability to discover the injury. As alleged by Appellant, severely offensive abuse naturally causes repression in the mind of a minor child. Thus, assuming the validity of Appellant’s scientific theory, the “laws of nature” prevented her from ascertaining her injury. As the <em>Greenberg </em>court concluded, “the statutory period does not begin to run if the fact-finder concludes that the plaintiffs failure of discovery, objectively determined, is brought about by the very nature of the defendant’s conduct.” <em>Id. </em>at 769.</p>

Brown, </em>at 170. The Majority, therefore, concludes that Appellant is asserting nothing other than an individual incapacity to know that she suffered a battery. I believe, howev<a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>er, that the engine driving the Majority’s analysis is its summary rejection of the <em>validity </em>of Appellant’s repressed memory theory, a question not now before this Court. The question before us is not limited to what makes common sense. We must accept, solely for purposes of this decision, a scientific theory that, like countless novel scientific theories, initially appears inconceivable.</p>
    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[168,697,1157,1113]]]'>As previously stated, Appellant asserts that repression is a <em>normal </em>psychological response of a healthy six to eight-year-old to a traumatic childhood event. Judge Fullam recognized in <em>Hewczuk, </em>where foster parents allegedly abused a minor child, “it is not at all unreasonable to suppose that a child of such tender years, with her limited experience in life, would not understand that her ‘parents’ were mistreating her and that these horrors would be totally repressed and excluded from her consciousness.” <em>Id. </em>at 1065. Just as exposure to asbestos does not cause cancer in every individual, childhood sexual assault may not trigger a dissociative reaction in every victim. In neither case does an incomplete correlation of cause and effect necessarily indicate an idiosyncratic reaction of a particular plaintiff. Although repression may be an extraordinary phenomenon, a victim such as Appellant, who allegedly dissociated and repressed all conscious awareness of childhood sexual assault, is blameless in her inability to discover her injury within the statutory period. Thus, I believe the Majority errs in concluding that, as a matter of law, it was unreasonable for Appellant to fail to detect her injury within the statutory period.</p>

      <em>Baily, </em>cited by the Majority, appears at first glance to involve a similar factual scenario. A closer inspection, however, reveals that <em>Baily </em>is factually distinguishable from this case. The <em>Baily </em>plaintiff claimed that he had psychologically repressed his memory of childhood sexual molestation by a family friend. The District Court said that the discovery rule applies where an injury is not readily discernible, such as in the case of a surgical sponge left in a patient’s abdomen. <em>Id. </em>(citing Ayers). The <em>Baily </em>plaintiff, however, did not allege that he was unaware of the alleged abuse when it occurred or <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>who committed it. He conceded that, at the time of the abusive incidents, he knew that it hurt both physically and emotionally. Instead, he asserted that he did not know the acts were <em>wrongful </em>at the time they were committed. The <em>Baily </em>court, therefore, reasoned that it was not the nature of the injury itself, i.e., a readily discernible battery, that resulted in the plaintiffs inability to sue, but his own incapacity.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[237,688,1161,885]]]'>The facts of <em>Baily </em>are more similar to those of <em>E.J.M v.

In <em>E.J.M., </em>the plaintiff conceded that he never repressed his memory of the physical acts a priest had committed upon him, but claimed that he did not know those acts were “abuse” and had caused psychological and emotional harm. Likewise, in <em>A. McD., </em>the plaintiff was aware that her psychiatrist committed sexual acts upon her, but claimed that her psychiatric problems precluded her from knowing that the acts were unethical. In both cases, the court held that the plaintiffs lack of awareness that the defendant’s conduct was wrongful and injurious is irrelevant to the discovery rule analysis. In each case, the court held that once the plaintiff knew what was happening to him or her and who was doing it, the plaintiff had a duty to investigate the matter and institute suit.</p>

Thus, although all of the elements in a typical battery action are <em>ordinarily </em>present and known to the plaintiff at the time of the touching itself, <em>Baily, </em>here, it was the offensiveness of the contact that allegedly caused her to repress all conscious awareness and memory of the touching. Accordingly, the battery was not immediately discernable to her. Therefore, it is the nature of the actual injury that prevented her from ascertaining its existence.</p>
