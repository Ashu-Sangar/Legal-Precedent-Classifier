Under the net method, the employer’s accrued lien and all legal costs of obtaining the settlement are deducted from the total recovery for purposes of determining the amount of the employer’s credit for future installments. The amount available for future credits is referred to as the “balance of recovery.” The balance of recovery is then divided by the weekly compensation rate being paid to the workers’ compensation claimant in order to arrive at what is known as a “grace period.” The grace period is the number of weeks in the future for which the employer does not have to pay claimant workers’ compensation benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Under the gross method, any balance of recovery is determined by deducting the employer’s accrued lien from the total recovery. When the claimant’s recovery in the third-party action provides the employer with repayment of its accrued lien, the employer must reimburse the claimant for the claimant’s proportionate share of the costs expended to recover that amount. The remaining legal expenses are attributable to the balance of recovery. Next, one calculates the credit or grace period due to the employer. In doing this, the balance of <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>recovery is divided by the weekly compensation rate being paid to the employee. Finally, the expenses attributable to the balance of recovery are divided by the number of weeks in the grace period in order to determine the amount of legal expenses to be paid by the employer to the claimant in installments each week during the grace period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The parties also agree that an employer’s settlement of its accrued lien, including legal fees, for an amount less than the amount of the accrued lien (here, a $35,000 settlement of a $117,167.24 accrued lien) does not affect the calculation of the balance of recovery or grace period.</p>

Section 319 requires that “reasonable ... fees and other proper disbursements incurred in obtaining a recovery or ... settlement shall be pro-rated” between the employer and employee. Section 319 then mandates that this prorated rule for legal expenses first be applied to the “accrued <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>lien,” the amount of workers’ compensation paid by the employer to the employee up to the time of recovery.

    <p id="b580-6" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[255,1045,1160,208]]]'>The dispute then turns to the treatment of legal expenses when calculating the balance of recovery eligible for credits against future workers’ compensation payments the employer must make to the employee.

We arrive at this conclusion because as stated above, Section 319 mandates that the legal expenses be pro-rated between the employer and the employee. Since the legal expenses and future credits portion of Section 319 must be read <em>in pari materia, </em>we conclude that Section 319 requires that the em<a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>ployer only needs to reimburse the employee for legal expenses as the employer receives the benefit of the recovery or settlement. Thus, the employer, in connection with each week of the grace period, must reimburse to the employee the amount of legal costs attributable to that week of the grace period. Therefore, when the above interpretations surrounding the many facets of Section 319 are combined, we conclude that it describes what is referred to as the gross method for determining an employer’s subrogation rights and liabilities with respect to an employee’s recovery in a third-party action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The WCJ arrived at the amount Employer owed appellant in legal fees by first dividing Employer’s accrued lien of $117,167.25 by the total recovery of $165,000, which equals approximately 71%. The WCJ then arrived at the $40,903.77 figure by multiplying the total legal fees of $57,610.95 by 71%.</p>

The WCJ arrived at this figure of $16,707.18 by subtracting the amount it previously determined Employer owed appellant for legal fees, $40,903.77, from the toted legal fees of $57,610.95. The WCJ then subtracted the remaining legal fees of $16,707.18 and the accrued lien of $117,167.25 from the total recovery of $165,000, to equal the net recovery of $31,125.57.</p>

We note that the WCJ also determined that Employer owed appellant $38,943.40 in past due workers’ compensation payments plus $226.20 more per week in future compensation. The WCJ also determined that Employer violated the Workers' Compensation Act by altering appellant's benefits without a judicial order. Thus, the WCJ imposed a 20% penalty on the $38,943.40 in past due compensation plus $226.20 per week benefits and 10% interest on all late payments. The WCJ also ordered Employer to pay counsel fees in the amount of 20% of all compensation due for an unreasonable contest in this action. These awards, however, were ultimately reversed by the Commonwealth Court and are not a part of this appeal.</p>

Appellant's petition for allowance of appeal also alleged that the Commonwealth Court erred by reversing the WCJ’s grant of $40,903.77 to appellant as Employer's share of legal fees. Appellant claimed that the Commonwealth Court exceeded its scope of review because Employer failed to raise the issue on appeal. This Court rejected that claim and limited the grant of <em>allocatur </em>to the methodology issue only.</p>

As the Commonwealth Court in this case noted, the parties in <em>Rollins </em>did not preserve any question relating to the methodology used in calculating the grace period during which the employer would not have to pay future workers' compensation benefits to the employee. Instead, <em>Rollins </em>primarily involved the validity of a subrogation agreement between the parties in which the employer accepted $10,000 in settlement of its accrued lien in return for a promise that the employee would forego future workers' compensation benefits.</p>
