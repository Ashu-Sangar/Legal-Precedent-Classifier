A three-member hearing committee held hearings on July 27, 1992 and November 18, 1992.

For example, the hearing committee found that on June 21, 1989, Monsour was entrusted with $96,224.68, but that the client trust account balance was only $31,326.29, thus representing a deficiency of $64,989.39. Furthermore, on one occasion, Monsour used funds entrusted to him on behalf of one client to make a payment to another client. The hearing committee also found that Monsour deposited personal funds into the account, thus commingling personal funds with entrusted funds.

In February of 1994, he entered an intensive outpatient counseling program at Gateway Rehabilitation Center (Gateway).

He reviewed Monsour’s treatment records and spoke to his therapist at Gateway and his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor. Dr. Capretto testified that he believed that Monsour knew what he was doing was wrong at the time he engaged in misconduct. While Dr. Capretto opined that Monsour’s alcoholism was directly related to his misconduct, he was not aware of the extent of Monsour’s actions, and believed that he had misappropriated $5,000.00 or $10,000.00.</p>

In its report, the Board determined that Dr. Capretto’s testimony did not convincingly establish a causal nexus between Monsour’s alcoholism and his misconduct. It concluded that Monsour failed to meet his burden of proof because of: (1) the short period of time Dr. Capretto spent with Monsour; (2) the lapse of eight months between the end of Monsour’s treatment and his meeting with Dr. Capretto; and (3) the doctor’s vague acquaintance with the details of the misconduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We note that <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>nowhere in his deposition testimony does Dr. Capretto state how he determined that Monsour’s conduct was related to his alcohol abuse.</p>
