For the reasons which follow, we reverse the orders of the Superior Court which affirmed the trial court’s transfer of these litigation matters.</p>
    <p id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[228,1041,1161,476]]]'>In the first appeal before us, appellants Kathleen Cheese-man and her husband Robert Cheeseman (the Cheesemans), who are Bucks residents, commenced a personal injury action in Philadelphia against appellees Lethal Exterminator, Inc. (Lethal Exterminator) and Joseph P. Clare (Clare) in May of 1994. The Cheesemans’ complaint alleged that Kathleen Cheeseman was seriously injured when her vehicle collided with a vehicle which was owned by Lethal Exterminator and operated by Lethal Exterminator’s agent, Clare, in Bucks.</p>
    <p id="b286-8" data-blocks='[["BL_286.8",286,[226,1540,1162,691]]]'>Appellees Lethal Exterminator and Clare filed a petition to change venue pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1006(d)(1) in May of 1995, seeking a transfer of the litigation to Bucks, where Lethal had its principal place of business. The appellees asserted, generally, that litigating in Bucks would be more convenient for the parties and their witnesses for the following reasons: all of the parties and fact witnesses resided in Bucks; all of Kathleen Cheeseman’s treating physicians resided in Bucks; and no significant aspect of the case involved Philadelphia. In response, the Cheesemans asserted that Philadelphia was not an inconvenient forum because all of the witnesses lived or worked within a 45-minute drive from Center City Philadelphia.</p>

See Pa.R.C.P. 1006(a), (b), (c); Pa.R.C.P. 2179. The trial judge considered the private interests of the litigants, i.e., that the residences and locations of the parties and the prospective witnesses were in Bucks, and also considered the court’s public interest, i.e., the court’s own interest in administration of its cases and the backlog in the Philadelphia courts. The trial judge weighed these considerations against the convenience of the plaintiffs chosen forum. The trial judge reasoned that nothing would make trial in Bucks more expensive or time-consuming for the litigants than trial in Philadelphia. The trial judge heavily weighted the fact that the Cheesemans were not Philadelphia residents and that their case was imposing an extra matter on Philadelphia’s already burdened court system, and concluded that the balance of the litigants’ private interests and the court’s public interest required transfer of the <em>Cheeseman </em>action to Bucks.</p>

Delaware Valley Medical Center asserted, generally, “[a]ll of the parties and the vast majority of perspective [sic] trial witnesses and sources of proof are located in Bucks,” and that litigating in Bucks would be more accessible and less disruptive to the health care defendants and their witnesses than litigating in Philadelphia. Delaware Valley Medical Center further pointed out that the courts in Philadelphia were congested, and that imposing jury duty service on citizens of Philadelphia for a case having no significant connection to Philadelphia would be unfair.</p>

Forman alleged that Philadelphia was an equally convenient forum and was convenient for her because she worked in Philadelphia. Moreover, For-man denied that the public interest would be best served by transfer of the litigation to Bucks, arguing that Philadelphia’s court congestion, in itself, is an insufficient basis for transferring venue.</p>

Only two years ago, we reaffirmed this standard in <em>Scola v. AC &amp; S, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/540/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="540 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="472149" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0353-01">540 Pa. 353</a>, <a href="/a2d/657/1234-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="657 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="11944732,472149" data-case-paths="/a2d/657/1234-01,/pa/540/0353-01">657 A.2d 1234</a> (1995). Nonetheless, I agree with the Majority that “[u]nfortunately, our inclusion in <em>Scola </em>of the ‘test’ set forth in <em>Okkerse </em>was ill-advised. The obvious confusion created in the lower courts regarding the inquiry which a trial court must conduct in ruling on a petition to transfer venue pursuant to Rule 1006(d)(1) requires our consideration.... ” Majority op. at 161. As the Majority points out, the second prong of the test, a court’s own private and public interest factors, is not an appropriate consideration pursuant to Rule 1006(b)(1).</p>

In granting Appel<a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>lees’ petitions to transfer venue, the trial court relied primarily on its own private and public interest factors. Because only now have we clearly decided that a court may no longer weigh these factors in its Rule 1006(d)(1) analysis, fairness dictates that we should remand these cases to the trial court so that it may determine if Appellants’ choice of forum was oppressive and vexatious, which is the only remaining prong of the newly truncated <em>OkJcerse-Seola </em>test. The Majority states that Appellees may meet this standard by establishing on the record that trial in the chosen forum is oppressive because “trial in another county would provide easier access to witnesses or other sources of proof----” Majority op. at 162. Appellees have a legitimate prospect of demonstrating this since in each case the parties and a majority of the witnesses and other sources of proof are located in Bucks County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Additionally, this result will not trigger the Majority’s concerns regarding burdensome evidentiary hearings or dilatory tactics. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 162 n. 8. Only those cases pending on appeal where this issue has been properly preserved would be eligible for relief, and from this date forward the members of the bar will have notice of the proper standard for a change of venue petition pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1006(d)(1). Because the Majority is unwilling to grant Appellees the opportunity to satisfy that standard, I must respectfully dissent.</p>

The obvious question here is why have Appellants chosen to pursue their personal injury actions in Philadelphia County when Bucks County clearly appears to be the more convenient forum. Perhaps the perception that Philadelphia juries are more generous than those in Bucks County has influenced Appellants' choice of forum.</p>
