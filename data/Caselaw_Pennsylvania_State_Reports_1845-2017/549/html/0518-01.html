This matter involves the interpretation of two automobile insurance policies, one issued by State Farm on the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident at question and the other issued by Universal Underwriters Insurance Company (“Universal”) on the owner of the vehicle. Because we determine that the policy issued by Universal does not provide coverage for the driver of the automobile in question, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>

Universal contended that Hill was not covered by its policy and therefore it had no duty to compensate State Farm for the costs of defending and settling the claims.

    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[239,779,1160,743]]]'>The provision on which State Farm places most of its emphasis is § 1786. The 1988 version of that statute stated that each motor vehicle registrant shall certify that he has provided “financial responsibility’ at the time he registers his vehicle. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1786. “Financial responsibility’ was defined as the ability to respond in damages in the amount of $15,000 because of injury to one person in any one accident, in the amount of $80,000 because of injury to two or more persons in any one accident and in the amount of $5,000 because of damage to property of others in any one accident. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702. Essentially, State Farm’s argument is that in order for the owner to be in compliance with § 1786, all permissive users would have to be insureds under the owner’s policy.</p>
    <p id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[239,1547,1159,258]],["BL_607.1",607,[190,309,1155,476]]]'>There is some authority to support the argument that where a permissive user is otherwise not covered by financial responsibility, then the vehicle owner must provide coverage in order to meet the requirement of § 1786 that the vehicle be covered by “financial responsibility’.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Yet, that is not the situation <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>with which we are confronted in this matter. Here, Hill was covered by financial responsibility due to her own auto insurance policy. In order to hold that the 1988 version of § 1786 mandated that Hill be covered in this instance, we would have to find that the statute directed an owner to provide the minimal level of coverage set forth in § 1702 even where the permissive user is already covered by financial responsibility under her own policy. In essence, we would have to state that § 1786 mandated the owner to provide redundant coverage.</p>
    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[192,819,1154,367]]]'>We reject this approach. Section 1786 required that the owner’s vehicle be covered by financial responsibility but is utterly silent as to whom the coverage of the owner’s policy runs. We find it fantastic to conclude that from this silence would spring a mandate that permissive, otherwise insured drivers such as Hill would be required by law to be insured under the owner’s policy.</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[190,1220,1155,636]]]'>State Farm’s remaining arguments concerning Subchapter H are also unconvincing. For example, State Farm argues that 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1784 and 1785 established that Hill should be covered under the Universal policy. We disagree. Those statutes provided that where a vehicle which was not covered by financial responsibility was involved in an accident, then the automobile’s registration<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and the owner’s license<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> would be suspended.

      <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>Finally, we note that much of State Farm’s argument is premised upon the position that public policy would be served by requiring that a vehicle owner’s insurance policy encompass a permissive user as an insured. Yet, the role of the court in this matter is not to make policy determinations as to whether permissive drivers who are covered by their own auto insurance <em>ought </em>to be insureds under the owner’s insurance policy; rather, our function is simply to determine whether the Legislature did indeed place such a requirement in the 1988 MVFRL. Reworking the dictates of the MVFRL in order to achieve some ostensibly laudable public policy goal would be a gross intrusion on the Legislature’s constitutional powers. Therefore, we decline to alter the meaning of the 1988 MVFRL in order to achieve some policy goal.</p>

This approach allocates the loss by prorating coverage according to the ratio of the coverage provided by each policy for the same loss to the total coverage provided by all policies. <em>See generally Hoffmaster v.

Therefore, by employing the policy limits method, State Farm would be liable for 1/1 lths ($50,000.00/$550,000.00) of the loss whereas Universal would be liable for 10/1 lths ($500,000.00/$555,000.00).</p>

As noted above, the post-1990 version of these statutes has no application to this matter. Therefore, those portions of State Farm's argument that touch on sections of the MVFRL which were either created or substantially altered by the 1990 amendments will not be discussed in this opinion.</p>

We note that at least one appellate court has adopted the position that where a permissive user is otherwise <em>not </em>covered by financial responsibility, then the vehicle owner is “required by law” to provide coverage in order to meet the requirement to provide financial responsibility. <em>See Steinberg v.

In that case, the court was also confronted with determining whether a permissive user of an automobile is “required by law” to be covered under the vehicle owner's insurance policy. In analyzing an Illinois statute which is strikingly similar to § 1786 of the 1988 MVFRL, the Appellate Court of Illinois determined that although an otherwise insured permissive user is not "required by law” to be covered under the owner’s insurance policy, an owner would be "required by law” to cover a permissive user who did not provide her own financial responsibility. <em><a href="/citations/?q=677%20N.E.2d%201321" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="677 N.E.2d 1321">Id.</a></em>

      <blockquote id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.6",608,[278,2008,1126,350]]]'>We reject this conclusion as we find nothing ambiguous about the clause that the insurance contract would extend coverage to a driver as required by law. The language itself could not be plainer. Furthermore, as discussed above, there is no support in the 1988 version of the MVFRL for the position that a vehicle owner’s policy was required to insure a permissive user who had her own automobile insurance providing financial responsibility. Therefore, we find that it is clear that Hill was not "required by law” to be an insured under the Universal policy.</blockquote>
