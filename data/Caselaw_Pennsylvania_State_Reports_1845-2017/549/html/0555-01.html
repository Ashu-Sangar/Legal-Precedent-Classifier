The Commonwealth Court held that Section 333 does not apply under these circumstances. Specifically, the court held that although Section 333 differs from Section 8523 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8523, which was at issue in <em>Chen, </em>the language of both statutes is substantially similar; therefore the reasoning of <em>Chen </em>controls. In that case, a personal injury plaintiff filed suit against several defendants in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. One of the named defendants issued a summons to join the Department of Transportation (the Department) as an additional defendant. The Department subsequently filed preliminary objections, alleging improper venue. Pursuant to Section 8523, the Department argued that venue would lie only in Dauphin County, where the Department’s principal office is located, or in Delaware County, where the Department maintains a local office.

The Commonwealth Court ruled, however, that Section 8523 is inapplicable where the Commonwealth party is joined as an additional defendant. According to the court, the statute specifically refers only to where “actions may be brought” and, therefore, is limited to cases in which the plaintiff sues the Commonwealth party originally. Moreover, the court reasoned that a transfer of venue under these circumstances disregards the plaintiffs choice of forum, which is entitled to considerable weight. Applying <em>Chen </em>to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Commonwealth Court held that Section 333 is not applicable to third-party proceedings in which the original defendants join the local agency as an additional defendant.</p>
    <p id="b642-6" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[261,1124,1167,948]]]'>We disagree with the Commonwealth Court’s decision in both this case and <em>Chen. </em>A plain reading of Section 333 and Section 8523 does not distinguish between actions brought by a plaintiff against a defendant or a defendant against a third party. Because neither statute specifically defines the term “action,” the rules of statutory construction require us to ascribe to the term its ordinary meaning. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). The term “action” as defined in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure is “any civil action or proceeding at law or in equity brought in or appealed to any court of record which is subject to these rules.” Pa.R.C.P. 2251. The dictionary definition of “action” is “a suit brought in a court; a formal complaint within the jurisdiction of a court of law.” <em>Black’s Law Dictionary </em>26 (5th ed.1979). In Pennsylvania, filing a praecipe for a writ of summons or a complaint may commence an action. Pa.R.C.P. 1007; <em>see also Human Development of Erie, Inc. v. Zoning Hearing Board of Millcreek Township, </em>143 Pa.Cmwlth. 675, <a href="/pa-commw/143/0675-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="600 A.2d 658" data-case-ids="1423198" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/143/0675-01">600 A.2d 658</a> (1991).</p>

Under the rules, the procedure, including pleadings, between the Original Defendants and Allentown “shall be the same as though the party joining the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>additional defendant were a plaintiff and the additional defendant were a defendant.” Pa.R.C.P. 2255(a). Thus, the Original Defendants have effectively filed an “action” against Allentown, alleging that Allentown is solely liable to the Ribnickys or liable to the Original Defendants for indemnity or contribution. As such, despite the fact that the Ribnickys did not originally seek damages from Allentown, they “shall recover from the additional defendant found liable to him alone or jointly with the defendant as though such additional defendant had been joined as a defendant and duly served and the initial pleading of the plaintiff had averred such liability.” Pa.R.C.P. 2255(d). Accordingly, an action has been brought against a local agency, thus, triggering the venue provisions of Section 333. Because Allentown is located in Lehigh County and the cause of action arose in Allentown, Section 333 mandates the transfer of venue to Lehigh County.</p>

I disagree with Mr. Justice Cappy that joining an additional defendant does not constitute an action against that party. As the dissent points out, once an additional defendant is joined “... [t]he action becomes a combination of a suit of the plaintiff against the original defendant, a suit of the original defendant against the additional defendant, and a suit of the plaintiff against the additional defendant.” GoodrichAmram 2d § 2252:1.</p>
    <p id="b644-10" data-blocks='[["BL_644.10",644,[259,1558,1161,790]]]'>In other words, once joined the additional defendant’s involvement in the action is as if it was an original defendant. For instance, an additional defendant is as vulnerable to a finding of liability as an original defendant. To conclude that a party is not in an “action” merely because it is an additional defendant ignores the practical reality of the lawsuit. The legislature enacted section 333 of the JCA in order to allow a municipality to defend itself in its home jurisdiction and the courts have recognized the importance of this principle. To follow the logic of the dissent, the municipality would be placed in a different position in defending itself as a third party defendant than as an original defendant even though the dissent agrees the same liability attaches to the municipality in either instance. This frustrates the purpose of the statute and leads to an absurd result.</p>

Rather, it recognizes the competing interests of the plaintiffs choice of forum and the statutory requirement of where a municipality may be sued. Although the majority resolves this conflict in favor of the municipality, nevertheless, an original defendant will not be able to manipulate plaintiffs choice of forum merely by joining a municipality. If joinder of the municipality is not meritorious then the municipality will be removed from the action. Once the municipality is no longer a party to the action, plaintiff may properly file a petition to transfer venue back to the original jurisdiction by way of Pa.R.C.P. 1006(d)(1).</p>

Appellee Galina Ribnicky and her husband Appellee Richard Ribnicky (collectively, Appellees) commenced a negligence action in 1993 against Yerex, MCI Telecommunications Corporation, which was Yerex’s employer, and U.S. Fleet Leasing, Inc., which owned the truck Yerex was driving (collectively Appellants/Original Defendants). Appellees brought the action in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, which is undisputedly an appropriate forum, rather than in Lehigh County, which also would have been an appropriate forum. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1006; 2179.
