Five years later, the Governor of the Commonwealth issued a warrant of execution, and appellant was scheduled to be put to death on January 14, 1992. Approximately one week before the scheduled execution, appellant, represented by court appointed counsel, Norris Gelman, Esq. and Louis M. Natali, Esq., sought a stay of execution from the Court of Common Pleas on the grounds that, before his execution, appellant should be allowed to argue the issue of whether his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the aggravating circumstance of torture. The trial court denied the stay, and appellant filed a stay request in both this Court and in the Federal District Court. On January 13, 1992, this Court remanded the matter to the trial court for a PCRA hearing on the torture issue. On September 14, 1992, the trial court held a PCRA hearing and denied relief to appellant. This Court affirmed on July 1, 1994. <em>Commonwealth v.

On July 7, 1995, this Court granted a stay of execution and allowed appellant thirty days to file yet another PCRA petition. Appellant filed his third petition on August 4, 1995 and supplemented it on September 12, 1995 claiming that he suffered from a mental illness that should have been deemed a mitigating factor in the penalty phase and that there should have been a competency hearing before the penalty phase. Following an evidentiary hearing, on October 25, 1995, the PCRA court denied the PCRA petition, and appellant appealed to this Court.</p>

On July 17, 1996, this Court remanded to the PCRA court “for a colloquy to determine whether petitioner fully understands the consequences of his request to withdraw his appeal and to waive all collateral proceedings.”</p>

The court granted appellant’s requests. One week later, on August 9, 1996, appellant again appeared before the PCRA court for the waiver colloquy. The hearing began with the judge questioning appellant about whether he had an opportunity to speak to the attorneys from the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy &amp; Defense Assistance (“CLEADA”) during his week at Graterford. Appellant responded that he spoke to them on three separate days and again on the morning of August 9, 1996. Appellant stated that the last time the attorneys from CLEADA came to Graterford he signed papers stating that he wanted them to represent him.

Appellant’s counsel from CLEADA then filed the instant appeal alleging that, notwithstanding appellant’s letter and testimony, appellant actually did not waive his rights to collateral and appellate review.

The court asked if he understood that he had a right to have a jury impose sentence and that a jury might sentence him to life imprisonment.

He also repeatedly stated that he wanted his attorneys not to file any further appeals or petitions on his behalf. As a result of the colloquy, the court accepted appellant’s waiver.
