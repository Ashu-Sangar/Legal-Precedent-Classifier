Appellant and his cohorts arrived in Coatesville at approximately 12:00 noon. Upon arriving in Coatesville, the three men decided to rob a laundromat on Main Street. Appellant and Greene proceeded into the laundromat while Davis waited in the car as the getaway driver. Appellant, armed with a loaded .357 caliber magnum revolver, went to the cashier’s area in the rear of the laundromat while Greene, armed with a .22 caliber revolver, stayed near the front entrance to the laundromat. Appellant withdrew his revolver and demanded that the victim give him the money from the laundromat. After the victim refused to give appellant the money, appellant fired a shot which grazed the victim’s head. Appellant then fired another shot from a distance of approximately four (4) to ten (10) inches which entered the back portion of the right side of the victim’s head and traversed through the victim’s brain causing instantaneous death. When appellant fired the fatal shot, his .357 caliber revolver was in double action firing mode, which would require nine pounds of pressure on the trigger to activate the hammer in order to fire a round.</p>

Appellant then fled in the getaway ear to a house in Coatesville where appellant and his cohorts changed clothes and joked about their weapons with the man who resided at the house. The three men eventually left the Coatesville house and returned to Philadelphia where they changed clothes once again at a fast-food restaurant.</p>

The Philadelphia police transported appellant to the Philadelphia Police Administration Building where appellant was processed and turned over to the Chester County detectives. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> appellant was questioned by the Chester County detectives in the Philadelphia Police Administration Building. Appellant then made a statement in which he confessed to his participation in the robbery and murder.

After the victim declined appellant’s demand for money, appellant pointed the revolver at a vital part of the victim’s body. At the time appellant killed the victim, the revolver was four to ten inches away from the victim’s head. Also, two eyewitnesses identified appellant as the person who emerged from the rear of the laundromat after the shots were fired which killed the victim and that appellant waved the revolver at them in his attempt to flee the scene. Moreover, appellant admitted to shooting the victim. Accordingly, we find that this evidence is sufficient to establish that appellant acted with malice aforethought and with the specific intent to kill the victim. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Instead, the remark was an attempt by the prosecutor to explain to the jury the difficulty of proving the intent to kill and that such intent must be inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing since the victim cannot testify.

During trial, the Commonwealth introduced the statement appellant made to the Chester County detective at the Philadelphia Police Administration Building. In that statement, appellant contended that he participated in the crime because he needed the money to buy his two daughters Christmas presents. Moreover, the murder occurred on December 18, 1993, one week before Christmas, and, as the Commonwealth notes, Christmas was mentioned during trial as a reference point as to when the events surrounding the murder occurred. Based on the evidence offered at trial, we conclude that the prosecutor’s comments were not delivered in an effort to appeal to the sympathies of the jury. Rather, the comment was a fair response to the reason offered by appellant in his statement as to why he participated in the crime. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the prosecutor’s comments were proper remarks which did not cause the jury to form a fixed bias or hostility towards appellant so that the jury was unable to render a true verdict based on the evidence.
