George moved out in July, 1991, four months before the child was born. Lisa stated that at the time Audrianna was conceived the former husband slept on the couch and she slept in a bedroom. Further, although her former husband was not physically incapable of procreation at the time Audrianna was conceived and although he was free to enter her bedroom, she and her husband did not have sexual relations. Lisa also testified that she was having sexual relations with Richard King during the period when Audrianna was conceived<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and that her husband filed for divorce because he learned that she was pregnant by King.</p>

King denied paternity and refused blood testing. Lisa then filed a motion for adjudication of paternity and King answered that Lisa was precluded from claiming that he was the father of Audrianna because she had failed to rebut the presumption that her former husband was the father. The trial court treated the motion for adjudication of paternity as a motion for blood tests and directed the parties to submit memoranda of law on their positions. The court thereafter concluded that Lisa had failed to rebut the presumption that her former husband was Audrianna’s father, for she was unable to establish that the former husband had no access during the period of conception, and denied the motion for blood tests. Lisa then appealed to Superior Court.</p>

They suggested that this court consider whether additional factors, such as the identity of the father named on the child’s birth certificate, whether the putative father has established a <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>relationship with the child, whether the putative father provided support for the child, and whether the putative father provided medical insurance for the child should be also considered in rebuttal of the presumption.</p>

Traditionally, the answer to this question has been that the presumption applies if the child was conceived or born during the marriage. We now question the wisdom of this application of the presumption because the nature of male-female relationships appears to have changed dramatically since the presumption was created. There was a time when divorce was relatively uncommon and marriages tended to remain intact. Applying the presumption whenever the child was conceived or born during the marriage, therefore, tended to promote the policy behind the presumption: the preservation of marriages. Today, however, separation, divorce, and children born during marriage to third party fathers is relatively common, and it is considerably less apparent that application of the presumption to all cases in which the child was conceived or born during the marriage is fair. Accordingly, consistent with the ever-present guiding principle of our law, <em>cesscmte ratione legis cessat et ipsa lex, </em>we hold that the presumption of paternity applies in any case where the policies which underlie the presumption, stated <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>above, would be advanced by its application, and in other cases, it does not apply.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The wife gave birth to three minor children, one in 1939, one in 1942 and one in 1943. The children were given the name Owens; they lived with Owens and never with Cairgle; and Owens, not Cairgle, supported them. After the husband, Cairgle, died of silicosis in 1948, the wife sought to collect benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act for her children. In order to be entitled to these benefits, she was required to prove that her children were "legitimate.'' <a href="/pa/366/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="366 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="8845417" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0249-01">366 Pa. at 254-55</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20439" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="77 A.2d 439">77 A.2d at 442</a>.

In other words, the wife’s lack of credibility and her life with Owens rebutted the presumption.

Non-access is defined by the majority in this case to mean “that it was physically impossible for the presumptive father and mother to have had sexual relations.” I find the majority’s definition of non-access unnecessarily restrictive for the reasons articulated by Madame Justice Newman in footnote eight of her concurring and dissenting opinion. The testimony of Lisa Brinkley that she and her former husband did not have sexual relations during the period of conception was sufficient to establish non-access and to overcome the presumption.

Lisa testified that King's wife knew that he was giving Lisa money for child support and that Mrs. King was the person writing the check for the support. King had been giving Lisa $100 per month but when she told him she needed more money to support Audrianna, he refused. Lisa then threatened to take him to court to compel him to give her more money. It appears that Mrs. King then agreed to begin giving Lisa $150 per month, however the payments ceased once Lisa filed the Complaint for Support.</p>

For example, in 1992, a controversy arose surrounding the lead character of the popular television show "Murphy Brown.” Murphy Brown, a successful, single newswoman, became pregnant, chose not to have an abortion, and decided to have the baby out of wedlock. Despite the television show's presentation of a common situation in our society, some were nevertheless unwilling to acknowledge the frequency with which women are faced with this choice. While some applauded Murphy’s decision not to have an abortion, then Vice President, Dan Quayle, criticized the television situation comedy for depicting a scenario that, to him, typified the collapse of the family values in our country. Clearly, we continue to battle the preconception of the typical "traditional” family with the reality of the makeup of the modern family.</p>

Currently, to prove a putative father's paternity of a child born during wedlock, the challenging party must first rebut the husband’s paternity with evidence of non-access, impotency, sterility or blood tests excluding him as the father. Scientific tests then establish the putative father’s paternity. To promote efficiency and reduce the costs, time and effort involved in this determination, I would invite the Legislature to enact a provision that would permit a party to disprove the husband’s paternity with evidence that indicates a 99% or greater probability that the putative father is the biological father. Thus, one round of testing of the mother, the child and the putative father could both disprove the husband’s paternity, and prove the putative father's parentage.</p>
