Pursuant to a Notice of Compensation Payable, K-Mart began paying benefits for total disability at the rate of $121.00 per week. In July of 1983, K-Mart filed a petition to terminate benefits, asserting that King was no longer disabled. In support of its petition, K-Mart presented the deposition testimony of Dr. John T. Williams, who had examined King on July 14, 1983, and was unable to find any cause or explanation for her complaints of pain. He offered the opinion that King was able to return to her normal work duties. King presented the deposition testimony of Dr. Ronald B. Greene, who had examined her on February 17, 1984. He described King’s condition as chronic coccydynia<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and opined that she was permanently disabled from working. In July of 1987, the referee denied the termination petition based on his finding that Greene’s testimony was more persuasive than Williams’s.</p>

In support of this petition, K-Mart presented the deposition of Dr. Marc Manzione, who had examined King on August 8, 1989, and found no objective physical basis for King’s complaints of pain. King presented the deposition of Dr. Andrew Newman, who examined her on May 3, 1990, and the earlier deposition of Dr. Greene. King also testified herself, as did her husband.</p>

The referee found Dr. Newman’s testimony less credible than Dr. Manzione’s, and therefore accepted Dr. Manzione’s conclusions and rejected Dr. Newman’s. He found that, “As of the date of Manzione’s examination, Ms. King was fully recovered from her work-related injury. Any disability that she suffered from was the result of some other cause and not related to her <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>work injury.” The referee rejected King’s argument that because of the result of the earlier petition K-Mart was barred by res judicata from bringing this petition.</p>

Unfortunately, the remainder of the Commonwealth Court opinion gave no indication of the reason for the citation to <em>Hebden </em>or the part it played in the analysis and decision of this case. It is thus unclear whether the court found our decision in <em>Hebden </em>controlling in this case, or whether the court was merely reiterating the language of its own decision in <em>Hebden </em>with respect to the doctrine of res judicata, finding our decision inapplicable but discussing it simply as the later history of the cited case. We find our <em>Hebden </em>decision entirely inapplicable.</p>

The employer later sought modification. In the course of explaining their opinion that the claimant was not disabled, the employer’s medical experts testified that the claimant had bronchial asthma, not pneumoconiosis. One of these doctors conceded on cross-examination that if the claimant did not have pneumoconiosis at the time the doctor examined the claimant, he would not have had it <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>previously.

The testimony of Dr. Manzione suggested that coccydynia “generally responds to conservative treatment” that protects the area of the coccyx from direct pressure, and that injections and surgery may be employed to relieve the pain. Thus at the very least, K-Mart produced evidence that the condition King had been diagnosed with was changeable.</p>

    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[154,552,1152,482]]]'>The reason for such a requirement is perhaps best stated by the learned Judge Glenn E. Mencer in <em>Banks v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>15 Pa.Cmwlth. at 377, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="327 A.2d 404">327 A.2d at 406</a>, “[ajbsent the requirement of showing a change in disability, a disgruntled employer (or claimant) could repeatedly attack what he considers an erroneous decision of a referee by filing petitions for modification based on the same evidence as infinitum, in the hope that one referee would finally decide in his favor.”</p>
    <p id="b165-5" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[153,1078,1154,425]]]'>In the case <em>sub justice </em>K-Mart offered a change in condition since the 1983 termination petition proceedings by presenting expert medical testimony of the 1989 examination of Ms. King and the expert’s conclusion that Ms. King’s subjective complaints of pain, at the time of the second examination, were unfounded. Thus, the Act’s requirement of proving a change in condition since the last determination regarding the extent of the claimant’s injury was met.</p>
    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.6",165,[153,1547,1154,805]]]'>Further, I believe that consideration of the timing of the filing of repeat termination petitions is critical to protect a party from vexatious litigation. While the Act allows a party to seek modification of benefits based upon a change in physical condition at any time, this court noted in <em>Kachinski </em>that, “the viability of this system depends on the good faith of the participants.” <em>Kachinski, </em><a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">516 Pa. at 252</a>, 532 A.2d at 380. Penalty provisions of the Act, such as section 440, 77 P.S. § 996, which allow for the assessment of attorneys fees and costs against an insurer which contests, without a reasonable basis, a compensation claim, are consistent with requiring parties to proceed in good faith. More specifically, prior case law has focused on the time between the filing of petitions as indicia of whether a claim for modification was brought in good faith. <em>Cf Airco-Speer; Banks.</em>

      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>I suggest that a determination of whether a party is proceeding in good faith, and, thus, whether benefits should be terminated, must include as a primary element of consideration, the timing of the filing of repeat termination petitions. I submit that a reasonable period of time must pass between the filing of termination petitions. While what constitutes a “reasonable” period of time will differ with the facts and circumstances of each case, I believe that only in rare cases should a petition to terminate benefits, which is filed within the same year as a previous petition, lead to a termination of a claimant’s benefits. This respite would help to prevent vexatious litigation, promote judicial economy, and establish respect for judicial judgments, thus, ensuring the ‘Viability of the system.” <em>Kachinski.</em>
