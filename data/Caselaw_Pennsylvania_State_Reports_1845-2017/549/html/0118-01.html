Pa.R.C.P.1915.1 defines “custody” as “the legal right to keep, control, guard, care for and preserve a child.... ” The term “custody” includes legal and/or physical custody. “Legal” custody is the “legal right to make major decisions affecting the best interests of a minor child, including but not limited to, medical, religious and educational decisions.” “Physical” custody is defined as “actual physical possession and control of a child.”</p>

The record demonstrates that the child resides full-time in appellee’s home.

However, we cannot agree with the Superior Court that a “literal” interpretation of the phrase “physical custody” is sufficient to create standing to bring an action for child support. <a href="/pa-super/449/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="449 Pa.

This entire argument rests upon the assumption that appellee, in fact, has physical control of the child because the child resides in his home and appellee’s spouse has legal and physical custody of the child. That assumption reads more into the record of this case than exists. The court order awarding temporary legal and physical custody to Gloria Larson does not confer any legal rights upon appellee. It would be just as logical to assume from the absence of appellee’s name in the custody order that it would not be in the best interests of the child to confer any legal rights upon appellee on behalf of the child.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[173,1066,1153,688]]]'>The right to child support belongs to the child and should only be asserted by a party who possesses a legal right to act on behalf of the child. Gloria Larson possesses the legal right to proceed with an action for support and has chosen not to sue for support. If appellee truly believes that decision is not in the best interest of the child then, as the trial court aptly noted, “the appropriate avenue to lodge a complaint is in the custody arena, not an ‘end run’ in support court.” (tr. ct. op. at 2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The creation of a doctrine of “de facto” standing to enable a person in possession of a minor child, in the absence of a formal custody order or agreement, to sue for support would only serve to further complicate this area of the law.</p>

The rules governing support actions do not require such a result and the majority’s decision goes against the best interests of a child who has no legal custodian protecting him.</p>
    <p id="b207-8" data-blocks='[["BL_207.9",207,[173,1134,1152,400]]]'>As recognized by the majority, standing to bring an action for child support is governed by Rule of Civil Procedure 1910.3. Relevant to this case, Rule 1910.3 states that a support action shall be brought “on behalf of a minor child by a person having custody of the minor, without appointment as guardian ad litem.” Pa. R. Civ. P.1910.3(2). Thus, Appellee has standing to seek support if he has custody of Appellant’s child.</p>
    <p id="b207-9" data-blocks='[["BL_207.10",207,[173,1563,1153,515]]]'>The Rules of Civil Procedure governing support actions do not define custody. Where a legal custodian fails to seek child support from a natural parent, Rule 1910.3 does not preclude another custodian from protecting the child and seeking support on his behalf. Rule 1910.3 simply confers standing upon a person with custody. As it is undisputed that Appellant’s child resides with Appellee and Appellee financially supports him, Appellee has <em>de facto </em>physical custody and thus has standing. Appellee also has <em>de facto </em>physical custody by virtue of the court’s award of physical custody to his wife.</p>

In this context, custody is defined as the <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>legal right to care for a child and includes legal, physical and shared custody. <em><a href="/pa-super/398/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="398 Pa.
