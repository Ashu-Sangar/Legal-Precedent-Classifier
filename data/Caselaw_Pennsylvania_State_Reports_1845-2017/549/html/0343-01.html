The Commonwealth sought once again to proceed against appellant for a fourth time. This decision was based upon the Commonwealth’s contention that the co-defendant driver had not fully revealed all relevant evidence during his preliminary hearing testimony but that after consulting with his attorney, he was willing to provide additional information to assist the Commonwealth in making a <em>prima facie </em>case against appellant. Accordingly, the Commonwealth is not attempting to proceed against appellant yet another time with the “same” evidence. Rather, as a result of the co-defendant’s <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>consultation with his own attorney, the co-defendant was willing to fully cooperate with the prosecutor and to provide new evidence against appellant.</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[233,480,1163,797]]]'>The parties readily acknowledge that there is no authority expressly limiting the number of times the Commonwealth may rearrest a person for the same criminal episode. Rather, the only prohibition appears to be that the Commonwealth may not continue to rearrest a person and pursue the same charges if such action is undertaken simply to harass the accused or is undertaken in bad faith. As I believe that the Commonwealth now has access to new evidence, albeit from an existing witness who previously testified, and that there is no evidence that the felony charges are being pursued simply to harass appellant, I would affirm the Superior Court’s holding. I would further add that even if an abuse of discretion standard applied, I would find that the trial court abused its discretion in this case by not allowing the Commonwealth to proceed under the circumstances of this case.</p>

Presumably, no record was made in this regard since the Commonwealth believed it could always rearrest appellant under the existing law, notwithstanding the reasons for the continuances.</p>
