On the evening of January 23, 1993, Appellant and his co-defendant, Derrick Teagle, drove to a Sav-A-Lot supermarket in Philadelphia with the intention of robbing it. Both men were armed with handguns, but Teagle’s was not functioning due to a broken firing mechanism.</p>

    <p id="b103-8" data-blocks='[["BL_103.7",103,[144,1767,1153,258]]]'>A few minutes later, they returned. Teagle pointed his gun at Buchanan, and Appellant ordered her to open the store’s safe.

When he saw the robbery taking place, he pulled down the metal grating that secures the entrance to the store during non-business hours. Appellant and Teagle, however, noticed this happening.

Lawson then began to chase after Appellant. When he saw Lawson pursuing him, Appellant turned and fired, hitting Lawson in the head. Appellant and Teagle then left the scene.

The officers responded by showing Appellant an eight-by-ten inch photograph of himself. At that point, Appellant admitted that he was indeed Anthony Washington and submitted to the arrest. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/6/94, at 52-55.</p>

In the instant case, even assuming that the admission of Teagle’s redacted statement infringed upon Appellant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause, the error was indeed harmless and did not prejudice Appellant. Any evidence of Appellant’s involvement in the shooting that could be inferred from Teagle’s confession was merely cumulative of other, properly admitted evidence indicating his guilt. Officer Smith was an eyewitness to the shooting of Tracey Lawson. He identified Appellant as the shooter in a photo array, at a line-up, at the preliminary hearing, and at trial. Juana Robles also identified Appellant at trial as the shooter. Both Martha and Melissa Harrington testified that Appellant admitted to them that he had committed the killing in the course of robbing the Sav-A-Lot. Further, Elijah Washington testified that on the night of the shooting, Appellant asked him to drive Teagle home because the police might be looking for Appellant and Teagle. Also, when arrested, Appellant tried to deceive the arresting officers and submitted to the arrest only after a photograph clearly indicated that the officers were not mistaken in their identification. Finally, the ballistics evidence indicated that the bullet that killed Lawson did not come from Officer Smith’s handgun.</p>

On cross-examination, the prosecution questioned the grandmother about her knowledge of Appellant’s prior convictions for auto theft. Appellant suggests that there was no evidentiary basis for the prosecutor’s cross-examination. He claims that his prior convictions were irrelevant, did not rebut his grandmother’s testimony, and were raised in an attempt to prejudice him in the eyes of the jurors.

Appellant suggests that the prosecution's comments were improper because he knew the juiy could not take Teagle’s statement into deliberations. He further claims that these comments were another impermissible attempt to use Teagle's statement to demonstrate Appellant's guilt. He forwards these arguments in support of a claim that defense counsel was ineffective for not specifically objecting to the three above-quoted comments.</p>
      <p id="b112-8" data-blocks='[["BL_112.7",112,[265,1809,1132,587]]]'>This claim is meritless. To establish the ineffective assistance of counsel, Appellant must demonstrate (1) that the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) that counsel’s course of conduct was without a reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client's interest; and (3) that he was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. <em>See Commonwealth v. Howard, </em><a href="/pa/538/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="174" data-cite="538 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="475553" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0086-01">538 Pa. 86</a>, 93, <a href="/pa/538/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="175" data-cite="645 A.2d 1300" data-case-ids="475553,7874424" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0086-01,/a2d/645/1300-01">645 A.2d 1300</a>, 1304 (1994). For the reasons already discussed in the body of this opinion, we find no merit to Appellant's underlying claim of prosecutorial misconduct. Moreover, we believe that the prosecution’s invitation to the jury to "read” Teagle's statement was simply a rhetorical device intended to convey the prosecution’s belief that the details of the statement were clear and unequivocal. Further, we note that the jury did not take Teagle's statement into their deliberations. Thus, we find that Appellant has failed to establish the prejudice necessary to support his claim of ineffectiveness. Accordingly, the claim fails.</p>
