At approximately 2:30 a.m. on May 7, 1992, Frank Nardone and Appellant, a black male, went to Purgatory, an after-hours nightclub in Philadelphia. Kimberly Griffith, a twenty-seven year old white female who worked at the club as a part-time bartender, was present with a friend. Appellant, Nardone, and Griffith, all of whom knew each other,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> began to socialize.</p>

Once there, Appellant and Griffith ingested cocaine in Nardone’s kitchen and bedroom. Appellant and Nardone then began giving Griffith a massage. Nardone, however, was intoxicated and soon passed out. At 1:30 p.m. that afternoon, Nardone awoke and discovered Griffith’s naked and battered body lying on a couch in his living room. After Nardone and a neighbor determined that she was dead, they summoned the police. Later that day, the <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>body was taken to the Medical Examiner’s office. An autopsy indicated that Griffith had died of strangulation, performed manually and with a cord,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and had been beaten and dragged along the floor. The examination also revealed injuries to the vagina and anus, indicating forced sexual penetration. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/25/94, at 90-92, 101-03. Analysis of sperm found in the victim’s vagina indicated that the sperm could not have come from Nardone, but could have come from Appellant. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/24/94, at 145. At trial, the medical examiner stated that Griffith had survived for thirty to sixty minutes after the onset of the attack. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/25/94, at 103, 105. The medical examiner also stated that the death had occurred between 5:00 a.m. and approximately 9:00 a.m. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/27/94, at 128,143.</p>

He stated that he had had consensual sex -with Griffith after Nardone fell asleep. He also stated that the victim was alive when he left Nardone’s house. During the interview, police observed scratch marks on Appellant’s arms and body and a bruise in the shape of a straight line on the back of his right hand. He explained that one of the scratches was made by Griffith while he was having sex with her. He could not explain the others. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/24/94, at 193-94. At trial, Appellant indicated that he left the nightclub with Nardone and the victim around 4:00 a.m. and that he left Nardone’s house at approximately 10:00 a.m. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/26/94, at 140,184.</p>

Moreover, at trial, the preliminary hearing testimony of Frank Nardone was read into evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> In that testimony, Nardone identified the body he discovered in his living room as that of Kimberly Griffith. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/24/94, at 230-32, 239. Further, there was testimony concerning both the transportation of Griffith’s body from the crime scene to the Medical Examiner’s office and regarding the autopsy performed on her remains. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/24/94, at 130-31; 10/25/94, at 85-106. Moreover, Appellant himself testified that he knew the victim as “Kim” prior to the date of the killing, and that he had known her for five or six years. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/19/94, at 92.

Rule 305(B)(1) states, in pertinent part: “In all court cases, on request by the defendant, ... the Commonwealth shall dis<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>close to the defendant’s attorney all of the following requested items or information, provided they are material to the instant case____” The Rule then sets out the seven categories of evidence that this language applies to.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> The names and statements of prior assault victims such as Cardinal, Gogos, and Berson do not fall within any of these categories. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 305(B)(1)(a)—(g).

I write separately, however, to express my disagreement with the conclusion that sufficient evidence supported the aggravating circumstance of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8). Because there was sufficient evidence supporting the aggravating circumstance that the killing was committed while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and no mitigating circumstances were found, the death sentence may be affirmed despite this conclusion. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 971 l(h)(3)(ii).</p>
