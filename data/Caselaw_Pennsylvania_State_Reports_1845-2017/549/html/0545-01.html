This time, the record reflects that the Commonwealth objected to the trial court’s proposal to submit written instructions to the jury on direct and circumstantial evidence.

The trial court overruled the Commonwealth’s objection and ultimately decided to submit written instructions which defined direct and circumstantial evidence since this was a practice the trial court had successfully followed in the past in order to resolve jury confusion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <blockquote id="b631-8" data-blocks='[["BL_631.8",631,[219,1462,1121,270]]]'>(2) The other type is circumstantial evidence, which is testimony about facts which point to the existence of other facts which are in question. Whether or not circumstantial evidence is proof of other facts in question depends in part on the application of common sense and human experience.

      <blockquote id="b631-9" data-blocks='[["BL_631.9",631,[219,1738,1119,192]]]'>(3) In deciding whether or not to accept circumstantial evidence as proof of facts in question you must be satisfied, first, that the testimony of the witness is truthful and accurate and second, that the existence of the facts the witness testifies to leads to the conclusion that the facts in question happened.</blockquote>

If there are several separate pieces of circumstantial evidence, it is not necessary that each piece standing separately convince you of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, before you may find the defendant guilty, all the pieces of circumstantial evidence, when considered together, must reasonably and naturally lead to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty and must convince you of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words you may find the defendant guilty based on circumstantial evidence alone, but only if the total amount and quality of that evidence convince you of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>
