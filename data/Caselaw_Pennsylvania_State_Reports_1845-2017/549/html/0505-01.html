According to the affidavit, Special Agent John Jefferson of the Criminal Investigation and Prosecution Section of the Attorney General’s office interviewed an unidentified confidential source who had identified himself as a non-lawyer and who had served as a runner for lawyers and health care providers in southeastern Pennsylvania over a period of six years beginning in 1987. <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>The source identified Purl and Bagenstos as individuals who had paid him money for client referrals in the past.</p>

The confidential source introduced the agent to Purl. Purl interviewed the agent and introduced him to Bagenstos, advising the agent that Bagenstos would be handling the accident case. Subsequent to the initial meeting, the agent signed documents to retain the lawyers to represent him in legal matters relating to the fabricated accident.</p>

The municipal court judge rejected the latter two assertions, but agreed with Appellees’ assertion that § 4117(b)(1) was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The charges against the Appellees were dismissed. The Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court denied the Commonwealth’s appeal. This direct appeal followed.</p>
