PHICO took the position that the excess portion of the settlement should be allocated on an equal shares basis with each insurer matching dollar for dollar payments up to the limits of the lower policy, and with any remaining portion of the loss being paid from the larger policy up to its limits.

Thus, application of the policy limits method would result in PHICO being apportioned ten-elevenths of the excess loss ($10,000, 000.00/$11,000,000.00), and American Casualty being apportioned one-eleventh of the excess loss ($1,000,000.00/11,000,-000.00).</p>

This argument is meritless. American Casualty itself acknowledges that the PHICO excess policy incorporates only those terms of the primary policy "which are not inconsistent with the provisions, terms, conditions and exclusions of this policy....” R.R. at 100a. As noted above, the "other insurance” clause in the PHICO excess policy states that PHICO would pay only after other applicable insurance policies had been exhausted. This clause clearly establishes that the PHICO excess policy will not share liability with another carrier. Such a clause, with its unmistakable antipathy to sharing liability with another insurer, is directly contrary to the primary policy’s provision that PHICO will share liability pro rata. Thus, since the allocation by pro rata clause in the primary policy is inconsistent with the “other insurance” clause in the excess policy, the primary policy's allocation clause is not incorporated into the excess policy.</p>

The majority method of prorating proceeds primarily upon the premise that because the higher policy limit insurer receives more premium payments, he should pay a greater part of any loss incurred. If one accepts the contention of many courts that premium charges do not increase proportionally with the amount of coverage, much of the appeal of the majority method of prorating disappears. The principal arguments in favor of the majority method are then reduced to (1) there is some, though not a proportional, increase in premiums accompanying an increase in policy coverage; and (2) the majority method is usually a simple way of arriving at a prorating formula. Thus the majority method is based on a partial fiction (proportionali<a id="p692" href="#p692" data-label="692" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*692</a>ty between premium charges and maximum policy limits). There is, of course, some increase in premium charges with increased policy limits. This is so particularly when the loss in an occurrence is less than the maximum coverage of either policy. There is not, however, proportionate increase. The majority method of prorating operates inequitably in its differentiating treatment of the high-loss and low-loss insurer. In return for a greater premium the insurer providing higher coverage has undertaken to protect the insured against accidents involving high losses. Yet because of this undertaking to protect against high loss the larger insurer is in an unfavorable position vis-a-vis the other insurer even in cases of low loss, since under the majority method of prorating the insurer affording the greater maximum coverage pays the greater segment of any loss incurred, regardless of the amount of loss. This seems inequitable since both insurers have equally undertaken to insure against the low-loss accident.</blockquote>
