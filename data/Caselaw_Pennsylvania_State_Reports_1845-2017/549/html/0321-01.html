Appellant suspected that the guards were going to search the cell he shared with co-defendant Anthony Allen, so he told Allen that they had to be ready when the guards came. Appellant then put six “D” batteries into a pillow case and handed it to Allen. When the guards arrived at the cell, they informed Appellant that they were simply conducting a rou<a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>tine linen check.

One of these pre-trial proceedings was an October 14, 1994, <em>habeas corpus </em>hearing. The other pre-trial proceeding was the July 19,1995 hearing on pre-trial motions concerning the suppression of evidence, the severance of his trial from his co-defendant and a Rule 1100 violation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Also, the evidence demonstrates that the same assistant public defender who represented appellant at the pre-trial hearings was present and acted as counsel during the jury venire process. It was only after the jury was chosen that appellant made his wishes known to the trial court that he did not want to be represented by the assistant public defender. After being told of this, the trial court granted appellant’s wish to dismiss his attorney and the trial court informed appellant that the same assistant public defender was going to remain in the courtroom as standby counsel so that appellant could consult with standby counsel any time he desired.</p>
    <p id="b411-4" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[190,1331,1157,906]],["BL_412.1",412,[243,303,1159,462]]]'>Appellant apparently understood the ramifications of this colloquy and the availability of assistance from the court appointed standby counsel since the record demonstrates that appellant availed himself of standby counsel’s assistance throughout trial. In particular, appellant conferred with his standby counsel on three occasions during appellant’s cross-examination of the Commonwealth’s witnesses. (N.T. 7/20/95 at pp. 54, 55, 83). Standby counsel also reported to the trial court that while he was outside the courtroom during a break, he observed one of the Commonwealth’s witnesses who just completed testifying discussing his testimony with a Commonwealth witness who had yet to take the stand. Also, following the close of the testimony, appellant requested the trial court to permit standby counsel to make closing argument on his behalf. After the trial court approved the request, standby counsel gave a closing argument in which he discussed the elements of each crime of which appellant was charged and <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>where appropriate, pointed out why the Commonwealth failed to prove a particular element. Moreover, prior to the jury charge, standby counsel made a motion for judgment of acquittal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Furthermore, standby counsel also requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the theories of abandonment and renunciation of a conspiracy as well as accomplice liability since the evidence suggested that appellant may have terminated his role in the conspiracy prior to the commission of certain offenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[241,797,1160,902]]]'>Moreover, when a totality of the circumstances test is applied to the facts of this case, it becomes apparent that appellant should not receive a new trial because he fails to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s failure to conduct a more extensive colloquy. Here, appellant alleges he was prejudiced from the failure to receive a more extensive colloquy because he did not request that Commonwealth witnesses be sequestered and he failed to more thoroughly cross-examine Commonwealth witnesses. However, the record shows that the Commonwealth voluntarily sequestered its witnesses. Also, appellant fails to explain how a more thorough cross-examination of the Commonwealth witnesses would have revealed new evidence which would have changed the verdict since the facts, as recounted by the majority, were straightforward and do not appear to be in dispute. Thus, I believe that the record does not demonstrate that appellant suffered prejudice from the trial court’s colloquy in this case.</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[240,1722,1159,418]],["BL_413.1",413,[194,308,1153,467]]]'>Based on the above, the record demonstrates that appellant effectively was represented by counsel throughout the entire process, including his trial. I believe it is a great disservice to the interests of justice for the majority to permit appellant to refuse representation at trial and now prevail on appeal because of the allegation that he was denied adequate representation even though the record shows that appellant obtained the benefit of standby counsel’s legal advice and legal <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>arguments throughout his trial as well as the fact that appellant cannot demonstrate any prejudice from the trial court’s failure to conduct a more thorough colloquy. Thus, under a totality of the circumstances analysis, I believe that appellant was more than adequately represented by counsel during trial and hence, the trial court’s colloquy was sufficient. Therefore, I would affirm the order of the Superior Court which affirmed the trial court’s judgment of sentence. Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>
