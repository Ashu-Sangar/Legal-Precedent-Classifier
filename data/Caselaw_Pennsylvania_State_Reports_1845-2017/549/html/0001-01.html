To hold that a claim accrues solely when a party is able to prepare a detailed statement of the claim, would negatively impact both contractors and the Commonwealth by encouraging needless and premature litigation. Specifically, any time the Commonwealth does not pay an invoice within six months, a contractor will be forced to file a precautionary law suit or risk being barred at a later time due to the running of the statute of limitations. Of course, there are many reasons why an invoice may not be paid within six short months which have nothing to do with a refusal of payment. Nevertheless, to protect itself in the event of a subsequent refusal to pay, a prudent contractor will initiate a prophylactic action or be subject to the possibly ruinous effects of the statute of limitations.</p>
