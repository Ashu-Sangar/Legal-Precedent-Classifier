The parties married in Ankara, Turkey in 1982, and settled immediately in Belgium, where Father had already worked for two years as a civil engineer for the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers of Europe (SHAPE), the military arm of NATO. They have three children, all of whom were born in Belgium: a daughter, Cigdem, born in 1985; a son, Alper, born in 1986; and another daughter, Aylin, born in 1991. At the time the instant action began, the two older children were attending the British school on the SHAPE base, and the youngest daughter was enrolled in a Belgian kindergarten.</p>

Mother appealed the trial court’s determination regarding jurisdiction to the Superior Court, and Father appealed the grant of the supersedeas.

A year later, both parties moved to Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, where the court of common pleas entered a consent decree transferring custody to the father. Shortly after that, the mother moved to Argentina with the children, who would spend approximately four months of vacation each year with their father in the United States. This pattern continued from 1974 through 1979, when the father informed the mother that he intended to keep the children permanently. Following a hearing, the trial court determined that it had jurisdiction, and issued an order awarding custody of the children to their father. On appeal, <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>the Superior Court affirmed, and noted that the mother, by agreeing to modification of the Virginia decree in a Pennsylvania court, had placed custody under the jurisdiction of this Commonwealth. In the instant matter, however, there was no preexisting order granting custody to one parent, and.the childrens’ annual three-week visit to their grandparents’ home is qualitatively and quantitatively different from the Hattoum children’s four month stays with their father in Pennsylvania.</p>

She continued to live in the same city, and visited the children every day. The court entered a divorce decree in May of 1980, with custody given to the father, who was a member of the armed forces. In March of 1981, the mother moved to her hometown in Elk County, Pennsylvania. The father brought the children to their mother for an extended visit in 1981 and in 1982. While the children were visiting in 1982, the mother filed a custody petition in the court of common pleas. The trial court recognized that Texas was the children’s home state, but noted that the military had transferred the father to California for a temporary duty assignment before he brought the children to their mother. Moreover, at the time of the hearing, the father was uncertain where the military would post him at the end of his stay in California. Because of the “diminishing connections” between the father, the children and Texas, the trial court determined that it would be in the best interests of the children for Pennsylvania to retain jurisdiction.</p>

If so, the trial court must determine whether it is in the best interest of the children for the court to exercise jurisdiction. In the instant matter, the Court fulfilled this obligation by addressing Section 5344(a)(2) in its Opinion, and noting, “The children simply have no significant connection to this Commonwealth. Their sole connection with Pennsylvania is that they have occasionally traveled to Norristown to visit their maternal grandparents.” Trial Court Opinion, May 1, 1995 at 4. Although not a detailed analysis, our review of the record shows that the trial court correctly identified the children’s strongest connection to Pennsylvania.</p>

The first three factors cannot be considered maximum contacts. Furthermore, the fact that “there is available in this Commonwealth substantial evidence concerning the present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships of the child(ren),” Section 5344(a)(2)(h), because of their presence here since December 1994, is of no moment because jurisdiction is determined at the time the action is commenced. <em>Black, </em><a href="/pa-super/441/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="441 Pa.

We find no basis in the UCCJA or in our case law to support the conclusion that a balancing of interests analysis is appropriate for determining whether the Commonwealth has jurisdiction of a custody matter. Pennsylvania either meets the criteria for jurisdiction pursuant to Section 5344(a)-(c), or it does not, without considering any other forum. The sole exception is that where no other state has jurisdiction, or another state has declined jurisdiction in favor of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth may determine custody if to do so is in the best interest of the child. Section 5344(d). This is not true here, because the children have extensive contacts with Belgium, a country that has exercised jurisdiction over their custody.
