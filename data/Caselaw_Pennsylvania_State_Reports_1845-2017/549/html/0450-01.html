The first claim is that counsel failed to “life-qualify” the jury. During voir dire, the prospective jurors were asked by the court whether they had any moral, religious or ethical beliefs that would prevent them from voting for the death penalty in a proper case. This inquiry has come to be known as “death-qualifying” the jury, as its purpose is to exclude jurors who are not qualified to serve because they could not follow the law and impose the death penalty even where the law requires them to do so. Hardcastle argues that counsel should have asked the prospective jurors whether they had any beliefs that would prevent them from voting for life imprisonment in an appropriate case, or whether they would automatically vote for the death penalty upon a conviction of first degree murder.</p>

    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[226,732,1163,636]]]'>We next consider the argument that counsel failed to properly investigate certain facts. The context of this claim is the testimony of several Commonwealth witnesses, Jeanette High and Anthony Evans. High testified that she saw a man, whom she described in detail but could not identify, leave the victims’ house on Stewart Street, turn right (east), and then right again (south) across a basketball court. Evans testified that he saw Hardcastle, whom he knew, by a vacant lot near his house on Sharswood Street, which is immediately south of Stewart Street. Evans’s description of Hardcastle corresponded with High’s description of the man she saw, and both sightings occurred at about the same time.</p>
    <p id="b538-6" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[225,1395,1163,412]]]'>Hardcastle refers to various street maps and photographs of the site and suggests that people who lived in the neighborhood could testify to the configuration of lots and fences there. He asserts that an investigation of these things by counsel would have revealed that it would have been physically impossible for him to have followed the path described by High and then be seen near Evans’s house at approximately the same time.</p>

For example, we indicated that Evans testified that he observed Hardcastle “stumbling through <em>the vacant lot next to Joseph Gregg’s house,” </em><a href="/pa/519/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="519 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1813556" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0236-01">519 Pa. at 248</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="519 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1813556" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0236-01">546 A.2d at 1107</a> (emphasis added). Later, we wrote that “a man matching appellant’s description was seen running out of the victim’s house. It was at this time that the fire was discovered. The man was carrying a box and ran through the vacant lot next to the victim’s home. Approximately the same time a witness observed appellant <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>stumbling out of the rear <em>of the same vacant lot. </em>Appellant was carrying a carton box filled with liquor and beer.” <em><a href="/pa/519/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="519 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1813556" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0236-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/519/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="519 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1813556" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0236-01">at 251</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="519 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1813556" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0236-01">546 A.2d at 1108</a> (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[201,493,1155,574]]]'>Hardcastle’s “physical impossibility” argument depends almost entirely on a variance between these summaries and the layout of the area. That is, the basketball court next to the victims’ house and the vacant lot next to Evans’s house are not one and the same place. As the Commonwealth notes in its brief, however, and as is confirmed by a review of the trial transcripts, contrary to the description in our prior opinion Evans did not testify that he saw Hardcastle come out of the lot next to the victims’ house. Rather, he testified that he saw Hardcastle stumbling and <em>guessed </em>that he had been <em>in the lot next to Evans’s house.</em>

A single person could easily have been seen by High running from the victims’ house on Stewart Street then through the basketball court, and been seen moments later by Evans stumbling in front of the vacant lot next to his house on Sharswood Street.</p>
    <p id="b539-7" data-blocks='[["BL_539.6",539,[197,1710,1158,367]]]'>As the common pleas court observed, the configuration of the area was fully explored at trial with the testimony of High, Evans, and the investigating police officer. The record plainly refutes the argument that through more diligent investigation counsel could have discovered a different set of facts that would have raised a reasonable doubt as to whether High and Evans were describing the same man.</p>
    <p id="b539-8" data-blocks='[["BL_539.7",539,[197,2104,1153,258]]]'>Hardcastle makes two other claims of ineffective assistance that are tangentially related to Jeanette High’s testimony.

It is argued that counsel should have objected because the witness referred to is unquestionably Jeanette High, and through discovery materials counsel should have known that she could not identify the person she saw coming out of the house as Hardcastle, even though she knew him.</p>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[234,820,1158,194]]]'>We agree -with the Commonwealth that this argument is “particularly baseless.” The excerpt from the transcript in the Appellant’s brief conveniently omits what the prosecutor said next:</p>

    <p id="b540-8" data-blocks='[["BL_540.8",540,[232,1430,1159,149]]]'>Hardcastle also argues that counsel failed to object to portions of the prosecutor’s closing argument that mischaracterized High’s testimony. The prosecutor stated:</p>

    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[196,767,1154,796]]]'>Once again, the supposedly objectionable comment is taken out of context. The transcript reveals that almost immediately thereafter the prosecutor continued by stating “the person went through this back yard. Now that back yard leads to all this lot area, leads to Sharswood Street through the basketball court....” Thus the prosecutor acknowledged High’s testimony that she saw the person run through the basketball court, but broke the sequence into separate elements, focusing on the person’s passage through the yard before the basketball court. Not only was this an accurate reflection of High’s testimony, see N.T. 11/30/82, 103-04, it was made in response to defense counsel’s argument, which suggested that the person seen by High went directly from the house to the basketball court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> For all of these reasons there is no merit to the argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to object.</p>

Harris, a friend of Hardcastle, was presented as a character witness by the defense during the penalty hearing. On cross-examination, he testified that he came home on the night, of the incident to find Hardcastle sitting on his steps, needing a place to stay. He indicated that he arrived home at around 12:30 a.m. and that Hardcastle stayed with him until around 10:00 a.m. Since the fire started around 1:30 a.m., and High, Evans, and others testified to seeing Hardcastle or someone who fit his description at about that time, the argument is that <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>counsel should have offered Harris as an alibi witness because his testimony placed Hardcastle at a different place.</p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[229,447,1170,887]]]'>In ruling on this argument, the common pleas court observed that counsel had met with Harris prior to trial, and there is no indication in the record or, significantly, in the extensive post-conviction documents submitted by Hardcastle pro se, that counsel knew or should have known that Harris was a potential alibi witness. Harris’s statement as to the time he encountered Hardcastle, which was given in response to the prosecutor’s question during cross-examination, was never probed for accuracy. It is thus an exceptionally flimsy foundation for a claim that Harris should have been presented ■ as an alibi witness. This is especially true in light of the fact that such an alibi would have contradicted the defense strategy acknowledging Hardcastle’s presence in the area but emphasizing the lack of direct evidence placing him inside the victims’ house or tying him to the killings and the fire (an eminently reasonable strategy given the eyewitness identification testimony of persons who knew Hardcastle).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Hardcastle contends that this argument was improper because it was not supported by the record. He points to the medical examiner’s testimony that both of the victims were dead before the fire started. The Commonwealth responds that the prosecutor was focusing on Hardcastle’s state of mind at the time he set the fire, not on whether the victims were in fact dead.
