The tractor belonged to Marks’s neighbor, Walter F. Merriman. Patricia Marks, the decedent’s wife and administratrix of his estate, sued Merriman under the Wrongful Death and Survival Acts. She also claimed damages ■ on her own behalf for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>

Merriman’s defense asserted that the accident was caused by Marks’s own negligence in operating the tractor too close to the edge of an embankment. Merriman died prior to trial and Mary Lou Swayne, administratrix of his estate, was substituted as the defendant. A jury found for Patricia Marks on all claims and awarded $989,875 on the wrongful death and survival counts and $40,000 for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The jury attributed 8% of the causal negligence to the decedent, and the judgment was molded to reflect this reduction as well as an added amount for delay damages.</p>
