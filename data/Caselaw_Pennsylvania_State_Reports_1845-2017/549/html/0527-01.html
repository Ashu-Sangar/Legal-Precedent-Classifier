We granted allowance of appeal in this matter to determine whether the Lycoming County prosecution of Lisa M.

For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Lycoming County prosecution is not barred and therefore affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>

Jewelry Enterprise (“G.M. Jewelry”) in Harrisburg, Dauphin County. Appellant’s name and correct address appeared on the receipt issued by the jeweler. Apparently suspecting the jewelry may have been stolen, the jeweler contacted the police in Dauphin County, who in turn sent a copy of the receipt to Pennsylvania State Police Officer Charles Snyder (“Officer Snyder”) in Lycoming County.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[179,1290,1153,467]]]'>Officer Snyder contacted Betty Sue Bird (“Bird”), a victim of a burglary that occurred in Lycoming County on December 18, 1990. On January 29 and 30, 1992, Bird travelled to Harrisburg and identified the 34 pieces of jewelry as among those stolen from her residence over a year earlier. The total value of the over 300 pieces of jewelry stolen from the Bird residence in 1990 was in excess of $16,300.00. The record does not indicate that anyone has ever been charged with the Bird burglary.</p>

Appellant first denied having sold the jewelry in Harrisburg; she then admitted that she sold the <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>jewelry, but denied that she had stolen it. She told Officer Snyder that it had belonged to her grandfather who had died several weeks before Officer Snyder contacted Appellant. Appellant contended that she had taken the jewelry, without her mother’s knowledge, from its storage place in her grandfather’s car and had sold it.</p>

Appellant’s mother then went to a car parked in the driveway, later determined to belong to her deceased father, and retrieved additional jewelry. Stadt purchased an item of jewelry which she recognized as having been stolen during the 1990 Bird burglary. Stadt later informed Officer Snyder of the events at the porch sale. A search warrant was issued for the Hockenbury residence and the car in the driveway. The search revealed more than 280 pieces of jewelry which Bird identified as having been taken from her bedroom in the 1990 burglary.</p>

On May 27,1992, a preliminary hearing was held on the charge, and the district justice determined that there was sufficient evidence to hold the matter for trial. A bill of information was filed against Appellant on June 11, 1992. On August 14, 1992, the Commonwealth filed a bill of particulars alleging that Appellant received stolen property “which was purchased at the Hockenbury residence on April 12, 1992, and/or which was seized from the residence ... on April 12, 1992.”</p>

The trial court granted Appellant’s motion to dismiss the Lycoming County charges on the grounds that she had already pled guilty to and been sentenced for receiving stolen property in Dauphin County. The trial court held that the prosecution was barred by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article I, § 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 109 and 110. The Superior Court reversed the trial court. We granted allocatur to determine whether the Lycoming County prosecution is barred under either §§ 109 or 110 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, or the double jeopardy clause of either the United States Constitution or the Pennsylvania Constitution.

    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[182,1516,1152,689]]]'>The first issue presented for our review is whether the Lycoming County prosecution is barred by section 109 of the Crimes Code. That statute states in pertinent part that “[wjhen a prosecution is for a violation of the same provision of the statutes and is based upon the same facts as the former prosecution, it is barred by such a former prosecution where---- (3) The former prosecution resulted in a conviction.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 109. The requirement that the former prosecution result in a conviction is met by Appellant’s guilty plea in Dauphin County. Furthermore, the Commonwealth concedes that the same provision of the statutes, namely 18 Pa.C.S. § 3925, is involved in both the Dauphin County and Lycoming County prosecutions.

      <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>Appellant asserts that “the same facts” requirement is met here because the Lycoming County prosecution, like the Dauphin County prosecution, would attempt to prove that the 280 items of jewelry were stolen from the Bird residence during the 1990 robbery. We agree that both prosecutions have this fact in common; yet, there are many facts which the two prosecutions do not share. For example, the prosecutions involve different property possessed in different counties on different dates. Thus, the only way we could accept Appellant’s contention that the requirements of § 109 are met in this matter would be to alter the “same facts” requirement to read that only <em>some </em>facts need be in common. We decline to so alter the plain meaning of the statute and therefore deny Appellant relief on her § 109 claim.</p>

As noted by the Superior Court below, the only common “criminal episode” is that the source of the jewelry is allegedly the 1990 burglary, a crime of which Appellant has not been charged. There is no evidence that Appellant possessed the 280 pieces of jewelry, which were taken out of her grandfather’s car in April of 1992, <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>when she sold 34 pieces three months later in Dauphin County. Furthermore, the prosecution in Dauphin County was not premised on her possession of those 280 pieces of jewelry. The evidence does not show that the two offenses are linked by time or location. We thus agree with the conclusion of the Superior Court below that possession and sale of stolen property in January of 1992 in Dauphin County is a separate criminal episode from the receipt of entirely different stolen property in April of 1992 in Lycoming County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, § 110(l)(ii) does not bar the Lycoming County prosecution.</p>

As discussed above, the facts of record in this matter establish that there are two different criminal acts, occurring in two different counties at different <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>times.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> We conclude that the Lycoming County prosecution does not constitute prosecution for the “same criminal offense” as was at issue in the Dauphin County prosecution; therefore, the Lycoming County prosecution will not offend the federal Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>

The critical inquiry is what conduct the state will prove, not the evidence the State will use to prove the conduct.” <em>Grady, </em><a href="/us/495/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="495 U.S. 508" data-case-ids="634223" data-case-paths="/us/495/0508-01">495 U.S. at 521</a>, <a href="/us/495/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="495 U.S. 508" data-case-ids="634223" data-case-paths="/us/495/0508-01">110 S.Ct. at 2093</a>, <a href="/us/495/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="495 U.S. 508" data-case-ids="634223" data-case-paths="/us/495/0508-01">109 L.Ed.2d at 564</a>.</p>
      <p id="b621-9" data-blocks='[["BL_621.10",621,[227,1770,1121,582]]]'>Appellant apparently is of the belief that the fact that both prosecutions would point to the 1990 Bird robbery as the source of the stolen property mandates that the Lycoming County prosecution is barred under the <em>Grady </em>test. Yet, the Supreme Court in fashioning <em>Grady </em>was explicit in stating that merely because two prosecutions have an overlap in proof does not mean that the subsequent prosecution will be barred. The key inquiry is what conduct the prosecution will prove. <em><a href="/us/495/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="495 U.S. 508" data-case-ids="634223" data-case-paths="/us/495/0508-01">Id.</a> </em>As we have discussed <em>supra, </em>the Lycoming County prosecution and the Dauphin County prosecution concern different stolen property possessed at different times in different locations. Thus, the Commonwealth is not trying to prove the "same conduct” in the Lycoming County prosecution as was at issue in the Dauphin County prosecution. Therefore, we believe that the "same conduct” test could not be met here even if we were to adopt <em>Grady </em>as the constitutional standard for our Commonwealth.</p>

Since the jewelry was taken in a single burglary, and the prosecutions are the result of a single investigation, I cannot agree with the Majority’s characterization that the charges against Appellant either were born from substantially different facts or were the result of separate criminal episodes. I believe that the Majority errs by focusing on the double jeopardy issue without looking at that issue in light of the specific crime Appellant is accused of committing. Additionally, the Majority fails to see that the Commonwealth is not justified in subjecting Appellant to be <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>twice placed in jeopardy of her liberty simply because the criminal conduct crossed a county line.</p>

The Majority tests whether the Lycoming County prosecution would show <em>any </em>facts which differed from those involved in the preceding prosecution. However, the statutory language requires a bar when both prosecutions are “based upon the same facts____” 18 Pa.C.S. § 109. I do not agree that the Commonwealth can introduce superfluous facts into either prosecution and thereby evade the clear purpose of this statute. That the criminal conduct occurred in separate counties is not an issue here since the same substantive law applies. A single Pennsylvania State Trooper conducted the investigation into Appellant’s criminal conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> So intertwined is the criminal conduct that the affidavit supporting the search warrant allowing the balance of the jewelry to be recovered in Lycoming County lists the Dauphin County sale as probable cause.

Receiving, possessing, and disposing of stolen property are not separate crimes. Instead, these acts are merely indicia that “[a] person is guilty of theft.” By allowing Appellant to be prosecuted separately for possessing stolen property and disposing of stolen property, the Majority has created three distinct crimes, where there was formerly only one. Now defendants could face separate charges for receiving, possessing, and disposing of the same stolen property.

It is inconceivable that the possession and the disposal of goods, which were stolen from the same owner at the same time, may somehow not be temporally and logically connected. Not only are they so connected that the legislature included them both in the same statute as indicia of theft, they are the continuation of the same purpose and act. Surely a person cannot dispose of goods without possessing them, and likewise a person seeking to profit from such criminal activity would need to dispose of the goods at some point. Temporally, the existence of a break in time between the possession and the moment when control is relinquished in the act of disposal is impossible.</p>

To find that Appellant must present such evidence is an improper shift of the burden of proof from the Commonwealth to Appellant. The Commonwealth again relies on the fact that the criminal conduct continued over a county line. This does nothing to further the Commonwealth’s argument here, since the <em>Hude </em>test makes no provision for geographic separation.
