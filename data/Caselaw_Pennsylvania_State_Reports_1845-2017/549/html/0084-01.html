    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[236,998,1161,528]]]'>In December of 1992, the parties entered into an agreement by which Cintas rented uniforms to Lee’s Cleaning. When Lee’s Cleaning allegedly failed to pay for the uniform rentals, Cintas filed a complaint for breach of contract on February 22, 1994. On February 28, 1994, Cintas served the complaint on Lee’s Cleaning. Howard Zavodnick, Esquire, counsel for Cintas, filed a return of service on March 16, 1994 describing the method of service and stating that his employee, Albert Zavodnick, had served the complaint on Lee’s Cleaning. The return of service provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>

Lee’s Cleaning did not respond to the default notice. Cintas then filed a praecipe to enter a default judgment for $7,685.85 on September 23, 1994. The Prothonotary entered judgment against Lee’s Cleaning on September 26, 1994. Approximately six months later, on March 23, 1995, Lee’s Cleaning filed a petition to strike the default judgment. First, Lee’s Cleaning argued that the <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>return of service was defective because it was not completed by Albert Zavodnick, the person who actually made service, and thus, it violated Pa.R.C.P. 405, which requires the person making service to complete the return of service. Second, Lee’s Cleaning argued that service of process was improper because the complaint was delivered to Virginia Watson, who was a receptionist and not a person “in charge” as required by Pa.R.C.P. 424. In support of this argument, Lee’s Cleaning filed the affidavit of Nina Kinnard, its vice president, secretary and treasurer. The affidavit states that Watson was not the person in charge of business at Lee’s Cleaning.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[165,930,1153,748]]]'>The trial court denied Lee’s Cleaning’s petition to strike the default judgment. Without addressing the Rule 405 claim, the court held that service was proper under Rule 424 because Kinnard’s affidavit did not deny that Watson held herself out as the person in charge on the day Albert Zavodnick served the complaint. On appeal, the Superior Court held that the return of service was defective pursuant to Rule 405 because Albert Zavodnick did not complete it. <em>Cintas Corp. v.

For example, in <em>Sharp, </em>the defendant filed a petition to strike a default judgment based on defective service. The return of service there stated that the complaint was delivered to the person in charge of defendant’s “place of employment” instead of defendant’s “office or usual place of business”. <em>Sharp, </em><a href="/pa/422/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="422 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="1901751" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0124-01">422 Pa. at 126</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=221%20A.2d%20185" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="221 A.2d 185">221 A.2d at 186</a> (interpreting former Rule 1009(b)(2)(iii), now Rule 402(a)(2)(iii)).
