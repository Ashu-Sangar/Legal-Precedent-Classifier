The trial court permitted counsel to withdraw and notified Appellant that he had the option of either retaining private counsel or proceeding pro se. He chose to proceed pro se.

Unlike other litigants, pro se prisoners cannot personally travel to the courthouse to see that the notice is stamped “filed” or to establish the date on which the court received the notice. Other litigants may choose to entrust their appeals to the vagaries of the mail and the clerk’s process for stamping incoming papers, but only the pro se prisoner is forced to do so by his situation. And if other litigants do choose to use the mail, they can at least place the notice directly into the hands of the United States Postal Service (or a private carrier); and they can follow its progress by calling the court to determine whether the notice has been received and stamped, knowing that if the mail goes awry they can personally deliver notice at the last moment or that their monitoring will provide them with evidence to demonstrate either excusable neglect or that the notice was not stamped on the date the court received it.</blockquote>

In <em>Smith, </em>the appellant sought to appeal a decision of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (Board) dated March 15, 1994. Smith, who acted pro se and was incarcerated, allegedly gave his petition for review of the Board’s decision to the prison officials on April 14, 1994. In return, Smith received a “Cash Slip” indicating that the Department of Corrections charged Smith’s prison bank account for postage for mail sent to the Prothonotary of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on that date. <em>Smith, </em>at 118, <a href="/pa/546/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="683 A.2d 278" data-case-ids="466762,7861001" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0115-01,/a2d/683/0278-01">683 A.2d at 279</a>.</p>

The Commonwealth Court quashed his petition, <em>sua sponte, </em>as untimely filed because the prothonotary did not receive it until April 20, 1994. This Court reversed and held that when the appellant is (a) acting pro se and (b) incarcerated at the time he or she seeks to file an appeal, justice requires the appeal to be deemed “filed” on the date that the appellant deposits the appeal with prison authorities and/or places it in the prison mailbox. The appellant bears the burden of proving that he or she in fact delivered the appeal within the appropriate time period. This rule is appropriately termed the “prisoner mailbox” rule.</p>

We note, however, that Rule 1514 explicitly provides that an appeal may be deemed “filed” either on the date the prothonotary receives <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>it or on the date the appellant deposits it with the United States Postal Service if he uses a Postal Form 3817, Certificate of Mailing, on which the postal clerk stamps the date of mailing. Rule 903 states generally that an appellant may file the notice of appeal with the clerk of the lower court and Rule 905 explains that the date of filing will be the date that the clerk receives the appeal. We believe that the language of Rule 903 is amenable to an exception for pro se prisoners. Therefore, we extend the prisoner mailbox rule to all appeals by pro se prisoners. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hockenberry, </em><a href="/pa-super/455/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="455 Pa.

As provided in Rule 1514, a Postal Form 3817, Certificate of Mailing, constitutes proof of the date of mailing. In <em>Smith, </em>we said that the “Cash Slip” that the prison authorities gave Smith noting both the deduction from his account for the mailing to the prothonotary and the date of the mailing, would also be sufficient evidence. We further stated in <em>Smith </em>that an affidavit attesting to the date of deposit with the prison officials likewise could be considered. This Court has also accepted evidence of internal operating procedures regarding mail delivery in both the prison and the Commonwealth Court, and the delivery route of the mail, to decide the last possible date on which the appellant could have mailed an appeal based on the date that the prothonotary received it. <em>Miller v.
