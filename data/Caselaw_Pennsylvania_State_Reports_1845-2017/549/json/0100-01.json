        "text": "OPINION\nNIGRO, Justice.\nGary Barbera Dodge, Inc. (\u201cBarbera\u201d) appeals from the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination that Barbera failed to submit timely automobile title applications to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\u201cPennDOT\u201d) and that delivery to an authorized messenger service was not a \u201crelevant mitigating event.\u201d For the following reasons, we reverse in part.\nBarbera is a licensed new and used automobile dealer which performs title work on the vehicles it sells. On November 19, 1993, PennDOT notified Barbera that it had filed untimely title applications on fifty-nine occasions in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103.1(d), which requires that title applications for automobiles purchased from dealers be mailed or delivered to PennDOT within 20 days of the date of purchase.\nFollowing an administrative hearing, PennDOT issued an order on May 13, 1994 determining that Barbera had failed to submit timely title applications to PennDOT on fifty-seven occasions in violation of section 1374(a)(5) of the Vehicle Code (\u201cthe Code\u201d), 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5)(1995). PennDOT imposed fifty-seven separate $200 penalties against Barbera, totalling $11,400. On June 6, 1994, Barbera appealed Penn-DOT\u2019s order to the trial court, which reversed following a de novo hearing.\nAt the hearing, Barbera\u2019s title clerk, Audrey Brown, testified that Barbera utilized a licensed messenger service, Nelson\u2019s Messenger Service (\u201cNelson\u2019s\u201d), to pick up Barbera\u2019s completed title work and then deliver it to PennDOT. Brown testified that she generally processed the title work in seven days, but that Nelson\u2019s was not submitting the title work to PennDOT in a timely fashion. The trial court held that \u201ctimely delivery of the documents to an authorized messenger service was tantamount to delivery to [Penn]DOT,\u201d N.T. at 34, and thus Barbera was not in violation of the Code.\nThe standard of review on appeal is to determine whether the findings below are supported by substantial evidence, whether an error of law has been committed or whether an abuse of discretion has occurred. Commonwealth v. Boucher, 547 Pa. 440, 691 A.2d 450 (1997); Commonwealth, Department of Transportation v. O\u2019Connell, 521 Pa. 242, 555 A.2d 873 (1989); Philadelphia Honda, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, 666 A.2d 349 (1995).\nApplying this standard, the Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court, finding (1) that Barbera\u2019s delivery of the title applications to Nelson\u2019s did not constitute timely delivery of the applications to PennDOT; and (2) that Nelson\u2019s delayed delivery of the title documents to PennDOT did not constitute a \u201crelevant mitigating event\u201d under section 1374(b) which would excuse Barbera\u2019s untimely delivery.\nWe granted allocatur in order to determine whether Barb-era failed to timely submit the title documents to PennDOT under section 1374(a)(5), and, if so, whether Nelson\u2019s failure to timely deliver the title applications to PennDOT constituted a relevant mitigating event under 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(b).\nPursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5), PennDOT may impose a monetary penalty when it finds upon sufficient evidence that \u201cthe registrant has failed to deliver to a transferee lawfully entitled thereto or to [PennDOT], when and as required by this title, a properly assigned certificate of title.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5)(1995).\nBarbera argues that delivery of the title documents to Nelson\u2019s within 20 days of purchase constituted timely delivery to PennDOT under section 1374(a)(5). However, Barbera fails to cite any provision in the Code supporting this assertion. As indicated by the Commonwealth Court, while messenger services are licensed to transact business with Penn-DOT, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7501-7506, they are not authorized under any provision of the Code to act as PennDOT\u2019s agent for the purpose of accepting delivery of title documents. Thus, delivery of the title documents to Nelson\u2019s was not the equivalent of delivery to PennDOT.\nAlternatively, Barbera argues that even if its delivery of the documents to Nelson\u2019s was not equivalent to delivery to PennDOT, delivery to Nelson\u2019s constituted a relevant mitigating event under section 1374(b) of the Code. Section 1374(b) requires that PennDOT consider relevant mitigating events when holding an administrative hearing on whether a dealer violated section 1374(a)(5) of the Code.\nAlthough Section 1374(b) does not provide a definition of relevant mitigating events, the Commonwealth Court has defined the term as \u201csomething that is beyond the control of the motor vehicle dealer, that is significant and of such a nature that it moderates and lessens the consequences of the late title submissions.\u201d Philadelphia Honda, 666 A.2d at 352.\nIn the present case, the Commonwealth Court held that Nelson\u2019s late submission of the title documents was \u201cnot beyond the control of [Barbera], since [Barbera] chose to contract with Nelson\u2019s to deliver title documents to [Penn-DOT] and could have monitored its performance.\u201d Gary Barbera Dodge, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Motor Vehicles, 670 A.2d 1186, 1190 (Pa.Commw.1995).\nHowever, although Nelson\u2019s is not an agent of PennDOT for the purpose of accepting title documents, it is an authorized messenger of PennDOT. Authorized messengers which fail to comply with the Code or PennDOT regulations are subject to sanction. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7501-7506. Specifically, Section 7503 provides:\n(a) General rule.\u2014The department shall supervise messenger services and, after providing an opportunity for a hearing, shall suspend the authorization of any messenger service which it finds is not properly operated or which has violated or failed to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted by the department____\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7503.\nOne obligation imposed upon a messenger service is that it submit documents in a timely fashion. 67 Pa.Code \u00a7 255.5(e) provides, in part:\n(e) Time limits. Messenger services shall submit documents to the Department within 5 days after the messenger\u2019s receipt of all necessary and fully executed documents ____\nWhen Barbera gave the title documents to Nelson\u2019s within seven days of purchase, it reasonably assumed that Nelson\u2019s would comply with section 255.5(e) and deliver the documents within the requisite twenty-day period. Thus, Barbera was under no continuing obligation to monitor the delivery of the title documents once they were in the possession of Nelson\u2019s. Because Barbera had no continuing obligation to monitor the documents, once the documents were transferred to Nelson\u2019s, the timeliness of their delivery was beyond Barbera\u2019s knowledge or control. Accordingly, we disagree with the Commonwealth Court and find that Nelson\u2019s negligence in failing to deliver the documents within the prescribed period constituted a relevant mitigating event within the meaning of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(b).\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed in part and the case remanded to PennDOT so it may reconsider the imposition of sanctions.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion in which FLAHERTY, C.J., joins.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103.1(d) provides in part:\nIf the application refers to a vehicle purchased from a dealer, the dealer shall mail or deliver the application to the department within 20 days of the date of purchase....\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103.1(d)(1995).\n. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5) provides:\n(a) Suspension or revocation after opportunity for hearing.\u2014The department may impose a monetary penalty for certain violations and offenses as prescribed by regulation or this section ... in any of the following cases when the department finds upon sufficient evidence that:\n(5) The registrant has failed to deliver to a transferee lawfully entitled thereto or to the department, when and as required by this title, a properly assigned certificate of title.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5)(1995).\n. The penalty was imposed pursuant to section 1374(d)(2), which provides:\nIf the department finds that the registrant has violated subsection (a)(5) or (7) as a third offense, the registrant may be sanctioned with a monetary penalty of not less than $100 and not more than $200 per violation.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(d)(2)(1995).\n. Section 1374(b) provides:\n(b) Mitigating events.\u2014The opportunity for a hearing as authorized by subsection (a) shall include the consideration of relevant mitigating events as prescribed by regulation for violations and offenses of subsection (a)(2), (5) and (7).\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(b)(1995).\n. The Commonwealth Court also addressed the issue of whether delivery to Nelson\u2019s was delivery to a \"transferee\u201d under 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5), infra, which provides that a dealer may be penalized for late delivery of title documents where \"[t]he registrant has failed to deliver to a transferee lawfully entitled thereto or to the department, when and as required by title, a properly assigned certificate of title.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5)(emphasis added). The Commonwealth Court held that delivery of the title documents to Nelson\u2019s did not constitute delivery to a \"transferee\u201d under 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5)(1995), reasoning that Nelson\u2019s was not a \"transferee lawfully entitled\u201d to accept delivery of title applications within the meaning of the Code because a \"transferee\u201d can only be the purchaser of a vehicle.\nIn its brief to this Court, Barbera does not argue that Nelson\u2019s was a transferee, but rather argues that delivery to Nelson\u2019s was the equivalent of delivery to PennDOT. Because Barbera does not challenge the Commonwealth Court\u2019s finding that Nelson\u2019s was not a transferee, we need not address that issue.\n. A messenger service is defined under 67 Pa.Code \u00a7 255.2 as \"[a] person who, for a fee, advertises, offers or provides to the public the service of delivering and obtaining documents to and from the Department. ...\u201d\nUnder 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7501(a), \"[t]he department shall authorize and shall issue a certificate of authorization to every messenger service that complies with the requirements of this chapter and regulations adopted by the department.\u201d\nThe criteria for obtaining a certificate of authorization are set forth in 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7502, and include, among other things, the posting of a bond indemnifying the public and PennDOT in the amount of $50,000.\nAuthorized messenger services are entitled to \u201ctransact business with the department\u201d pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7505.\n. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7506 provides:\nAny person violating any provision of this chapter or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder for which a specific penalty is not provided is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $100.\n. Barbera also claims that the Commonwealth Court erred in holding that the issue of the propriety of the penalty imposed by PennDOT was waived due to Barbera\u2019s failure to raise this issue before the trial court. Because we find that Nelson\u2019s failure to deliver the documents in a timely manner constitutes a relevant mitigating event, it is unnecessary to consider the propriety of the original penalty imposed by PennDOT.\nThe statute does not specify what penalty, if any, is appropriate where relevant mitigating events are found. Due to our finding of relevant mitigating events, PennDOT must now decide whether it is appropriate to impose a penalty, and if so, what the proper amount of the penalty should be, in light of the relevant mitigating circumstances.",

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI agree with the majority that Barbera\u2019s delivery of the title documents to Nelson\u2019s was not equivalent to delivery of the documents to the Department for purposes of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1374(a)(5). I also agree that because Nelson\u2019s is an authorized messenger service required to comply with Department regulations regarding timely submission of documents, its failure to submit Barbera\u2019s title documents in a timely fashion constitutes a \u201crelevant mitigating event\u201d under \u00a7 1374(b) that should be considered in evaluating the charges that Barbera violated \u00a7 1374(a)(5). I dissent from the judgment, however, because I do not believe that a remand to the Department is necessary or appropriate.\nThe order imposing the penalty stated, \u201cThe Department has not found sufficient mitigating events which would warrant exoneration, or reduction of the penalty.\u201d R.5a. There is no record of whether Barbera argued that the messenger service\u2019s fault was a \u201crelevant mitigating circumstance\u201d or whether the Board gave any consideration to this theory. It is thus possible that the Department has already done what the Court is directing it to do on remand, i.e., \u201cdecide whether it is appropriate to impose a penalty, and if so, what the proper amount of the penalty should be, in light of the relevant mitigating circumstances.\u201d Majority opinion at 925, n. 8.\nMore importantly, Barbera\u2019s appeal was taken pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1377(a). That section provides that the court shall schedule a hearing \u201cand thereupon take testimony and examine into the facts of the case and determine whether the petitioner is entitled to registration, subject to suspension of registration or other sanction under the provisions of this title or departmental regulations.\u201d As with driver\u2019s license suspension and revocation appeals under \u00a7 1550, the common pleas court\u2019s consideration of the matter is de novo. It has long been understood that in such de novo appeals although the court should give due consideration to the Department\u2019s exercise of discretion in interpreting and applying the statute and regulations, it is not bound thereby. See Commonwealth v. Emerick, 373 Pa. 388, 96 A.2d 370 (1953). The Commonwealth Court thus erred in stating that \u201c[t]he discretion to consider mitigating events is expressly granted to DOT, and DOT\u2019s decision on that question should not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d Commonwealth Court Memorandum Opinion at 1189-90.\nAfter Barbera\u2019s witness had testified, counsel for the Department argued to the court that \u201calthough [Barbera\u2019s counsel] has explained the reason for .the lateness, I don\u2019t believe that is a relevant mitigating event.... \u201d The court then asked, \u201cWhat would be a mitigating event if they are using a messenger service? Don\u2019t they have a right to rely upon DOT\u2019s licensing of the messenger service? If the person wasn\u2019t reliable and so on, one would think DOT wouldn\u2019t license them____\u201d R. 25a-26a. Later, in explaining its reasons for sustaining the appeal, the court stated\nI think we should emphasize the fact that the messenger service is licensed; that the cost of using the service is paid by the dealer ... and hence increases the dealer\u2019s expense. The dealer ought to get something out of this, and one of the things they should get is the peace of mind that comes from knowing, if the darn stuff gets there late, its the messenger\u2019s fault, and DOT can easily suspend the messenger\u2019s license or hang the messenger out to dry as opposed to hanging the dealer out to dry.\nR. 42a. Thus despite the court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that delivery to the messenger was tantamount to delivery to the Department, the record adequately indicates as an alternative basis for its ruling that the court considered the fact that the lateness was attributable to the messenger to be a relevant mitigating event.\nFor these reasons, I would hold that Commonwealth Court erred by applying the abuse of discretion standard to the common pleas court\u2019s review of the Department\u2019s order imposing the penalty. Rather, the common pleas court\u2019s decision was subject to reversal only for abuse of discretion, error of law, or lack of substantial evidence. Having determined that the common pleas court did not commit an error of law in treating the messenger\u2019s delay as a relevant mitigating event, I would vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the court of common pleas.\nFLAHERTY, C.J., joins this Dissenting Opinion.",
