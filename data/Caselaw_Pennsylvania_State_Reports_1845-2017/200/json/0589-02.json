J.\nBoth parties claimed title under sheriff\u2019s sales on execution against Wolfgang, who owned a tract of land partly in Schuylkill and partly in Northumberland counties. The latter disclaimed. The defendant having a judgment in Schuylkill county proceeded under the act of 1840 for the sale of lands lying in different counties, sold the entire tract in both counties and purchased at the sale'.'\nSubsequently plaintiff having judgment in Northumberland county levied and sold the portion of the tract in that county,', purchased and brought this ejectment.\nAt the trial it appearing that the levy under which the defendant\u2019s sale was made, was after the return day of the writ of fieri facias, the court held the title invalid, and the proceedings in plaintiff\u2019s title being regular, directed a verdict for plaintiff.\nError assigned amongst others was in giving binding instructions for plaintiff.\nS. M. Enterline, with him Voris Auten, for appellants.\nS. B. Boyer and S. P. Wolverton, for appellee.\nOctober 11,1901:"
