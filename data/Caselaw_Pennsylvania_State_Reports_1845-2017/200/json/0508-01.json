He appears, however, to have overlooked the decisions of this court in Sugar Notch Borough, 192 Pa. 349, in Commonwealth v. Gilligan, 195 Pa. 504, and Commonwealth v. Howell, 195 Pa. 519.\nThose decisions sustain the act of May 23, 1874, and require the controller to discharge the duties under said act which devolve on him.\nJudgment affirmed.",
