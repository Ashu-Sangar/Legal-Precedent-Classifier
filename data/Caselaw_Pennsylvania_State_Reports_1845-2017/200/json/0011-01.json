        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe learned judge who tried this case allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a compulsory nonsuit, and refused to take it off. The plaintiff assuming that there was error in the refusal to take- off the nonsuit, entered an appeal to this court. The argument made on the appeal and the cases cited to support it failed to convince us of error in the conclusion arrived at by the learned court below. It plainly appeared on the trial of the case that the plaintiff\u2019s right of action accrued on delivery of the deed of June 8, 1889, and that the summons on which the service was made was issued seven years, eleven months and twenty-six days after the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed. It seems to us that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was in any aspect of the case, barred by the statute of limitations, and that the allowance of the nonsuit and the refusal to take it off was properly entered.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "McCormick, Appellant, v. Sener.\nStatute of limitations\u2014Tenants in eommon\u2014Contribution.\nWhere two judgment creditors under an agreement with each other purchase real estate of their debtor at a sheriff\u2019s sale as equal tenants in common, and pay therefor largely by receipts on their judgments, and one pays more than the other, the statute of limitations begins to run against a right of contribution for the excess from the date of the delivery of the sheriff\u2019s deed.\nArgued April 23, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 289, Jan. T., 1900, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Clearfield Co., Sept. T., 1897, No. 102, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of C. S. McCormick v. W. Z. Sener.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for contribution.\nAt the trial it appeared that plaintiff and defendant owned judgments against J. H. Bierly. . By agreement with each other they purchased Bierly\u2019s real estate at a sheriff\u2019s sale as equal tenants in common, and largely paid for the same by receipts on their judgments. The sheriff\u2019s deed was delivered on June 8,1889. McCormick paid more than Sener, and on September 7, 1895, brought this action for contribution. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off, Gordon, P. J., filing the following opinion:\nThe statute of limitations commenced to run at the time the right of action accrued.' Sener and McCormick agreed to act together in proceedings against Bierly, each having claims against him. They bought this real estate at sheriff\u2019s sale, the deed being made to the two of them as tenants in common and vested an undivided half interest in each. McCormick held judgments against Bierly, and they purchased as lien creditors under the act of 1846. The sheriff\u2019s sale occurred May 6,1889. On May 9, 1889, the court fixed May 10, 1889, as the time for reading the sheriff\u2019s return in open court. The return was read, and no objections being made the deed was acknowledged June 8, 1889, and duly recorded. The execution upon which the return was made is lost. The sheriff testifies that appended to it was a receipt by Mr. McCormick, as a lien creditor, for amount claimed upon his judgment. This is largely his opinion, he saying he has no specific recollection of the matter, but that it was his practice to procure such receipts as are required by the act. The plaintiff testifies that he gave no receipt to the sheriff until September 30, 1889. The question involved is whether plaintiff\u2019s right of action accrued on delivery of deed, June 8, or September 30,1889. If the former, more than six years elapsed before suit was brought, and the claim would be cut out by the statute of limitations. In our opinion the right of action accrued on delivery of the deed. At that time defendant acquired his title, which was paid for in part by plaintiffs\u2019 judgments. The purchase was under the lien creditor\u2019s act and largely by these judgments. No objection was made to this and the acknowledgment of the deed extinguished the judgments to the extent used, and gave plaintiff the right to demand contribution from the defendant for what the judgments had purchased for him. The subsequent appointment of an auditor was not on account of the purchase as lien creditors. Had it been, the acknowledgment of the deed would have been deferred until the matter was disposed of. The auditor was appointed on the application of the sheriff on account of a dispute about the attorney\u2019s commissions on judgments held by another creditor. The right of action commenced at the time plaintiff\u2019s judgments were used, and extinguished in the acquisition of title by defendant. This was at the acknowledgment and delivery of the sheriff\u2019s deed, and not months afterwards when plaintiff receipted to the sheriff in pursuance of the distribution by the auditor. The defendant\u2019s motion is granted, and judgment of compulsory nonsuit entered against plaintiff.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nJ. B. McEnally, with him Daniel W. Me Curdy, for appellant.\nDavid L. Krebs, with him W. A. Kagerty and A. M. Live-right, for appellee.\nJune 4, 1901:"
