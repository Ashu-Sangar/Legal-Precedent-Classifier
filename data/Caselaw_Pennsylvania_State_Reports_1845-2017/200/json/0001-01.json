The ease was clearly for the determination of the jury upon the evidence, and there was nothing in the charge of the court which would justify the setting aside of the verdict or of the judgment entered thereon. The assignments are, therefore, dismissed and the judgment is affirmed.",

The evidence for the plaintiff, although contradicted, tended to show that the iron rope attached to the .cage was in bad condition, and there was also evidence that the engineer who had charge of the shaft was very deaf, and had mistaken the signal, and that his deafness was known to the defendant.\nThe court submitted the case to the jury.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $4,000. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned among others was in submitting the case to the jury.'\nWilliam S. McLean, with him George R. McLean and William R. Gibbons, for appellant.\nJohn T. Lenahan and W.
