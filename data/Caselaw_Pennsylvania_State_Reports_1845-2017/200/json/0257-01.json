J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on October 14,1897, William H. Shortt made information before M. W. Harrington, a justice of the peace, and one of the defendants, as follows:\n\u201c Personally appeared before me, a justice of the peace, in and for said county, Wm. H. Shortt, president of Sugar Grove Savings Bank, who being sworn according to law, deposes and says, that on or about the 4th day of October, 1897, as he verily believes, that John P. Gustafson and Jonas P. Magnussen and some other person, to the complainant unknown, did, without leave or right, take from the premises of Gust and John Swanson, one spring road wagon, one covered buggy, one cutter, belonging to the Sugar Grove Savings Bank.\u201d\nA warrant was issued and Magnussen and Gustafson were arrested, and bound over for trial. An indictment was framed which the grand jury ignored. No notice of suit was given to Harrington as provided by the act of March 21, 1772. The court granted a non-suit as to Harrington which it subsequently refused to take off. The court also held that as the information did not charge a felonious taking, the suit could not be maintained against W. H. Shortt.\nVerdict and judgment for W. H. Shortt. Plaintiff appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1) refusal to take off non-suit; (4) in giving binding instructions in favor of W. H. Shortt.\nW. W. Wilbur, of Wilbur Schnur, and B. TJ.
