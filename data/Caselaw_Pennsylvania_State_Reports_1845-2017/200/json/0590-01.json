        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Mitchell,\nSection 5 of article 14 of the constitution providing that \u201c in counties containing over one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, all county officers shall be paid by salary,\u201d does not execute itself, nor does it furnish the courts with any means of executing it. It is a mandate to the legislature, but does not become effective until legislative action. In this respect it is in exactly the same position as section 5 of article 5, directing that every county containing 40,000 inhabitants shall constitute a separate judicial district, and section 12 of the same article directing that in Philadelphia there shall be established a magistrate\u2019s court for each 30,000 inhabitants. It has been expressly settled that neither of these sections executes itself nor can be enforced by the courts until legislative action: Com. ex rel. v. Harding, 87 Pa. 343 ; Comm. ex rel. v. Handley, 106 Pa. 245; Cahill\u2019s Petition, 110 Pa. 167.\nThe Act of March 31,1876, P. L. 13, in obedience to section 5 of article 14 of the constitution provided for salaries of county officers in counties with more than 150,000 inhabitants, but unfortunately made no provision for determining the population in case of change or dispute. In the case of cities whose classification may be affected by change of population, it was provided by the Act of May 8, 1889, P. L. 133, that the population \u201c according to the last preceding United States census, or any municipal census taken later \u201d should be officially certified to the city councils by the governor, under the great seal of the commonwealth. It would have been desirable, and have saved much trouble if some similar provision had been included in the act of 1876. But in the absence of any legislative method, the courts in cases of dispute like the present must proceed upon the general principles of law, and for convenience, if not of necessity, must settle the questions involved by reference to the census. In Com. ex rel. v. Harding, 87 Pa. 343, already cited, it was held that the population of 40,000 entitling a county to constitute a separate judicial district, was to be ascertained by the preceding census. The court was guided to that standard somewhat by section 14 of the schedule of the constitution which directs the legislature to designate the judicial districts \u201c after each decennial census and not oftener.\u201d But independent of that section, Chief Justice Ag-new said, \u201c The number of inhabitants in a county is an unknown fact, except as it may become known through the decennial census taken by the United States.\u201d And in Luzerne County v. Glennon, 109 Pa. 564, it was held that for the purpose of classification of counties under the salary acts, the census is the only test of population.\nThe census has no inherent force or application in the law of Pennsylvania. Its relevancy to state matters depends on the constitution and statutes of the state. In adopting it as the test, therefore, the courts proceed upon the general principle that it affords the best evidence attainable of the necessary fact. And upon the same principle, before the fact can become a part of the state law, and be made the basis of. action it must be established by competent evidence. It follows therefore that it is not the mere existence of the fact that must govern its application, but its legal and official ascertainment.\nThis is so clear as a matter of legal reasoning that it does not require elaboration, but it may be well to add an illustration ab inconvenienti. The census established that from 1880 to 1900, the population of Lackawanna county increased at a steady rate of a little over 5,000 a year. In 1890 it was 142,088, and it is therefore \u201cmorally certain,\u201d as is said by appellee,\" that on June 1, 1892, Lackawanna county had more than 150,000 population.\u201d If the fact alone governed, then everything done in regard to official salaries, in the county, has been wrong for eight years, though nobody knew or could know it. \u2022 Or still worse, suppose the question were not of fees but of a legal office. The Act of June' 27, 1895, P. L. 403, abolishes in counties of more than 150,000 population, the office of county auditor and requires the election of a county controller. Is every act of county auditors in such counties to be held illegal and void, and the county without the only legal officer, during the interval? The difficulty cannot be solved by treating the auditors as officers de facto, for that principle does not apply where there is no such office in the law: Com. ex rel. v. Harding, 87 Pa. 343, 353.\nBut it is argued that as the census was taken as of June 1,1900, the fact must be taken to be established as of that date, without regard to when the result is made known. This will not help the difficulty. There is no retrospective force in the census act, nor was any such effect intended. A date certain was necessary to insure correctness, uniformity, the avoidance of duplication, etc., and this is all that was intended. But the argument only puts the inconvenience a little further off without lessening it. The census was prescribed by the constitution as a basis for the apportionment of representatives in congress and required only an enumeration of the population, distinguishing free persons from all others, and excluding Indians not taxed. But congress in the interests of legislation, science and general information has included in the census many other statistics. Suppose the census of 1900 had been directed to report the population of the states by counties each year as of June 1, 1891 to June 1, 1900, we should have had the same difficulty already suggested. The fact would appear officially that for eight years Lackawanna had been acting as of a class to which it had ceased to belong though the official ascertainment of the fact was not until now. It is of general knowledge that the results of the census have not been promptly reached, that of 1880, not having been officially announced until 1883 and that of 1890, not until 1895. On the argument of appellee everything dependent on the census would be kept in a state of suspension, or in danger of being turned topsy turvy, for an indefinite period. The only escape from such intolerable inconvenience and confusion is by adherence to the logical principles of the law that the fact becomes applicable only from its legal ascertainment.\nThough in none of the cases heretofore decided by this court has the time when the change of population becomes operative, in reference to the census, been directly considered, yet the principles of the decisions have been in harmony with the result now reached. Thus in Com. ex rel. v. Harding, 87 Pa. 343, it is said, \u201c There would arise perplexing questions of jurisdiction likewise if the fact of the required population determines the operation of the constitution, and not its legal ascertainment by an act of legislative power. If the fact determines, then the time of the fact also governs, and who shall (outside of the legal mode) determine when this took place?\u201d So in Com. ex rel. v. Handley, 106 Pa. 245, Clark, J., says, \u201c The fact that a county contains 40,000 inhabitants determines its constitutional right to be made a separate district; but that fact must somehow be authoritatively ascertained in order that the right may be exercised.\u201d And in Luzerne County v. Glennon, 109 Pa. 564, it was held with great strictness on a case stated, that an agreement as to population argumentatively stated, would not be regarded, Sterrett, J., saying \u201c The only legally recognized method of determining the population of. any particular county or district is by resorting to the last preceding decennial census. . . . In the light of existing legislation we have no doubt that for. the purposed of classification under the various salary acts, each county must remain in the class in which the last census found it until it is transferred to another'' class by a subsequent census.\u201d\nThe mode of compensation of the plaintiff under the constitution was fixed at the date of the election. A county once having its status settled, retains it until it is legally and officially ascertained to have changed. There was no such ascertainment until after the election. Even if the announcement' in the press bulletin, referred to in the agreement of facts, could be considered as an ascertainment of the population, it was not made until after the election. But though it may have emanated from the census bureau, the press bulletin was not proof or even evidence. Newspaper bulletins are not evidence of anything. The question is not one of announcement, as the appellee has argued, nor of notice or knowledge on the part of the candidates or the electors. It is of the legal ascertainment of the fact. Under the Revised Statutes of the United States (1878) section 2196, the secretary of the interior is to lay the returns of the population before congress. This provision does not appear to be repeated in the census act of March 3, 1899, but nevertheless the census bureau submitted to congress on December 13,1900, an official bulletin (No. 20) giving the population of the states by counties. But even that was a provisional statement, subject to correction on final report. In very close cases this feature might become important. Nevertheless as an official act of a department of the government, in connection with congress, this was probably part of the public history of which not only the courts but officers of election and electors are bound to take notice. But that is the earliest date at which the fact of population on which the status of Lackawanna county was to be changed, can be considered as legally ascertained in the present case. It was then too late to affect any rights under the election of November 6 : Guldin v. Schuylkill Co., 149 Pa. 210; Com. ex rel. v. Comrey, 149 Pa. 216.\nSection 30 of the census act of March 3,1899, authorizes the director of the census on request, to furnish the governor of a state, or \u201c the chief officer of any municipal government \u201d with a copy of the returns of the population of the territory within the. jurisdiction of such officer. It is probable that in reference to elections.the sheriff would be deemed the chief officer of his county so far as to authorize him to procure the information, and that an official statement of the facts from such certificate in his proclamation for the election, would be treated as a legal ascertainment of the facts which would be binding on electors and elected. This matter, however, is not raised in the present case.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the judgment of the common pleas affirmed.",

The plaintiff was duly elected district attorney of Lackawanna county on November 6, 1900, to serve for the term.of three years from the first Monday of January, 1901, and entered upon the duties of his office on the said first Monday.'of January, 1901, being January 7, 1901. \u2022 '\n2.

As ascertained by the census of 1890, the population of Lackawanna county was 142,088, and as ascertained by the census of 1900, the population of Lackawanna county was 193,831.\n4. The census of 1900 was taken under the act of congress, which provides that the enumeration of the population shall be made as of June 1, 1900.\n5. The population of Lackawanna county by the census of 1900, was first announced on November 19, 1900, in a press bulletin from the census bureau in the city of Washington, D. C.\n6. The average annual compensation received by the district attorney of Lackawanna county for the past ten years has exceeded the sum of #5,000, and if it is decided that the plaintiff is by law only entitled to receive compensation fixed by the act of assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, entitled \u201cAn act to carry into effect section 5 of article 14 of the constitution,\u201d etc., approved March 31, 1876, P.

Harding, 87 Pa. 343.\nThere is no virtue in the mere taking of a federal census, of itself, or in any regulations of an act of congress providing for the taking of a federal census, to repeal or put into effect state laws or change the classification of counties.\nWhere the federal census is expressly made the guide to determine classification, no retroactive force is given to the census when completed, although stated as of the day it was commenced : State v. Braskamp, 87 Iowa, 588.\nAppellant\u2019s compensation as district attorney is fixed and determined by the laws in force as to Lackawanna county on November 6, 1900, the date of his election, and he is not affected by file salary act of 1876 coming into force as to Lackawanna county after said date, but its operation is held in abeyance as to him by article 8 of section 13, of the constitution: Apple v. Crawford County, 105 Pa. 300 ; Guldin v. Schuylkill County, 149 Pa. 210; Com. v. Comrey, 149 Pa. 216 ; Carlile v. Henderson, 17 Colo. 532; Comrs. of Converse County v. Burns, 29 Pac. Repr. 894; Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 499.\nI. H. Burns and Henry A. Knapp, of Willard, Warren Sp Knapp, with them H. L. Taylor, for appellee.\nThe salary act went into operation in Lackawanna county on June 1,1900.\nQuestions raised by the transition of counties from one class to another have been before this court in the cases of Monroe v. County of Luzerne, 103 Pa. 278, Luzerne County v. Glennon, 109 Pa. 564, Rymer v. Luzerne County, 142 Pa. 108, Guldin v. Schuylkill County, 149 Pa. 210, and Commonwealth v. Comrey, 149 Pa. 216; and it is submitted that none of these cases can be fairly considered to in any way bear out the contention of the plaintiff, but all of them are decidedly favorable to the defendant\u2019s cause.\nThe courts will take judicial notice of the results of the United States census: Hawkins v. Thomas, 3 Ind. App. 409; State v. County Ct., 128 Mo. 427; Worchester Nat. Bank v. Cheney, 94 Ill. 430; C. & A. R. R. Co. v. Baldridge, 177 Ill. 233; People v. Williams, 64 Cal. 87; People v. Wong Wang, 92 Cal. 278.\nThe press bulletin may be used to inform the judge in the same manner that he could inform himself by a personal letter to the director of the census. For this purpose it will show the fact of which the court is bound to take judicial notice, and that the fact appears that the population of Lackawanna county, not on November 19,-but on June 1, 1900, was over 150,000 and less than 250,000.\nOctober 11, 1901"
