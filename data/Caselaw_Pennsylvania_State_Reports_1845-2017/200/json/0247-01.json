On the trial of the case a verdict for the plaintiff of $3,000 was rendered by the jury. The court below refused to grant a new trial and an appeal was taken to this court. The only specification of error on the appeal was \u2019\u2022*' that under all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d The testimony in the case, however, was such as compelled a reference of it to the jury, and a withdrawal of it from their consideration would have been palpable error. This appears in the charge of the court and its refusal to grant a new trial. The case was fairly presented to the jury and there was no error in their verdict or in the refusal of the court to order another trial.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Amity Township, Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014Township\u2014Dangerous road.\nIn an action against a township to recover damages for personal injuries, the case is for the jury, and a verdict and judgment for plaintiff will be sustained where the evidence tends to show that at the point where the accident occurred the township had constructed a culvert under a public road, and in doing so had left on one side of the road an embankment extending about sixteen feet, that this embankment was about four feet high at its highest place and was supported by a retaining wall, but had no guard rail or barrier, that the traveled portion of the road at this point was about fifteen feet wide, that the plaintiff was driving a one-horse wagon, that his horse became frightened, and the wagon with plaintiff in it was carried over the embankment, that plaintiff was familiar with the road, and that the accident happened in broad daylight.\nArgued April 30, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 1, Jan.
