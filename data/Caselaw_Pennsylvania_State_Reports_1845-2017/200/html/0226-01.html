The period of confinement of the jury was so long before verdict, because it is absolutely necessary under the decisions of our courts, that in all cases upon indictments for murder, that there can be no discharge until a verdict has been rendered, that it is just possible that after the court ordered the jury to be polled, and it appearing that Mr. Koons, one of the jurors, did not -as a matter of conscience agree to the verdict, but only agreed because of physical exhaustion, that it was not a true verdict of murder in the first degree. At that time after the written verdict had been filed, the defendant’s counsel said: “ I would like to have the jury polled.” The clerk proceeded to poll the jury. The Clerk: “F. A. B. Koons.” Mr. Koons : “I signed the verdict against my consent, believing that that man was irresponsible when he—• ” The Court: “ What is your verdict, Mr. Koons?” Mr. Koons: I signed it—” The Court: “What did you find?” Mr. Koons: “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” The Court: “ Guilty of murder in the first degree ? ” Mr. Koons: “Yes, sir.” Defendant’s counsel: “ I wish to enter a protest against the reception of the verdict after the answer of Mr. Koons.” The Court: “ It may be recorded.”</p>

If he had done this, it then would have become the duty of the court to have directed the jury to again retire until they had agreed upon a verdict. Because of the doubt in our mind as to whether that which was done at the time the verdict was returned, was the verdict of the conscience of the whole jury based upon the circumstances incident to the long confinement of the jury and that which may have been in the mind of Mr. Koons at the time he desired to make a statement, that it was not the verdict of- his conscience, but one rendered necessary because of physical exhaustion on his part, and as all reasonable doubts under circumstances surrounding criminal cases are under the law to be given to defendants, we have concluded to allow the <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>motion for a rule for a new trial in this case and at the same time to make it absolute.</p>

    <p id="b252-11" data-blocks='[["BL_252.18",252,[294,1442,1180,974]]]'>John Lutz was accused of the murder of his wife. He was indicted for the crime with which he was charged, and on the trial of the case he was convicted of murder of the first degree. He was not sentenced when he made, through his counsel, an application for a new trial. This application resulted in a compliance with defendant’s request. It is not necessary to specify herein the circumstances which induced the court below to allow and make absolute the motion for another trial. This sufficiently appears in the record and in the opinion of the court granting a new trial. When the case was called for a retrial the prisoner filed a special plea of once in jeopardy, in which all the facts relating to the verdict on the former trial were set forth in detail. A jury was called and sworn according to law and the case was then proceeded with in due course. That the evidence in the case clearly warranted the verdict rendered by the jury admits of no reasonable doubt. A motion for another trial followed this verdict, but upon due consideration by the court the motion was deified. The denial of the motion was promptly followed by the sentence of the court.</p>
