Clearly, in order to retain their control, they would have to endeavor to surmise the highest price that the minority stockholders, or any one else, would be willing to pay, and then bid a trifle over such highest price.

Would it be right then, to compel the holders of a majority of the present stock to blindly surmise the fictitious value, which the minority might be willing to bid, under pain of losing the control, if their blind guess as to such fictitious value turned out to be too low ? Or suppose an outsider was the successful bidder for the 650 shares, such outsider would then be master of the situation in the sense that he could auction off said shares, calling for bids alternately from the majority and minority, and finally disposing of them to the party who was willing to pay the greatest sum of money for the control.] [2]</p>

The citations heretofore made show this to be a “pre-emptive right,” an “absolute right,” a “ very important right,” a right which “the courts go very far in protecting, ” especially when questions as to the control of the corporation may be involved.
