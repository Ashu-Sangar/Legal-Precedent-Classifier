    <p class="syllabus" id="b569-8" data-blocks='[["BL_569.8",569,[112,998,1180,601]]]'>The orphans’ court has no jurisdiction to settle mutual and complicated accounts between a claimant and a decedent, the matters of which had never been separated by the parties themselves. Such an account can only be adjusted in a court of general equity jurisdiction. If the claimant, although warned by the Supreme Court of the lack of jurisdiction of the orphans’ court persists in proceeding before the auditor appointed by the orphans’ court, a report by the auditor in his favor will be set aside, and a decree will be entered that proceedings shall be suspended for a short period to permit the claimant to file a bill in a court of equity, and to prosecute it with diligence to final hearing, with leave to the court, however, if the claimant should not file his bill within the specified time, or if the delay should appear to be seriously injurious to other parties, to make distribution to the parties in interest, exclusive of the claimant, either with or without requiring refunding bonds as might appear to be equitable.</p>

The effect of the adjudication is to allow appellee (Dr. Miller) to enforce payment of a part of an admittedly unsettled account and to turn over the other side to another suit for what may be due to him. This cannot be done. The matters are closely interwoven and were never separated by the parties; they must go together to a common settlement now.

This seems to reduce the question to a simple proposition. If the orphan’s court could not deal adequately then with the whole account, it cannot do so now, and therefore nothing remains but a bill in equity to investigate and determine the relations and obligations of the parties to each other and the amount owing by each to the other.</p>

We therefore affirm the older on his opinion, but equity under all the circumstances requires a slight modification. The parties have been distinctly notified, both by the orphans’ court and by this court, that their accounts could not be settled in this proceeding, and that it was a case for amicable reference or a bill in equity. The fact that the appellee’s claim has been reduced to two items does not vary the status of the case, for it clearly appears that these items are not separate debts of the decedent which could be proved in the orphans’ court, but are parts of numerous transactions in which there were mutual obligations, requiring an account which can only be adjusted in a court of general equity jurisdiction.</p>
