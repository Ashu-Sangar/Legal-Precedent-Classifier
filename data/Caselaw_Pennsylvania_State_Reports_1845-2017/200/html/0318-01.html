Those shall be deemed orphans who shall have lost either parent. I desire twenty thousand dollars to be expended in erecting suitable buildings, the residue to be secured in government securities, bearing not less than six per cent per annum interest. I wish the building to be erected in the City of Lancaster, south of East King Street, provided sufficient ground, not less than two acres, shall be donated therefor; if not, on the north side of said street on the same conditions. If sufficient shall not be gratuitously offered, then I desire it to be built at Columbia. The orphans who cannot be bound out may remain in the institution until the age of fifteen years, and longer if infirm, at the discretion of the authorities. ' They shall all be carefully educated in the various branches of English education and all industrial trades and pursuits. This must be left to the discretion of the authorities. No preference shall be shown on account of race or color in the admission or treatment.

It also admits that it has merely acted as custodian of the fund, and has taken no steps to erect, establish and endow a house of refuge as provided by said will, because it was advised that it had no right or authority to do so, and because it was not expedient for the trust that it should begin or undertake such erection, and it also avers that the sum in its hands was not sufficient to successfully establish and maintain the home contemplated by the testator, and that it is impossible to secure or invest the same in government securities bearing not less than six per cent per annum. It also avers that it is advised that-it is not such a trustee as is contemplated by the testator to carry out the trust, but it expresses an entire willingness to have the intent of the testator, so far as it can be ascertained, carried into effect consistently with law and equity, and to that end, that it is willing, whenever the court shall so order and direct, to account for the trust funds and to pay over the same to any person or corporation whom the court mav decide to be fully authorized, qualified and entitled to <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>carry out the provisions of testator’s will in reference to the said trust.</p>

C. C. Rep. 241. Therefore, when a charity is established in any manner, such a slight impediment as a defect or want of power in the trustee to execute it does not stand in the way; the charity remains ; the trustee is declared incapable of acting, and a competent trustee is appointed in his place. Chancery here steps in to enforce it and commits it to some one who may lawfully administer it: Frazier v. St. Luke’s Church, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20Pa.%20266" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="147 Pa. 266">147 Pa. 266</a>. While the statute of 43d Elizabeth is not here in force, the principles which the English chancery had adopted obtained with us as part of the common law. Before the year 1855 it was a clear and well settled rule, that even when the objects of the charity were uncertain, there must be held somewhere, in a competent trustee or trustees, the discretion absolutely necessary to carry them into effect by selecting those objects: Mann v. Mullin, 84 Pa*. 297. But, by the provisions of the 10th section of that act, viz : the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 331, entitled, “ An act relating to corporations and to estates held for corporate, religious and charitable uses,” a remedy was supplied for future cases in which the donor or testator had omitted to vest such a discretion in a trustee or trustees, or it had failed to be effectual by the death or other disability of the person or persons whom he may have appointed. This act was amended by the Act of May 23, 1895, P. L. 114, which act is an exact copy of the act of 1855, except that the words, “ corporations not for profit,” are inserted in the body of the act, and the proviso is entirely new. The portion of the act which it is now important <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>to consider reads: “ That no disposition of property, heretofore or hereafter made for any religious, charitable, literary or scientific use shall fail for want of a trustee, or by reason of the objects being indefinite, uncertain or ceasing, or depending upon the discretion of a last trustee, or by giving in perpetuity or in excess of the annual value heretofore limited; but it shall be the duty of any orphans’ court, or courts having equity jurisdiction in the proper county, to supply a trustee, and, by its decrees, to carry into effect the intent of the donor or testator, so far as the same can be ascertained and carried into effect consistently with law or equity, for which purpose the proceedings shall be instituted by leave of the attorney general of the commonwealth, on the relation of any institution, association, corporation not for profit, or individual, desirous of carrying such disposition into effect and willing to become responsible for the costs thereof,” etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[122,1192,1180,353]]]'>. All of the eases, therefore, involving the construction of the act of 1855, are equally applicable to the act of 1895. Under these cases and the act of assembly, there would seem to be no doubt as to the power of the court, “ by its decree, to carry into effect the intent of the donor or testator, só far as the same can be ascertained and carried into effect’ consistently with law or equity.”</p>
