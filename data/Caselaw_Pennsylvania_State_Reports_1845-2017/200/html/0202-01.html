Ike, presented his petition to the orphans’ court to sell decedent’s real estate for the payment of debts. Included in the schedule of debts were |9,000 of notes held by Jerry Ike against the decedent. Emma Ike, widow of deceased, petitioned the court for an issue to determine the validity of the notes alleging that they had been given in pursuance of the conspiracy to defraud the petitioner’s rights. The matter was referred to M. M. Morrow, Esq., as examiner to take testimony. The examiner filed a report in which it appeared that he had not permitted the widow to offer certain testimony as to fraud. The matter was referred back to him, and upon his second report, Bell, P. J., filed an opinion which was in part as follows:</p>

She offered no evidence tending to show a fraudulent scheme to deprive her of her rights as widow, but she did offer some testimony, tending to show, it is claimed, that the notes in controversy, payable to Jerry Ike, were signed by Dr. E. M. Ike with an intent to defraud creditors at a time when he was prosecuted for an alleged abortion. The offer of evidence—or that part of it wherein its purpose is disclosed—is as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[132,838,1180,669]]]'>“ The evidence is offered for the purpose of showing that after said informations (for abortion) were made and up to the. time the bill was ignored that Dr. E. M. Ike was in sore distress as to the outcome of these prosecutions, and feared that he would be ruined financially and imprisoned, and counsel for Mrs. E. M. Ike propose to argue from this that inasmuch as E. M. Ike has not shown any consideration for these notes that these notes were drawn by Dr. E. M. Ike, and left among his papers, with possibly the intention of delivering the same to his father, and that the necessity for the delivery having been done away with by the ignoring of the bills, his father, when he took out letters of administration, found these notes among the papers of the decedent in his capacity as administrator.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.6",227,[135,1516,1180,407]]]'>The examiner rejected the offer. But if the testimony had been admitted, how would the case of the widow now stand ? "We would, in the first place, have some evidence tending to show that Dr. E. M. Ike prepared and signed the notes in question as part of a scheme to cheat and defraud creditors. Just who the creditors or prospective creditors were is not disclosed by the offer, but unquestionably it was part of a scheme to cheat some one, and not to cheat his'.wife.] [8]</p>

Said legal doctrine is predicated on the idea that a debtor might have honestly repaid to his creditor a bona fide note, which note was thereupon returned to the debtor; the debtor dies and the creditor, taking advantage of access to the debtor’s papers as his executor, or administrator, seeks to collect said note a second time. But will the law stretch out its arm to invoke this doctrine in case of the estate of one who by his wrongful act in striving to cheat some one, and for a fraudulent purpose, has left the fraudulent notes among his papers ?] [4]</p>

His daughters claim under and through him , and however innocent and unoffending they must be considered of the trick intended by their father, cannot, in a legal sense, be deemed his creditors. His crime will be visited on them and the law points out to them no mode of redress, which was not open to their father.

Ike, deceased; but we have the rather remarkable assignment before us by which we are asked to review and correct alleged error committed by the court of common pleas in refusing to permit the appellant to intervene and defend in six suits, brought by the appellee to recover judgments on the said notes held by him against the estate of the decedent. This alleged error of the learned president judge of the common pleas is brought to our attention in appellant’s history of the case, and is discussed by counsel for appellee as well as for appellant in their printed argument; but we hardly think we need say anything more about the second assignment, which must have slipped into this record.</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[288,1120,1179,1077]]]'>To his petition to the orphans’ court for an order to sell the real estate of the decedent for the payment of debts, the administrator, Jerry Ike, appended the usual schedule of liabilities, in which was included the sum of $9,000 due to himself on judgment notes. The real estate was sold, exceptions were filed by the appellee to the confirmation of the sale, and she subsequently presented her petition to the court below, asking, for reasons therein set forth, that an issue be awarded to determine the validity of the several notes of her husband, making up. the $9,000 item of liability in the schedule of debts appended to the application for the order of sale. An answer to this petition was filed by the appellant, and, after hearing before an examiner, the court, in a well-considered opinion, refused the issue. No useful purpose can now be served by reviewing, simply to sanction them, the reasons given by the learned judge of the court below in denying appellant’s petition. The issue asked for was not of right, but depended upon the discretion of the court, under the facts as developed s Kates’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/148/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="148 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="981748" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0471-01">148 Pa. 471</a>. There was not only no abuse of this discretion, but in our judgment, upon a review of the whole record, a proper exercise of it.</p>
    <p id="b232-6" data-blocks='[["BL_232.6",232,[286,2207,1175,197]],["BL_233.1",233,[124,363,1182,669]]]'>If these notes of the decedent, held by the administrator, his father, ought not to be paid, the appellee can still, at the proper time, when the administration account is filed and the fund in the hands of the administrator is brought before <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>the court for distribution, contest their right to participate in it. The decree appealed from will not preclude her. It was not made in connection with the distribution of the decedent’s estate, but rather in a proceeding that grew out of the application of the administrator for an order to sell the real estate, that funds might be realized for the payment of creditors. Hereafter, when these notes, now objected to by the appellant, are formally presented to an auditor distributing the estate of the decedent, objections to them can be made and must be heard; and, even then, the issue now denied can be awarded by the court, in the exercise of its discretion, if, repeating the words of the learned judge below when he first refused it, “ It be made to appear that there is a necessity for such trial.”</p>
    <p id="A4p" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[126,1040,1179,147]]]'>The first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth specifications of error are overruled, the appeal is dismissed and the decree affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
