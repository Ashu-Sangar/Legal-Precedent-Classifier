It was to continue five years from the date the terre-tenant’s deed was recorded, under the act of 1849. Is the repugnance between the statutes so great, that we must hold that the later one repeals the earlier one ? We are not indifferent to the able opinions in the Superior Court and court of common pleas, which hold that the last impliedly repeals the former. We undertook iii Wetmore v. Wetmore, <a href="/pa/155/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="155 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="983259" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0507-01">155 Pa. 507</a>, to set forth the reasons for the passage of the act of 1849.

The act of 1887 had been six years on the statute book, in 1893, when Wetmore v. Wetmore was heard, and, although cited in the argument by appellant’s counsel, it was not pressed and the case was decided on the plain words of the act of 1849.</p>

There are no repealing words in the latter act; no remedy is supplied to overcome the evils which the act of 1849 cured. We adopt in all its force the familiar rule of interpretation of the Superior Court, that repugnant acts cannot stand together. But, are these acts absolutely irreconcilable or repugnant? We answer, apparently, they are, but we think not really so. The act of 1849 effectually stopped that juggling with the title between judgment debtor and terre-tenant which had grown up under the <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>act of 1827, and which often left the creditor with a live judgment once a lien, but which had disappeared because of collusion between the debtor and a real or fictitious purchaser.</p>

    <p id="b527-7" data-blocks='[["BL_527.7",527,[161,1146,1181,356]]]'>But, it is asked, on what does the act of 1887 operate at all if it does not operate to repeal the act of 1849 ? We answer almost in the express words of the act, it operates to relieve the land.from the lien of the judgment, where the deed to the terre-tenant has been placed of record, and in the scire facias to revive, the terre-tenant has not been named; and this is not mere supposition; it is a reasonable inference.</p>
    <p id="b527-8" data-blocks='[["BL_527.8",527,[162,1511,1180,608]]]'>It was a very common practice to issue a scire facias to revive judgments against the original debtor, and at the same time direct the sheriff to give notice to all terre-tenants, without designating them. Judgments were then often obtained against tenants for years, or at will, or they were put to the expense of defending. It was probably the intention of the legislature to put a stop to such an irregular practice. At least, the act would be in entire accord with such intention, and this of itself would warrant us in holding that the repugnancy is only apparent, but not real. If both can stand together a.nd work no injustice, then both should stand: Barber’s case, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20400" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="86 Pa. 400">86 Pa. 400</a>; Erie v.
