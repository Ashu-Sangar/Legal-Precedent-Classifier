On December 12, 1895, the Smethport and Olean Railroad Company located its right of way across a farm known as the Pelton farm, and on the same day this location was duly adopted by the board of directors. The company began the construction of its road within two years from the date of its incorporation, but at the time the bill was filed on October 4, 1899, it had not reached the Pelton farm in the laying of its tracks. In the mean time on May 9,1898, the Kushequa Railroad Company was incorporated, and on the morning of October 4, 1899, laid 1,300 feet of road in a hasty and crude manner across the defendant’s right of way on the Pelton farm. The court granted the appellant a preliminary injunction which was subsequently dissolved, Morrison, J., filing an opinion, which was in part as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b551-7" data-blocks='[["BL_551.10",551,[133,1602,1184,769]]]'>. From the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, it follows that the preliminary injunction granted on October 4, 1899, and continued in force by decree of October 16, 1899, must be dissolved; that the defendant company has a lawful right to construct its railroad across the Pelton farm on the location and grade adopted by the Smethport and Olean Company on December 12, 1895, and that the defendant company has the legal right to remove so much of the plaintiff company’s railroad as lies across its sixty feet of right of way over the Pelton farm. It also follows that upon satisfying the court that it has legally located and adopted a route for its road over the Pelton farm and across the defendant’s located line, the plaintiff company will be entitled to a decree regulating an overhead crossing by its road, of the road of the defendant company.</p>
