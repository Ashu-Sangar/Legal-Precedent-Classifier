Morrison, deceased, sold under an order of the orphans’ court a tract of land to W. C. Warner for $25,000, of which $15,000 was paid in cash, and the balance secured by a mortgage. On August 17, 1885» Warner sold and conveyed the land to Mary E. Shearman, Charles F. Morrison and G. B. Morrison, who were the heirs at law of F. S. Morrison, the consideration being the payment of the mortgage. At various times the administrator receipted on the mortgage until the whole of the mortgage was paid. On October 13,1897, B. G. Morrison, as administrator assigned to himself individually the mortgage in question in consideration of the sum of $2,059.13, which was the amount that he claimed was due to him by the other terre-tenants on account of the mortgage. This suit was subsequently begun for this balance.’ The defendants pleaded set-off, and the plaintiff pleaded the bar of the statute of limitations as to all claims of set-off over six years old. The court refused to give binding instructions for defendant.</p>
