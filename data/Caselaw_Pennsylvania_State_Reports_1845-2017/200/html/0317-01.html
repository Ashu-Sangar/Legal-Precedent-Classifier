Reist for $1,250. After plaintiff’s death a rule to open the judgment was made absolute, and at the trial of the issue the defendant offered evidence which tended to show that he had bought a stock of goods from plaintiff for $1,250, and gave the judgment in controversy. That thereafter it was agreed between himself and plaintiff that execution should issue on the judgment, and that plaintiff should buy in the stock at a price sufficient to satisf}*- certain other small executions, and then close out the goods b}' private sale, and give defendant credit for whatever should be realized and satisfy the judgment. J. Frank Reist was placed in charge qf the store, and he testified that an amount had been turned over to plaintiff from proceeds of sales to pay the judgment, less a small sum.</p>
