Hershey shall and do keep safe and account, as directed by law, for all moneys received by him for the use of the said commonwealth, and shall faithfully discharge all duties enjoined on him by law in behalf of the said commonwealth of Pennsylvania, then this obligation to be void.” The sureties on this latter bond, which is the bond in suit, were C.

The plaintiff’s statement admits that, at the time of the defalcation, there was left in the county treasury ■ $61,623.50. If the treasurer then owed the state $20,772.88, he owed the county the difference between that amount and $126,661.44,-namely, $105,888.56. It being admitted that the money which/ he had in hand could not be traced to any particular source, upon the principle conceded by the court and by all parties to-the contention, it must be apportioned between the county and the state in the proportion of $105,888.56 and $20,772.88; so that the state bondsmen are entitled to a credit of which produces a quotient of (.164) $10,106.45. This amount1 of money must, therefore, in equity and good conscience, be credited to the bondsmen on the state bond, and leaves their' liability at $10,666.43. Thus the county treasurer was in default, on account of moneys due to the state, to the amount of $10,666.43 only, and to this extent alone can these defendants, as sureties on his bond to the state, be held liable, if they can be held to be liable for'any amount.

The tax collected by the county treasurer for the state was $83,930.83. This sum was paid to the state by the county after the treasurer’s defalcation and before this action was brought. The county immediately received back from the state $62,318.65, being three fourths of the tax, less the treasurer’s commission, returned to the county under the provisions of the act of 1891, making the net payment by the county only $21,612.18. This action is founded on the right of the county to be subrogated to the use of the remedies which the state had to secure the payment to it of the tax collected by the treasurer. The right of the county is, of course, no higher than that of the state and it cannot in any event recover more than it lost by reason of the failure of the treasurer to perform his duty to the state. In an action by the state against the county, under the facts as they appear, the prinicples stated in the opinion in Commonwealth v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/157/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="157 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="846595" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0531-01">157 Pa. 531</a>, would limit the recovery to the difference between the whole tax charged and the amount of the tax which the state was required to return to the county. If the treasurer had complied with the law and paid the tax and received back three fourths thereof, the county would have been $21,612.18 better off, and this was all it was.required to pay because of his default in this particular. To charge the defend<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>ants with the whole tax, $83,930.83, is to charge them with $62,318.65, which the treasurer would have received from the state as county treasurer, and for the safe keeping of which they were not responsible. In other words if the treasurer had complied with the law as regards the state, he would have paid out $21,612.18 more than he would have received back as county treasurer; his failure in this regard cost the county $21,612.18. We are not adjusting the equities between the sureties on the county bond and those on the state bond, but dealing only with the strict rights of the parties to this action. In this view of the case the proportion of the whole loss because of the treasurer’s defalcation which should be borne by his sureties on the state bond is $10,666.43, and the judgment entered is reduced to this amount with interest from February 2, 1900. With this modification, the order of the court is affirmed.</p>
