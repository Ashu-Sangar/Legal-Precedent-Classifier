They could, however, defend their possession after the election, and if the bill were filed by them alone it would be a sufficient answer to refer them to their remedy at law. But as the bill is brought in behalf of taxpayers, the addition of the office holders, though unnecessary, does no harm. The taxpayers’ standing is beyond question, and the smallness of their interest affects not their right but the discretion of the court in the application of the remedy by injunction.</p>

If a single member of the court had a doubt on the law, we should postpone the decision. But the time, though short, is sufficient for so clear a case.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[274,677,1181,1749]]]'>The Act of April 24, 1901, P. L. 95, known as act No. 66 of the session, plainly contravenes the prohibition in section 7 of article 8 of the constitution against the passage of any local or special law “regulating the affairs of counties, cities,” etc. It provides that “ there shall be elected in each county coextensive in boundary with a city of the first class, three persons to serve as members of the board of revision of taxes,” etc. This description cannot apply either at the present time or in the proximate future to any county but Philadelphia, and for that reason the act is distinctly local and special. It cannot be sustained on the ground of classification, for it is outside of all the principles on which classification is permissible. The rule is stated in Lloyd v. Smith, <a href="/pa/176/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="176 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="882204" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0213-01">176 Pa. 213</a>, that “a law which does not exclude any one from a class, and applies to all the members of the class equally, is general,” and the converse is also true that a law which does permanently exclude any one from the class must be special. The fact that the law applies to only one county now would not be a sufficient objection if in the natural progress of events under existing laws, others may grow into the class hereafter. But the way must be clear for them to do so. No such way is left open by this statute. It is not a law relating to cities of the first class, but to counties coextensive with them and there is no other county than Philadelphia which is now so coextensive in boundary, nor is there any law on the statute books by which any other county can become so. If any city shall hereafter grow into the first class, as Pittsburg is rapidly doing, its county will not come under this, act without further legislation to enable it to do so, and even then it will come in not by virtue of any generality in this act, but by the provisions of such subsequent legislation. So far as the operation of this act is concerned it not only applies to but one county now, but permanently excludes all others. That is not classification but special and local legislation on a forbidden subject.</p>

    <p id="b663-6" data-blocks='[["BL_663.6",663,[117,780,1181,770]]]'>This act is equally and even more frankly local than No. 66, for it applies only to the city of Philadelphia by name. It is argued, however, that it is valid under the part of section 7 which permits the passage of laws repealing special or local acts. The present act, however, is not a repeal of the act of 1865, but only of a part of it, and in such manner as to amount merely to an alteration of the local law. The object of the permission in the constitution to repeal local and special laws was to allow the legislature to do away with exceptions, and bring interests previously under special or local statutes into conformity with the general laws of the state. This act does nothing of that kind. It merely makes a change in the mode of filling an office whose name, powers and duties are left as they were before. This is not repealing an old local law but making a new one.</p>
