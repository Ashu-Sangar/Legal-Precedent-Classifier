Nor does the agreement bind the water company to furnish a sufficient supply. On the contrary, the agreement is “ to furnish free of charge all the water that may be necessary in case of fire, provided the company’s supply is sufficient for such emergency.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.6",427,[133,1406,1185,922]]]'>The company’s theory of their original charter was the simple right of attachment regardless of quantity of supply, and the agreement made is strictly in accord with this theory. How can it be said that such an agreement permitting the taking of water for fire purposes, a right already granted under their original charter, shall be held to be a contract on the part of the borough to forfeit its right to construct its own works, and to be the execution and carrying out of its full unlimited power to provide a supply of water for the use of its inhabitants ? We agree with the counsel for the defendant that the water neededforthe extinguishment of fires is only an infinitesimal part of the water needed for the use of the inhabitants of a borough. To say, therefore, that when the borough accepts gratis the water for extinguishment of fires, it- forfeits its greater and more comprehensive power to supply water for all purposes of the inhabitants of the borough, is to say something that is altogether unreasonable and which our Supreme Court has never suggested.</p>
