Clearly that was a very different procedure from that now under review.</p>

We do not so interpret the decision. On the contrary, we think it is apparent, from the opinion, that the thing condemned was the arbitrary assessment of the whole cost of an improvement upon abutting properties, whether such properties are specially benefited or not, to the extent of the cost, and without regard to that consideratión.”</p>

The structure of the pavement along its entire extent is uniform in distance and quality. There is no showing that there is any difference in the value of any of the lots abutting on the improvements.” The cost of the pavement was apportioned and charged against the abutting property owners, according to the “ foot front rule.” This method of assessment was approved by the Supreme Court of the United States with the statement that it was “ an orderly procedure, under a scheme of local improvements, prescribed by the legislature, and approved by the courts of the state, as consistent with constitutional principles.”</p>
