By “one full share ” testator undoubtedly means share of the principal, for if we hold it to mean only a share of the income, there would be no disposition of the principal fund at all, and as to it he would die intestate. He cannot be presumed to have so intended.

In most instances the amount set apart, being in sums a multiple of $5,000, seems to indicate that he had in mind a legacy to each nephew and niece of $5,000. What he evidently had in view at the time he drafted his original will was eqirality in his gifts. So long, therefore, as the expression, “one full share,” can be grammatically construed to apply to either the principal or annual interest, and by holding it to refer to the principal, this idea of equality can only be carried out and the fund itself finally distributed, and thus avoiding intestacy, it is manifest it should be so held. To hold that testator meant income would merely result in the <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>creation of a gift of the income in perpetuity, and would, by operation of law, vest the principal in the children.</p>

As we have seen, the trust is a valid one, and without modification, subsequently, by the testator, would continue until, in process of time, the principal became absolutely vested in the grandchildren of John Reilly. The plain and ordinary meaning of the language of this clause, however, is to put a period to the trust, to provide a contingency upon the happening of which the trust determines, and the principal is at once payable to those who, under the twelfth clause, were only to receive the income. The contingency provided for has actually happened. William H. Reilly, one of the children of John, survived the testator and died without lawful issue. The force and effect of the twenty-first clause becomes of vital importance to the trust.</p>

So that it is manifest that when testator, in the twenty-first clause, provides for the death of any one of the children without lawful issue, he means dying after his own decease. That is the period of time he had in view. “ Dying without lawful issue ” means in cases of personalty, not an indefinite failure of issue, but without issue at the time of his, the legatee’s, death. “In gifts of personalty the phrase ‘ die without issue ’ means die without issue living at the death of the person, the failure of whose issue is spoken of: ” Eachus’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/91/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="91 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="488056" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0105-01">91 Pa. 105</a>.

Why he should strike down this trust upon the happening of this contingency, it is of course impossible to say, but it is worthy of note that he does so only in the case of the bequest to the children of John. In all the other trusts, except that established in the tenth, clause, there is the same omission to provide for the death of a legatee without issue, but in not one of them does he seek to supply that omission. In the tenth clause he provides that the fund, upon a certain contingency, shall fall into the residue of his estate. The testator must have had some special reason for singling out the children of John for this extraordinary favor which he denied to the other beneficiaries. Unless then some established rule of construction can be found which will- pervert the plain and ordinary meaning of testator’s words, and render them of practically no effect, the conclusion is inevitable that he appreciated their full force and effect, and intended to do exactly what his words undoubtedly accomplished. That he could, if he desired, terminate this trust upon such a contingency, is certain; that the language used is sufficient for that purpose is equally <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>certain. The clause is not ambiguous or equivocal. It can be interpreted without changing or supplying a single word. The fact that it conflicts with a previous clause establishing a valid trust is of no moment; that is the very object of its insertion in the will. That fact simply necessitates a careful scrutiny of the conflicting clauses, and the will as a whole, and if the inconsistency is clear and irreconcilable, and the language of the later clause free from doubt and unambiguous, then it must be permitted to have its full effect.</p>

It is against public policy, therefore, that parties should, by the terms of a private agreement in advance, oust their jurisdiction.

    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[160,766,709,43]]]'>And the twenty-first clause, which is:</p>
    <p id="b327-7" data-blocks='[["BL_327.7",327,[114,818,1178,406]]]'>“ My executors are to define the provisions of this, my will, and their decision shall be final and conclusive upon all matters in it.

    <p id="b327-8" data-blocks='[["BL_327.8",327,[113,1232,1181,614]]]'>Under the twelfth clause, above quoted, a trust was created by the decedent for the benefit of the children of his brother John. Provision was made for the payment of the annual interest upon the sum of 140,000, to a class, viz: The children of John Reilly, and upon the death of each one of that class, one full share was given to his or her child, or children. The words “ one full share ” as here used, evidently meant one full share in the principal of the fund. Otherwise, there would be intestacy as to the principal. The intent to carry the corpus, or principal, over to others, clearly appears, and in such case, the words of the will must be permitted to have their proper force: Bentley v. Kauffman, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20101" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="86 Pa. 101">86 Pa. 101</a>.</p>

These, as a class, took the income, with remainder over, of the principal sum, to the issue of those comprising the class. This was the status, in so far as the twelfth clause was concerned. But the estate in remainder, so provided, was, by the language in the twenty-first clause, made subject to being defeated, by any member of the class dying without issue. A new contingency was thus imposed which prevented the remainder from becoming a vested one, so long as the contingency was liable <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>to happen. Authority for this proposition is found in McBride v. Smyth, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Pa.%20248" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="54 Pa. 248">54 Pa. 248</a>, in the language of Justice Strong, who said:</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[297,493,1177,301]]]'>“ This is not a mere postponement of the time of enjoyment. It is a selection of individuals from a class to be donees of a right; a description of persons, not a regulation of interest given. It is impossible to admit that a gift to such a number of persons as may meet a defined description, is a gift to all the persons, whether they meet the description or not.”</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.6",328,[299,803,1180,715]]]'>The rule of legal construction, as well as the testamentary intent in such cases, is well stated in Smith on Executory Interests, page 281. It is said: “ Where real or personal estate is devised or bequeathed to such children, or child, or individuals, as shall attain a given age; or the children who shall sustain a certain character, or do a particular act, or be living at a certain time, without any distinctive gift to the whole class, preceding such restrictive description, so that the uncertain event forms part of the description of the devisee or legatee, the interest so devised is necessarily contingent on account of the person. For until the age is attained, the character is sustained, or the act is performed, the person is unascertained; there is no person answering the description of the person who is to take as devisee or legatee.”</p>

That event has happened in the death of William H. Reilly, without issue. Until the death of a member of the class, without issue, the gift in remainder created by the twelfth clause of the will, was contingent. But, with the happening of the event, contemplated in the twenty-first section, came in force the gift of $40,000, which, in the words of the testator, “ shall be equally divided among the surviving children of my said brother, John.” In clause twelve, reference was made to a share in the principal sum. But, in the twenty-first clause, the gift is not of a share in, but of the whole bequest of $40,000, to be equally divided as directed. We are unable to agree with the learned court below, that, in order to give effect to the intention of the testator, it is necessary to interpolate the words “ his share in ” so as to make the clause of the twenty-first section read: “If one or <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>more of the children of my brother John, shall die without lawful issue (his share in) the bequest of forty thousand dollars .shall be equally divided among the surviving children of my brother John.”</p>

In which event the principal sum was at once to be made payable to those, who, theretofore, had been receiving the income. The testator had a perfect right to terminate the trust, upon "such a contingency, if he so desired. The language used by him is ample for the purpose.
