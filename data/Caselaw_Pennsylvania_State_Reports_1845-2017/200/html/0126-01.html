    <p id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.11",151,[132,862,1181,720]]]'>The city of Scranton paved Mulberry street, with sheet asphalt, and assessed the cost upon the abutting property owners. The assessment was laid without regard to the number of square yards of pavement in front of any particular property, but was made upon a pro rata basis, which was ascertained by dividing the entire cost of the improvement in proportion to the number of feet of property fronting on the street. Immediately in front of the defendant’s property a street railway had laid its tracks, and paved that portion of the street so occupied by it. The effect was to reduce the amount of paving required to be done by the city, at that point. For this reduction, the defendant claimed he was entitled to credit. The city ignored this claim, and divided the whole cost of paving the street among the total property frontage.</p>
    <p id="b151-8" data-blocks='[["BL_151.12",151,[135,1589,1180,252]]]'>Upon a case stated, the learned court below held, that the basis for the assessment thus adopted by the city was not correct. Judgment was accordingly entered for the amount admitted to be due by the defendant, and, upon appeal by the city to the Superior Court, this judgment was affirmed.</p>

The act of assembly under which that improvement was made, authorized “ an equal assessment on the foot front, bounding on said street.” It was held that the property upon the east side, the title being in the city, was not subject to assessment, and that the whole cost must be collected from the properties ■ abutting upon the other side of the street. But it is carrying the effect of the decision in that case too far to hold that it is authority for the proposition that the assessment upon each property must be limited to the cost of the work done immediately in front of it.</p>

Properties in the same general situation are presumed to get the same general benefit from a common improvement, and as this benefit is assessed exclusively on property abutting on the line of the improvement, it is presumed to be fairly measured by the foot frontage of the property on that line, though values may be, and usually are, very different, and dependent on other circumstances, such as the depth of the lots,” etc.</p>

This was followed by the enactment of an ordinance by the city councils, authorizing the work to be done, under the direction of the city engineer, and, according to plans and specifications. The city engineer was instructed to make the assessment for the cost of the paving according to the “ foot front ” rule against the abutting owners, giving notice to said owners as provided by law. The work was admittedly done in accordance with the contract and the specifications. The city engineer made the assessment in strict accordance with the law, and, as a result, the property of the appellee was assessed in the sum of $286, that amount being in proportion to the number of feet which his property fronts upon the street. The jurisdiction of the city authorities under the admitted facts of this case cannot be questioned, and there being no allegation of fraud or defective workmanship* or mistake in the computation of the engineer, the assessment must be regarded as conclusive.</p>
