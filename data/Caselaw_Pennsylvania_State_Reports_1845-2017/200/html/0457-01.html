The shares were divided into sixteenths, and the term of the partnership was for twenty years. On a bill in equity by two of the partners representing three and one half sixteenths against the. other partners for an account, it appeared that one of the plaintiffs was a woman, and the other was engaged in banking in a distant state. Three of the defendants were practical men in the coal business and one of them who acted as manager or superintendent was an educated mining engineer of large experience in his profession. The evidence showed no bad faith or fraud in the management of the business. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants should account for a very large expenditure on a tunnel over a mile long, for the cost of a dwelling house for the superintendent, for a salary of $10,000 a year of an assistant superintendent, and for various other matters of expenditure. The evidence showed that the large expenditure for the tunnel was due to unforeseen conditions in the strata, impossible to determine beforehand; that the house was occupied by the superintendent who paid an annual rental which equaled-six per cent of its cost. As to other items explanation was made tending to show that they were necessary to carry on the business successfully and for a profit. <em>Held, </em>that the defendants were under no duty to account.</p>

      <em>We </em>may note, first, that Alvan Markle is no longer a party plaintiff. After the testimony was all in, and before the court below considered it, he withdrew, substantially, acknowledging he had been mistaken in his complaint; then when the decree he had joined in asking for was entered, he appealed from it. Further, appellants aver that George B. Markle, one of the two remaining plaintiffs, has no standing as a party, because his interest as a partner had become vested in his two sisters, Clora Markle, plaintiff, and Ida Hessenbruch, one of the defendants. As to the issue raised by this objection, it is not material in this case; the whole question Avas considered and finally decided in Hessenbruch v. George B. Markle, <a href="/pa/194/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="194 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="912385" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0581-01">194 Pa. 581</a>. Although that case Avas a close one and the court by no means of one mind, we adhere to that decision and will not “ thresh that old straAV over again; ” it would profit neither side to this appeal. Besides, no one questions that Clora Markle became the equitable if not the absolute owner of the moiety of her brother, George, bjr assignment from him, so that, he could properly appear as a party, if she made no objection, tó urge the enhancement of the value of her interest held in pledge before and advocate her complaint as against her co-partners, these defendants.</p>

Wilbur and Ida Markle, for the purpose of mining coal upon lands held by the firm under lease from the Union Improveinent Company, for thirty years from January 1, 1890, and from the Highland Coal Company, for thirty years from January 1,1892, the interests of the partners being as follows: William Lilly, six thirty-seconds; E. P. Wilbur, twelve thirty-seconds ; John Markle, four thirty-seconds ; J. B. Markle, four thirty-seconds; Clora Markle, one thirty-second; Ida Markle, one thirty-second. The partnership was to begin January 1, 1890, and to continue to January 1,1920. Any partner might sell his interest to any of the remaining members of the firm, but not to a third person without written consent. Assignment was not to work a dissolution, and in case of death the executors were to represent the estate. While John Markle gave his personal attention and so long as his management should <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>be satisfactory to all interests, he was to be allowed a salary of $15,000 per annum.</p>

That in further pursuance of the conspiracy to defraud, he neglected and refused to accept pay for coal sold to the Lehigh Yalley Coal Company; and that he made grossly inaccurate statements and plaintiffs had no means of finding the true account. That John Markle and his associates built a tunnel known as the Jeddo tunnel, of which they could get no true accounts, and built another tunnel which the plaintiffs thought was worthless, but the true cost of which was unknown. That he built a house for himself at Jeddo, at a cost of $16,000, which he paid for out of the current fund. That he made grossly inaccurate statements of the net earnings. That the books had been kept at Jeddo exclusively by John Markle and his clerks; that they could only have access to them under espionage. That no meeting of the members of the firm had been called. That John Markle had pledged to Drexel &amp; Company security to indemnify Drexel &amp;■ Company against his unlawful acts.

It denies conspiracy or agreement to exclude the plaintiffs from the management, except as contemplated in the articles of partnership, alleging that the majority in-interest had a right to govern. It denies that he agreed to act as manager only so long as satisfactory to all, and alleges that at the formation of the firm, it was understood by all, that he was to have control and direction of the business, as it would be impossible for the other partners to find time to take any active part.

In Jiis sale to Markle, Mr. Wilbur stipulated, that he should retain title to the interest until it was paid for. It was not paid for while he acted as a partner, under the terms of this sale. Wilbur, still holding a legal title, his vendee, John Markle, was the only proper party to object, and he did not do so. Therefore, in any view of the evidence, the management, good or bad, was expressly authorized or subsequently ratified by a very large majority of the partners in number and value. A very small minority, these two complainants, must now be treated as objecting. The court below, in its third conclusion of law, says: “ A majority of the members .... may do all those things necessary for successfully carrying on the business contemplated in the articles of copartnership but this correct enunciation of the law is neutralized by that part of his conclusion immediately following it, when he says: “ But they have not the power to make permanent improvements, nor to establish a surplus fund for future improvements, nor to build a house, nor to employ clerks at excessive salaries, nor to employ an assistant superintendent, nor to do any other act not necessary for the ordinary business operations of the firm, without the consent of the minority members.”</p>

The firm must have its origin in the mutual confidence reposed by the persons who comprise it, in each other’s skill, integrity and capacity.

It was the rule of the common law that the contracts of partnership must be governed, like other agreements, by the principles of natural law and justice. It has accordingly been held that, where a firm consists of more than two persons, the majority, acting fairly and in good faith, may direct the conduct of its affairs as long as they keep within the purpose and scope of the partnership: 2 Bouvier’s Inst. sec. 1454; Story on Part. <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>sec. 123. In such case, the minority must yield, so long as the majority do not transcend or pervert the powers with which the firm has been invested. If the number of partners should in any given case be an even number and they should be evenly divided in opinion, with no provision for such a contingency in their articles, then it may be that, as to that subject, the power of the firm to act is suspended so long as the even division continues ; and, if the subject be one upon which action is essential to the purposes of the partnership, such disagreement might work a dissolution by rendering the further prosecution of the common enterprise impossible. The same consequences could not flow, however, from the dissent of a minority, because, within the purpose of the partnership and for the promotion of its interests, the majority have the right to control.”</p>

John Maride was appointed superintendent or manager in tlie articles of copartnership, at a salary of $15,000, and continued till October, 1892, when the plaintiffs gave notice that, they were dissatisfied with his management. He, from that time, ceased to draw his salary, but continued in the management the same as before. He is an educated mining engineer, of large experience, and had the full confidence of his father, who for many years was a large coal operator in that region. During the five years, 1890 to 1894, inclusive, the partnership made large profits, over $1,000,000. Of this, forty per centum of the capital invested was paid out in dividends to the partners and part of the balance was expended in improvements, and part set aside as a fund to meet contingencies such as insurance and depreciation in the value of machinery, and so forth. E. P. Wilbur had been in the coal business all his life and was active as a consulting partner. General Lilly while he lived, was active in consultation and advice, and two of his executors after his death.</p>

This business, by the terms of the articles, was to continue twenty years. This tunnel, over a mile long, cost over $200,000 much more than the original estimate, owing to impossible to <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>be foreseen conditions in the strata penetrated. A dwelling house for the superintendent, costing $16,000, was erected, on which John paid an annual rental equal to six per cent of its cost. An assistant superintendent, at a salary of $10,000 was employed. It is alleged that this last amount is excessive and that defendants must account for and pay over the excess. That the setting aside of an insurance fund without consent of plaintiff was illegal. And so with other items of expenditure; the court directs that defendants shall account for all of them and pay over to plaintiffs their share.</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[274,877,1179,1386]]]'>The fault we find with the learned judge’s conclusion is, that it does not follow the premise laid down by him. He concedes, that a majority of the members of the firm had the power, if they acted bona fide, to do all those things necessary for successfully carrying on the business contemplated in the articles of copartnership. He does not intimate that they acted mala fides, nevertheless, having acted in good faith according to their honest judgment as to the necessity of the expenditures, he imposes upon them the most severe penalty. He could not have made it more severe if he had found they had acted in bad faith, or had grossly and wilfully mismanaged the partnership affairs. He acts on his own judgment, as to how the property has been managed, and wholly disregards the judgment of the partnership; this, too, long after the event when the exercise of foresight is no longer required. It is plain that the Jeddo tunnel cost more money than it would have cost if its projectors could have seen thousands of feet into the mountain through which it was dug, before they determined its dimensions ; but they planned it with the best skill and light they had; after proceeding a considerable distance, they found entirely different conditions from what they had been led to expect and were compelled to greatly change their plans. This was a costly mistake, the consequence of a want of knowledge, which no human power could have given them before the commencement of the work, but which certainly subjects them to no penalty for a mere ignorance which they could not dispel. And the same may be said of all their other acts complained of.</p>

This interpretation of articles <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>of copartnership to produce and market annually many thousands of tons of coal during a period running through many years, is entirely too narrow. It is the interpretation put by jurists upon the federal constitution, “ whatever power is not expressly granted is withheld.” But it was error to put that interpretation upon articles such as these, applicable to a business such as this; rather the interpretation should be, that whatever power is necessary to a profitable transaction of the business is impliedly given to the partnership, and as the authorities cited show, the action in good faith of a majority of the partners is that of the partnership. The learned judge holds, that the partnership had no authority to make a permanent improvement ; but who should decide what is a permanent improvement? No doubt the Jeddo tunnel, and other tunnels, were permanent, in that, they would remain there after the termina,tion of the partnership; and the superintendent’s house would also remain; they could not remove the tunnel or the house and use them elsewhere; but that is not the test to be applied to this partnership agreement. What was immediately necessary for the successful operation of the property? That, must be constructed, even if it endured a century and in the distant future might largely benefit others. Nearly all mine improvements, constructed by those who first open the mines but do not exhaust them, are more or less beneficial to their successors ; those who made them do not destroy them when their term ends ; therefore, in this sense, they are permanent. But they were constructed solely for the benefit of those who made them, because, they to them, were necessary during their temporary occupation of the land, but no longer. In this sense they were temporary, and it may be safely assumed, would not have been made if those who expended their money on them had not deemed them immediately necessary for their profit. The manifest weight of the evidence sustains all of the material averments of the defendants in their answer as to the immediate necessity for these improvements and other expenditures. They are not bound to account further, because they have regularly and fully accounted and paid the net earnings to the partners. Any funds in their hands, for which they, according to their answer are held for distribution and for which they have not <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>yet accounted to the plaintiffs, should at once be paid over, acr companied by satisfactory accounts.</p>

As is obvious, from her testimony, her knowledge of the business is very limited and her principal advisor is her brother, George; but, as long as that relation continues, she must abide the consequences which flow from his guidance. As to John and George, they are intolerant of each other. John is a competent mining engineer and business man. His testimony shows that he is not ignorant of his own merits. George has not been successful. His large éstate,— at least, a great part of it,—has slippéd awajr from him; he ha.s become embittered against his associates, especially his brother John, and doubtless believes they have wronged him. His belief is founded on no facts warranting it. Perhaps if John, th.e manager, had shown toward him a little more gentleness, and had acted with a little more tact, all this prolonged and expensive litigation, which has now been before us in different shapés in not less than four appeals might have beén avoided. George, perhaps, might have been convinced, as was his brother Al van, that his copartners were in good faith managing this large and profitable property for the best interests of all. But it is useless to now speculate. It is possible the partnership may be harmoniously conducted in the future. If not, then at the end of six months from filing this decree, under the clause of the agreement providing for the sale of an interest of any one.'of -the partners to the others, the court below m'ay have to interfere, if they cannot agree. Therefore, while we reverse the decree of the court below, we will not finally dismiss, the bill, but leave it pending, so that equity' may be done in this particular without disturbing the ordinary business operations of the partnership.</p>
