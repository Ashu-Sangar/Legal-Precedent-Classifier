The act of April 28, 1899, was declared unconstitutional. Supervisors were appointed by this court, Judge Stewart sitting, and the contract decreed, which was duly entered into, and the contractor, the said coal and iron company, made and repaired the roads and bridges of said township for said year. The township’s portion of the license money for the year amounted to $2,935. This was paid by the county treasurer to the supervisors, who turned the same over to the contractor, and the money was used upon the roads. The petitioner, alleging that he was the duly elected and qualified treasurer of the township, has instituted these proceedings to the end that the fund may be turned oyer to him as such treasurer.</p>

The township was entitled to elect a treasurer under the general township act, and we conclude that in any event he was the proper treasurer of the township.</p>

By the Act of June 9,1891, P. L. 248, amending the Act of May 13,1887, P. L. 108, regulating the sale of liquors, four fifths of the license fees paid for licenses in townships are to be paid to the township treasurers, to “ be applied to keeping the roads in good repair.” In townships not having treasurers, this money is,ex necessitate, paid to the supervisors, who in such townships, are practically township treasurers for the receipt and expenditure of moneys for road purposes; but, where the office of township treasurer exists, the license money due the township can, under the act of June 8,1891, be paid to no one else.</p>

L. 464—and subsequently thereto, and payment of the same was refused. The answer of the appellant admits that the relator had been duly elected treasurer of Coal township, and had qualified as such, under the provisions of the act of assembly of April 28,1899; that the said sum of money paid for licenses had been in his hands until September 11,1900—ten days after it had become due and payable to the treasurer of the township—aixd ten days after it had been demanded by that officer; and, as a reason why he should not now pay it to the relator, sets forth the payment to <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>persons alleged, under the circumstances stated in the answer, to have been the supervisors of the township.</p>
    <p id="b387-5" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[114,460,1185,1191]]]'>The act of assembly is clear that the money is payable to the township treasurer, to be applied to keeping the roads in repair. This means that the proper township authorities can direct the expenditure of the money so paid to the township treasurer; but, in the first instance, it must be paid to him. The conditions stated in the answer of the appellant under which he paid the money to the supervisors, cannot relieve him now from paying it to the officer designated by the act of assembly as the person to whom it must be paid and who, it is admitted, has qualified himself to receive it. That it may have actually been used for road purposes by persons not authorized to receive it, cannot affect the liability of the appellant to pay it to the officer specifically named as the one to whom it must be paid. There is no allegation that the election of the township treasurer was irregular, or that the election at which he was elected had not been, in all respects, legal; on the contrary, we have the distinct admission of the due election and qualification of the relator, and to him alone was the money payable in the first instance, the supervision of its expenditure being, as stated, with the proper township authorities. Under the plain admissions in the answer, the writ of - mandamus could not have been withheld, and the order of the court below, in directing it to issue, is affirmed.</p>
