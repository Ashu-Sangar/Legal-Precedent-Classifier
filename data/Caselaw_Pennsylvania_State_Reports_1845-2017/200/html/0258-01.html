So we say to you that there is no evidence here that would call upon us to construe the two instruments in writing, the deed and the <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>will, or that would justify us iu saying that he had a right to live somewhere else.

The assignments are therefore dismissed and the judgment entered as aforesaid is affirmed.</p>
