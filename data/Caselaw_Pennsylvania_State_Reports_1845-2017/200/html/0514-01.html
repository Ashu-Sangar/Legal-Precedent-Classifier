By reason of the washout and defective filling there was a drop of at least seven inches if a pedestrian stepped over, or slipped off, the edge of the stone, and then a slope down into a hole several feet in depth. This condition of things had existed for not less than five or six months immediately prior to <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>the accident, and the testimony of one witness was to the effect that it existed in this way from the time the sidewalk was originally filled up, in 1893, continuously to the time of the accident.</p>
