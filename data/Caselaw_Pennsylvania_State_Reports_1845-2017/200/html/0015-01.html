To say its obligations are discharged by a vain attempt to make them; that'the plaintiff is bound to accept useless form of assessments is unreasonable. The parties contemplated valid charges on the property. The term assessment clearly implies this ; nothing short of a lawful assessment—one capable of enforcement, satisfies it. It was such assessments the plaintiff agreed to accept, and assumed the risk of collecting. The parties were mutually mistaken respecting the authority to pay in the special manner designated; but this does not relieve the defendant from its obligation to pay.</p>

There, tbe term “assessment” signifies, and can only signify, a proceeding which creates a charge on the property specified. The statute first provides for this proceeding and charge, and then for its transfer to the contractor.

The inability to collect assessments, in the Harrisburg case, resulted through no fault or mistake of the Harrisburg city councils ; it was the act of the Supreme Court, or rather defective legislation by the state legislature, which caused the loss. But, in this present Altoona case, the loss was occasioned by the fault, or mistake, of the city councils of said city in passing the ordinances through both branches of councils on the same day. Should not said city, then, bear the loss caused by the mistake of its own representatives, rather than bondholders who have paid their money out on the faith of the validity of the bonds ?

There provision was made for the payment of said debt by assessment on abutting property and adjacent (but not abutting) property supposed to-be benefi'tted; here, like provision was made by assessments on abutting property; there, such provision failed because “the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of Park Avenue Sewers, <a href="/pa/169/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="169 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="870613" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0433-01">169 Pa. 433</a>, decided that assessments levied against property not abutting ” were illegal; here a like provision for the payment of the debt by assessments failed because the city councils of Altoona passed the ordinance through both branches on the same day.</p>
