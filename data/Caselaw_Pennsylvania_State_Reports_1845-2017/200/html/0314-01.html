The telegraph company owned the wires along the defendant’s right of way, but they were used by the defendant under a contract between the two companies. Clune’s negligence, which caused the accident consisted in ordering the men to place a hand-car on the track on a foggy morning with<a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>out making any inquiry as to tbe movement of trains.
