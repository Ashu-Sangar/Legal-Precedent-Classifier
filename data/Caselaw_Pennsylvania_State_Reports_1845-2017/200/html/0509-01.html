We have already stated that these parties subscribed for the stock on the morning of the day they were elected directors. These subscriptions were on that morning handed by A. K. Stevenson, one of the parties, to P. V. Land, the secretary and treasurer of the company, and also one of the directors, who on that day resigned, that the respondents might be appointed. He paid nothing at the time, but being told that “it would take $35.00,” said to Land, “You just pay it for me and I will pay you to-morrow or next day.” He says that he, a few days afterward, paid the amount, and that the other three parties subsequently paid him. Admittedly Stevenson’s payment to Land was some days after December 20, the day of the election of directors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[120,1073,1182,302]]]'>It thus appears that the controlling and only disputed fact is, did Land pay the $3.75 dues on each five shares of stock to the association before the election in the afternoon of December 20 ? The other money, $20.00, is made up of an admission fee of $5.00 each, the payment of which is not a prerequisite to eligibility.</p>

We, however, give the respondents the benefit of the literal rendering of the law. If, however, they are allowed to prepay and become eligible the day they subscribe, they cannot complain if they are held to a strict compliance with the by-law. In the present case, they, although Land was the secretary and treasurer of the company, constituted him their agent to furnish and pay the money. The burden is upon them to show that he did this. Have they shown that he separated the money from his own funds and put it into the control of the company, so as to complete the payment ? He did not enter the payment on the book of the company until January 4,1901. Two witnesses testified that on December 27 or 28, he told them he yet had the money in his pocket. He says that he put the advance dues, $3.75 each, in a drawer in the safe on December 20, attaching- a memorandum showing what it was, but forgot -or neglected to enter the payment on the books; that he <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>retained the admission fees as his commission, that he spoke of them when he said on December 27, that- he had the money in his pocket; but that he that day added this $20.00 to the money in the safe. These payments were not entered on the subscription card, as seems to be the custom. The drawer in the safe is one to which Land alone had the key. The memorandum which was attached to the money is without date, and it shows a deposit for each one of $8.75, or $35.00 in all, although admittedly $20.00 of that amount was not put in the safe until December 20, 1900.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[288,864,1180,714]]]'>If this memorandum was intended to show other officers or employees of the company where the money came from, why attach a $35.00 memorandum to a deposit of $15.00? This seems to corroborate the witnesses, who say that on the 27th Land simply claimed that he had the money in his pocket. If this is so, then he either meant that he had money of his own sufficient to pay the advance, or that he had, then, the money which A. K. Stevenson paid him some days after the election. It is even doubtful whether, under the circumstances, a putting of the money in a drawer of which Land alone had the key, with no entry on the books, should be considered as a payment. But we do not consider it necessary to rest our conclusion on this. These respondents have not shown the payment of the money prior to the election.</p>
