Lefevre, in trust, “ subject to the payment to my estate of the sum of $5,000 within six months from the time of my decease.” Instead of paying this money in cash to the executors, Franklin P. Lefevre gave them a mortgage for $5,000 on the property, which they sold and thus realized for the estate $5,000. This money the executors had been advised was part of the general fund of the estate, applicable to debts, etc. They accordingly applied the whole of it toward paying debts, the collateral inheritance tax ordered by the testator to be paid, etc., and took credit for these moneys thus expended in their account.

Lefevre property, was not property applicable to the payment of debts, collateral inheritance tax and expenses of the estate, but was payable as a pecuniary legacy to them, and had, therefore, been wrongly appropriated by the executors.

This payment was in frill discharge of all the annual instalments of <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>principal due on the legacj" up to January 26, 1897, and also of the interest due on the entire legacy of $5,000 up to January 26, 1897. There now remain due three instalments of principal of $500 each, payable respectively on January 26, 1898,1899 and 1900, with interest thereon at four per cent from January 26,1897. When the executors have paid these remaining instalments, they will then have paid in all to Mr. Witmer and Mrs. Shertz, $6,530. Although they have not yet actually paid the unmatured instalments of principal amounting to $1,500, they stand now surcharged with them by the confirmation of the former auditor’s report and are, therefore, under personal liability to pay them when due, and while not formally surcharged in the former auditor’s report with interest on the legacy beyond January 26, 1896, the confirmation of that report, based on the decree of the Supreme Court, fixes their liability also for the whole of this interest as it becomes due. They have, therefore, now paid or become personally liable to pay the whole of this legacy and interest, amounting to $6,530. They may, therefore, be said to have relieved the estate with their own moneys, and are in consequence entitled to be reimbursed by the estate these $6,530.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[289,1424,1179,975]]]'>In order that they may be made entirely whole, they must, however, also be paid by the estate interest from the time of its payment on the moneys ($4,190), which they have actually now paid out on account of this legacy. As to the unpaid instalments, if they are now put in funds by the estate to meet these, and the interest on them when due, they will be protected as to that part of the surcharge. But as to what they have already paid they are entirely out of pocket and it will not be sufficient that they be simply repaid the moneys which they have advanced; they are in addition entitled to interest on these moneys from the time when they paid them up to the time when they are repaid by the estate. The interest on the $4,910 paid by them would amount, on August 21, 1897, the date of filing this report, to $110.47, and this amount will be added to the $6,530. already found to be due them from the estate. When the order to mortgage, which is hereafter recommended, comes to be made, if it is made, it should, however, include in addition to what is here found due the executors, interest on $4,910 from August 21,1897.</p>

      <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>We think there is no room whatever for question that the estate is liable to repay the executors the principal of the legacy with which they have now been surcharged for the benefit of Mr. Witmer and Mrs. Shertz. These moneys were used to pay Mr. Lefevre’s debt, and now that the executors are obliged to repay them to the legatees, his debts have for the time being been paid with the executors’ own money, and the estate now owes them to the executors. That the executors should be left in the position of having paid Mr. Leievre’s debts and the collateral tax out of their own money, while a large estate left by him would thus pass to his legatees and devisees, clear of his debts and the tax on these legacies and devises would be too manifesty unjust to need argument.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[132,1023,1181,1028]]]'>We think, however, that the executors are in like manner entitled to be reimbursed by the estate for the interest which they are obliged to pay Mr. Witmer and Mrs. Shertz on their legacy, for the time during which it has been withheld from them. The estate and not the executors personally has had the use during this time of their $5,000 legacy. If the executors had not had this in hand, they would have been obliged, at the very outset, to raise this amount out of the rest of the estate, and in that case whichever of the beneficiaries under the will would have had to contribute, would have lost the use which they had otherwise had up to this time of so much of their devises as would have been required for this purpose. There is, therefore, no injustice but exact equity in requiring the estate now to reimburse the executors for the interest which they are compelled to pay Mr. Witmer and Mrs. Shertz for the use up to this time of their legacy, and also in reimbursing the executors by interest for the use of their own money which they have now advanced to repay the principal and interest of the Witmer and Shertz legacy thus far used for the purposes of the estate.</p>

It was on this theory that a credit of $1,617.50 was allowed them in the restatement of their account in the former audit by the present auditor, and a balance of $6,617.50 found due them in <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>that account. Although no exception was taken to that finding, and no error in regard to it has been suggested to us in the present audit, we are now of the opinion, upon a reconsideration of the whole matter, that the liability of the estate to the executors does not extend so far as the balance then found. That balance was found on the theory that the executors had paid $5,000 of Mr. Lefevre’s debts, and were hence entitled to interest on that payment. But as a matter of fact they did not really lay out their own money until now that they have been obliged to pay Mr. Witmer and Mrs. Sliertz their legacy. All that they can ask is to be saved from loss, and when they are now repaid the $4,910 already paid by them, with interest from its payment, and have had placed in their hands in addition a sufficient sum to meet, when it becomes due, the balance with which they are surcharged, and such interest as will be due on it, we think they are made whole, so far as the surcharge on account of the $5,000 legacy goes. For this reason we shall fix the liability of the estate on account of this legacy at $6,640.47 and such interest as may accrue after August 21,1897, as here-* tofore fully explained, instead of on the basis found in the former auditor’s report.</p>

For the same reason the costs of the present audit are chargeable also to the estate. These amount to $143.15, and together with the $161.38 and $68.34 heretofore referred to, will be added to the liability found on account of the legacy, thus making an aggregate of $7,029.56, for which the estate is liable to the executors, and for which a mortgage will be hereinafter recommended.</p>

If they had paid it to those legatees in the first instance, they would have had to raise the money for the debts from the estate, and the will specifically designates the farm devised to Mrs. Leaman as the source' from which money to pay debts, etc., was to be raised. The effect of the application of the mortgage money in either way there fore is exactly the same. The executors are not barred by the fact that their account was called, and was supposed to be final. If a new debt of the estate had been brought forward, the executors would have had to meet it, and to reopen the administration of the estate for that purpose. The claim <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>of the legatees was equivalent in its effect, and the executors having paid it are in the same position as if they had done so out of the proceeds of the mortgage, and paid the debts out of their own pockets. They are entitled to be reimbursed.</p>
    <p id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[302,567,1178,601]]]'>The result is unfortunate for Mrs. Leaman, for it apparently reduces the devise to her to an empty shell. But this is a consequence of the testator’s express direction. He either overestimated the value of the farm, or underestimated the amount of his debts. Whichever it was, it is clear that he devised the farm charged with any deficiency of cash for the other purposes of the will, and Mrs. Leaman can only take what is left. Her situation in this respect is no worse than it would have been if the administration had been strictly in accordance with the legal requirements of the will, and the money to pay the debts had been raised by mortgage on her farm in the first instance.</p>
