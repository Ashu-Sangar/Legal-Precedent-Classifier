The plaintiff Stewart constructed the bins, under an arrangement with W. S. Farrell. Plaintiff claimed that Farrell was the agent of the defendant in making the contract with him. Plaintiff offered to prove under objections and exceptions various declara<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>tions of Farrell tending to show his agency. The objection was overruled and the evidence admitted. Plaintiff then produced other independent evidence tending to establish the fact of agency. Plaintiff also offered under objections and exceptions to prove declarations of the officers of the company made after the date of the contract tending to show that they regarded Farrell as the agent of the company. The objections were overruled and the evidence admitted.</p>

The defendant company being dissatisfied with the verdict, entered this appeal. In its paper-book we find twelve assignments in each of which error is charged to the learned judge of the court below. Each of said assignments have been carefully examined and considered by us, and our conclusion from the examination thus made is that no materia] error appears in either of said assignments. We therefore affirm the judgment entered on the verdict above mentioned.</p>
