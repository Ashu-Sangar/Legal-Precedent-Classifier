On March 6, 1896, reasons for a new trial were filed,- and on the same day a rule to show cause was granted. The rule was continued from that time to March 22, 1900, when the rule to show cause was argued, and on May 26, 1900, the rule for new trial was discharged. On January 18,1901, the jury fee was paid and judgment was entered on the verdict. On the same day an appeal was taken to this court.</p>

L. Bush, and the seal after his signature, there can be no recovery in this action.” To this the court replied as follows: “We say to you we are obliged to refuse to answer this point in the affirmative. The plaintiff herself was called by the defendants on the stand, under cross-examination and she testified positively, that the alterations in this note so made were made specially at the request of the deceased, her husband, and that the scroll seal itself was added to it by the deceased. This testimony has been un contradicted, and if believed by you, your verdict should be promptly rendered for the plaintiff in this case for the full amount with interest.” As we have already seen the verdict was renderd as above stated.</p>
