But beyond the effect arising from such exclusion and from the reduction in the amount of the residue under other clauses in the codicil, the legatees who take the residue and their proportionate shares remain as set forth in the will of 1885.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b31-9" data-blocks='[["BL_31.9",31,[186,1562,1183,408]]]'>6. The codicil does not purport to make any person residuary legatees who were not such legatees in the will. in 1885; nor to change the standard of measurement of the shares of the legatees in the residuary estate, except so far as striking'out the names of his sons as legatees would have such an effect. The sums which the codicil provides should be given to, or charged against, certain persons, affects only the amount which would be left to constitute the residuary portion of the estate.</p>

The bequest to the widow in the sixth clause of the codicil, now estimated at a value of 1400, is a legacy within the popular meaning of that term, and makes the widow legateé as to that bequest. This would entitle her to claim such proportionate part of the residuary estate as such legacy represents, if the meaning of the will and codicil taken together, is to divide the residuary part of the estate among all who received legacies under either the will or the codicil. But under the auditor’s view, neither the will nor the codicil entitles any <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>legatees to a claim on the residuary estate, except those who were legatees under the will in 1885, before the codicil was written.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.6",32,[275,578,1179,250]]]'>1. The will does not call the widow a legatee. It gives the residuary estate to the legatees “ hereinbefore mentioned,” but does not name them. Whether she is intended by the testator to be included under that name is a matter of mere inference. And such inference is not necessary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b32-7" data-blocks='[["BL_32.7",32,[273,836,1181,446]]]'>2. The bequest to her in the will of ,1885, is simply to pay the debt or obligation- due her under the marriage settlement, and which she could enforce by will. In fact the ten acres of land devised and bequeathed to her were already her property under the terms of that settlement. The will could convey no better title than she already had. The $2,000 was simply an obligation he was bound to pay, and the testator declares the bequests to have been made in pursuance of the marriage settlement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b32-8" data-blocks='[["BL_32.8",32,[265,1301,1184,975]]]'>3. A legatee is one who receives a legacy. The ordinary popular meaning of a legacy and its usual legal signification, is a gift or gratuity,—not the payment of a debt or a provision to pay a debt. Where the meaning is uncertain it is reasonable to infer that the popular and ordinary meaning is intended, unless there is something to require a different construction. In support of this view we cite the following authorities: 2 Bouvier’s Law Dictionary, 161. Legacy is defined to be a gift of personal property by last will or testament: Byrne v. Byrne, 3 S. &amp; 11. 60. Legacies are considered as gratuities : Zeigler v. Eckert, <a href="/pa/6/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="954587" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0013-01">6 Pa. 13</a>. The law presumes every legacy is intended to be a pure gratuity: Brightly’s Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 383. The law presumes every legacy is intended to be a pure gratuity, citing Byrne v. Byrne: 2 Story’s ■ Equity, Jurisprudence, secs. 1099, 1100. Whatever is given by a will is prima facie to be intended as a bounty or benevolence: Hunter’s Estate, <a href="/pa/6/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="954627" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0097-01">6 Pa. 97</a>. The popular meaning of words is the best criterion of the intention of the testator: Biddle’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=99%20Pa.%20532" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="99 Pa. 532">99 Pa. 532</a>. To same effect and citing, <a href="/pa/6/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="954627" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0097-01">6 Pa. 97</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b32-9" data-blocks='[["BL_32.9",32,[264,2285,1174,147]],["BL_33.1",33,[148,372,1187,819]]]'>4. That which prompts a gift or legacy, and forms its basis, is the view which the testator entertains of the claim which the legatee has upon his bounty. When a father bequeaths legacies <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>to his children and heirs in unequal sums it indicates the proportionate extent to which he regards them entitled to his bounty. And if the residuary estate is left to them to be shared in the same proportion, it seems to be natural and reasonable as arising from the purpose of heart that actuates .the testator in bestowing his property. But if the testator pays a debt or obligation by a provision in his will it cannot reasonably raise any presumption that he regards the creditor or obligee entitled to his bounty beyond the payment of the debt; and it is even more unreasonable to presume that the amount of the debt that is paid is to be regarded as a standard to measure the extent of such bounty. In this view the presumptions are naturally all against the testator making his widow a legatee of his residuary estate, to be measured on the basis of apre-. viously existing obligation due her which the will directed to be paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[149,1200,1182,1179]]]'>5. As stated in Postlethwaite’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>, these surrounding circumstances of the testator, his family, the amount and character of his property, may be and ought to be taken into consideration in giving a construction to the provisions of his will. By considering such matters in this case, the construction claimed for the widow, which would give her the great body of the entire estate, after' she had already been provided for by the marriage settlement, leaving the children and grandchildren only a small fraction of the estate, seems improbable and unreasonable. It also seems almost conclusive that the testator did not think that his widow was so amply provided for when he made the codicil to Ills will. In the sixth clause of the codicil he provides that she be permitted to occupy his dwelling on the farm, and have certain articles of furniture, and have annually 480 pounds of flour, 200 pounds of meat, potatoes, fruit, etc., off the farm to furnish her a comfortable living. Also one cow, her choice, and feed off the farm to keep it. This seems to be a reasonable provision if he supposed that the share previously allowed her out of his estate was simply what she got by the marriage settlement. But it seems hardly possible that the testator would make such provisions for his wife if he supposed he had already given her the greater part of his estate.</p>
