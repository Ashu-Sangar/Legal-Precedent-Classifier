Upon the face of the bill we learn that J. L. Seyfang', one of the defendants, and the plaintiff entered into a copartnership in 1878; that about the year 1880 they employed another of the defendants, A. W. Lewis, as their bookkeeper, and that in June, 1891, said Lewis became a member of the firm which thereafter was known as Bovaird, Seyfang &amp; Company; that they continued business until November, 1891, when David Bovaird, J. L. Seyfang, A. W. Lewis, O. D. Bleakly and J. W. Lee, associated themselves as corporators of a manufacturing corporation, known as the Bovaird &amp; Seyfang Manufacturing Company, with a capital stock of 1500,000 ; that the corporation carried on business until November 30, 1893, when the plaintiff and the other stockholders filed a bill in the court of common pleas of McKean county, at No. 2, December term, 1893, against the Bovaird &amp; Seyfang Manufacturing Company, praying for the appointment of a receiver for said corporation; <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>that on December 1, 1898, James E.

    <p class="summary" id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[141,825,1181,1238]]]'>The bill alleges that the business of Bovaird &amp; Seyfang, and Bovaird, Seyfang &amp; Company, the copartnership, has never been settled, and prays for an accounting in regard to the co-partnership business. The bill also complains that the receivers, Thomas H. Kennedy and James E. Cochran, never filed any account of their receivership, and asks that they be required to account. The bill also alleges that the reorganized corporation known as the Bovaird &amp; Seyfang Manufacturing Company, was reorganized in fraud of plaintiff’s rights and asks for relief from said corporation. Complaint is also made that certain individuals named in the bill, have been guilty of fraudulent practices, without distinctly stating what such fraudulent practices were. The suit seems to be brought by plaintiff as an individual and as a stockholder in the Bovaird &amp; Seyfang Manufacturing Company. The plaintiff claims as an individual to have relief against his copartners, and as an individual to have relief against the manufacturing company, and as a stockholder to have relief against the manufacturing company, and as an individual and stockholder to have relief against the receivers and the company; and in his prayers he asks for a distinct and separate relief against all of the various parties enumerated in his stating clause of the bill.

It cannot be collaterally assailed and overturned for any fraud which the parties to the transaction, on which it is founded may have committed against each other.” In City v.

The fraudulent acts must be specifically set out so that the court can from the face of the bill say that the acts complained of, if true, were fraudulent: Daniell’s Chancery Pleading &amp; Practice, 4th Edition, 324; see Note 8.</p>

This defect might be cured by amendment, and we would not dismiss for that reason alone, until after plaintiff had refused to amend.</p>

    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[280,418,1175,654]]]'>The plaintiff's bill was dismissed, at his cost. The grounds of the dismissal appear in the elaborate and exhaustive opinion of Judge Morrison on which an affirmance of the decree dismissing the bill may safely rest. It is not necessary to specify herein, in detail, the grounds of the dismissal, as they clearly and plainly appear in the opinion referred to. The plaintiff, on his appeal to this court, filed a “statement of errors to the decree of the court below in dismissing his bill.” The errors alleged were twelve in number each of which appears to have been founded on the opinion of the learned court below. A careful consideration of the alleged errors resulted in the conclusion that there was nothing in either of them which warranted a reinstatement of the dismissed bill.</p>
