The breaker building is located close to the railroad, its most easterly foundation being but eight feet and the structure itself about twelve or fifteen feet from the westerly rail of the south-bound track, and a switch, <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>extends from that track under the structure of the breaker on which coal cars are run below the coal pockets to be there filled with prepared coal for transshipment to market.</p>

The bridge crosses the tracks about twenty-five feet below or to the southwest of the breaker; it is constructed of wood and supported on wooden beams or bents resting on stone foundations and has a span across the tracks of the railroad of about forty-six feet; it is twenty-five feet wide and carries two narrow gauge mine tracks, one to convey the culm from the breaker to the dump and the other to return the empty cars to the breaker again; the loaded cars are shifted by means of a small mine locomotive engine and the empty cars returned to the breaker by gravity.</p>

Four years later, or about 1859, a bridge, similar in character and construction to the one now extending over the railroad and at about the same location with it, was built across from the breaker to the easterly half of the surface of the track which was specially set aside as a dumping ground for culm and refuse from the mines.</p>

About this time the second track of the railroad company was laid and the bridge or trestle was correspondingly lengthened. Three years later, in 1874, the coal company built á new and larger breaker on the site of the old one, the plans being made by John F. Snyder, chief mining engineer of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company. This breaker, to meet certain internal arrangements, was extended entirely over the two railroad tracks -then existing, its extreme easterly foundation being on the east of them, and engines and-trains on these two main tracks running under the building for a distance of about one hundred feet as through a tunnel. At the same time the culm trestle was taken down and a new one built diagonally across the railroad somewhat higher above it than before, with two tracks upon it instead of one as on the old one.</p>

      <em>(o') </em>In 1877 the Mount Pleasant Coal Company was sold out and the lease of the coal forfeited to the lessors, who the same year executed to William T. Smith a new lease to run until April 1, 1893, and this lease in December, 1884, was still further extended and made perpetual until all the coal in and upon the tract should be exhausted. Later, about 1890, a perpendicular shaft was sunk to the coal and the slope abandoned, a change which required a remodeling of the breaker,; the part overhanging and bridging the railroad tracks was accordingly taken down and the building confined to the westerly side of the railroad the same as it now stands; the bridge or culm trestle was also overhauled, and the one which is now in use constructed. In the mean time, in the fall of 1882, the <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>third, took was laid by the railroad company.

These were the existing conditions when the present Mount Pleasant Coal Company, on November 28, 1898, became the owner of the property in question, since which time it has continued to carry out the contract with the railroad company for the sale and delivery of the coal which it has mined. Dissatisfied, however, with the way in which the contract was being carried out on the part of the railroad company, on July 12, 1899, the said Mount Pleasant Coal Company made a new contract with the New York, Ontario and Western Railroad Company, also a coal carrying road, for the transportation by it to tide water of all the coal to be mined from the said land. The railroad of the said New York, Ontario and Western Railroad Company also traverses the Swetland tract, but at its extreme easterly end and at a much lower level along the bank of the Lackawanna river. In order to connect the Mount Pleasant breaker with it, it is proposed to build a switch about 8,000 feet long, starting at a point a little above the breaker and on the opposite side of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western‘Railroad from it and circling around the culm dump and running down at a grade of about three and one half feet to the hundred, to unite with it at a point on its main line near the river. It is further proposed, as part of the same plan, to build coal pockets at the upper end of this switch just opposite the breaker under which the cars of the said railroad company will be run and from which they will be loaded with coal; and as -a neces<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>sary adjunct to this the coal must in some way be conveyed from the breaker on one side to the pockets on the other across the tracks of the defendant railroad.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[334,512,997,45]]]'>9. To effect this the following plan has been devised:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[288,562,1179,706]]]'>(«) It is proposed to build an overhead Howe truss wooden bridge or structure stretching across the tracks at the height of at least twenty-seven feet and extending in width the whole front of the breaker some ninety-six feet up and down the railroad. It was at first intended to support this bridge on the side of the breaker by a bent of timbers resting on the present easterly stone foundation of the breaker building eight feet from the most westerly rail of the railroad, and on the other side by a similar bent resting on a foundation to be built fifty-five feet from the other, but as these abutments would fall within the right of way claimed by the railroad under the Swetland deed, the offer was made at the trial to lengthen the span to such distance as the court might direct in order that this should be avoided.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.7",464,[288,1287,1181,815]]]'>(fi) On this bridge is to be constructed a system of eleven belt conveyors of the best quality of rubber belting—nine of them twelve inches wide, one eighteen inches, and one twenty-four inches—running over moving pulleys by which they are to be kept in place, and put in motion; these belts will move at the rate of 200 feet a minute and the coal from the breaker falling loosely upon them and being kept in place by the sagging of the belts, will be conveyed across and dumped off without more into the pockets on the other side; each belt will run in a separate compartment which will be sided and boarded over and in, and the bottom of the bridge will be tightly closed with tongued and grooved boards, and then sheathed with sheet iron or copper to prevent danger of fire from sparks thrown out by passing locomotives. The same precaution by sheathing will be taken as to the rest of the structure if deemed necessary by the court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-7" data-blocks='[["BL_464.8",464,[289,2110,1177,305]]]'>(ft) The proposed bridge is not to be connected in any way with the present culm trestle, which at its nearest point is fifteen feet away from where the other is to be set up, and upon the erection of the new structure, the culm trestle will be torn down and abandoned, the culm being conveyed over by a belt in one of the compartments the same as the prepared coal.</p>

The only menace to the railroad would be from a fire starting in the breaker and communicating to the bridge, and the debris falling down upon the tracks and blocking them, but the destruction of the breaker by fire as it now stands but twelve or fifteen feet from the nearest rail would result in practically the same thing, and the extension of the bridge would not materially increase this danger. As to the sparks from passing engines the structure, i-f properly covered or sheathed, with iron or copper, would be sufficiently protected.</p>

The capacity of the mines and breaker of the plaintiff company is 120 tons an hour, or 1,200 tons a day, amounting to 300,000 or 350,000 tons a year. Although the mines have been operated steadily for over forty years there are still about 3,000,000 tons of merchantable coal on the property, the great bulk of which is on the westerly side of the railroad. It is also estimated that there are some 700,000 tons of the smallest sizes in the culm or refuse dump, which in the present and prospective condition of the trade can be screened and marketed. The best veins, however, have been worked out and the coal which remains requires to be mined according to the most approved and economical methods in order to be profitable. The proposed overhead structure with its system of belt conveyers is in line with this and is necessary for the full and profitable working and enjoyment of the tract as a coal property. Without it the company is practically confined in the sale and trans<a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>portation of its coal to such arrangements as it may be able to make with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad only.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.5",466,[257,523,1187,1849]]]'>11. In June, 1899, prior to making the contract with the New York, Ontario and Western Railroad, E. L. Fuller, president of the plaintiff company, met W. H. Truesdale, president of the defendant company, and stated that his company desired to build an overhead bridge across the tracks of the railroad such as has been described, and asked permission to construct on the railroad right of way, in such a manner, however, as would not interfere with its traffic, the necessary preliminary false work in order to do so. He explained by a sketch the proposed system of conveyors and the characters of the construction, just where it was to be put up, its dimensions, purposes, etc., and offered to construct it if so desired under the supervision and in accordance with the views of the railroad company’s engineers. It was conceded at the time that this was for the purpose of shipping the coal produced at the breaker by the New York and Ontario railroad. Mr. Truesdale declined to allow the construction, either of the false work or the proposed bridge, and announced that the company intended to hold the coal and not let it go to another road. He asked if the Mount Pleasant people were not satisfied with their treatment; to which Mr. Fuller replied that they were not, and that on the contrary they were very much dissatisfied; that the railroad company had not lived up to the terms of its contract and had discriminated in favor of other operators, refusing to furnish cars to the Mount Pleasant Company for anything like the tonnage agreed to be taken under the contract, for which statement he gave facts and figures, apparently convincing Mr. Truesdale of its truth. Several interviews of similar character were had afterwards, but without favorable result. Both parties consulted legal counsel and the railroad company being advised that the crossing could not be made without its consent declined to allow the construction and the present bill was filed. Mr. Trues-dale subsequently notified the Mount Pleasant Coal Company by letter to take down the existing culm trestle or bridge and remove the breaker from off the limits of the right of way, giving them until January 1, 1900, to do so.</p>

This lease expired on April 1, 1873, but with an option to renew the contract for a new term. Therefore, in view of the expiration of the lease on April 1, 1873, Swetiand having died, his executor, on July 19, 1871, reciting that the interests of Lewis &amp; Howell had become vested in the executor and the Mount Pleasant Coal Company, a new lease of the coal was made to the company for a term of ten years. Successive term leases were made until the last one, under which the plaintiff is now operating; it is for all the coal in the tract, or until the coal is exhausted. The possible value of plaintiff’s grant is, that although the tract has been mined for forty years, there still remains 3,500,000 tons yet to be mined, under its lease, besides 750,000 tons of coal yet in the culm banks.</p>

This railroad also runs through the same tract of land. To facilitate, or make possible, the delivery of coal to the latter company, the plaintiff proposes to build a Howe truss bridge over defendant’s railroad, about fifteen feet distant from the present trestle over the same track which has been there since the mining of coal commenced.

In our opinion, the issue turns on an interpretation of Swetland’s deed .of January 23, 1854, to the defendant company. The rights of both parties hinge on that deed; whatever they might have been at law, if defendant were there, by right of eminent domain, it would be fruitless to discuss, for it cannot be questioned, defendant entered under a contract with Swetland, the owner of the land, with no appropriation then or since of any portion by right of eminent domain. When the entry was made in 1854, the land was farm and coal land. Although no mining had yet been done, because of lack of transportation facilities, its quality and great value as coal land were well known to both parties. Defendant desired to cross it. This brought the two parties together, the owner of the coal land and the railroad company, and they made a contract, the material part of which we have quoted. Swetland says he hereby grants to the railroad company, “ the following lot or piece of land for <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>the purposes of the railroad of said company.” This company was, under its charter, a miner and owner of coal land, as well as a shipper and carrier of coal. The grant is to the company in its business as a carrier and for no other purpose authorized by its charter. It then goes on to say: “ Being a strip of land about fifty perches in length, occupied by the grade, track and survey of the railroad of said company, and six perches in width, said survey being in the center of said strip of land, with such additional width as the necessary slopes of excavation and embankment may, in the case of a double track, require. This strip of land being only intended to be employed for right of way for the railroad of said company.”</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[271,979,1184,1437]],["BL_473.1",473,[138,342,1181,240]]]'>It is obvious, neither the length nor the width of the strip had been measured; both were estimated, as appears from the use of the word “ about;” the right granted was, however, in the center, which was then occupied by one track, with such additional land, without regard to width, as might thereafter be necessary for two tracks; it was not for the general purposes of a railroad company, such as a shifting or distributing yard, as seems to be intimated by defendant, but is expressly restricted to a “ right of way ” purpose in the center of the strip; by the words used, the manifest intention of both parties being a right over the land for two tracks, whereon the company could lay its rails and run its cars. It was intended by this deed to convey a strip of land through the tract, supposed to be about fifty perches across, but if more than this, nevertheless, the right to cross was certain; the rails were to be laid in the center of the strip; for two tracks, the company was not restricted to the grade track and survey, but might widen out, as the necessities of slopes, excavations and embankments might require. Mills on Eminent Domain, section 110, says : “All contracts made by the condemning party with owner, whereby privileges are wholly or in part obtained, without condemnation, are favorably regarded by the courts and are construed strongly in favor of the owner.” So to the same effect is Lewis on Eminent Domain, sections 289, 290, 298. This is the rule of interpretation of such contracts with the owner. And this interpretation of the deed was put upon it by the defendant immediately after its delivery, by most significant acts. It was bound to erect fences; it constructed one on the <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>eastern boundary of the right of way, exactly on the line of what would be sufficient for a double track, and just where plaintiff claims the boundary is indicated by the description in the deed; part of the fence is still standing, as testified by witnesses.</p>
    <p id="b473-3" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[137,601,1182,1495]]]'>Further, Swetland laid out part of the surface in lots, one of which, containing an acre, he conveyed by deed, in 1863, to one Finch; the' boundary on one side is the railroad; before he got his deed, about 1855, he entered upon the land and erected a foundation for a machine shop, which is still standing and is in a direct line with the fence. Again, a bridge was erected over the rails, called the Swetland street bridge, the eastern abutment of which is on a line with the fence ; the same with the. eastern abutment of the culm bridge, which is on the samé line,- Further, the original slope to mine the coal, sunk as early as 1855, was within fifteen feet of the railroad track, on the west side, the track remaining as it was then. The shaft for mining coal, the breakers for preparing it for market, and many other facts, all occurring during defendant’s occupation of the land, show, that both the grantor and grantee, put the same construction on the deed as that now claimed by plaintiff. The facts stated are not of a doubtful character; they are clearly established; there is but one inference from them, and that, that defendant for forty-five years misinterpreted its deed, or is now, under the stress of litigation, giving its grant a wider seope.than its language and the surroundings at the date óf it warrant. If this deed were obscure, or ambiguous, the conduct of the parties to it for nearly half a century would be conclusive as to their intention. We can scarcely call the language ambiguous; the only uncertainty that can be alleged, arises from the' neglect to make exact measurements ; but, then they restrict.the grant by the most exact words indicative of the purpose,—“ It is only to be employed for right of way for the railroad of said company.”</p>
    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[138,2105,1182,305]],["BL_474.1",474,[281,354,1178,1180]]]'>. The learned judge of the court below gives no weight to these-facts,as showing the assertion of a right on part of plaintiff and acquiescence therein by defendant, but is of opinion, that on account of the friendly relations subsisting between them, the intrusions, or trespasses were submitted to. .We cannot so regard-.them., .They..were distinct assertions of a right, hostile <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>to the claim now made, and utterly at variance with any other than a mere right of possession in defendant for the purpose of a roadbed; in substance, its acts were repeated admissions by defendant of plaintiff’s claim to the land, except for two tracks. Our observation is, that if there be any right of which railroad companies are jealous, it is of their right of way; it is rarely that they suffer such trespasses, if they be, in fact, trespasses, as is claimed to be shown by this evidence. We have repeatedly said, that what the parties mutually did and assented to under a contract, was an almost certain indication of its true meaning; not what they said as to its meaning after performance on each side, but what they did without objection while in the course of performance. In Republic Iron Works v. Burgwin, <a href="/pa/139/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="139 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="11251913" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0439-01">139 Pa. 439</a>, a case involving the construction of an agreement between heirs with reference to a tract of coal land, the present Chief Justice McCollum says: “For nearly fifty years the parties and their successors in title have occupied and used the property in conformity with this construction of the decree. It is a construction which gives effect to the obvious intention of the parties, and is consistent with the terms of the grant when read in the light of the circumstances and conditions affecting the subject of it.” Every word of which can be aptly applied to this contract and the conduct of the parties under it.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[281,1541,1179,870]],["BL_475.1",475,[114,346,1196,2070]],["BL_476.1",476,[293,346,1177,665]]]'>As before adverted to, the defendant’s right of way rests on a contract with the owner of the surface and coal; that the operator shall be able to work profitably the mines and ship over another railroad, an overhead bridge is necessary to supersede the present coal trestle, which latter is to be taken down and, in the language of the learned judge of the court below, “ By this change the danger will be actually decreased instead of increased.” Then as another fact he finds: “ Such bridge will not interfere with the operation of defendant’s railroad across the William Swetland tract, upon their right.of way, as they have occupied it from the time the first track was built down to the present time.” If the proposed structure does not intrude on their right of way, if it is not dangerous and in no way interferes with the operation of defendant’s railroad, why should they be forcibly prevented from erecting such bridge ? The court says : “ I consider the proposed overhead structure as reasonably necessary to the full and complete enjoyment of this <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>property, under the lease which the plaintiff holds.” But he then decides that, “ Regardless of the manner in which the right of way was acquired, or the width to which the defendant company may be now entitled, the plaintiff company, without the consent of the railroad company, cannot cross it with an overhead structure such as is proposed,” and this because of the prohibition of the Act of April 16, Í838, P. L. 464. We are clearly of the opinion, that the learned judge of the court below, misinterpreted this act, or rather misapplied it to the facts of this case. By the 11th section of this act it is provided that no person shall construct, among other things, any crossing place on the ground set apart for, or belonging to that forming • part of the banks or excavation of any railroad, without permission in writing from the railroad company; and further, that if any person should commence, or make any such construction, without such consent, he should forfeit or pay not exceeding $100, and that the railroad company might, at his expense, remove and destroy such structure. Obviously, this act was aimed at the wilful trespasser and was intended to guard the right of way from unauthorized intrusion. It is penal in its nature and invests the railroad company with the right not only to prosecute to punishment a wrong, but also with despotic powers to the extent of destruction of valuable property. But it never was intended to define the rights and powers vested in a railroad company, under a deed from its grantor; rights under a contract, of which neither we nor the legislature could deprive either party. Here is a most valuable tract of coal land, containing several million tons of marketable coal, cut in two by a railroad. For the complete enjoyment of this property, it is necessary, that the owner shall cross the right of way by an overhead bridge or structure. The railroad company had no right there at all, unless such right was granted by the sovereign, the commonwealth, or by the owner ; it chose to accept a' right by contract with the owner who, for railroad purposes, gave to it a narrow strip, for the consideration of $20.00. The extent of this grant is carefully limited to but the one purpose; it reserves all the coal, both outside and beneath the tracks; it is a plain assertion of intent by the owner to enjoy to the full his property as a coal property. The railroad company is as fully a party to that contract as the owner; the right <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>of either or both to contract could not be abridged by the legislature in the absence of any public policy demanding restriction or prohibition. No public policy in this case called for the interference of the legislature; therefore, the act of 1838 has no application; it was intended to -reach an entirely different sort of a case. We cannot, without disregarding the most familiar principles of equity, sustain defendant’s claim. It has under its charter an irrepealable authority to own, mine, sell and buy coal and coal lands; in addition, it has all the rights of a common carrier railroad; it ought not to be permitted to stretch its legal authority in the latter capacity, to prevent a rival coal operator from the full enjoyment of his property, and a competing railroad from facilities for shipping.</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[292,1019,1183,408]]]'>The whole argument of appellee’s able counsel, and the authorities cited to sustain it, is, in substance, based on the appropriation of land by a railroad company under a right of eminent domain. While we do not discuss this theory, neither will we. here undertake to deny it. What would have been our opinion had defendant appeared before us, claiming to hold under such an appropriation, is not intimated now. We only concede, there is a wide distinction in the extent of the rights.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[291,1435,1185,663]]]'>It is further argued by appellee’s counsel, that although the court below expressly based its decision on a construction of the penal act of 1838, yet, on other grounds, not expressly stated, its decree should be sustained. But on our interpretation of the deed, the conduct of the parties for forty years under it, and the findings of fact by the court below, compel-the defendants to rest their right of entry on the deed; if that right be not enlarged, or rather, the plaintiff’s, circumscribed by the act of 1838, defendant has no authority to prevent the erection of the proposed structure. It can stand on no other ground than the deed, and yet by implication claim that its footing is made secure by the act of 1838. This ground as we have shown, is utterly insecure and crumbles when tested.</p>
