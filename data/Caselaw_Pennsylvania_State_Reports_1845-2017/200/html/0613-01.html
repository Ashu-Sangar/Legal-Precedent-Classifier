Thereafter the water company erected a waterworks and laid its pipes in the streets of the borough. In August, 1893, the borough erected a waterworks of its own. See Howard’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/162/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="162 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="856832" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0374-01">162 Pa. 374</a>, and Fingal v.

The evidence showed that from the time the borough began to furnish water in 1894, until December 22,1899, the date of the bringing of the suit, the borough collected $33,367.91 in water rents.</p>

According to the testimony, the receipts of the borough from the water furnished customers by it during that time was $33,467.91.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b638-4" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[287,620,1182,1025]]]'>“ Now, I do not say to you as a matter of law that the water company is entitled to recover that amount of damages. It is for you, gentlemen, to say, as jurors in this case, whether or not that is the amount it is entitled to recover. As I said before, it is entitled to recover, if you find in its favor, such amount as will make it whole; such amount as will place it in the condition it would have been financially on December 22, 1899, if the borough had not started its plant. The receipts of the borough. were $33,467.91. That is not conclusive evidence that the Bennett Water .Company suffered to that extent by reason of the construction of the borough works. It is some evidence to that effect, but it is not conclusive evidence. Some of the consumers of the borough might not have taken from the Bennett Water Company. You must consider all the evidence and consider whether or not all these people would have taken a supply of water from the Bennett Water Company. If they would all have taken water from the Bennett Water Company instead of from the borough, the Bennett Water Company’s gross receipts would have been $33,467.91 more than they were during these years.] [17]</p>

While these receipts are not conclusive, as I said, and do not establish.absolutely that that was the amount of the plaintiff’s damage, they will afford you, gentlemen, a basis upon which to found your calculations.] [18]</p>

Under the contract with ■ the company, whenever fire hydrants became necessary for the protection of the property of the inhabitants of the borough, the Bennett Water Com<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>pany had a right to supply those additional hydrants. The borough had no right to take the right away from the Bennett Water Company. The municipality agreed in its ordinance authorizing the Bennett Water Company to come into the borough, to pay them for such fire hydrants as might afterwards become necessary. It appears that there were forty-one put in by the borough and supplied by the borough works sometime between 1895 and December 22,1899; whether they were all put in at once, or put in at intervals does not appear by the testimony. If these forty-one hydrants were reasonably necessary for the protection of the property of the borough, or the property of the inhabitants of the borough at that time, then the Bennett Water Company would be entitled to recover rental for those hydrants from the time they were put in, and you will have to determine whether or not they were necessary and allow for such as were necessary at $80.00 per annum from the time they were put in until December 22, 1899. If the whole forty-one were reasonably necessary, then the Bennett Water Company would be entitled to recover for those forty-one. If thirty were reasonably necessary, it would be entitled to recover for thirty only, and in determining that question you will take into consideration the fact that they were ordered by the proper municipal authorities; and, also, consider the natural increase of population in the borough. The population of the borough in 1890 was 3,809, and in 1900 it was 6,736, showing an increase in ten years of 2,927 people, or an average annual increase of about 293 persons. You will take these matters into consideration, and also apply your own judgment in regard to those matters in considering the testimony in determining the extent of the damage suffered by the company.]- [19]</p>

What was said by our late Brother Green as to the conduct of Millvale Borough, <a href="/pa/162/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="162 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="856832" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0374-01">162 Pa. 374</a>, can well be repeated now: “We can scarcely doubt that the proceedings by the burgess and councils, having in view the erection of new works, were animated and conducted with an unseemly desire to injure the Bennett Water Company, to de<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>stroy the value of its franchises, to disregard the terms of the solemn contract made by the borough with that company and with an entire willingness to evade the teachings of ordinary morality, business integrity and common honesty.

    <p id="b641-3" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[115,732,1181,1597]]]'>The Bennett Water Company was not a party to the proceedings in Fingal et al. v.

With no final decree in that case, which is still pending, and to which the appellee is not even a party, the borough of Millvale cannot turn to it as conclusive of its right to commit the wrongs complained of by the water company, and it can hardly say with candor that it expended any money or did anything in consequence of what may have been said in Howard’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/162/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="162 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="856832" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0374-01">162 Pa. 374</a>, argued with the preceding case; for its works were erected in 1893, and these cases were not argued until March 9, 1894, and decided only on July 11 of the same year.

City of Meadville, <a href="/pa/177/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="177 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="883741" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0643-01">177 Pa. 643</a>, should not apply to the case before us. No complaint was ever made that the water company had failed to supply pure and sufficient water to those entitled to it. If there had been any dereliction by the company in the discharge of this duty, there was a statutory mode to enforce it. No other course was open to the borough of Millvale, even for failure to properly supply it and its citizens with water, and with no complaint that the water company did not so supply them, the erection of waterworks by the borough, resulting in the ruin of the water company, was a trespass, both wilful and intentional, and' the measure of damages as laid down by the court was entirely proper. The mitigation claimed by the appellant was not of right in view of its wilful wrong to the appellee. Upon the question of damages, as well as upon the others raised, the case was intelligently and correctly submitted to the jury by the learned trial judge in his charge and answers to appellant’s points, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
