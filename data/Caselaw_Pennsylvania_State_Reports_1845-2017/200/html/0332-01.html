A case stated was framed between the next of kin of the testator and the church to determine the validity of the trust for the education of a young man for the ministry. <em>Held, </em>that during the lifetime of the annuitants, the trust was valid, and that after their deaths it could be determined whether the disproportion between the amount of the fund and the sum applied to charitable uses would render the bequest void under the law against accumulations.</p>

Were it not for the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 173, and the first proviso of the Act of April 18,1853, P.

Nor can the first objection be sustained. This is that the section is void by reason of uncertainty. The fund is given to the Mercantile Trust and Deposit Company, of Baltimore, who are required to pay $300 per annum “ to the proper authorities of St. Mark’s Lutheran Church, of Hanover, Pa., to be used in assisting to defray the expense of any young men of the church,” who are to be selected according to the opinion of the pastor and church council. The trustee is thus dis<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>tinctly designated. St. Mark’s Lutheran Church, according to the case stated, is an incorporated organization and consequently managed by “proper authorities,” to whom the fund is to be paid. And the pastor and church council are to determine according to their judgment and direction, who shall be the recipients of the testator’s bounty. It cannot be assumed that they will not do so, but if they should, those interested would not be without remedy. At all events it cannot be said that such a question arises now.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[302,824,1193,146]]]'>The fifth objection, namely: “ That it was not the testator’s • intention to create or establish a perpetual trust or a trust for accumulation,” raises a very serious question.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[300,978,1177,450]]]'>[The trust fund is sixty bonds of $1,000 each. No rate of interest is given in the case stated, but if'they were five per cent bonds the annual interest would be $3,000. It requires $2,600 to satisfy the annuities and two charities. In the course of years $2,000 of the $2,600 will fall into the principal fund and it may be expected to accumulate in the beginning from $1,500 to $2,500 annually, depending upon the lowering of the rate of interest on money and with an increasing ratio thereafter.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-7" data-blocks='[["BL_360.7",360,[295,1446,1177,873]]]'>The testator evidently had this in mind when he drew his will, and hence the fifteen blank lines following the tenth section in which he probably contemplated inserting a provision for the final disposition of the corpus of the fund. But he did not do so then and the will so remained for over two years, until the day before his death when he added a codicil, without, however, changing this provision. In view of this I cannot say that he did not intend to create this trust for accumulation, and were it not for the acts to which I have referred, this intention would be defeated by the statute. At all events it is valid during the continuance of the annuities, and when they shall have expired the question can then be determined, whether by the creation of so large a trust for accumulation and attaching thereto charities so disproportionate to the income it can be saved from the operation of the law against accumulations. If it can, then the policy of the law against accumulations and the statute can readily be avoided, and the latter will become a dead letter.] [1]</p>
