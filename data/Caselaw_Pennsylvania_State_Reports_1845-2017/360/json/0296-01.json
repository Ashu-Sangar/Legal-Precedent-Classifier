        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from a decree dismissing a bill in equity. President Judge Matthews \u00a1in his opinion correctly said that the question is: \u201cWhether the owner of real estate encumbered by a first mortgage and by judgment liens, who has entered into a contract with a third person to purchase and foreclose the \u00a1mortgage in order to divest the judgment liens without paying them, \u2022 to purchase the real \u00a1estate at sheriff\u2019s sale,: to manage and sell the same to divide\u2019 the \u00a1profits, may, through the intervention of a court of'equity, regain the property or recover a share, of the profits. The Answer is'obvious that he may not do so. That such an agreement is fraudulent as to creditors, both under the common law and the provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, 39 PS 351, admits of no serious dispute. In March or April of 1932 the defendant Baroni, a real estate agent, advised the plaintiff that he could sell lot No.' 4 for $1,300.00 fin'd th\u00e9refifter the agent accepted $300.00 on account of the purchase price. An examination'of the record discloses the judgments, as. recited. at our third finding in addition to the -mortgage of $2,000.00 and certain liens of the city of Uniontown. The plaintiff, on- being advised of the state of the reeord, admitted' that he was finable to pay'the 'judgments. Thereafter, he had some, negotiations with the mortgagees concerning a release of lot No., 4 from ,the.lien;of the mortgage, but. he. was unable'to-procure such release. The mortgagees, \u25a0 however, agreed ; to: accept' $1,000.00 principal find $100.00 interest in\u2019 ffill\u201d payment of the balance due. This was the state of things firhen.'.Baroni went to Lock Haven on May 29<, 1932, at. which time and place the agreement was executed and delivered. It is practically conceded that the agreement was intended as a \u00a1method whereby\u201d the title of\u2019 Smart \u2019 could b\u00e9 conveyed without payment of his judgment creditors! In reality, such is the fair construction of the agreement itself and it is apparent in subsequent proceedings,-. Therefore, our eighth finding of-fact to .the effect-that the-agreement was made for the purpose of defrauding plaintiff\u2019s creditors is abundantly ,and: completely; established,by, the record, None of* the other -findings is :in dispute;- \u25a0 AIL-of them are simply recitals of. conveyances .and assignments duly recorded and of court proceedings, except, however, the finding as to the execution and delivery of the agreement itself.\u201d\nThe findings made by the court below are all supported by the evidence and therefore they cannot be disturbed. The decree entered was on these findings a proper one. The decree is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.",
