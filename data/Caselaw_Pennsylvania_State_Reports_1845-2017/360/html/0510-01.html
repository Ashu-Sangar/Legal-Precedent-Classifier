When therefore the owner, exercising his right to redeem, filed his petition it was the duty of the court to determine from the evidence whether the title was still in the political subdivisions to whom the taxes were owing. The title in question in this suit is the title to the four lots specified as acquired by respondents at the sheriff’s sale on November 3, 1941. It is clear from what has been said earlier in this opinion that when the owner on November 1, 1941, made the tax payment described these lots should have been withdrawn from the proposed sheriff’s sale. The respondent political subdivisions, having received all the taxes then payable should not have permitted the lots to be sold on that execution. Having taken title to the four lots in such circumstances, they had no right to sell them to Charles Tuckfeld or any one else. As their agreement of sale to Tuckfeld has not been consummated by the transfer of such title as they had the court rightly held that the owner’s petition to redeem was in time. We must reject the contention of appellants that by their agreement of sale to Tuckfeld he acquired an equitable title to plaintiff’s four lots which disqualified plaintiff from exercising his right of redemption. The right to redeem existed as long as the title to land sold for taxes was in the political subdivisions where it is agreed the title still is. Appellants’ brief expressly admits that “as Arlington’s grantee of the four lots involved, appellee thus comes within the class of persons ‘entitled under existing law’ to redeem them under the Act of 1941, P. L. 535, for they were real property sold under a tax claim, and appellants concede the right of a grantee of ‘any part’ of the land so sold to redeem the granted part. . . .”</blockquote>

The Act of July 28, 1941, P. L. 535, section 2, 72 PS 6105.2, provides for the payment of “all costs incident to the aforesaid tax sale.” The joint answer of the respondents does not state what the costs amounted to in the sale of the block of 355 lots, nor does their brief enlighten us. The court below disposed of the point in these words: “The share of the Sheriff’s costs for which petitioner would be liable is negligible and we will not assess any Sheriff’s costs against the four lots of petitioner.” Nothing has been called to our attention that would require a reversal of that view.</p>
