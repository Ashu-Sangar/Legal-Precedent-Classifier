The petition was presented to the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County by J. S. Miller and eight other remaindermen beneficiaries under paragraph Fifth (d) of the Will of Francis R. Dravo, deceased, late of Edgeworth, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, who died on February 26, 1934. Francis R. Dravo executed his will on February 20, 1933, which was duly probated. The decedent gave the residue of his estate to his wife, his brother, and the Fidelity Trust Company, in trust, to pay- the. net income of the trust estate to his wife, Fanny Martin Dravo and, upon her death, he directed that the trust, estate should be . divided ,by the Trustees into three equal parts, designated as Parts “A”, “B”, and “C”,: and he-directed that the net income from Part “C” should be paid to Ralph M. Dravo, brother of the testator; and to. Jane M. Dravo,- the latter’s wife, or either of them, for life, and, at. the death of the survivor, to certain named employes of Dravo Corporation in certain proportions, with certain provisions for forfeiture, hereinafter stated.</p>

A copy of the resolution for the establishment of that plan, proposed to be adopted by said Board of Directors, is attached to the petition. All of the petitioners will be subject to the provisions of that plan if it is adopted, except A. Davia. The petition further sets forth the following: “Your petitioners are of the opinion that if the retirement plan is adopted and any of them are retired thereunder and his or their employment with Dravo Corporation is terminated thereby, his or their proportionate interests of Part ‘C’ of the estate of Francis R. Dravo, deceased, will not be forfeited, being of the opinion that (1) a termination of employment by reason of physical or mental disability prevents forfeiture; and (2) a termination of employment under a compulsory retirement plan is within the meaning and scope of the physical or mental disability clause.”</p>

Your petitioners further believe that, if the testator had intended that death should be the only happening upon which termination of employment would not effect a forfeiture, the insertion of the clause ‘or by reason of physical or mental disability’ would be superfluous, since the words ‘or any other cause’ in the preceding line would include termination of service on account of physical or mental disability.”</p>

Nothing but death, and possibly physical or mental disability, could terminate the services and preserve the legacy. How can we safely <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>say that retirement at 65 or 70 years of age to be brought about by resolutions of the corporate managers, long after the testator’s death, is not an evasion of the testamentary direction? Evidently the testator intended that life service, unless actually physically or mentally disqualified, was to be the inducement to obtain the legacies for the beneficiaries or their heirs. It is a quite unreasonable interpretation that demands the arbitrary addition of the words ‘or termination of services by retirement’ after the phrase ‘excepting death’, so as to bring about a condition contrary to the expressed intention of the testator. If the testator had said ‘or any other cause, excepting death <em>or </em>retirementthen we would know that the testator had in mind the possibility of retirement by his faithful servants, but he did not so state it and we cannot add anything to his will.” . ■</p>

In other words, though the plan is not yet adopted and therefore has no legal existence and though the petitioners have not retired from their employment with the Dravo Corporation, we are asked to declare judicially what petitioners’ rights will be <em>in the contingency </em>that the “proposed plan” <em>is </em>adopted and they are retired under it.
