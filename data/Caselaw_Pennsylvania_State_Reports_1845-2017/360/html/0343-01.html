Michael Billow died in August, 1945, and Andrew Billow, Sr., as surviving partner, became the liquidator of the partnership. Andrew Billow, Jr., son of the liquidator, brought suit against “Andrew Billow, Sr., Liquidator of Andrew Billow, Sr. and Michael Billow, late trading as Billow and Billow”, alleging that he had been orally employed by the partnership on or about September 1, 1940, at which time he was 16 years of age, to' work in the mine and the park; that he was to be paid $35 a week for regular work in the mine and $15 a week additional for extra work in the mine and for managing the park, but was not to receive his pay until all other debts of the partnership had been satisfied or there were funds available for that purpose; that he worked in the mine until January 1, 1945 and in the park until August 1, 1945, and thereby became entitled, on the basis of the rate agreed upon, to the sum of $11,620; and that this amount was now payable because the other debts of the partnership had been paid or there were funds sufficient to liquidate them.</p>

Plaintiffs mother testified to the same effect, while several other witnesses explained in more or less detail the work which plaintiff performed in the mine and the amusement park between the years 1940 and 1945.

It was to their mutual interest to prevent, if possible, the fastening of liability upon the partnership; if there was any contract of employment at all it was on behalf of the partnership and if the partnership was not liable Andrew Billow, Sr. would not have been liable; therefore he could not have been trying to protect himself individually at the decedent’s expense. Moreover, the adverse interest upon which disqualification depends must be in the immediate result of the particular suit and not in its effect on other possible actions or circumstances; remote considerations, such as a possible right of indemnity or contribution under which a witness might have an adverse interest, are not to be considered if his interest is not adverse so far as the suit is concerned in which his testimony is given: <em>Dillon’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/269/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="269 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1063490" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0234-01">269 Pa. 234</a>, 240, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20A.%20919" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="111 A. 919">111 A. 919</a>, 921; <em>Security Trust Company of Pottstown v.
