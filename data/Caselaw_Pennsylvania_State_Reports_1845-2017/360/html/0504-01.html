Dickson, one of the co-trustees, on June 15,1945, and the death of Mary L. Edwards, one of testatrix’s daughters, on November 24, 1945, Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company (now Peoples First National Bank and Trust Company), executor and trustee under Dickson’s will, claimed one-tenth of the balance shown by the account, contending that the gift in remainder vested in the grandchildren, as a class, including Eliza T. Dickson, the deceased grandchild; that upon her death, Burd B. E. Dickson and Charles E. Dickson, her parents and heirs at law, became the owners of her one-fifth remainder interest; and that upon the death of his wife Charles E. Dickson became the sole owner as surviving tenant by the entirety. This was contested by the four surviving grandchildren, George E. Dickson, T. Bruce Dickson, Burd D. Stevenson and Mary Dickson Varker, who contended that the remainders are contingent upon the remaindermen being in existence either two years after testatrix’s death, or at the death of the first of testatrix’s daughters to die, or at the successive deaths of testa<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>trix’s daughters.

In that case Eliza T. Edwards and Mary L. Edwards, two of the daughters, claimed the entire fund absolutely for testatrix’s four daughters, contending (p. 361) that the “remainders sought to be devised by testatrix to her grandchildren are contingent and not supported by prior vested particular estates, and therefore void.” This Court said (pp. 361, 362): “It is apparent, therefore, that the bequest was to the four daughters of testatrix for life, with no provision for survivorship and with remainder <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>to the grandchildren as a class . . . ‘Ample authority, is found in support of the proposition.that where, an estate is given to- a life tenant, .with remainder to .the -children of the life tenant,-the estate vests, at once upon the birth of each child, subject to open and let in after-born children, and this without, regard to the question .of ;whether or not a child survives the life tenant’ . . . <em>In the ease now before us, there were grandchildren living at the date of the death of testatrix, so that in so far. as: the principle referred to is concerned, the remainder, became vested at.once.” </em>The character of the remainder as vested or contingent under a proper construction of the will was the pivotal question before the-Court, as the- case was presented, and it was squarely decided against the.contentions, of.present appellants. • The statement at the end of the opinion, .“But in the present case, even if .the interests, of the grandchildren were contingent, they would have vested within the time limited by the rule/’ was an'afterthought. The use of the subjunctive serves to emphasize -what was actually .decided, namely, that the gift in remainder vested in the grandchildren at. the date of testatrix’s death.</p>
