Marcus in his own behalf, instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against certain defendants, one of the defendants being Robert N. Morris. The trial of this case in the United States District Court continued for a long period of time and resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and against all the defendants, except one, in the sum of $315,100.91. An appeal was taken to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the District Court. The United States Supreme Court later reinstated the judgment of the District Court. $100,000.00 of the judgment remains unpaid.</p>

Morris. These were, on December 2, 1940 and December 19, 1940, conveyed by estates in entirety to Robert N. Morris and Louise Evert Morris, his wife. The Bill avers that December 2, 1940, was the date on which the above mentioned trial was begun in the United States District Court against Robert N. Morris and certain other defendants. It also avers <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>that, there was no valuable consideration for the conveyances made by the defendants on December 2, 1940, and December 19, 1940, which purported to vest the estates in entirety in the defendants, who were husband and wife, and that the sanie were in fraud of' creditors. The Bill prays that these deeds be decreed to be null and void and defendants be required to re-deéd all of said premises to Robert N. Morris:</p>

Morris insolvent dr that the purpose and effect of these conveyances was "to hinder, delay and defraud complainants and other creditors and to place said properties beyond the reach of legal process. The Answer further sets forth that, Louise Evert Morris was a widow at the time of her marriage to Robert N. Morris, and upon the death, of her first husband in 1933 she received a, considerable estate, out of which she, prior to her marriage, to Robert N. Morris .in 1939, agreed to build a home, on a lot in Mt. .Lebanon, the .title to which was in.the name, of Robert N, Morris, who later became her. husband. . . The. dwelling so erected cost over $20,-000.00, which is more .than half of the value.of all the real estate contributed to the entirety estates by Robert N. Morris. .It is also, averred in the Answer that prior to the construction of the dwelling house a deed for the lot upon which the, house, was erected had been made to her by Robert N.

She proposed to invest a considerable part of her cash assets in a home for their joint use, and the prospective husband and wife discussed their mutual financial adjustments in the event of their prospective marriage. In order to protect his fiancee in the investment of her money in a house, Robert N. Morris on May 2,1939, conveyed for the consideration of One Dollar to Louise Evert McCombs the lot on Washington Road on which she proposed to build a house.”</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[284,932,1151,1179]]]'>Counsel for the plaintiffs argue that because one of the transactions which resulted in the creation of an entirety estate between the parties took place on December 2, 1940, and that this was the same day on which the trial of a large group of electrical contractors began in the United States District Court, that a strong presumption arises that there was fraud in these transfers. In answer to that contention the Chancellor says: “There would be great force in that contention if December 2,1940 marked the beginning of this transaction, but the evidence, it seems to us, clearly establishes the fact that December 2, 1940 was only the long delayed completion of arrangements, which had taken place a considerable period prior thereto and before any question had yet been raised as to any indebtedness of Robert N. Morris to the Government of the United States or to Morris L. Marcus. There is no evidence that when this house was being built, or when the deed of May 2,1939 from Robert N. Morris to Louise Evert McCombs was made that the United States had ever made any claim such as that, which was made finally in 1940 in the suit in the United States District Court.”</p>

The evidence, however, is quite to <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>the contrary in that the house, which was begun, was not constructed on a lot owned by her prospective husband, but on a lot, which she at the time personally owned.”</p>
    <p id="b327-3" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[139,446,1150,753]]]'>This is not a case where the wife of an insolvent debtor did not give full consideration for the husband’s conveyance of property to her. Here Mrs. Morris paid full consideration for what she received. The court en banc stated that “the improvements alone on this lot were worth as much if not more than all the properties which were contributed by Robert N. Morris to the entireties estate. It therefore cannot be fairly held under the facts of this case that the consideration for the conveyances now under attack came solely from the defendant, Robert N. Morris.” The $22,000.00 which Mrs. Morris provided for the building of the home for herself and her husband was money which she had largely received from the proceeds of life insurance policies on her first husband.</p>

In an opinion by Justice Walling, we said: “If John [the son] made a bona fide purchase of the farm from his father, for a fair consideration, without intent to hinder or delay the latter’s creditors, he acquired a good title whether his father was solvent or not. The fraudulent intent which will avoid a conveyance for value must be that of the purchaser: Reehling v. Byers, <a href="/pa/94/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="94 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="486661" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0316-01">94 Pa. 316</a>. An insolvent may make an honest sale of his property for a fair consideration. See sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Act of May 21, 1921, P.L. 1045, 1046. If John bought the farm for a fair value in good faith he would not be affected by his father’s financial affairs: Penna. Trust Co. v. Schenecker et al., <a href="/pa/289/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="289 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1103276" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0277-01">289 Pa. 277</a>.”</p>
