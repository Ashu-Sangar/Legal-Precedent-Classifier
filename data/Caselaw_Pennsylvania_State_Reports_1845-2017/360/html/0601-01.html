L. 400 (5 PS § 162 Pkt. Part), the defendants petitioned the court,, wherein the suit was pending, to require the plaintiff to submit its claim to arbitration in accordance with cited terms of the contract pleaded by the plaintiff. The court granted a rule on the plaintiff to show cause which, after argument, was made absolute.., The plaintiff appealed and assigns here for error the order making the rule absolute.</p>

The authorization “in the next preceding article”, so referred to, was a warrant of attorney empowering the owners to mark satisfied of record any lien or claim that the contractor, might file against the property. The contractor further expressly agreed that “if it shall delay the progress of the work so as to cause loss for which the Owner shall become liable, then it shall reimburse the Owner for such loss. Should the Owner and Contractor, fail to agree as to the amount of the loss comprehended in this Article, the determination of the amount shall be referred to arbitration as provided in [the contract].” The provision for arbitration reads as follows: “In case the Owner and Contractor fail to agree in relation to any portion of this contract, then the matter shall be referred to a Board of Arbitrators, . This article further prescribed the method of selecting arbitrators and provided that a decision of any two of them should be “final and binding on both parties” to the contract.</p>

The remaining two-thirds represents charges for extras under three, separate change-orders, one of which was not assented to by the plaintiff because of disputed items of credit claimed therein by the owners in a relatively small aggregate amount.</p>

      <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>In the petition for a reference of the controversy to arbitration, the defendants alleged that they were damaged in a substantial itemized sum because of delay attributable to the plaintiff in the performance of the contract and that' they were also entitled to greater credits in the change-order from which the plaintiff had withheld its assent. The plaintiff answered the petition for arbitration and averred that the delay in the completion of the contract was the fault of the defendants and not of the plaintiff ánd that the crédits to the defendants, as allowed by the plaintiff’s complaint, were correct; '</p>
    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[275,946,1151,915]]]'>The appellant contends that the pleadings do not present a case for arbitration, first, because the change-orders constituted “separate . . . contracts, in no way altering or affeeting the terms of [the original] contract . 1 and, second, because the matter of damages to the owner due to delay in the performance of the contract is not in issue, the plaintiff, by its answer, having traversed the allegations of the defendants in such regard and the latter not having supported their allegations thereafter by depositions. The appellant argues that, in consequence of the state of the pleadings, damages to the owners' for delay is no longer an issue by reason of the provisions of Rulé;209 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure with respect to the failure of a moving party to deny the averments of a responsive answer. There is no merit in either contention. ''</p>

But, it is equally true, since the Act of 1927, supra, which ordains the validity, irrevocability and enforceability of contractual provisions for arbitration in re<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>spect of a.controversy arising out of the subject matter of the-contract, that “; ... every reasonable intendment will be made in. favor .of the, validity of such agreements [citing case]”: <em>Bashford v.

In the present instance the Concern of the. contracting parties, as evidenced by their writing, with- respect to the status of, change-order agreements as,.separate contracts was that such agreements should .not alter or. affect the terms of the prime contract, and not. that controversies. so . arising were to be -excluded from the arbitration provision of the contract.. The intent,of the parties in pertinent relation is clear. Moreover, the change-order agreements themselves consonantly so confirm. In each of the first two change-orders the contractor accepted the owners’ written authorization “To proceed with the following addition to the original contract.” The third change-order did not contain a like authorization, but that is readily understandable, as that writing did not cover additional work to be done but merely stated an account of adjusted debits and-credits for certain extras and eliminations already made. ■ The conclusion properly follows that controversies arising out- of the change-order agreements' were referable' to the arbitration Contemplated by the prime contract.</p>
    <p id="b629-3" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[114,1650,1165,651]],["BL_630.1",630,[281,273,1151,595]]]'>The controversy over ¡the damages, claimed by .the defendants for. delay ¡in-the perl ormance of- the contract comes within the express terms of the provision for arbitration. Obviously,, therefore, the instant casé differs materially from the <em>Cornell </em>case, supra, upon which the .appellant so largely relies.,. Nor;:was,, the present controversy eliminated as a-subject of arbitration merely because the-defehdfints did hot file a réply denying the averiüétítsvÓf the'’plaintiff’s5'áhs-v^ér' to the ir'tilé' for arbitration. By their' petition, the defendants had directly .placed -the. blame for the damaging, delay upon the ■ plaintiff-while: the: latter, by its, answer, conceded delay <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>in contract performance but charged the fault therefor to the defendants. Thus was defined the issue of responsibility which satisfied the court that the matter was one for arbitration under the terms of: the contract. And, that is all that the procedural amendment of 1935, supra, required in the circumstances. It was not the intent of that Act that the court to which application is made for contractually specified arbitration should adjudicate the basic issues in dispute upon depositions. A determination of the controversy is the intended office of the arbitration approved by the statute.</p>
