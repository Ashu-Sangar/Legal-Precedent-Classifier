The case has been tried twice. The first trial resulted in verdicts for plaintiffs, but, after argument, the learned court below awarded a new trial. The second trial also resulted in verdicts for plaintiffs. Defendant did not question the fairness of the trial or the amount of the verdicts by moving for a new trial, but did file a motion for judgment n. o. v. After that motion was discharged and judgments were entered on the verdicts, defendant took these appeals.</p>

This playground, which was under the complete control and supervision of defendant’s employes, consisted of a large open space adjoining a school building and also of a room in the basement of this school, 28 feet 5 inches long, 27 feet 5 inches wide <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>and 9 feet high. A doorway and a descending flight of four steps led from the outdoor portion of the playground to this basement room. To the right of this doorway, a part of the room, 12 feet by 15 feet, was partitioned off for use as a boiler room, and ashes and rubbish were kept in one corner next to the partition. The remaining L-shaped space of the. room was dimly lighted by five small basement windows. In one corner there was a handicraft table. Yolleyball and badminton equipment, including shuttlecocks and racquets, as well as other playground material, were not stored away, but rather were lying in the open about the room, easily available to the children, who, with defendant’s permission, frequented this room every day during playground hours. For a long time this room had been used for handicraft work and frequently some of the children played there with a volleyball or batted a shuttlecock back and forth with badminton racquets. That the children had played, for at least three weeks prior to the accident, with this badminton equipment in this room was known to the playground leader, Miss Gehris.</p>
    <p id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[263,1426,1150,912]],["BL_239.1",239,[117,291,1149,370]]]'>At about eleven o’clock on the morning of July 22, 1942, minor plaintiff, then eleven years of age, was lawfully in this basement room with one Richard YonNeida and eight other children. Seeing defendant’s badminton equipment lying on the floor, Richard, who was also eleven years old at that time, suggested to minor plaintiff that they bat a shuttlecock back and forth between them with badminton racquets. Neither child had ever played the game of badminton. They proceeded to bat the shuttlecock to and fro, without a net between them. While they were thus playing, minor plaintiff stood inside the room with her back to the door and Richard faced her about seven feet away. Defendant’s playground leader was on duty and present in the room when these children started their play and she remained there for some time thereafter, but she did not endeavor to stop them or to warn them of the <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>possible danger involved: After playing for about five to ten minutes, minor plaintiff told Richard that she was quitting and tossed the shuttlecock to him with her hand and glanced away. Immediately, he batted the shuttlecock back again and the rubber part struck minor plaintiff in the left eye, injuring it so that, after several operations, it had to be removed.</p>
    <p id="b239-3" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[114,674,1151,422]]]'>Defendant maintains that it is entitled to judgment n. o. v. for three reasons: (1) that there was no negligence on its part; (2) that the proximate cause of the injury to minor plaintiff was the independent, intervening act of Richard YonNeida and (3) that minor plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. We shall examine these arguments in the order presented.</p>

That section reads: “If the actor, permits a third person to use land or chattels in his possession otherwise than as a servant, he is, if present, under a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control the conduct of the third person as to prevent him from intentionally harming others or from so conducting himself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them, if the actor (a) knows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control the third’ person, and (b) knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.” .</p>
    <p id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[284,948,1146,858]]]'>The pivotal question in this case is: Did the evidence warrant the submission to a jury of the question whether or not defendant exercised reasonable care for the safety of minor plaintiff? Our answer must depend upon a detailed analysis of the factual situation. Defendant was operating this playground under the exclusive control of its playground leader at the time the injury occurred. She, representing the City, had the duty to use every reasonable effort to control the conduct of all the children present there that day, including that of Richard and minor plaintiff. Other children, playing in the room, testified that the playground leader was present there during at least part of the time that minor plaintiff and Richard were batting the shuttlecock to each other with the racquets and that she made no effort to stop them.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[284,1826,1145,529]],["BL_241.1",241,[122,282,1148,700]]]'>The place in which they were playing obviously was hazardous for such activity, by reason of the poor lighting conditions, and of the restricted space available (which was but a fraction of the size of a regulation badminton court). The result of their inability to move freely about was that each player attempted to hit the shuttlecock directly toward his opponent rather than away from him as in a normal badminton game. The manner in which minor plaintiff and Richard were playing was also dangerous. The close proximity of <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>tlie children to each other,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the use of an outdoor shuttlecock with a hard rubber tip, instead of an indoor one with a cork tip in the still air of this room, and the absence of a badminton net, all were circumstances which helped to create a dangerous situation. The significance of the lack of a regulation net is that, when present, it offers some. protection to the badminton players. When a shuttlecock is struck hard and follows a straight, flat trajectory toward.the opposing player it is caught in the net which is erected between them. All these facts and circumstances, when considered together, show clearly that these children were allowed to continue playing in a situation of obvious danger.</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[107,994,1164,860]]]'>There is no doubt that the playground leader knew that she had the authority and ability to control these children. However, the questions to be determined, under the facts of this case, are: Would a reasonably prudent person ih her position have known of the necessity and opportunity for exercising this control, and, Was the conduct of the children a foreseeably dangerous activity which was creating an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them? The answers to these questions are not so clear that they can be ruled on as a matter of law, but are questions upon which there may be a reasonable difference of opinion, and, consequently, are . questions solely for determination by a jury. The jury found that defendant was negligent and we ‘are of opinion that the testimony was more than ample to support its conclusion.</p>

Richard VonNeida was the proximate cause of the injury to minor plaintiff. It was not extraordinary that Richard would strike the shuttlecock immediately when minor <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>plaintiff tossed it to Mm the last time. Children must be expected to act upon immature judgment, childish instincts and <em>impulses; </em>others who are chargeable with a duty of care and caution toward them must calculate upon this, and take precautions accordingly: <em>Rachmel v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/205/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="205 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="930000" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0314-01">205 Pa. 314</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.%201027" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="54 A. 1027">54 A. 1027</a>; <em>Fehrs v.

Richard was engrossed in the play which was being completed. It was for the jury to determine whether his act was a normal response to the stimulus of the situation created by defendant’s negligent conduct. See Restatement of the Law of Torts, Vol. II, §447.</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[306,932,1148,1230]]]'>Nor do we agree with defendant’s final contention that minor plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. She had never played badminton nor had she seen the shuttlecock used in the basement room. She did not realize that there was danger in the manner and under the conditions she was playing with Richard. While there was testimony that at times such play in the room was forbidden, there is no evidence that minor plaintiff knew of such prohibition. We have repeatedly said that only in clear cases, where the facts are settled and there can be no reasonable doubt as to the inferences to be drawn, can a court declare contributory negligence as a matter of law: <em>McCreery v. Westmoreland Farm Bureau, </em><a href="/pa/357/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="357 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="472055" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0567-01">357 Pa. 567</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="55 A.2d 399">55 A. 2d 399</a>. This is not such a case, and, therefore, the question as to minor plaintiff’s contributory negligence was for the jury. Particularly is this so, since she was not quite twelve years of age at the time of the accident. In this connection, we said, in <em>Fedorovich v. Glenn, </em><a href="/pa/337/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="337 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1197331" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0060-01">337 Pa. 60</a>, 64, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20358" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="9 A.2d 358">9 A. 2d 358</a>: “The question of contributory negligence of a child twelve years of age is particularly one for the jury under the decisions of this Court.”</p>

Regarding the duty to anticipate dangerous use, it is said, in Comment (c) : “If the chattel is one which can be safely used only if extreme caution is employed) or if one in possession of land permits a third person to conduct an activity thereon which is highly dangerous unless great care is taken, he may properly be required to exercise constant vigilance to be able to exercise his control over the third person when and if the occasion for it arises. <em>On the other hand, if the character of the chattel or its permitted use, or the activity upon the actors land is of such a character as to be dangerous only under particular conditions and in particular situations, the actor is required to exercise vigilance only if there is a reasonable probability that such a condition or situation will arise” </em>(Italics supplied). And, in Comment (d), it is stated: “If the third person permitted to use the actor’s chattel <em>persistently </em>uses it in a manner dangerous to others, the possessor may be required to terminate his consent to its use in order to escape liabilty for any harm' done by the <em>further </em>dangerous use of the chattel.” (Italics supplied).</p>

      <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>On the present record it is undisputed that appellant’s playground leader was not present in the basement room at the time of minor appellee’s injury. She left the basement room shortly after minor appellee and the boy started batting the shuttlecock to and fro, and had gone out onto the playground, to a handicraft table some distance away. There is no proof of anything occurring prior to the accident or during the play from which minor appellee’s injury could have been anticipated by the most alert playground leader or attendant. The mere batting of the shuttlecock, which is all that occurred in the playground leader’s presence, was not an inherently dangerous activity requiring, constant vigilance. Almost daily for a period-of three weeks prior to the accident the children had batted the shuttlecock in precisely the same manner and under exactly the same conditions, without injury to any child. Light was provided through five windows and the open door. The room was regularly used for handicraft purposes, and it may be assumed the lighting conditions were also adequate for the children to see each other and the shuttlecock as they batted it to and fro. True the batting back and forth of the shuttlecock by these children was not strictly in accordance with the rules governing the playing of a regulation game of badminton, in that they were using an outdoor shuttlecock indoors, without a net, and where the space available was less than specified for a regulation badminton court. But it cannot seriously be contended that any of these things constituted a violation of any rules designed for the safety of the players, for it is a matter of common knowledge that in badminton and similar games the play is frequently at close range, whether the game be played indoors or outdoors. So far as the record discloses, the space available and conditions were entirely adequate for the activity engaged in, which was not the playing of a regulation badminton game but the mere batting of the shuttlecock. <em>Moreover, it ivas not during </em>

      <em> </em>Seeing that he held the shuttlecock in his hand, and assuming he had also quit, she glanced away, but the boy, who was then eleven years of age, despite minor appellee’s announcement that she was unwilling to continue the game, which he heard, and despite the fact that she had turned her head away and was looking in another direction, which he observed, without warning and without cause batted the shuttlecock at her so that it struck her in the eye.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
