L. 259, in order to determine what portion of the coal must be left in place to support the turnpike and to assess the resulting damages to the Company. On appeal to this Court it was held that the State Mining Commission had jurisdiction in the proceedings over the Turnpike Commission: <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/351/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="462771" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0139-01">351 Pa. 139</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="40 A.2d 404">40 A. 2d 404</a>. The State Mining Commission found that the Turnpike Commission had waived the right to vertical and lateral support, that the Coal Company could remove all the coal, and that it .was therefore not entitled to recover any, damages. After certain subsequent proceedings, here immaterial, the Coal Company proceeded to mine the coal, the greater portion of which has now been remóved. In November, 1947,. more than two .years after the last order and decree in the proceedings had been made by the State Mining Commission, the Turnpike Commission petitioned it to order the Coal Company, <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>lessee, and tlie Thaw Coke Trust, owner, to pay the Turnpike Commission a certain specified sum as damages resulting from the subsidence of .one of, its bridges caused by alleged failure of the Company, to mine the coal in an orderly-fashion; also .that the: Company be ordered to cease, meanwhile from, further operations. On the basis of this petition the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, acting as Chairman of the State Mining Commission, issued a rule upon the owner and the lessee to show cause why the prayer should not be granted. Thereupon the Thaw Coke Trust and the Coal Company filed the.present petition in this Court for a writ of prohibition to enjoin the State Mining Commission from any further action in the proceedings, contending that its .jurisdiction had ceased after the expiration -of the appeal period from its last order or decree in July, .1945, and, contending also that it did not .have jurisdiction to assess damages against the owner or lessee of the coal after it had once finally determined that all the coal could be removed,— indeed, that it had no power in any case whatsoever to assess damages <em>against </em>the coal owner or lessee.</p>

The Commonwealth has filed a brief disputing the former but concurring in the latter of these contentions. The argument against the existence of the power is based upon article V, section 3 .of- the Constitution, which provides -that the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction in cases of injunction where a corporation is a party defendant, of-habeas corpus, of mandamus to courts .of inferior jurisdiction, and, of quo warranto as to all officers'of the Commonwealth whose jurisdiction extends over the State, “but shall not exercise any .other original jurisdiction”.</p>

Its principal purpose is to prevent an inferior judicial tribunal from assuming a jurisdiction with which it is not legally vested in cases where damage and injustice would otherwise be likely to follow from such action.

Be that as it may, the justification for the Court’s exercise of such power is to be found in the Act of May 22, 1722, 1 Sm. L. 131, 140, section XIII, which vested in the Supreme Court all the jurisdictions and powers of the three superior courts at Westminster, namely, the King’s Bench, the Common Pleas and the Exchequer. Inherent in the Court of King’s Bench was the power of general superintendency over inferior tribunals, a power which was of ancient inception and recognized by the common law from its very beginnings. Blackstone says, Book III, *42: “The jurisdiction of this court [of King’s Bench] is very high and transcendent. It keeps all inferior jurisdictions within the bounds of their authority, and may either remove their proceedings to be determined here, or prohibit their progress below.” By the Act of 1722 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was placed in the same relation to all inferior jurisdictions that the King’s Bench in England occupied, and thus the power of superintendency over inferior tribunals became vested in this Court from the time of its creation: <em>Commonwealth v. Ickhoff, </em><a href="/pa/33/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="33 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="988415" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0080-01">33 Pa. 80</a>, 81; <em>Chase v.

In the exercise of its supervisory powers over subordinate tribunals the Court of King’s Bench employed the writ of prohibition and such right and practice accordingly passed to the <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>Supreme Court; <em>First Congressional District Election, </em><a href="/pa/295/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="295 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1115163" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0001-01">295 Pa. 1</a>, 13, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20735" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="144 A. 735">144 A. 735</a>, 739; <em>McNair’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/324/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="324 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1171378" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0048-01">324 Pa. 48</a>; 64, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20498" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="187 A. 498">187 A. 498</a>, 505. The provision of the Constitution limiting the original jurisdiction of the Court did not affect the existence of this right; the Constitution did not remove from the Court its supervisory functions over lower courts' and therefore, of necessity, did not forbid its use of the writ of prohibition in the performance of such function's. As a matter of fact the issuance of such a writ is not, strictly speaking, an exercise of original jurisdiction (see <em>Commonwealth v. Balph, <a href="/pa/111/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="111 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="545298" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0365-01">111 </a></em><a href="/pa/111/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="111 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="545298" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0365-01">Pa. 365</a>, 382, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.%20220" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="3 A. 220">3 A. 220</a>, 230; <em>Commonwealth v.

The power of controlling the action of inferior courts is so general and comprehensive that it has never been' limited by prescribed forms of procedure or by the particular nature of the writs employed for its exercise. It may further be pointed out that Article V, section 3 of the Constitution expressly permits the exercise by this Court of original jurisdiction in cases of mandamus to courts of inferior jurisdiction, and prohibition is the exact counterpart of mándamus, the only difference being that the latter commands certain things to be done whereas prohibition forbids the doing of certain things which ought not to be done.</p>

The writ of prohibition is one which, like all other prerogative writs, is to be used only with great caution and forbearance and as an extraordinary remedy in cases of extreme necessity, to secure order and regularity in judicial proceedings if none of the ordinary remedies provided by law is applicable or adequate to afford relief. It is a writ which is not of absolute right but rests largely in the sound discretion of the court. It will never be granted where there is a complete and effective remedy by appeal, certiorari, writ of error, injunction, or otherwise: see <em>First Congressional District Election, </em><a href="/pa/295/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="295 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1115163" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0001-01">295 Pa. 1</a>, 13, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20735" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="144 A. 735">144 A. 735</a>, 739, 740, and cases referred to in the dissenting opinion in <em>Philadelphia County Grand Jury Investigation Case, </em><a href="/pa/347/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="347 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1217356" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0316-01">347 Pa. 316</a>, 330-334, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20199" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="32 A.2d 199">32 A. 2d 199</a>, 206-208; also <em>Roche, U.

As pointed out in the last cited authority (p. 203), “appellate courts are reluctant to interfere with decisions of lower courts, even on jurisdictional questions, which they are competent to decide and which are reviewable in the regular course of appeal. . . . The [extraordinary] writs may not be used as a substitute for an authorized appeal.” In the present case the action of the Chairman of the State Mining Commission in granting a preliminary rule to show cause does not necessarily indicate that the State Mining Commission itself may not, on argument directed to it, ultimately conclude that it is without jurisdiction over the prayer of the petition of the Turnpike Commission; it cannot be assumed that it will finally act if its lack of jurisdiction be established. If, however, it decides to the contrary and proceeds to adjudicate the controversy, the questions as to whether or not it has such jurisdiction, <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>and, if so, whether its final order or decree in the matter is proper, are both determinable by this Conrt on appeal, under the provisions of the Act of 1941. It is obvious, therefore, that there is no occasion whatever for invoking in this case the exercise of the extraordinary remedy of prohibition.</p>
