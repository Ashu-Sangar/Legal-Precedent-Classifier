The land was owned by John Koehler, who, at the time of his death January 10, 1947, was domiciled in the State of Ohio where his will has been probated. The parties agree .and therefore we assume that his will is valid by the law of Ohio. At the time of his death he owned personal property in Ohio and the real property in Sharon, Pennsylvania. He directed his executor to sell all his property except what was given in items III and V of his will and what was already invested in government bonds. He gave his residuary estate to a trustee to pay the income to the appellant charity, subject to the payment of one-half the income to Michael Molnar for life.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He died within <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>thirty days after executing his will. At that time the law of Pennsylvania provided that a will executed within that period could pass “No estate, real or personal ... to any person in trust for . . . charitable uses . . .” [Section 6,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Wills Act of 1917, P.

A citation was issued to Michael Molnar, Jr., legatee; to William B. Nicol, executor appointed in Item VII of testator’s will; to the Almira Home, and to the Union Trust Company of New Castle, trustee appointed in Item VI of testator’s will. Answers were filed. The case was heard by Judge Rowley, who awarded partition and, pursuant to waivers filed by petitioners, appointed a trustee to sell the real estate as provided in the Orphans’ Court Partition Act of 1917, P. L. 337, 20 PS 1181 et seq., the decree directing that Molnar’s rights “as life tenant shall be preserved and protected as provided in the Orphans’ Court Partition Act of 1917.”</p>

      <em> </em>The restrictions imposed by the Wills Act prevented the passing to the charity of the title to the Sharon property, whether considered as real or personal, and passed it as land to testator’s heirs. The learned court held that the heirs took the land subject to Molnar’s life interest in half the income; that Molnar, a party, could elect to receive, in this proceeding, his life interest in the income, as provided in Section 31 of the Orphans’ Court Partition Act of 1917, P. L. 337, 20 PS 1365. Molnar has not appealed from the decree.</p>
