The sentence was imprisonment in the penitentiary for not less than 10 years or more than 20 years. The Commonwealth alleges that on June 26th, 1947 at 2:20 A.M. Charles Peyton intentionally shot his wife, Mary, with malice aforethought, the victim dying ten hours later. Defendant was charged in two bills of indictment, one with murder and the other-with voluntary manslaughter.</p>

After he had retired he heard a banging on a door, (which he supposed was the outside door), and a female voice exclaim, “Let me (or us) in Charlie.” Shortly afterwards he heard a pistol shot, dressed hurriedly, and came down the stairway to the glass door leading into the kitchen. He further testified that there was an empty bucket against the opposite side of the door which was not there when he went upstairs. The Commonwealth claims that this bucket was so placed that if the chef pushed the door open it would make a noise and Peyton would thereby be apprised of his coming. He stated that a screw driver was in the hasp of the door to his right which led into the storage room. However, he did not try this door. From this position he observed that the north door leading from the kitchen into the barroom was open and that the ceiling light was on in the kitchen. He called the defendant, and receiving no response, called again. After the second call, Peyton appeared in the north entry to the bar and then disappeared again. McKenna crossed the kitchen to the north door, and followed defendant who was running up along the bar. Defendant turned and said he had shot Mary (his wife) accidentally. When defendant made this statement, he was probably six feet away from his wife, who said nothing. <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>Back of the bar, near the south entry, the witness discovered the body of Mary Peyton on the floor.

When the defendant approached his wounded wife she told him to “get away” from her. He approached her a second time and again she told him “to get away” from her. At the time Peyton was on his knees beside his wife and was shying to her that he was Sorry, that it was an accident, that he didn’t know she was there and he was trying to caréss her. Peyton went, at the direction of McKenna, to the phone to call a. doctor and after finishing the call, turned around and said he was going to call the police. Shortly afterwards'the telephone rang and the'witness answered the phone. A girl asked if this were Peytons, said' this was the doctor, and that the doctor would be right out.</p>

They knocked at the door and said they wanted a drink. He told them to go away but they persisted. They said if he didn’t let them in they were going to come in so he went and got the gun. He turned out all the lights thinking they would leave, but they kept pounding at the door. He then discharged the gun and immediately someone screamed “Charlie” and he realized that he had accidentally Shot his wife.

His wife went to the ladies room , (in the storeroom) and the pounding continued. In order to scare them away he fired a shot into the floor and then his wife fell on the floor in front of him and that was the, first he saw her or knew she was. there.

Riddle relative to the alleged dying declarations of the decedent. The appellant’s contention that these declarations do not possess the character of admissible dying declarations is well answered by the opinion of the court below written by Judge McNaugher, in refusing the motion for a new trial, where the learned judge said: “The nature of the wounds made by the .45 caliber bullet in its course through the body of the deceased, at one point tearing a hole in the stomach as large as a silver dollar, and at another macerating a lobe of the liver to a pulp; the testimony of the physicians as to the. seriousness of the patient;'the fact.that before the declarations were made the last rites of the Church had been administered by a Catholic priest; and the fact that she died within a few hours afterward; all of these considerations taken together constituted a sufficient basis for a conclusion by the jury that the deceased was in a dying condition and realized it.” In <em>Commonwealth v. Puntario, </em><a href="/pa/271/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="271 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="295699" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0501-01">271 Pa. 501</a>, 505, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.%20831" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="115 A. 831">115 A. 831</a>, this Court held that the nature of the victim’s wounds was such in itself as to justify the conclusion that, the deceased was aw;are of his impending death. In that case the opinion writer, Justice Sadler, quoted the following from 1 R. C. L. <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>546: “ ‘It is well settled that the sense of impending death which the dying person must have had in order to render a dying declaration made by him admissible in evidence may be inferred from the nature of the wound or the state of his illness without any express declaration to show that he was sensible of impending death.’ ” The opinion also quoted Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 2, p. 1807 as follows: “In ascertaining this consciousness of approaching death; recourse should naturally be had to all the attending circumstances. It has béén contended that only the statements of the declarant could be considered for this purpose; or, less broadly, that the nature of the injury alone could not be sufficient, i. e., in-effect, that the declarant must show in some way by conduct or language that he knew he was going: to die. This, however, is without good reason. We may avail ourselves of any means of inferring the existence- of any such knowledge; and if, in a given case, the nature of the wound is such that declarant must have' realized his situation, our object is sufficiently attained. Such is the settled judicial attitude.” To the same effect is the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mattox v. United States, </em><a href="/us/146/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="146 U.S. 140" data-case-ids="3564613" data-case-paths="/us/146/0140-01">146 U. S. 140</a>.</p>

What Wigmore on Evidence, Third Edition, Vol. 5, Sec. 1447 said, negatives this contention, to wit: “The Opinion rule has no application to dying .declarations. The theory of that rule is that, wherever the witness can state specifically the detailed facts observed by hiin, the inferences to be drawn from <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>them can equally well be drawn by the jury, so that the witness’ inferences become superfluous.

This case is easily distinguished from the instant case. In the <em>Fugmann </em>case, when the victim of a plan to kill pried open the lid of a box which was sent to him through the mails, a violent explosion took place which caused him fatal injuries. Shortly after the explosion took place the victim’s-wife asked him what had happened and he said, “Fugmann did this”. Fugmann was nowhere in sight and this statement of the victim was a surmise based upon previous relations between him and Fugmann. In the instant case the victim and her alleged slayer wére in close proximity to each other and she “was in a position to judge from the facts which she had preserved through her senses whether or not the shooting for which her husband was responsible was done intentionally or by accident. In <em>Commonwealth v. Werntz, </em><a href="/pa/161/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="161 Pa. 591" data-case-ids="854171" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0591-01">161 Pa. 591</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.%20272" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="29 A. 272">29 A. 272</a>, a declaration was offered as part of the res gestee made by a victim of á stabbing. The declarations were held admissible because they were made “by the party best informed and most interested”. In the' instant case the dying declaration as to whether or not the killing was accidental or intentional was máde by the person best qualified to know the truth. It was based not upon surmise, but upon observation. Theré was no error in the admission of Mary Peyton’s statement as a dying declaration.

When the facts that these exhibits would tend to prove can be proved by testimony without the use of photographs which tend to excite the emotions of those who view them, such testimony should be used exclusively and photographs should not be admitted.

Minnich, </em><a href="/pa/250/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="250 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1017026" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0363-01">250 Pa. 363</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20565" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="95 A. 565">95 A. 565</a> where it was held that “all declarations bf personal hostility are admissible in evidence as showing malice and tending to show the criminal intent charged.”</p>

The-defendant received- a fair trial before an able and impartial judge. The evidence warrants the belief that the defendant intentionally murdered his wife. The fact that he escaped conviction of murder in the first degree cannot be attributed to any weakness in the commonwealth’s case.</p>

The fact that Mrs. Peyton’s body was “black and blue” at the time stated was admissible, but without Mrs. Peyton’s explanation of this discoloration the fact had no probative value. Wigmore on Evidence, Third Edition, Vol. 6, Sec. 1772, page 190-191 says of “utterances forming a verbal part of an act”: “A second kind of situation in which utterances are not offered testimonially arises when the utterance accompanies conduct to which it is desired to attach some legal effect. The conduct or act has intrinsically no definite significance, or only an ambiguous one, and its whole legal purport or tenor is to be more precisely ascertained by considering the words accompanying it. The utterance thus enters merely as a verbal part of the act, or, in the common phrase, a ‘verbal act.’ ” He cites, inter alia, the case of <em>Patten v. Ferguson, </em><a href="/nh/18/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="18 N.H. 528" data-case-ids="4419529" data-case-paths="/nh/18/0528-01">18 N. H. 528</a>, where Chief Justice Parker says: “Here it is admitted that neither the fact nor the declaration, standing alone, are evidence; and when put together it is the declaration which is significant, and not the fact. The fact was of no importance standing alone; and the declaration, standing alone, was incompetent. When they are united, the unimportant fact is . . . used as a vehicle to introduce the important declaration.” In <em>Lund v. Tyngsborough, </em><a href="/mass/63/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="9 Cush. 36" data-case-ids="9453873" data-case-paths="/mass/63/0036-01">9 Cush. 36</a>, 42, it was stated: “when the act of a party may be given in evidence, his declarations, made at the time, and calculated to elucidate and explain the character and quality of the act . . . are admissible in evidence.” In <em>Eaton v. N. Y. Life Ins. Co. of N. Y., </em><a href="/pa/315/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="315 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1156642" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0068-01">315 Pa. 68</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20121" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="172 A. 121">172 A. 121</a>, we held that what the insurance agent said and what the insured (later deceased) said at the time the agent made manual delivery of the policy was admissible in evidence. In that case we quoted <em>Wright v. Tatham, </em>5 Cl. &amp; F. 670, 693 where Judge Coleridge stated: “The act itself being admissible, whatever accompanies it and serves to explain its character is relevant and admissible also.” ■</p>
