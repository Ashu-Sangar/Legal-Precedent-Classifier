After a hearing, at which defendants offered no testimony, the court below, being of the opinion that plaintiff’s remedy, if any, was at law, rather than in equity, dissolved the preliminary injunction and certified the case to the law side of the court, “on condition that the defendants pay into Court the sum of Fifty-two Hundred Fifty ($5250.00) Dollars, the sum tendered to the plaintiff, and refused by him, pending the final determination of the case.” That sum later was paid into court, and plaintiff appealed.</p>

    <p id="b403-3" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[129,938,1153,1194]]]'>From the record before us, it appears that plaintiff, on or about July 7, 1945, was offered by defendant, Geahry, who was then and still is president and director of the United Company, the position of plant manager of the company at a salary of $75 a week. As an Inducement to accept such employment, Geahry and plaintiff entered into a written contract for the sale by Geahry to plaintiff of 75 shares of United Company stock for the sum of $7500, payable $1250 on the execution of the contract and in annual payments of $1125 each, to be paid out of dividends declared annually on the stock. The agreement also provided that in case dividends in that amount were not declared, the sum of $1125 annually “shall nevertheless be credited on this contract.” It was further provided that “in case the . . . [plaintiff] should leave the employ of the United Cleaning Company either of his own volition or by dismissal of the company that . . . [defendant Geahry] shall pay to . . . [plaintiff] all of the money that has been paid on this contract including the annual payments credited thereon at the time of the severance of the contract of employment of . . . [plaintiff].”</p>

These 187% shares, Clark, under a contract dated November 30,1942, agreed to sell to Murtha and Geahry, for $14,000, payable in monthly instalments of $150. This latter agreement also provided that on payment of the total consideration, 112% of the 187% shares were to be issued to Murtha and 75 shares to Geahry. Payments on this agreement are not in arrears.</p>
    <p id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[270,1109,1153,803]]]'>On or about March 1, 1948, Geahry informed plaintiff that he intended to terminate their contract because his family wanted the stock, and offered to return plaintiff all moneys paid and credits allowed under the agreement. Plaintiff, however, insisted that the contract be performed in accordance with its terms. Thereafter, Geahry attempted to discharge plaintiff, but the latter refused to leave his position and has since and is now performing the same duties as before. Plaintiff’s payments under his contract are not in arrears, he having paid $1250 on the execution of the agreement, and certain sums thereafter in cash and in credits pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in the aggregate amount of $5250, leaving a balance of $2250 not now due. He has fully performed his contract.</p>

Plaintiff thus exceeded his obligation to Geahry under their contract, but this offer Geahry refused to accept, apparently determined to <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>void his contract and retain the stock he had agreed to transfer to plaintiff. It may be when defendant Geahry is heard he can show some reasonable ground for his refusal but the record in its present state shows none.</p>
    <p id="b405-3" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[115,533,1156,1139]]]'>We are satisfied that the order appealed from is clearly erroneous. Under the facts here presented, it appears that equity ought to take jurisdiction .in this case, because plaintiff’s remedy at law is wholly inadequate. The stock in the United Cleaning Company is closely held, is not purchasable in the market, has no quoted or ascertainable market value and is of peculiar value to plaintiff because of his employment by the company. Under such circumstances, equity will compel specific performance: <em>Eichbaum v. </em>Sample, <a href="/pa/213/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="213 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="943395" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0216-01">213 Pa. 216</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.%20837" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="62 A. 837">62 A. 837</a>; <em>Reid v.

Furthermore, an examination of plaintiff’s contract with Geahry would indicate that it was not the intention of the parties to vest in Geahry the right to terminate the agreement by causing plaintiff to be dismissed from his employment without just cause. The record shows that Geahry did not attempt to discharge plaintiff until after he had refused to convey the stock to plaintiff. Obviously Geahry could not avoid the obligations of his contract with plaintiff in this manner. See Restatement of Law of Contracts, § 307.</p>
