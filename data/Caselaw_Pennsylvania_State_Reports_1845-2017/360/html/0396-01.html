Upon trial, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.

The appellant also; contends that, had certain of his testimony, given in the plaintiff’s case as upon cross-examination, not been currently excluded, the granting of his motion for compulsory nonsuit would have been necessary and that, consequently, he is now entitled to a summary judgment on a reconstructed record. The facts and reasonable inferences favorable to the verdict show the collision to have occurred in the following manner.</p>

College Street whereon are erected “Stop” signs for the regulation of traffic on that street as it approaches Green Street from either side. In the late afternoon of a September day, the plaintiff, an elderly man, was. driving his automobile in a northerly direction on Green Street toward College Street. As he <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>approached the intersection, he looked “up and down” College Street, saw nothing and proceeded to cross. When he had reached a point about one-third of the way through the intersection, the defendant’s truck (described as a “station wagon”) crashed into the left-hand side of the plaintiff’s automobile, with the result that both vehicles careened over toward the northeast corner of the intersection. The plaintiff sustained .serious personal injuries; and his automobile, which had come to a stop against a telephone pole, was demolished beyond repair. The front of the truck was bent in and one of its headlights was broken. The defendant offered no evidence as to the happening of the accident.</p>

In such circumstances, a jury could properly infer negligence on the part of the defendant from the fact that his truck was driven head-on into the left-hand side of the plaintiff’s automobile. Under the facts as the jury presumably found them to be, it was the plain duty of the driver of the truck in approaching the intersection to have his car under such control as to be able to stop and wait in order to give the plaintiff’s automobile, already in the intersection, an opportunity to pass by in safety: <em>Davis v.

The defendant answered each of these questions in the affirmative; and, with that, the plaintiff concluded the cross-examination. Defendant’s counsel then undertook to interrogaté the witness, intending to ask him whether Onderisin had authority to drive the truck. Upon objection by the plaintiff, the learned trial judge refused to allow the examination on tbe ground that to do otherwise would enable the defendant improperly to introduce his defense in connection with the plaintiff’s case. The testimony so' éxclúded was, however, subsequently <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>received in evidence in the presentation of the defendant’s own case when he testified that, while both Feleptko and Onderisin were employed by him, he had never authorized the latter to drive the truck, Feleptko being the only one so authorized and Onderisin being employed merely as a helper in the loading and unloading of the truck.</p>

By what right, then, can a reviewing court subsequently conclude that, had the excluded examination of the defendant been permitted at trial, the plaintiff would have allowed such testimony to go unrebutted? Yet, such is the violent assumption that must necessarily be made as a prerequisite to the procedure approved in the <em>Conley </em>case. Certain it is that, had the defendant’s testimony in such connection been received in the plaintiff’s case and had the plaintiff offered further testimony in contradiction thereof, as it would have been his right to do, a nonsuit could not properly have been entered below nor, by the same token,' a judgment for the defendant given here on the-basis of the defendant’s self-serving testimony supposedly binding on the plaintiff only because of an unwarranted assumption.

Mervis, </em>supra, on the question of proper reexamination. Except for that case and subsequent rulings based on its authority, not a single instance has come to our attention where a trial court in .Pennsylvania has ever been reversed for exercising its discretion in favor of restricting the defendant’s cross-examination of the. plaintiff’s witnesses so as to prevent him from introducing his defense in the plaintiffs case unless the defendant would thereby be precluded from ultimately putting upon the record elsewhere in the trial the matter so excluded. Ordinarily, it has been considered a sound exercise of trial discretion for a judge to restrict the scope of examination so as to keep the presentation of evidence in proper sequence. The underlying justification for the rule was well stated in the <em>Hughes </em>case, supra, where it was said at p. 213 that ". . . to permit a party to lead out new matter, constituting his own case, under the guise of a cross-examination, is disorderly and often unfair to the opposite party.”</p>

A limitation upon the cross-examination of a witness in the adversary’s case is not harmful and, consequently, not grounds for reversal when the party so restricted has an opportunity to, and does, put the excluded testimony on the record in the presentation of his own case.
