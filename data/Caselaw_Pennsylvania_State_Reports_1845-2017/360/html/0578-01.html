    <p id="b603-6" data-blocks='[["BL_603.9",603,[97,920,1157,1260]]]'>This appeal is from a decree dismissing a bill for the specific performance of a contract to sell real estate. Perhaps much of the difficulty experienced by the parties (as well as hy the court) is directly attributable to plaintiff’s disregard of the provisions of Equity Rules 38 and 39 providing for preliminary injunctions with or without affidavit and the action of the court below in countenancing the violation of the rules. On the mere presentation of the bill on June 2nd the court below allowed a rule to show cause returnable June 21st with a stay of proceedings and without the entry of a bond; in other words, on sight, a 19 day injunction was granted contrary to the provisions and spirit of the Equity Rules, tying the hands of the defendants without notice. Finally, working through a series of rules allowed by the court below, the record was amended to present a preliminary objection (Rule 48) filed June 21st as of June 5th pointing out that it appeared that the statute of frauds prevented the enforcement of the contract sought to be enforced. The objections also asserted that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law; the court also thought the bill was not “properly verified as required by the rules of equity practice.”</p>

We shall not speculate on what amendments, if any, the plaintiff may make, but may note in passing that <em>Gettemy v.
