    <p id="b265-8" data-blocks='[["BL_265.11",265,[116,968,1151,372]]]'>The question, raised by this appeal is whether a dealer in cigarettes, required to pay a tax to the Commonwealth under the Cigarette Tax Act of May 13, 1947, P. L. 215, 72 PS Supp. 3154, is also liable to pay a mercantile license tax to the City of Pittsburgh under its mercantile tax ordinances. The learned court below .decided that the dealer was liable. This appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b265-10" data-blocks='[["BL_265.13",265,[117,1794,1148,209]]]'>By the Cigarette Tax Act of May 13, 1947, P. L. 215, 72 PS Supp. 3154, dealers in cigarettes are required to secure a permit to sell cigarettes and to pay a permit fee of One Dollar. The Act also provides:</p>

One, No. 489, required persons engaged in enumer<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>ated occupations and businesses to obtain a mercantile license upon payment of a named fee. The other, No. 488, assessed a tax on persons engaged in such occupations and businesses measured by the annual gross volume of business. The validity of these ordinances was sustained by this Court in <em>Federal Drug Co. v. Pittsburgh et al., </em><a href="/pa/358/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="358 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="8845730" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0454-01">358 Pa. 454</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20849" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="57 A.2d 849">57 A. 2d 849</a>.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[286,652,1149,316]]]'>The Rice Drug Company, appellant, is a dealer, inter alia, in cigarettes. It secured a State cigarette permit and paid the State tax, but protests the payment of the City’s mercantile license fee and mercantile tax. The appeal from the judgment raises the question of the legality of the tax assessment.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[284,981,1151,696]]]'>The validity of the tax is clearly established by the decision of this.Court in <em>Blauner's, Inc. et al. v. Philadelphia et al., </em><a href="/pa/330/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="330 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1182979" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0340-01">330 Pa. 340</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20889" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="198 A. 889">198 A. 889</a>. The facts in that case parallel those now before us, except that in the <em>Blauner </em>case it was the <em>State </em>which imposed the mercantile tax while the <em>City </em>enacted the sales tax. The language of both statutes and ordinances are substantially the same. The gist of the decision in the <em>Blauner </em>case is that while both taxes are <em>excise </em>taxes, a sales tax is a levy on the <em>transaction </em>whereby property is acquired, whereas the mercantile tax is an imposition for the <em>privilege of doing business. </em>Mr. Justice Drew succinctly states this principle at p. 346:</p>
    <blockquote id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[282,1689,1149,479]]]'>“The State mercantile license tax and the City sales tax are similar in that they are both excises, but the similarity goes no further. The .City tax is a levy on sales, the State tax is a levy imposed for the privilege of conducting a particular kind of business, albeit the amount of the tax is measured by'gross sales. The sales tax is imposed upon the transaction whereby property is acquired; the mercantile tax is an imposition for the privilege of doing business.”</blockquote>

In all of these cases this Court held that the tax imposed by the political subdivision in no way duplicated the State tax. As we said in <em>Federal Drug Company v. Pittsburgh et al., </em>supra, at p. 457: “The respective impacts of the two taxes are on a totally different basis.” See also: <em>Dunkard Township School Tax Case, </em><a href="/pa/359/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="359 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="473113" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0605-01">359 Pa. 605</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.2d%2039" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="60 A.2d 39">60 A. 2d 39</a>.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[127,715,1153,758]]]'>Appellant strenuously argues that the tax imposed under the <em>State Cigarette Tax Act, </em>supra, is <em>not </em>a sales tax but is a tax imposed on the <em>privilege of selling </em>cigarettes and hence the City mercantile tax duplicates the State tax. Much reliance is placed upon the use of the word <em>excise </em>in the Act. But as Mr. Justice <em>Linn </em>points out in <em>Philadelphia v. Samuels, </em>supra, the use of the same word may have variable meanings in different tax statutes. Even if this tax be regarded as an excise tax, the City mercantile tax is not necessarily invalid: <em>Blauner's, Inc., et al., v. Philadelphia et al., </em>supra. We have examined the words of the.present statute to. determine the true nature of the tax assessed. The words of the State Cigarette Tax Act are:</p>
