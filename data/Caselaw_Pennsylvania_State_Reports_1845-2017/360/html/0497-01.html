Fahey, deceased, take <em>per stirpes </em>or. <em>per capita. </em>The controversy arises out of a suit for partition in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County. The matter was here once before on an appeal from an order entered in a contemporaneous declaratory judgment proceeding instituted in the same court for the purpose of having the respective interests of the various beneficiaries of the decedent’s estate determined ancillary to the <em>partition suit already pending”. </em>Such a course, we held to be improper. It disregarded the procedure statutorily prescribed for partition in the Orphans’ Court: see <em>Fahey Estate, </em><a href="/pa/356/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="356 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="470720" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0535-01">356 Pa. 535</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20A.2d%20580" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="52 A.2d 580">52 A. 2d 580</a>.</p>

The court held that the grandchildren meant by the testator embraced only such as were children of the testator’s <em>deceased </em>son and daughter and that they and the testator’s children take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>This appeal is by the guardian and trustee ad litem of excluded grandchildren <em>in esse </em>or <em>in posse, </em>being the children (living or unborn) of the testator’s <em>surviving </em>son and daughters.</p>

No other inference can reasonably be drawn from the will. After appointing by name, his surviving son and daughters executors of his will, he therein expressly “charge [d] them to be Just &amp; true one to the other and to their nephews and Nieces, the children of my Daughter Hilda Fahey Charles and my Son John S. Fahey”. If the testator had meant by “grand Children” more than the children of his deceased son and daughter, is it not -reasonable to suppose that he would have used some all-inclusive phrase such as “all of my grandchildren”, and would he not, moreover, have charged his surviving son and daughters to be “Just &amp; true” to “all” of their nephews and nieces, and not merely to such as were the children of the deceased Hilda and John? If the will were interpreted to mean that, in addition to the <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>children of the deceased son and daughter, the word “grand Children” was meant to include, as well, the children of the testator’s surviving son and daughters, the result would run directly counter to the well-established rules of construction applicable to the interpretation of wills of doubtful or ambiguous meaning. Thus, under the appellant’s contention, if adopted, more remote kin would be elevated to the status of those nearest of kin; distribution would not be made by classes (children of the testator’s surviving son and daughters would share equally with their parents); and the scheme of the intestate law would be ignored: see <em>Wood Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/154/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="154 Pa.

The children of the surviving son and daughters, not taking by representation, would necessarily have to share <em>per capita </em>with their living parents. And, of course, in such circumstances, consistency would require that the children of the testator’s deceased son and daughter also share <em>per capita, </em>thus defeating a just <em>per stirpes </em>distribution among the testator’s “Children and grand Children”. The rule that “. . . in the absence of a contrary inten<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>tion, children do not take concurrently with their parents but the division is per stirpes” (see <em>Mayhew’s Estate, </em>supra, at p. 91) refutes the appellant’s suggestion that the testator meant to include among the participating “grand. Children” under his .will the children of his own surviving children.. The will does not call for any such strained interpretation.</p>
