He continued to hold that office for a period of approximately ten years. At a meeting of the council in Febru<a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>ary, 1945, it was . moved, seconded,, and parried that the office of chief of. police be abolished, for reasons of economy and that plaintiff’s employment' be terminated. Since then plaintiff has. been deprived of the . right no.t only to act as chief. o.f; police bat also ;to' perform the duties of a policeman, and he has received PQ salary.whatever from that date. It is not pretended, that he was guilty of any neglect, of duty or. that there..were any personal grounds for his dismissal, nor were. charges of any .hind made against him. On the other, hand,, plaintiff does not claim that in abolishing the. office of chief of police.the council of the borough were actuated by any political or improper motives, but only by a desire to reduce expenses.</p>

L. 689, provided that “Borough councils may appoint . . . one or more suitable persons ... as borough policemen. . . . The <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>borough council may designate <em>one of said policemen </em>as chief of police. . . . The borough may by ordinance establish a police department consisting of chief, captain, lieutenant, sergeants, and any other classification desired by the council, and council may designate the individuals assigned to each office . . It is clear that if a policeman, under that act, becomes designated by the council as chief he still remains a police officer; he merely holds thereafter a higher rank or position on the force; if at any time, therefore, this higher rank or office should be abolished it would not operate to deprive him of his original status as a policeman, an appointment which he had gained by passing the tests required by the Civil Service Act of June 5,1941, P. L. 84, and to the protection of which act he remained entitled.</p>

Such removal shall be accomplished by furloughing in numerical order, commencing with the man last appointed until such reduction shall have been accomplished”. Therefore, while the borough council had the power, for reasons of economy, to reduce the number of the paid employes of the police department by abolishing the office of chief, it was bound to remove from the force the person last appointed thereto and not a person with rights of seniority merely because the latter was no longer to hold the position of chief.</p>

In the <em>McAdoo Borough </em>case, supra, the office of captain of police was abolished and Thomas, the captain, was separated from the force altogether, but he does not seem to haye raised any question as to his dismissal; indeed, he and another member of the force had been the last to be appointed and on the same day, so that he was not in a position to invoke any claim of seniority. Neither of these cases, therefore, serves as precedent or authority in the present controversy.</p>
