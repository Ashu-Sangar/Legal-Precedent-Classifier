A corporate fiduciary was appointed guardian of her estate by a court of common pleas. The guardian petitioned that court for leave to sell the real estate therein described to <em>appellant and her husband </em>for <em>$6,380 </em>in conformity with their written offer. It was averred in the petition that a sale was necessary in order to secure funds to defray hospital expenses and that no other source of funds, was available. The petition was joined in by, or notice given to, all persons in interest. The court, on February 7, 1946, <em>approved </em>the <em>private sale </em>and, as authorized by section 6 of the Act of May 28, 1907, P. L. 292, 50 PS, 961, <em>decreed </em>that the guardian convey the real estate to appellant and her husband. $200 was paid to the guardian on account of the purchase price. Margaret E.

Upon answer and hearing, the court in an opinion and decree dated December 20,1946, discharged the rule. No appeal has been taken from this decree which therefore has become final. Judge Griffith, in his opinion, accurately said: “The petitioner contends that since the guardian’s powers ceased upon the death of its ward, the order of sale should be stricken from the record. With this contention we cannot agree. The order of February 7, 1946, authorizing and directing the guardian to sell to <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>the petitioner and her husband was valid when made and based upon a valid contract, upon which a down-payment had been made.

It is true that the guardian, after the death of its ward, can no longer execute and deliver a valid deed to the purchasers. However, upon the ward’s death, the powers of the guardian, as her personal representative, passed to her executrix (Frew’s Estate, supra), who now has the power and duty of enforcing the contract of sale against the purchasers.”</p>

Section 6 of the Act of 1907, supra, provides for both <em>public- </em>and <em>private </em>sales of the real estate of a mentally incompetent person. The guardian of the ward is required to petition the court for leave to sell. In the case of a <em>public </em>sale detailed requirements are enacted as to notice, advertising, etc. When' the court has directed such public sale, the Act requires that it <em>ccshall be </em>confirmedThere is a <em>proviso, </em>however, in the Act relating <em>to,private sales. </em>It reads: “Provided, that if the court shall be of the opinion that, under the circumstances, a better price can be obtained by private sale than at public sale, the court may decree and approve the same.”</p>

Neither are we in accord with appellant’s contention that the real estate had not been converted when a valid contract of sale had been concluded because of the decree and approval of the court.

And, that ruling, so made in 1846, was followed by this court without deviation as lately as in <em>Buck’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/256/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="256 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1030727" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0359-01">256 Pa. 359</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%20866" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="100 A. 866">100 A. 866</a>, where we affirmed per curiam a ruling by the Orphans’ Court of <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>Philadelphia County that the proceeds of.a guardianes sale, of lands of a weak-minded person under the Act of 1907 are distributable after the death of the ward as realty and not as personalty.

From the order then entered by the Common Pleas Court, discharging the rule to discontinue the sale proceeding, no appeal was taken; and, because of that, the majority of this Court now hold that, <em>unappealed </em>from, the order of the Common Pleas Court conclusively establishes that the contract, made under the aegis of that court for legally exclusive performance there but no longer so performable, became an asset of the deceased ward’s estate and, as such, is enforceable in the Orphans’ Court. Thus, the majority opinion states that “The obstacle to granting the relief is the <em>unappealed decision </em>of the common pleas court that there is a binding and enforceable outstanding contract for the purchase of this real estate executed by <em>appellant and Tier husband. </em>As decedent, in her lifetime, through her guardian, had transferred the equitable title to the real <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>estate, her testamentary provision with respect thereto became inoperative.”</p>

The legal situation is that the mentally incompetent ward transferred <em>absolutely nothing, </em>either equitable or legal, through her guardian. It was only the Common Pleas Court, having jurisdiction of the ward and her property, that could alien or charge her estate in any manner or degree. The fallacy in the reasoning of the majority opinion in this particular connection resides in treating, as an ordinary fiduciary, a guardian of a weak-minded person appointed under the Act of <em>1907; </em>see <em>Interboro Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Prospect Park, Guardian, Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/359/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="359 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="473143" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0315-01">359 Pa. 315</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20101" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="59 A.2d 101">59 A. 2d 101</a>. Such a guardian does not have even the slightest trace of the limited discretion imaginably attending the most restricted fiduciary: cf. <em>Davidson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/323/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="323 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1169580" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0113-01">323 Pa. 113</a>, 116, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20782" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="185 A. 782">185 A. 782</a>. He is but a bailiff of the court whose ward the incompetent really is. As observed by Chief Justice Gibson in <em>Lloyd v. Hart, </em><a href="/pa/2/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="2 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="951197" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0473-01">supra</a> (p. 478),—“A committee [in lunacy] is a bailiff whose power is limited to the mere care of the estate under the direction of the court; . . .”. And, in <em>Gerlach’s Estate, </em>supra, the Superior Court said (p. 300) that “A feeble-minded or weak-minded person is the ward of the court appointing the guardian, and the guardian is simply its bailiff or agent <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>in protecting him and his estate”. Manifestly, the unperformed contract in the present instance did not create any equitable charge against the ward’s estate. The guardian lacked the legal capacity to make it such; and merely partial compliance with statutorily prescribed court procedure for a judicial sale, of an incompetent’s real estate surely cannot be held to create such an estate in the prospective purchaser.</p>

The application in such connection was improvidently made, undoubtedly, out of a mistaken sense of caution. Upon the death of the incompetent, the court’s power to proceed further with the uncompleted sale and transfer ceased; No one disputes that. What the court was thus incapable of doing by direction should not be permitted to result by indirection and, particularly, not on the basis of implications drawn from the court’s refusal to act in a matter where the judicial power to act affirmatively had terminated. The appellant did, however, move advisedly when she abandoned the abortive proceeding taken in the Common Pleas Court after her mother’s death and went directly to the Orphans’ Court, as was her legal right under Section 33(f) of the Fiduciaries Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, 20 PS §736, for the allocation to her, by virtue of her mother’s will, of the real estate in controversy at the valuation fixed therefor in the will.</p>

We have already seen what Chief Justice Gibson said in <em>Lloyd v. Hart </em>about disregarding “the ulterior and conflicting interests of those who may be entitled to the succession; . . .”. In <em>Hoffman’s Estate, </em>supra, Mr. Chief Justice Mitchell characterized the similar and “in pari materia” Act of 1895, relating to feeble-minded persons, as “. . .'a dangerous statute easily capable of abuse by designing relatives to accomplish the very wrong intended to be guarded against, and therefore to be administered by the courts with the utmost caution and conservatism”.

It must be evident that to force the completion of the sale of the realty to the daughter and her husband according to the terms of their contract with the guardian could not possibly be for the benefit of the incompetent ward who is already deceased. The desire to hold the daughter and her husband to their contract offer for the property emanates from the decedent’s sons who will accordingly benefit materially at the expense of their sister. While the decedent’s will (made when she was admittedly competent) divides all of her property for distribution equally among her children, she thereby gave her daughter the right to take the real estate (here in controversy) at a valuation of $4,000. Inasmuch as the daughter and her husband agreed in the guardianship proceeding to pay $6,380 for the same property, the possible gain to the sons, as testamentary beneficiaries, is apparent. But, that can furnish no justification for now effectuating an uncompleted sale (initiated under a statute with which the Orphans’ Court has nothing to do) by simulated adaptation of the processes and powers of the latter court. The majority opinion notes that the daughter knew of the testamentary provision respecting the real estate when she and her husband made their bid for the property in the guardianship proceeding, but makes no comment upon that circumstance. In no event, however, could the fact that the daughter did bid considerably more for the property for the mother’s lifetime benefit than what the daughter could have gotten the property for from her mother’s estate after the latter’s death, afford any inference adverse to the appellant. Her brothers also knew that she could take the property after her mother’s death under the latter’s will at a $4,000 valuation. Yet, they have striven to deprive her of that testamentary privilege although there is no longer any occasion to sell the property for the mother’s need. The only power of sale ever germane to the facts of this case was the power <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>conferred by tbe Act of 1907.
