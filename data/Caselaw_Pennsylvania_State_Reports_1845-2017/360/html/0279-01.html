Cleveland, Ohio, to the Armstrong Cork Company’s plant at Millville, New Jersey, :on October 8, 1942. Both the chemical company and the carrier were aware that they were dealing with a dangerous chemical. On October 9, 1942, while the shipment was en route, the Armstrong Company cancelled the order and the cancellation was accepted by the chemical company; When the shipment arrived at the Millville plant of Armstrong, <em>upon the 'chemical company’s orders, </em>the truck was not unloaded but was. directed to return to Cleveland. While still en route the 20 drums arrived at the carrier’s terminal at Pittsburgh sometime between October 16 and 18, 1942. While the drums were being transferred from one truck to another, an employe of the carrier discovered a “pin hole leak” in one of the drums, which was thereupon immediately separated from the others and placed on the carrier’s dock or platform. The remaining 19 drums were delivered to the chemical company in Cleveland. Plaintiff was engaged, in the cooperage business in Pittsburgh in a building- adjoining the premises occupied by the carrier. Both the plaintiff and- the carrier used a common areaway between the two premises. After the defective drum, had remained for sometime on the carrier’s dock or platform, one of the carrier’s employes, disturbed by fumes being emitted from the drum, moved <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>the drum to the common areaway and placed it against plaintiff’s building, where it remained for at least two months before the accident. On June 4, 1943 (nearly eight months after the defective drum was left on the carrier’s premises), the carrier wrote to the chemical company requesting it to “make some disposition” of the defective drum. In the chemical company’s reply, on June 14th, it failed to order any disposition of it. Apparently the chemical company had credited Armstrong Company with the return of 19 drums of acid and regarded the defective drum as the property of Armstrong with which the chemical company had no further concern. On June 22, 1942, plaintiff, desiring to use .the space in the areaway, took hold of the drum, which was lying on its side, and rolled it towards himself. The acid had meantime eaten a large hole where the “pin hole leak” had started but which hole was not noticeable when the drum was lying on its side. The acid splashed out of the hole in the drum causing serious injury to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[294,1312,1147,753]]]'>The carrier was negligent in knowingly permitting a <em>defective drum </em>containing highly dangerous acid to lie in the common areaway without notice to plaintiff. The chemical company was also negligent in delivering acid in a defective drum — one which was not properly insulated to protect the inside of the drum against the action of this dangerous acid. The chemical company did nothing to ascertain the whereabouts of the 20th drum, after the other 19 drums had been returned to it, following its agreement to cancel the whole of the 20 drum order. Furthermore, after notice on June 4th that the defective leaking barrel of acid had been at the carrier’s place of business nearly eight months, no effort was made by the chemical company to dispose of it.</p>

It was shown that the carrier was fully aware that it was transporting hydrofluoric acid and that acid of that nature was a most dangerous substance. The carrier knew that the drum had sprung a <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>leak. It also knew, or ought to have known, that escaping acid might cause serious injury. The liability of the chemical company was also for the jury. The chemical company was aware of the dangerous character of the chemical which it was delivering to its customer. It was required to use every reasonable precaution to protect others against injury from coming in contact with such a product. As was said in <em>Fredericks v. Atlantic Refining Co., </em><a href="/pa/282/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="282 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1088422" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0008-01">282 Pa. 8</a>, 13, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.%20615" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="127 A. 615">127 A. 615</a>, “A higher degree of care is required in dealing with a dangerous agency than in the ordinary affairs of life or business, which involve little or no risk.
