The plaintiff sued to recover damages for the defendants’ breach of an alleged oral agreement said to confer upon the plaintiff a right of redemption to a certain piece of real estate <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>which one of the defendants had acquired at-a sheriff’s sale upon an execution issued on an unpaid judgment against the plaintiff in favor of the same defendant.</p>
    <p id="b517-4" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[140,436,1150,967]]]'>On May 16, 1930, W. Riley Alter, the plaintiff,-was the owner of two improved tracts of land in the city of New Kensington, Westmoreland County. One of-such properties was, known as the Alter Building; the other was a lot and dwelling. The Alter Building property was encumbered by a first mortgage to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.in the sum of $150,000 as security for a bond indebtedness originally .in .like amount whereon judgment had been entered. The property was also encumbered by .a second mortgage to The Logan Trust Company, one of the defendants, in the sum. of $20,000 as security for a bond whereon judgment had, likewise, been entered., On May 16, 1930, thé plaintiff conveyed the Alter Building property in trust to The Logan Trust Company to receive and apply the income from the- property to the payment of taxes, insurance and upkeep and in reduction of the indebtedness above mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[139,1423,1150,921]],["BL_518.1",518,[279,272,1146,97]]]'>Oh August 15, 1931, The Logan Trust Company entered into a voluntary liquidation agreement with The Logan National Bank and Trust Company, the other defendant. Thereby The Logan Trust Company assigned all' of its assets, including notes owing by the plaintiff and his bond and mortgage, to The Logan National Bank and Trust Company, the latter company assuming liability for the indebtedness of The Logan Trust -Company. In furtherance of the liquidation so provided for, the plaintiff entered into a second trust agreement, with The Logan National Bank and Trust Company on November 23, 1932. Therein, it was agreed that The Logan Trust Company should convey the title to the Alter Building property (which it held as trustee) to The Logan National Bank and Trust Company upon the same‘ terms and conditions as were contained in the original trust agreement between the plaintiff and The <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>Logan Trust Company. Both of the trust agreements contained provisions for terminating the trusts.</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[274,381,1151,806]]]'>In April of 1935 The Logan Trust Company caused an execution to issue upon its judgment against Alter and had the sheriff levy upon the Alter Building property which was duly advertised for sale and was thereafter sold at sheriff’s sale on May 3,1935, the purchaser being The Logan Trust Company. On the day prior to the sheriff’s sale, to wit, on May 2, 1935, Alter and The Logan Trust Company had entered into a written agreement whereby it was agreed that, in consideration of the trust company’s cancellation and discharge of all of Alter’s indebtedness to it (which at that time amounted to $57,453.40), Alter would not delay the sheriff’s sale and he thereby further expressly relinquished to the trust company any and all interest which he might have in the Alter Building property.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[270,1199,1151,1134]],["BL_519.1",519,[127,279,1151,699]]]'>The plaintiff bases his present action upon an alleged oral agreement which he says was entered into between him and the defendant banks, the latter acting by one Walter N. Gabel, on or about May 1, 1935. Gabel was then vice president and treasurer of The Logan Trust Company and vice president and cashier of The Logan National Bank and Trust Company. According to the terms of the oral agreement, as the plaintiff avers them, he agreed not to delay the sheriff’s sale and to relinquish any and all interest which he might have in the Alter Building property in consideration whereof the defendant banks were to cancel his indebtedness to them. It is apparent that, up to this point, the provisions of the alleged oral agreement do not differ materially from the analogous provisions of the subsequent written agreement of May 2, 1935. The appellant avers, however, that the alleged oral agreement further provided that for one year he should have the right to redeem and reacquire the Alter Building property upon assuming liability for the mortgage indebtedness owing to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and by pay<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>ing tlie defendant banks the sum of $30,000 for which the banks would transfer the title to the property in question to the plaintiff or to any purchaser he produced who would assume the first mortgage and pay the banks the sum of $30,000. The plaintiff further avers that he did produce a purchaser who was willing to satisfy the redemption conditions of the. alleged oral agreement and who would also have transferred to him a piece of real estate in Pittsburgh worth $25,000. It is in that amount that the plaintiff seeks damages in the instant suit for the defendants’ refusal and failure to perform the relevant provisions of the alleged oral agreement.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.4",519,[122,991,1154,966]]]'>At trial the plaintiff testified in substantiation of the oral agreement as pleaded; and, in cross-examination by the defendants, he identified the written agreement of May 2, 1935, between him and The Logan Trust Company. This agreement was offered by the defendants and received in evidence over the plaintiff’s objection in connection with the defendants’ cross-examination of the plaintiff. At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case, the defendants moved for a compulsory nonsuit on three grounds, viz., — (1) that the plaintiff had failed to prove Gabel’s authority to enter into the alleged oral agreement in behalf of the defendants; (2) that even if Gabel had such authority¿ the alleged oral agreement became merged in the subsequent written agreement of May 2, 1935; and (3) that the alleged oral agreement was concerned with the transfer of an interest in realty and, being parol, did not satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.</p>

In the opinion thereafter filed in support of the refusal of the plaintiff’s motion to take off the nonsuit, the learned court below based its action principally on the ground that, the plaintiff had failed to establish Gabel’s authority to make the alleged oral agreement for the defendant banks and, <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>also, to some extent on the ground that-the alleged-oral agreement had-become merged; in the written agreement of May 2, 1935.</p>
