Haverford Avenue is a heavily travelled thoroughfare forty-four feet in width, but by reason of an angle at the northwest corner of the intersection the distance between the curb lines at the corner is fifty feet. There is one trolley track on Haverford Avenue which is situate twenty-four and one-half feet north of the south curb line. It is a standard five foot, two-inch track, so that the distance between the north rail and the northwest curb is a little better than twenty feet. The defendant was driving an automobile west on Haverford Avenue at a speed of fifteen to twenty miles per hour. There is an overhanging electric light at the intersection, which light extends out from the pole on the southwest corner toward the northeast corner, and which light was lit at the time of the accident. The weather was clear and the highway dry. The view east on Haverford Avenue was unobstructed. Plaintiff testified that she had looked before leaving the south curb and then looked again when she reached the trolley track, but did not see the defendant’s car or any other motor vehicle at any time before she was struck by defendant’s automobile. When she was struck she had one foot on the north curb and one in the cartway. The lower court decided that the evidence established the applicability of the rule: “it is vain to say one looked but did not see what was obvious.” It held plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence <em>as matter of law. </em>With this we do not agree.</p>

Since a person usually walks about four miles per hour, or six feet per second (Miller v. Gault et al., <a href="/pa/345/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="345 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1213397" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0474-01">345 Pa. 474</a>, 481), she was struck approximately three seconds after she testified she. had <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>looked for the last time. At twenty miles per hour the defendant could .have travelled but fifty-seven feet, nine inches during the same interval.”</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[295,442,1154,1810]]]'>-, It concluded that the plaintiff was therefore contributorily negligent. With this we do not agree. It is a most significant fact that plaintiff was struck just one step from the north curb. She testified at p. 11a ". . <em>. </em>I put one foot on corner and one foot I have down, and the machine struck me.” She had carried the duty imposed upon her when she looked in both directions before and while crossing Haverford Avenue. Since she had reached the other side of the street before being struck, the circumstances are not so. clear that we can say <em>as matter.of law </em>that she was guilty of contributory negligence.- The defendant was charged with the duty of remaining highly vigilant at the street crossing. The jury might find that he was negligent under all the circumstances. It might also find that even if plaintiff had, or ought to have, seen defendant’s car in the distance, before or while crossing, she might have supposed that -it was safe for her to cross, especially since plaintiff was. only one step away from the curb when struck. This Court said in <em>Harrington v. Pugarelli, </em><a href="/pa/344/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="344 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1211024" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0204-01">344 Pa. 204</a>, at p. 207, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20149" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="25 A.2d 149">25 A. 2d 149</a>, in quoting from <em>Johnson v.

Applying this formula it concludes that plaintiff was struck three seconds after-she last looked. The inference is that she must have ¡stepped in front of defendant’s approaching car. But the record in <em>Miller v. Gault et al., </em>supra, discloses that the plaintiff there was a woman of forty-five years whereas the plaintiff in this case was sixty-six years old.

In that case plaintiff was found only one step from the far curb. This Court affirmed the granting of defendant’s motion for judgment n. o. v. on the ground that under the circumstances in that case plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law. Mr. Justice Linn, writing for the majority, said át p. 43: “This car was in the northernmost traffic lane, of the Avenue; that he [plaintiff] fell from it about one step from the curb when the car stopped, is explained by the fact that he was <em>carried </em>there” (emphasis supplied).</p>
