Daines applied to plaintiff, The Travellers Insurance Company, on, August 22, 1945, for a policy of insurance upon his life in the amount of $50,000, naming defendant, Heppenstall Company, his employer, as beneficiary. On September 13, 1945 plaintiff issued the policy and defendant paid the initial premium of $2,214.50. Daines died on March 29, 1946 of a coronary thrombosis. Plaintiff, after tendering a return of the premium, filed a bill in equity for cancellation of the policy.

In 1940 he had a tonsillectomy.. In 1941 he suffered from symptoms of indigestion; his physician, Dr. N. F. Fisher, diagnosed his trouble as a duodenal ulcer, to remedy which he prescribed medication and a diet; a couple of months thereafter X-rays were taken which showed that, if there had been an ulcer, it had cleared up. That same year he had an appendectomy. In 1943 he again exhibited symptoms of indigestion and hyper-acidity, and, at Dr. Fisher’s suggestions, he had an electrocardiogram taken; this, in Dr Fisher’s opinion, showed no myocardial pathology. In 1945 he suffered a dizzy spell while driving his automobile; another electrocardiogram was taken on whicih a hospital interne made a notation of “possible coronary”, but Dr. Fisher again diagnosed the condition as a mild attack of vertigo and not as evidencing any heart disturbance; Daines was in the hospital for only one day,- received no medication other than a sedative, and immediately resumed his employment. He continued - in. apparently good health and without any interruption of his work from that time until his death some eight, months later. He never had any heart pains nor showed any clinical symptoms of cardiac illness, and he had every reason to believe, when he made application for insurance in August, 1945, that he was in good health.</p>
