Their parents, Rev. John P. II. Schweitzer and Mary P. Schweitzer, were owners, as tenants by the entireties, of premises 1223 Chelten Avenue, Philadelphia, ánd lived there with their two daughters from 1925 to 1943. The father and mother then became estranged and the former left the home together with plaintiff, while the mother and defendant <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>continued to reside there. On May 5, 1946 the mother died and, two days later, the father, becoming sole owner of the premises as surviving tenant by the entireties, conveyed the premises by deed to plaintiff. Defendant refused to move from the premises and plaintiff brought the present proceedings in ejectment to obtain possession.</p>

In consideration of such loans, payments and services her mother, on April 12, 1946, less than a month before she died, signed and delivered to defendant the following writing :</p>

She alleges that shortly before her mother’s death her parents, John and Mary Schweitzer, orally agreed with one another and with defendant that, in consideration of his wife’s agreeing to have support orders which had been made against him vacated by the Municipal Court, and in consideration of defendant’s <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>agreeing to provide a home for her mother during the latter’s lifetime, John Schweitzer would convey the Chelten Avenue property to his wife or to defendant as her nominee, and Mary Schweitzer would convey to her husband a property in Wildwood, New Jersey, which was also owned by them as tenants by the entireties. Defendant further avers that her father orally authorized her mother to act as his agent in executing the “lease” of April 12, 1946, and orally agreed with defendant to lease the premises to her on the terms therein contained.</p>
    <p id="b579-3" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[124,882,1150,209]]]'>Plaintiff filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The court sustained these objections and entered judgment for plaintiff for possession of the premises. Defendant appeals.</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[124,1103,1151,964]]]'>Whether the writing of April 12, 1946 can be considered a lease is, at best, extremely doubtful. It is true that no particular form of words is necessary to constitute a lease and that any writing is sufficient which establishes the intention of one party voluntarily to dispossess himself of the premises, for a consideration, and of the other to assume the possession for a prescribed period: <em>Bussman v. Ganster, </em><a href="/pa/72/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="72 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="434759" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0285-01">72 Pa. 285</a>; <em>Davis v. Hartel, </em><a href="/pa-super/56/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="56 Pa. Super. 557" data-case-ids="442018" data-case-paths="/pa-super/56/0557-01">56 Pa. Superior Ct. 557</a>, 559. The document in question, however, would seem merely to authorize defendant to “live in the house”; the privilege thus given does not purport to convey any exclusive right of tenancy; cf. <em>Callen v. Hilty, </em><a href="/pa/14/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="14 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="405867" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0286-01">14 Pa. 286</a>, 287, 288. But even assuming that this writing does amount to a lease the question arises as to the right of Mary Schweitzer to create a lease of the premises without the authority or consent of her husband who was her co-tenant by the entireties.</p>
    <p id="b579-5" data-blocks='[["BL_579.6",579,[127,2087,1150,260]],["BL_580.1",580,[266,286,1162,1643]],["BL_581.1",581,[114,288,1147,318]]]'>The legal status and the rights inter se of tenants by the entireties have so often been enunciated by this Court that it would be a work of supererogation here to repeat them. Suffice it to say — what has been long and firmly established — that neither tenant may separately <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>dispose of any part so as to work a severance of the estate, nor encumber the property in any way. Neither spouse may convey any interest in the estate without the other’s authority or consent, nor perform any act or make any contract respecting the property which would prejudicially affect the other, for it belongs equally to both, and each has a joint right with the other to its possession, use and enjoyment during the existence of the marriage. As a corollary of these principles it follows that a lease of the property can be made only by the act of both parties joining therein, and this, of course, is especially true if it purports to be for a term extending beyond the lifetime of the spouse who executes it. Since a judgment creditor of either spouse cannot sell on execution his debtor’s interest in an estate by the entireties, and a purchaser at sheriff’s sale thereunder would not acquire any right to possession,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> it is obvious that neither husband nor wife can voluntarily put a stranger, even though a creditor, into possession, and thereby infringe the co-tenant’s rights. It is true that either spouse presumptively has the power to act for both, so long as the marriage subsists, without any specific authorization, <em>provided the fruits or proceeds of such action inure to the benefit of both,</em>

      <em> </em>and therefore if the husband or the wife undertakes to lease the property the other may, either expressly or tacitly, acquiesce therein and assert a right to share equally in the rents derived therefrom: <em>O’Malley v. O’Malley, </em><a href="/pa/272/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="272 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1068408" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0528-01">272 Pa. 528</a>, 533, 534, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20A.%20500" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="116 A. 500">116 A. 500</a>, 502, 503; <em>Gasner v.

But the situation is entirely different where, as in the present instance, the surviving spouse repudiates the action of his deceased co-tenant and does not seek to share in its benefits, the attempted lease being extremely disadvantageous to, and indeed a complete ignoring of, his own interest in the premises.</p>
