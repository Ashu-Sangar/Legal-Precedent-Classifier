    <p id="b107-17" data-blocks='[["BL_107.23",107,[132,2024,1150,315]]]'>The verdict was in favor of the defendant in an action in trespass for injuries sustained when plaintiff was struck by a Buick Sedan driven by defendant. The accident occurred on May 15, 1946 between 6:30 and 7:00 P. M. on the North side of Northampton Street between Sixth and Seventh Streets, Easton, Pa.</p>

      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>According to plaintiff’s witnesses, Ms wife, who was driving the automobile in which he was a passenger, parked the car on the north side of Northampton Street. While she remained at the wheel, plaintiff alighted from the right side of the car, walked to the rear, and stood there with his hand on the left fender looking to the right and to the left preparatory to crossing Northampton Street in order to get his “pick-up” truck on the other side, when Strausser, who was traveling west on Northampton Street, ran into him. There were no cars parked behind the car from which plaintiff alighted for at least 102 feet eastward. Plaintiff contends that he was standing about a foot away from the left rear fender and his body was in a diagonal position facing the opposite side of the street when he was struck on his left side by defendant’s automobile. He estimated defendant’s speed betwen 40 to 42 miles per hour. The momentum of the.impact was so great that, plaintiff’s body was hurled forwards and struck for a second time before defendant’s car. could come to a stop.</p>
    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[270,1369,1151,370]]]'>Defendant is charged with negligence in operating his automobile at an excessive speed, in failing to have it under proper control,, in failing to be watchful and to see the plaintiff in sufficient time to avoid striking him, in driving too closely to parked automobiles, and in otherwise failing to regard the rights and safety of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[269,1752,1149,424]]]'>Defendant denies liability and asserts that the plaintiff must have stepped directly into the path of his car ánd'fallen across the right front fender. He ádmitted he saw neither plaintiff nor his parked car before the impact, nor did he know that he struck plaintiff until he first noticed'him lying on his right front fender. A conflict in the evidence as to the nature and extent of plaintiff’s injuries also exists.</p>

Complaint is also made of the court’s failure to instruct the jury that a pedestrian intending to cross a street between intersections has a right to rely on the exercise of reasonable care by drivers on the highway and to presume that ordinary, care will be used to protect him from injury, and its failure to instruct the jury as to the evidentiary value of the admission by the defendant .of his failure to see the plaintiff before he was struck. Defendant also avers that the charge on the question of negligence was incomplete, inadequate, and misleading.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[145,935,1151,319]]]'>The issue submitted to the jury was whether plaintiff was visible and whether the defendant in the exercise of due care should have observed him, or whether plaintiff negligently walked into defendant’s car.

Plaintiff asserts that he had five witnesses to corroborate his version as to the way in which the accident occurred, while defendant called no witnesses to contradict his -testimony.

    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[282,608,1157,860]]]'>In charging the jury as to the corresponding degree of care required by motorists and pedestrians who cross streets between intersections, the trial judge stated: “Where a pedestrian traverses a street between intersections, he must exercise a higher degree of care for his safety. Motorists are correspondingly held to a less degree of care. Where a pedestrian crosses a street at an intersection, motorists must be highly vigilant and maintain sufficient control of their cars to stop at the slightest notice of danger. It is the duty of a pedestrian to look before he undertakes a street crossing and to continue to look as he proceeds, and such duty is particularly incumbent on one who traverses a street in traffic at an unauthorized crossing.” This is the law promulgated in <em>Fearn v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/320/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="320 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1163733" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0156-01">320 Pa. 156</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20534" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="182 A. 534">182 A. 534</a>.</p>

One exercising his lawful rights at a place where the exercise of like rights by others may put him in peril, is obliged to use such care for his own safety as a reasonably prudent man would employ under like circumstances. See <em>Poole v.

Man’s natural instinct of self-preservation will generally inspire in the pedestrian a due degree of caution for his own safety, when he is aware of the approach of an automobile and this the law will require him to exercise.

    <p id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[138,563,1153,698]]]'>The trial judge properly submitted the question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence to the jury. He said: “It is not contributory negligence as a matter of law for a pedestrian to step out into a street or a highway at a place other than at regular intersections. The law on that situation has been well settled by cases heretofore decided by the Supreme Court of .Pennsylvania, and it has been stated that a pedestrian cannot be held to' be negligent by the Court as a matter of law when he attempts to cross a street between the regular crossings, but, in exercising this right, he must have due regard to the conditions of the traffic before he enters the cart-way.”</p>

Where he looks but does not see an approaching automobile, or, seeing one, erroneously misjudges its speed or distance, or for some other reason assumes he could avoid injury to himself, the question is usually one for the jury.” <em>White v.
