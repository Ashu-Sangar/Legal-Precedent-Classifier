North‘Side of the City of Pittsburgh. In 1941 it purchased an additional strip of ground to the rear of its property and extending at right angles to it, of a width of 60 feet and a length of 484 feet from Faulsey Way on the north to Western Avenue on the south. ' Approximately midway on this strip, and • quite distant, therefore, from any of the surrounding streets, was a 75-year-old stable building constructed of common brick-and lime -mortar';-it was 1^2r stoines in height, extended 52'feet from <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>east to west and 25 feet from north to south, and its east wall was parallel to, and about 2 or 3 feet distant from, the rear or west wall of another factory building on Bidwell Street belonging to Arbuthnot-Stephenson Company. Palley Manufacturing Company, desiring to construct an addition to its plant on this newly acquired lot, entered into a contract with Branna Construction Corporation for that purpose, and also into a separate supplemental contract for the demolition of the stable building. On March 27, 1945, the latter work was started by Branna Construction Corporation and was completed on the fourth day, but meanwhile, on the evening of the third day, March 29, between 6:30 and 7:00 o’clock, the accident occurred which gave rise to the present litigation.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[301,1080,1149,806]]]'>It appears that the lot on which the stable was located had been used for many years by children in the neighborhood as a playground. While the work of demolition was under way a number of these children, including plaintiff John Patterson, a lad then two weeks short of 14 years of age, were in the habit, after school hours, of congregating, at one end of the lot in order to watch the operation, and, in the late afternoons after the workmen had retired, and again in the evenings, they would play around on the premises, especially in and about the partially dismantled stable building; their presence at such times was known generally to the workmen, and the official of Branna Construction Corporation who was in charge of the work had received direct information in regard thereto.</p>

At that time the work had proceeded to a point where substantially all the walls of the stable had been levelled except a part of the east wall which still stood to a height <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>variously estimated at from 10 to 15 feet. In the afternoon, and again in the evening, several of the children, as on previous occasions, entered the stable area and played on and around the remaining portions of the walls. Suddenly the accident occurred. While three of the boys stood on the top of the east wall and the Patterson lad was standing below on the inner side of the wall and about 3 or 4 feet distant from it and was talking to them, a large section of the wall suddenly collapsed and young Patterson was buried from the waist down under a mass of bricks. The result was that he was severely and permanently injured, and he, by his father as guardian, and his father in his own right, brought the present action against Palley Manufacturing Company and Branna Construction Corporation to recover damages. At the close of the trial the court gave binding instructions in favor of Palley Manufacturing Company, and its action in so doing is not contested by any of the other parties. The jury returned verdicts against Branna Construction Corporation in the sum of $10,000 for the minor and $2,500 for the father. A motion of Branna Construction Corporation for judgment n. o. v. being overruled, that defendant now appeals, while plaintiffs also appeal from a refusal by the court to grant motions which they filed for a new trial because of alleged inadequacy of the verdicts.</p>

This danger resulted from the fact that, in the course of the demolition, bricks had fallen or been thrown into the narrow space between the east wall of the stable and the rear wall of the Arbuthnot-Stephenson building to a height equal to that of the east wall as it then stood. An expert <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>builder and wrecker who testified on behalf of plaintiffs stated that it was negligence on the part of the workmen to throw the bricks, or allow them to fall, in this narrow space, since their weight,- massed in that position, would exert a pressure against the wall itself; that weight and resulting pressure were greatly augmented by-the absorption of the rain-water by the porous bricks; moreover the wall would naturally have been softened and weakened by the rainfall upon it tending to pulverize the mortar; there was also testimony that the workmen had scraped or chipped a section of the entire length of the wall, at a height of about three or four-inches above the ground, with mattocks,- sledge hammers and crowbars. - The effect of all these circumstances was, ■ according to the-expert, that the collapse of the wall might readily have been anticipated. Since Branna Construction Corporation had been put on notice that children had each evening been playing on and around this wall and it had every reason to believe that they would do so again on that evening with likely danger to themselves, plaintiffs' justly contend that defendant’s- liability for the accident which happened was thereby established.</p>

Although a new trial was granted the defendant for other reasons, it was there decided that the owner of the building of which the wall had formed a part could be held liable in damages for the accident if negligence in regard to the proper maintenance of the wall in a safe condition was-proved. That case differs in several respects from'this one'but in many of its features is not dissimilar, and it throws at least some light upon the legal'problems here involved.

The answer is that it should have placed a guard or watchman upon the premises in order to see to it that the children remained away from the vicinity of the wall in the dangerous condition in which it was then standing; while the children might, of course, have evaded a watchman’s vigilance defendant at least would then have done its duty and not been remiss by failing to take all reasonable measures to prevent their being injured. Or, in the alternative, it should, after the rain had ceased, have immediately torn down the remainder of the wall instead of leaving it in its dangerous condition until the following morning when it did complete the work of demolition.
