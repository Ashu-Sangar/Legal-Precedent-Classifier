The injunction was granted on the ground <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>that the picketing was for an unlawful purpose. The decree is supported by facts found on sustaining evidence. No witnesses were called by the defendants though one of them, Rocco Locantore, the union’s business agent, was called by the plaintiffs as for cross-examination.</p>

L. 1198, 43 PS §206a, as amended in 1939, P. L. 302, 43 PS §206d, or by the Labor Relations Act of 1937, P. L. 1168, 43 PS §211.1.

There was no controversy between plaintiffs and their employes. A majority of them were not members of a labor union and did not wish to become members. The plaintiffs had no objection to any of their employes joining any union and offered no objection to defendants’ effort to persuade them to join a union. Defendant union did not represent any of plaintiffs’ employes. In April or May, 1947, the defendant, Rocco Locantore, the defendant union’s business agent, submitted to plaintiffs for execution a form of contract to govern plaintiffs’ relations with their employes and requiring plaintiffs to employ only union employes; Locantore informed plaintiffs that if they did not execute the contract picketing would result. <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Plaintiffs, desiring not to coerce their employes declined to comply with Locantore’s request and the picketing followed as threatened. Pickets obstructed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> plaintiffs’ doorways “so as to hinder customers’ entrances thereto.” “42. A fist fight occurred between one of the pickets and customers of plaintiffs’ place of business at the hotel. 43. One of the pickets used vile and abusive language to and threatened to ‘get’ one of the plaintiffs’ employes.” The court also found that “sellers and suppliers of foods, soft drinks, beer and services have, as a result of the picketing, refused to make deliveries to plaintiffs at their place of business although prior [to the picketing] deliveries were regularly made.”</p>

Such a purpose is clearly unlawful and subject to restraint: see sec. 13, Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, 12 PS §1221; 17 PS §§281, 282, 2082, and the Act of February 14, 1857, P.

E. 2d 685</a> (1942) as appears in the following extracts from the opinion of the court: “The defendants contend, however, that, even though the contract be invalid, it is the function of the commission and not of the .courts to set it aside, because the commission is given exclusive jurisdiction by G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 150 A. §6(a), to bring proceedings to prevent unfair labor practices. We are of opinion, however, that by refusing <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>to enforce the contract the judge did not infringe the jurisdiction of the commission. It was appropriate to consider the question of the validity of the contract in determining whether it should be enforced, and there is nothing in the labor relations act restricting that inherent power of a court of equity. See Devon Knitwear Co. Inc. v. Levinson, 173 Misc. (N. Y.) 779, 781 [<a href="/citations/?q=19%20N.Y.S.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="19 N.Y.S.2d 102">19 N. Y. S. 2d 102</a>]; 2 Teller, Labor Disputes and Collective Bargaining, §271, and cases cited.” Later in the opinion the court says: “To conform to the defendants’ demands, compliance with which they sought to effect by picketing, it is manifest that the plaintiff would have to engage in an unfair labor practice as defined by the statutes just referred to, and in contravention thereof to discharge over three fourths of the employees involved, and to bargain with the defendants under the contract in question, which was of no force and effect, and to refuse to bargain with the certified representative of the employees as determined in the proceedings of the commission and as required in <em>law; </em>in brief, to do something it cannot legally do.” See, also, <em>Fashioncraft, Inc. v.
