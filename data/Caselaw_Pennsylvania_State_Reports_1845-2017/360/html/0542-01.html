Competency of these documents to prove this fact is not affected by the failure of congress or the legislature of this Commonwealth to decree their admissibility. Naturalization records have been relied upon to establish an insured’s age: <em>Hervitz v.

Her prior testimony that he was born in 1891 is of little weight for the source of her information was insured’s statement to her, which was hearsay. The finding of the chancellor that the date of birth was February 1,1886, was affirmed by the court <em>en banc, </em>is amply supported by the evidence and has the force and effect of the verdict of a jury. It cannot be held that, the finding was arbitrary or capricious and it will not be disturbed. Equally supported is the finding that the date, February 1, 1891, was given by insured with intent to defraud the insurer and, to secure an undue advantage.</p>
