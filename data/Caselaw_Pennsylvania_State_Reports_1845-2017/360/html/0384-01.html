    <p id="b409-11" data-blocks='[["BL_409.17",409,[101,1390,1155,746]]]'>This was an action in trespass against the City of Philadelphia to recover for serious and permanent injuries sustained as the result of a fall allegedly caused by the formation of ice on the public sidewalk near the southeast corner of the intersection of 18th and Vine Streets. The case was twice tried. At the first trial the jury disagreed and was discharged. On the second trial the jury returned a verdict against the City in the amount of $20,000 following a charge by the trial judge to which no exception is taken. Motions filed by the City for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>and for á new! trial were overruled by the court below and judgment was entered on the verdict. . The City appeals, assigning for error the refusal of its motion for a hew trial.</p>

On the second trial appellee testified that he “squirmed around” after his fall, moving “approximately a couple feet.” Another witnesss, residing at the time near the northeast corner of the intersection and who was not present at the first trial, testified that she had observed appellee on the pavement and that “he was pulling himself, dragging himself around” in the direction of the place where he was picked up according to the records of the police.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[299,815,1148,317]]]'>Appellant states the question involved as follows: “Where a plaintiff at a second trial, held because the first jury disagreed, changes his testimony on material matters affecting liability to match the story of a surprise witness who had not been present at the first trial, is defendant entitled to a new trial?”</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[300,1143,1148,1023]]]'>As said in <em>Koch v.

But in any event, since the sole reason now advanced was not among the reasons assigned in the court below, we may not consider it. In <em>Dugan v.
