Miller, one of the defendants, complains that the court refused to set aside service of the amended bill in equity on appellant in Allegheny County made pursuant to an order of the court in Clarion County in which the suit is pending. The defendants are Rimersburg Coal Company, a corporation, Harry F. Miller, George Miller and J. J. Miller. The amended bill was served on the coal company and George Miller in Clarion County on July 19, 1944, a service which is not challenged. It is unnecessary to describe the suit further than to say that plaintiffs pray relief by injunction and account on aver<a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>ments of the individual defendants’ misrepresentations and fraudulent conduct and tbe wrongful acquisition of the capital stock of Rimersburg Coal Company. The averments of the amended bill, to which our consideration at this stage of the record is limited, show that George Miller is one of the principal defendants: compare <em>Whittaker v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/301/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="301 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1126470" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0410-01">301 Pa. 410</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%20670" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="152 A. 670">152 A. 670</a> (1930). There is no question of the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter of the suit, that is, the power of the court to enter upon a judicial inquiry into the fraudulent conduct alleged by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs obtained leave on August 1,1944, to serve the amended bill in Allegheny County, on the defendants residing in that county. Thereafter, the committee in lunacy of Harry F. Miller, appointed since this suit was brought, and J. J. Miller were served. The committee, by a de bene esse appearance and appropriate motion, challenged the service. The court below denied the motion but gave no reasons for the action, apparently ignoring our Rule 58.</p>

The suit is pending in Clarion County. One of the principal defendants has been served in that county. The appellant resides in and was served in Allegheny County, in this Commonwealth. The right of the legislature to provide for such extraterritorial service within the Commonwealth is settled; the question was considered and decided in <em>Mid-City Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Myers et al., </em><a href="/pa/343/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="343 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1208303" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0465-01">343 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20420" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="23 A.2d 420">23 A. 2d 420</a> (1942), a case not considered in appellant’s brief: see also <em>Landis v.

It is unnecessary to repeat what was said in the <em>Mid-City Bank </em>case, which fully answers appellant’s contention. The decision in <em>Com. v. Lutz, </em><a href="/pa/359/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="359 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="473116" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0427-01">359 Pa. 427</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.2d%2024" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="60 A.2d 24">60 A. 2d 24</a> (1948), relied on by appellant, is not ¡inconsistent with those cases because in that case no principal defendant was served in Schuylkill County, wheré the bill was filed and leave to make extraterritorial service was asked.</p>
