After termination of the federal regulations, the Pennsylvania Milk Control Commission<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> on November 1, 1945, published orders continuing these restrictions. The original orders of the Commission became effective November 1, 1945, and expired on April 30, 1946. Prior to expiration the commission held a hearing to determine the advisability of continuing the orders. Appellants appeared before the commission on behalf of 51 <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>local unions representing, for purposes of collective bargaining, persons employed in the delivery of milk throughout the Commonwealth and also on behalf of local union No. 463, representing dairy employes in the Philadelphia area.</p>

The reasons for this order seem to have been the continued existence of equipment shortages and the decrease in cost to distributors (and also to the consumer) resulting from restricted deliveries. Before the' commission the unions contended that the subject matter of deliveries should not be regulated by governmental agencies but should be left to the processes of collective bargaining. Evidence was adduced that returning veterans were being absorbed into employee force but that failure to return to everyday delivery threatened to create an excess labor pool.</p>

The appeal, being a joint appeal, is not saved by setting up an agent to take the appeal. The statute confers the right of appeal upon “any person aggrieved.” The appellants have taken a joint appeal. As the statute does not provide for a joint appeal, their appeal is unauthorized and for that reason may be quashed. As we agree with the learned court below that appellants are not aggrieved and therefore not entitled to appeal we shall not quash merely because the joint appeal is unauthorized; we prefer, in the circumstances, to treat the case as though appellants had elected to discontinue as to all but a single appellant as was done in <em>Schuetz’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/315/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="315 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1156673" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0105-01">315 Pa. 105</a>, 113, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20865" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="172 A. 865">172 A. 865</a>, 868 (1934).</p>

Will you state what your interest is in these proceedings? A. Our' interest in the proceedings is first to make clear as far as the federation is concerned we have no objection to a continuation of the every-other-day delivery as we understand it, but rather to register an objection to any governmental agency attempting to regulate anything that is normally handled through the processes of collective bargaining. Q. And you feel that matters relating to the days upon which a man can work and the length of their work week and other factors relating to hours and working conditions are purely within the field of free collective bargaining? A. Very definitely.” But that interest in this proceeding is obviously not a direct interest, but an interest that is too remote to constitute a person aggrieved; it is not an interest that at the time the order was made was the subject of pecuniary consideration to appellants in any collective bargaining then in process; it may never become a subject of such consideration and therefore does not constitute a substantial interest in this proceeding affecting appellants. As the learned court below pointed out, “Here, the general order appealed from is capable of directly affecting only ‘Persons engaged in business as milk dealers, handlers or distributors’, ‘consumers’ and producers. Therefore, any effect which it may have upon persons employed by milk dealers, handlers and distributors individually, or upon their representative union, is a remote consequence of the order and is therefore indirect and incidental ...”</p>
