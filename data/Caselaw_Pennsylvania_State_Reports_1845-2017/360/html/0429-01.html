N. “Ab” Young Company, appellant, a Pennsylvania corporation, owned 15 lots of ground in Mt. <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>Lebanon Township, Allegheny County, plotted on a recorded plan of lots. All the lots are included within District U-2 Class A of township ordinance No. 594. Such classification permits the erection of dwellings designed for occupancy by not more than two families. <em>In the fall of 1946 </em>appellant was granted a building permit and constructed seven double dwellings wholly or in part on lots Nos. 31 to 34 inclusive, numbered Nos. 488 to 500 inclusive. In. this erection the lines of the plotted lots were disregarded but it is conceded that the buildings conform to ordinance No. 594.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[278,886,1147,317]]]'>On <em>March 27, 1947, </em>appellant applied for a permit to erect a double house <em>on lot 81, </em>which already had parts of premises Nos. 488 and 490 thereon. The permit was at first granted by the inspector but was later revoked by the board on April 17, 1947. No appeal was taken by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[273,1215,1150,807]]]'>On <em>May 1, 1947, </em>ordinance No. 1380, amending ordinance No. 594, was introduced before the township commissioners. <em>The amendment provided that not more than one building should be erected upon separate and distinct numbered lots. </em>Statutory notice and publication were made. On <em>June 5, 1947, </em>appellant again applied for a permit for the same structure on the same lot. On <em>July 10, 1947,. </em>the board again refused the permit. Its action was predicated, inter alia., upon the fact that <em>an amendatory zoning ordinance was then pending. </em>The effective date of the amendatory ordinance was <em>July 28, 1947. </em>It is conceded that the proposed building would violate the zoning ordinance No. 1380, because lot No. 31, in, addition to the. proposed building, would have erected upon it parts of buildings No. 488 and No. 490.</p>
    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[273,2032,1147,260]]]'>Appellant contends that because it had filed its application for a permit <em>prior to the effective date of the amendatory ordinance </em>it acquired a vested right to secure the permit, which right could not be taken away retroactively.</p>

      <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>It is well established in this Commonwealth that where an applicant for a building-permit complies with the laws in effect at the date of application, -and is granted a permit, and proceeds in. good faith to incur obligations and to build in reliance thereon, the authorities may not revoke the permit because of subsequent changes by amendment made or proposed: <em>Herskovits et ux. v. Irwin et </em>al., <a href="/pa/299/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="299 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1122268" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0155-01">299 Pa. 155</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.%20195" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="149 A. 195">149 A. 195</a>. Chief Justice Moschzisker said in that case, p. 162: “. . . a property interest arises where, after permit granted, a landowner begins construction of a building and incurs liability for future work.” In that case the applicant had expended substantial sums in reliance on a <em>preliminary permit </em>issued.to him. It was held that the refusal to grant a .“final” permit, because of a subsequent ordinance, could not be sustained. In <em>Gold v. Building Committee of Warren Borough et al., </em><a href="/pa/334/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="334 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="1190748" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0010-01">334 Pa. 10</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 A.2d 367">5 A. 2d 367</a>, an application was made for a permit to erect a gasoline station on a designated lot which, on the date of application, complied with the borough's zoning law. The application was refused because there was pending an ordinance which would prohibit the erection of such a structure on such lot. Application was made to the court of common pleas for. a mandamus against the borough building committee compelling them to issue the permit. The court refused to award the writ of mandamus, despite the. fact that the ordinance was passed during the proceedings but before the decree. In that case no improvements had been made on the lot or any money expended in connection therewith. See: <em>Ventresca v. Exley, </em><a href="/pa/358/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="358 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="8845076" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0098-01">358 Pa. 98</a>, 103, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20210" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="56 A.2d 210">56 A. 2d 210</a>.

Unlike the facts, in <em>Herskovits v.
