Earlier, in the 15th century, witnesses not only could not be compelled to come to court and testify but were barred by the law which, regarded them as officious meddlers and provided a civil action of maintenance against them. <em>Holdsworth, History of English Law, </em>3d ed., vol. I, p. 335, vol. III, p. 398; <em>Thayer on </em>Evidence, 124-9; 8 <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>3d ed., section 2190. The practice of compulsory attendance was evolved in chancery and the common law- courts' to meliorate the harsh doctrine of maintenance; the theory being that an action would not lie where attendance was compelled by law. The concept of duty.tq testify appeared later. See <em>Dobson v. Crew, </em>Cro. Eliz. 705, 78 Eng. Rep. 940 (1599).</p>
