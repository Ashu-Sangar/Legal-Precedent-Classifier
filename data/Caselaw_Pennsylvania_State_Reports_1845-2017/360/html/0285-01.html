The amendment of 1939 by section 602.1 directed how unused and unnecessary school lands and buildings should be <em>sold. </em>Under the Act of 1939, <em>the board of school directors </em>is given the choice of three methods of sale: (a) <em>by public auction </em>conducted by a licensed auctioneer, <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>after specified notice, posting and publication (b) <em>upon sealed </em>bids, with similar notice, posting and publication and (c) <em>at private </em>sale, with approval of court.

The term of the lease was fifteen months. It contained an option to the lessee to purchase for $15,000. On July 9, 1947, the Board petitioned the court of common pleas for approval of a sale to the lessee for $15,000. The court fixed a hearing for August 5, 1947, and directed statutory notice, posting and advertising. At the hearing counsel <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>appeared, for the Greek; Catholic Church of the Holy Ghost atMcKees Rocks and made an offer of $16,000. On the following day* August 6thj the church filed.a petition “for leave to bid” $16,000. On August 28th Lee. Kozell presented- his petition to purchase the premises for $16,750. On' September 3,- 1947, -the church filed an amended,or supplemental'petition increasing its “bid” to $17,000. On September 10, 1947, Lee Kozell filed another bid of $17,250. On September 17,1947, the court directed-the Board to convey the premises to the church Upon receipt of .$17,000; Adelaide Mae Kozell and Lee Kozell filed'exceptions. After a hearing the court dismissed, the exceptions.. The School .Board was directed to comply with the court’s order of September 17, 1947, ordering a private sale to the church at $17,000.

Fiduciaries , in- possession of such estates aré under the court’s direct supervision. When a statute requires a <em>court </em>to direct or approve a sale of real estate in such estates, the Fiduciaries Act either expressly or by necessary implication places the duty of making o.r approving sales upon the <em>court </em>and requires <em>it </em>to receive and consider bids. The Fiduciaries Act does not apply, however, where the <em>fiduciary </em>makes a contract <em>not requiring approval by the court </em>and after the sale a higher offer is presented.

Courts, in the absence of statutory provision, do not possess the control and supervision of assets of school districts. The legislature has delegated to <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>the board of directors of-the. school district the duty, inter alia, of purchasing and selling the real estate for the school districts. The sole restriction placed upon such power is when <em>the board </em>sells unused and unnecessary school lands and buildings <em>at private sale. </em>The legislature has imposed, limitations on. such a sale. Before the school board may consummate a <em>private </em>sale of such real estate, approval of the court must first be obtained. But the Act does not impose the duty on the court to make the sale.. That duty rests with the <em>board. </em>The sole function of the court is to approve or disapprove the proposed private sale.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[137,940,1150,372]]]'>As above indicated the board petitioned the court to approve a private sale to Adelaide Mae Kozell for $15,000. At the hearing higher offers in the form of bids were made to the <em>court. </em>The attitude of the school board is reflected by its counsel when he said (p. 88a) that the board would “stand by” whatever the court decided as the board took a “middle of the road position”.</p>
    <p id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[136,1319,1149,586]]]'>This procedure was erroneous. It is the <em>board </em>which makes the sale and not the court. The court properly refused to approve a private sale to Adelaide Mae Kozell for $15,000 because of substantially higher offers. Such increased offers clearly indicated that $15,000 was not an adequate price. Having refused ,to approve, the <em>board, </em>and pot the <em>court, </em>should have renegotiated the sale or, in lieu of a private sale, the <em>board </em>might, in the existing circumstances, expose the premises to <em>public-sale </em>or receive <em>sealed bids. </em>This is for the board’s decisión and not the court’s.</p>

In this connection the court may consider the adequacy of an increased offer and require a sufficiently guaranteed assurance, if approval is denied, that any such substantially increased offer will be made to the <em>board </em>when the premises are again offered by it either at private sale, public sale, or upon sealed bids.</p>
