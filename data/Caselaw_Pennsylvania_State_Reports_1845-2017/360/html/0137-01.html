Green, a young woman, who lived alone in a first floor apartment in Pottstown, Montgomery County, was found murdered shortly before two o’clock on the afternoon of Monday, December 9,1946. When her body was discovered by other tenants of the building, she was lying on her left side upon her bed, clothed only in a short polo coat and bobby socks. A kimono had been placed carefully at the back of the body, presumably to keep it from <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>rolling to the floor. Death was due to strangulation, caused by a woman’s blue scarf being folded into a band about one inch wide and tightly tied in a square knot around her neck. There was blood on her face and teeth, as well as on the pillowslip, sheet, spread, coat, socks and scarf. There was also a bloody impression, resembling the shape of a hand, upon the sheet about the center of the bed. Small amounts of blood were also found on the floor of the living room and in the bath tub. All of this blood, upon examination, was found to be of the same type of human blood as that of deceased. Money in the apartment was not disturbed. There was no evidence of a struggle and everything in the apartment appeared to be in order. Her working clothes were neatly folded over a chair in the bedroom. A screen and a metal grating on the outside of the bedroom window had been removed. The front door and the bedroom window were open. Dr. W. L. Franck was called immediately by the police, and, upon his arrival within a few minutes, he examined deceased and pronounced her dead from strangulation. However, because the police officer who had called Dr. Franck to the scene thought that Mrs. Green might still be alive, inasmuch as there was some blood, mucus and air coming from her right nostril, the body was sent to the Homeopathic Hospital in Pottstown. There Dr. Franck again examined the remains and made the same pronouncement. It was this physician’s professional opinion (based upon the facts that there was no odor of putrefaction in the bedroom, the amount of air escaping from the lungs and the consistency of the blood and mucus in the nasal fossa when the body was first examined by him) that Mrs. Green had been dead for a period of not much more than twelve hours. Dr. J. S. Simpson, the coroner’s physician, performed an autopsy upon the body at seven o’clock that same evening. He found that the neck had been broken and that death was due to strangulation. He concluded <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>that death had occurred not less than twelve or more than twenty-four hours prior to his examination, predicating his opinion upon the following facts: that there was no putrefaction in the lower right abdomen, the amount of rigidity then in the arms, and the temperature and general condition of the body when he performed the autopsy.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[282,679,1153,1682]],["BL_165.1",165,[137,272,1152,757]]]'>Defendant, a married man residing with his wife and child in nearby Kennilwortli, was arrested at a club in Pottstown at about seven-thirty on the evening of the day the body was found. After making many false, conflicting and evasive statements, he finally, when faced with evidence which apparently he thought was insurmountable, admitted the following: He had had an adulterous relationship with Mrs. Green for a period of approximately two years prior to her death, that he had visited her apartment on numerous occasions, that they had drunk heavily at various hotels and taverns, and that he had had intercourse with her as late as December 2, 1946. He had caused her to be pregnant in the Spring of 1946 and an abortion had been committed. Mrs. Green had told him on December 4, 1946, that she had just received her divorce and that she was “going-out and flit like a bird” two nights hence when he, defendant, was away on a hunting trip. He admitted that he had a violent temper, and that he had threatened Mrs. Green that if she ever went out with another man, he “would take her and tear her private parts out”. He also stated that he had made advances to his wife about a divorce, offering her their home and twenty dollars a week, but that she refused to discuss the matter with him. He admitted he had a quarrel with Mrs. Green about a week before her body was found. He also admitted that he had gone to the Green apartment at eleven o’clock on Sunday night, December 8, 1946, gained entrance with a key which she had given him sometime previously, and, immediately upon turning on the light, discovered her dead body. He claimed, however, that he <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>had nothing whatever to do with her death, did not touch the body, and that as soon as he made the discovery, he turned out the light and left, shutting the door behind him. He also admitted that when he was in the apartment at that time he did go into the bedroom and he said: “I walked to the side of the bed and stood about the middle of her body. I said, ‘Oh, my God’, and that is when I put my hand on the bed and that is where the handprint will be about the middle of the body. I then left.” He acknowledged his ability to tie various types of knots, including a square one, and admitted teaching others so to do. Also, he stated that shortly after noon of the day the body was found, he had thrown the key to the Green apartment into the Schuylkill River.</p>
    <p id="b165-3" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[140,1042,1151,803]]]'>The Commonwealth also presented evidence that the scarf with which the murder was committed was lost about midnight, December 6, by its owner, one Joyce Mogel, in the immediate vicinity of the place where defendant admittedly parked his car when he visited the apartment on the night of December 8. In addition, the Commonwealth established that the lights were seen burning in the kitchen and bathroom of the Green apartment and the blinds were drawn at eleven-thirty P. M., December 8; and that defendant’s fingernail scrapings, taken shortly after he was apprehended by the police, showed the presence of human blood. Defendant said nothing whatever to the police about his visit to the apartment on the night of December 8 and his discovery there until sometime after his arrest.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[139,1866,1152,478]],["BL_166.1",166,[281,274,1153,1900]]]'>Defendant contended that Mrs. Green was not killed on the night of Sunday, December 8, or early the folloAVing morning, as contended by the Commonwealth, but rather met her death two days prior to that time, and that he had an alibi from the late afternoon of December 5 until his admitted visit to the Green apartment at eleven o’clock on Sunday night, December 8, when he discovered the dead body of Mrs. Green. In support of his contention, defendant produced evidence that Mrs. <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Green was last seen during the early evening of Friday, December 6; that one of the tenants of the upstairs apartment knocked on her door the morning of December 8 and received no reply; that she did not visit her mother in Reading or call her there on December 7 or 8, as was her custom each week-end; and that she did not go to work on December 7. Defendant also offered evidence that he was on a hunting trip some two hundred miles from Pottstown from the late afternoon of December 5 until early the morning of December 8 and he also accounted for his whereabouts thereafter until his admitted visit to the Green apartment on the night of December 8. In view of defendant’s many damaging admissions and the other evidence adduced by the Commonwealth, the jury may have concluded, as its verdict would indicate, that over this particular week-end of December 7 and 8, Mrs. Green, who frequently had not been seen by her neighbors for weeks at a time, may have gone away on a visit or may have secluded herself in her own apartment for reasons of her own, and not having a telephone in her apartment, found it inconvenient to call her mother. Defendant called Charles D. R. Kent, the undertaker who received the body on December 9 at about eleven o’clock, P. M., after it had been autopsied and embalmed. This witness, in an attempt to refute the testimony of Doctors Franck and Simpson, called by the Commonwealth, stated that he was of the opinion that Mrs. Green had been dead forty-eight to seventy-two hours from the time when he received the body. In rebuttal, however, the Commonwealth called John S. Frain, the undertaker who witnessed Dr. Simpson’s performance of the autopsy and who had embalmed the body, and he stated that it was impossible to determine to any degree of certainty the time of death after a body had been autopsied and embalmed.</p>

With this contention we cannot agree. Inasmuch as the Commonwealth was unable to produce any eye-witness to the crime and since defendant did not confess to the actual killing, the evidence adduced by the Commonwealth was wholly circumstantial. A careful reading of such evidence reveals that it is more than ample to sustain this conviction of defendant. While none of the facts presented would be conclusive of his guilt when individually considered, yet there is no doubt in our minds that the evidence presented, when considered collectively, required that the case be submitted to the jury.</p>

As long ago as Commonwealth v.

But that consequence does not necessarily follow. Circumstantial evidence is, in the abstract, nearly, though perhaps not altogether, as strong as positive evidence; in the concrete, it may be infinitely stronger.’ See also Commonwealth v.

Nor may we say, as a matter of law, that the guilt of the accused has not been sufficiently established to carry the case to the jury merely because of a remote possibility that the evidence, or some part of it, might be true and the accused still be innocent. The requirement of the law is that in order to warrant a conviction the facts and circumstances proved must be of such character as to produce a moral cer<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>tainty of the guilt of the accused beyond any reasonable doubt — not that they need be absolutely incompatible with his innocence — and that doubt is for the jury unless the evidence ‘be so weak and inconclusive that as a matter of law no probability of fact can be drawn from the combined circumstances’: Commonwealth v. DuBoise, <a href="/pa/269/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="269 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1063554" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0169-01">supra, 174</a>. See also Commonwealth v.

We also have defendant’s own admissions that he was at the scene of the crime at or about the very time when two reputable physicians, called by the Commonwealth, stated that deceased had met her death; and that on the occasion of that very visit he had put his handprint on the bed sheet at the exact spot where the bloody impression, resembling the shape of a hand, was found. J. E. Burke, Federal Bureau of Investigation finger print examiner, testifying for the Commonwealth, stated that upon his examination of this bloody mark, he found it impossible to obtain a “lift” containing sufficient characteristic details to compare it with defendant’s hand or palm print because of the porous nature of the bed sheet. If this bloody print was made by the hand of defendant being laid upon the sheet, it is obvious that such print could not have been made unless the blood of deceased <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>was upon his hand at the time. This would also account for the blood under his finger nails. We also have defendant’s admission that he fled from the apartment, knowing that she was dead, and that he thereafter deliberately, to divert suspicion, threw away the key with which he had gained entrance to the apartment, entered into a conspiracy with his wife to say that he first learned of Mrs. Green’s death at seven o’clock on the evening of December 9, and evaded revealing to the police, until after his arrest, the facts as to his visit to the Green apartment on the night of December 8 and of his discovery there. The jury could reasonably infer from the fact that the apartment was in order when the body was found and that it showed no evidence of a struggle that deceased was alive and expecting defendant when he arrived at her apartment on Sunday night, December 8, and also that after committing the killing, he sought to avoid suspicion by removing the screen and grating and opening the door and bedroom window.</p>

In these statements, defendant first denied and then gradually in later statements, admitted, among other things, more and more as to his presence and actions during his visit to the Green apartment on Sunday night. Less than an hour after his arrest, defendant made his first statement, wherein he freely admitted his meretricious relationship Avith Mrs. Green; said that he feared his Avife was becoming aware of such association; denied that he went to the Green apartment on December 8; stated that he left a club in Pottstown and went directly home that night, arriving there at eleven-fifteen; denied that he had a key to the apartment of Mrs. Green; stated that she was never pregnant to his knowledge; and said that he did not know of her death until told by a service station OAvner about a half hour before his arrest on Monday <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>evening, December 9. Some twenty-six hours later, while still in custody, defendant made a second statement, in which he admitted that he did not go directly home from the club on the night of December 8, but rather went to the apartment of Mrs. Green; that the door jarred open as he was about to knock; that he went in, turned on the light, saw the dead body of Mrs. Green and ran out without going into the bedroom; and that he told his wife the following day about this visit and what he found. He made a third statement about twenty-five minutes later, in which he reiterated visiting the apartment of Mrs. Green on the night of December 8, stated that he was only there ten seconds, and that he did not go into the bedroom or bath but only went to the bedroom door. In this statement, he also stated that he had had a key to the apartment but had returned it to Mrs. Green two or three weeks before. Here, for the first time, he said that he did not touch the body, and he also said that he and his wife had no agreement between them as to the story they were to tell to the police with reference to this murder. Forty-five minutes later, defendant gave his fourth statement, wherein he admitted that he did have a key and had used it to gain admission to the apartment on the night of December 8, and that he had thrown it into the Schuylkill River at about noon when he, his wife and sister-in-law were crossing the bridge about one o’clock on the afternoon of December 9. The next morning, December 11, at about eleven o’clock, in the office of the District Attorney, defendant gave his fifth statement, wherein he stated that he had been drinking at a club in Pottstown on December 8 from seven to eleven o’clock, P. M., that he was then pretty hazy, and that when he entered the Green apartment that night, he did go into the bedroom and put his hand on the bed, leaving a handprint. In his sixth statement, made that same morning about forty-five minutes later, defendant reiterated what he had said in his fifth statement, and also admitted putting his hand on the bed at about the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>middle thereof and he actually diagrammed his position beside the body, and where his hand was placed. In his seventh statement, made on January 6, 1947, defendant first denied the pregnancy of Mrs. Green, and then admitted it and also stated that they had discussed abortion and even suicide. He also admitted that he and Mrs. Green had arguments, that he had lots of girls, that he had a bad temper and that he had struck girls across the neck while playing tennis. In this statement, defendant admitted also that he and his wife, whom defendant had informed at noon on December 9 of his visit to the Green apartment the previous night, had agreed to say seven o’clock the night of December 9 was the first time they knew of the murder; that he had asked his wife for a divorce and that she had refused to listen to him, although he had agreed to give her his house and Wenty dollars a week. Defendant made his eighth statement shortly after making his seventh, and it is largely repetitious.</p>

That case readily can be distinguished from the instant one. There, the factual situation was entirely different from that here. In that case we were unanimously agreed that defendant’s conviction was based on evidence so weak and inconclusive that as a matter of law no probability of fact could possibly be drawn from the combined circumstances. Here, however, the very reverse of that is true. This defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree on evidence which, though wholly circumstantial, leaves no reasonable doubt in our minds as to his guilt. To hold that the evidence here presented did not warrant the submission of this case to the jury would be almost tantamount to a complete elimination of convictions <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>based entirely upon circumstantial evidence, however strong and conclusive.</p>

He assigns as error, inter alia, the admission in evidence, over the objection of his counsel, of the following: certain photographs taken of the scene of the crime as reconstructed by the police some time subsequent to the killing; photographs of the body of the deceased; the statement of defendant made on January 6, 1947; and of testimony that deceased was pregnant by defendant in the early part of 1946.

Furthermore, these photographs were proved and identified by the photographer who took them. We agree with the learned court below that: “While the weight of the testimony might be affected by the fact that the foundation had to be laid by Officer Hahn, yet in view of his explanation to the jury we feel that they were competent evidence.” Under the circumstances, we do not believe the trial court abused its discretion in admitting these pictures.</p>

They were offered better to enable the jurors to understand the appearance of the body when found, the clothing then upon it, and the position of the scarf used in the killing. These photographs were referred to by Dr. Simpson and other witnesses for the Commonwealth to explain and corroborate their testimony. It is conceded they were not pleasant to look at. At the time they were received in evidence, the learned trial court instructed the jury as follows: <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>“However horrible a crime may have taken place, as shown by these pictures, does not indicate the guilt of this defendant.

Wentzel found himself enmeshed in a set of circumstances which raised a <em>suspicion </em>of his guilt, but each of these circumstances is consistent with his innocence. There is no rule in law or in logic that <em>several </em>suspicious circumstances, <em>each one of which </em>is consistent with the innocence of an accused, becomes proof of guilt when they are <em>considered together. </em>Four or five times <em>nothing </em>is <em>still nothing. </em>In this case it is impossible to find a single fact cited against the accused which is not consistent with his innocence. The fact that Wentzel was in this woman’s room a few minutes after 11:00 P. M., Sunday, December 8,1946, and found her dead and did not report that fact to the police was just as consistent with the theory that he did not wish to have his affair with this woman made known in the locality in which he lived as it is with the theory that he was her murderer. All the evidence indicates (as we will point out) that this woman had been murdered <em>forty-eight hours before Wentzel found her dead. </em>If a man came home and found his <em>wife </em>murdered, he would naturally report it immediately to the authorities, but if he went to the apartment of a woman with whom he had maintained adulterous relations for two years and found <em>her </em>murdered, he might hesitate to report it to the authorities lest the question would be propounded to him, “What were <em>you </em>doing in her apartment at 11:00 o’clock at night?” Wentzel probably calculated that Mrs. Green’s neighbors would find her murdered and report that fact (as they did do on the next day), and as he himself said, he expected that the murderer would soon be apprehended and that he would not become involved in the case in any way.</p>

His false statements after his arrest are easily accounted for by his anxiety, first, to cover up the duration and intensity of the intimacy between himself and Mrs. Green, and, second, to protect himself (as he ignorantly calculated) against the suspicions which surrounded him when he admitted that he had been in Mrs. Green’s apartment for a few minutes on December 8, 1946, an admission which presumably he would <em>not </em>have made had he been the murderer because no one had seen him enter <em>or </em>leave her apartment. He knew he was suspected of having killed this woman, and under those circumstances the average man of Wentzel’s age is quite likely to be in a stage of mental panic and not use good judgment. Wentzel made a serious error of judgment when he did not report Mrs. Green’s death immediately after he discovered her dead in bed at 11:00 P. M. Sunday night.

It does not necessarily follow that it was actually taken advantage of by the party shown to have possessed it; or that it was not taken advantage of by another person. . . . The real murderer may have left the dead body, and escaped from the room or the house in which it is found, only the moment before the accused entered it.”</p>

Sometime afterwards it was established that the murder was committed by another guest who, upon stabbing the victim escaped from the room two seconds before Bradford entered it. We also cited the case of William Habron, reported by Lord Birkenhead in Vol. 2, p. 21 of “Famous Trials of History”.

The Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the conviction, saying “opportunity, alone, is not sufficient to justify a conviction even though they [defendants] are unable to show who did commit it.

If that was the fact, she would have been dead only fifteen hours when the body was discovered. The testimony which the Commonwealth produced to prove the condition of the body when discovered is most unsatisfactory. The officials should have called in an experienced undertaker who could have determined with a fair degree of accuracy how long the body was dead when it was discovered at two p. m. Instead of that, reliance is placed upon the testimony of Dr. W. L. Franck, who was clearly an incompetent witness. He had no experience in examining corpses to determine how long they had been dead. He did not even examine Mrs. Green’s body to determine how long she had been dead. He said he “didn’t examine her except to notice she had bobby socks on. The body was then taken to the Homeopathic Hospital. He added: “I don’t think it had been dead much more than twelve hours.” He admitted that he had had no pathological <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>work on corpses.

On cross-examination he was asked this question: “Is it possible that this body was a corpse for forty-eight hours?” Answer: “It is possible.” Question: “It could have been a corpse for seventy-two hours?” Answer: “It could.” It is conceded that the Commonwealth’s case stands or falls upon the evidence as to the time of Mrs. Green’s murder. If she was not killed Sunday night Wentzel did not kill her. To convict this defendant the Commonwealth had to <em>prove </em>that Mrs. Green had been dead longer than twenty hours before Dr. Simpson performed the autopsy at 7 p. m., December ninth.

The arms and shoulders were very much enlarged, which, of course, was caused by tissue gas and tissue gases of course caused by putrefaction which of course would be gas developing between the skin which would cause the swelling which is an indication the body had been lifeless for some time. It was swollen to the point it could not be reduced, so that we could make the body visible to show for the family and friends and relatives.

He said it was his opinion that the body had been dead from forty-eight to seventy-two hours. He based this on his “experience and marks of decay which could not exist in a short time like this.” He was asked: “Is there no history of any case where the body had been dead less than that, and the body decayed in a similar manner?” He answered: “Not in my experience.”</p>

Famous, stenographer. <em>Wentzel had no counsel or friend present. </em>In that statement he denied that he was in Mrs. Green’s apartment on Sunday night. On December 10th (Commonwealth’s Exhibit C-54) he was again interrogated. He apparently had told the officer that he wished to correct the first statement made. In the second statement he said he had come to Mrs. Green’s apartment Sunday night to take her some venison and that he went there from the Elks. Possibly if Wentzel had been permitted to consult counsel in the first place, counsel would have told him to tell the truth and would have assured him that the fact that he was in Mrs. Green’s apartment on Sunday night would not of itself be sufficient to convict him of her murder.</p>

M. in the presence of the same four persons who had taken his first statement. This third statement was taken at the Pottstown police station on December 10, 1946, in the presence of the same four persons who were there. In <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>the third statement he denied he had a key to Mrs. Green’s apartment. He said he got in when the door “seemed loose and he pushed it”. He told about finding Mrs. Green’s body in the bedroom. He was asked if he touched “that window or the grate”. He answered: “I did not.” He was asked: “If your fingerprints appear on that grate, could you explain their presence?” He answered: “If my fingerprints appear on that grate, I cannot explain their presence.” This record does not disclose that there were <em>any </em>fingerprints on the grate. Certainly, there was no proof that Wentzel’s fingerprints were on any grate or anywhere else in that room. Apparently, the officers were trying to get him to admit in <em>response to their suggestion </em>that his fingerprints were on the grate. He said after he saw the body he turned out the light and ran out. He testified that it took him about “5 or 6 minutes” to get to his home from Mrs. Green’s. When asked why he did not call the police, he answered “fright”. He said he was “that scared”. Another statement was taken from Wentzel on December 10, 1946, at 10:30 P. M. (Commonwealth’s Exhibit No. C-56). In that statement he admitted he had a key to Mrs. Green’s apartment; that he entered her apartment by using the key. Apparently, his first denial of his possession of a key was due to his desire to show that his relationship with Mrs. Green was not so close that he had access to her apartment at all times by means of a key. The Commonwealth offered in evidence another statement of Wentzel, Exhibit C-57. It is very significant that this statement, which contains an alleged remark by Wentzel as to the handprint in the middle of her body, <em>was not signed by Wentzel and was not talcen in question and answer form. </em>It was allegedly made in the presence of District Attorney Smillie, Assistant District Attorney Scirica, County Detective James Gleason and Chief James Laughead of Pottstown. The first paragraph of the statement shows that it was not composed by Wentzel since no one accused of a crime voluntarily makes <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>such a statement as it is claimed Wentzel made. The first paragraph reads as follows: “I, Gerald C. Wentzel, having been warned that anything I might say would be used against me and having been promised nothing nor threatened in any way, and knowing that I can be represented by counsel, say I do not want counsel. I have no fear. I have told everything I know, and I am willing to make this statement voluntarily and freely. I do not want counsel and want to say everybody has been very good and kind to me. Chief Laughead, Jim Gleason, Mr. Scirica, Mr. Smillie and Mr. Bennett have all been very nice to me, and I wish to make this statement.”</p>

In it there appears this statement: “She had blood on her teeth. I walked to the side of the bed and stood about the middle of her body. I said, ‘Oh, my God’, and that is when I put my hand on the bed and that is where the handprint will be about the middle of her body.” If we knew what <em>suggestive </em>question was put to Wentzel we could fairly judge as to whether or not he made the statement attributable to him, and if he did make it, whether it was in response to some suggestive question. Anyone familiar with the administration of criminal law knows that accused persons and witnesses are often amenable to suggestions. In a book entitled, “On the Witness Stand”, Avritten by Hugo Munsterberg, who was Professor of Psychology at Harvard University when the book was written, in a chapter entitled “Untrue Confessions”, points out how innocent men have by suggestion been entrapped into confessing crimes they did not commit. He said: “It may be pure fatigue which may decrease our resistance against the creeping of deceptive illusions into our memory. Or it may be a simple emotional excitement; no doubt, the mere fact of being on the witness stand awakens in many minds, by its importance and solemnity, an excitement which is especially favourable for opening the memory to suggestions <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>and to confused ideas which group themselves around some ideas with strong feeling tone.

The sheet should have been exhibited to Wentzel and his hand should have been placed upon it for the purpose of making a comparison of sizes. This sheet should have been available at the trial. If it was not available at the trial it was certainly available when Wentzel was being examined a short time after Mrs. Green’s murder. The District Attorney seems to have been content to extract in some way <em>(how </em>it was extracted does not appear from Exhibit C-57 for that Exhibit contains no questions) an admission from Wentzel that he put his hand on the sheet. The District Attorney would have it <em>inferred </em>that the imprint on the sheet was Wentzel’s hand. <em>There is no proof that it was Wentzel’s hand. Wentzel never said that his hand was bloody when he placed it on the sheet. </em>It was entirely probable that the murderer of Mrs. Green on Friday night did put <em>his </em>bloody hand on the sheet. It is probable that Wentzel on Sunday night placed his hand on the sheet. That would have been a natural thing for him to do. It is important to note that J. E. Burke, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was called by the Commonwealth as a fingerprint expert, could not identify the bloody impression on the bed sheet as having been made by Wentzel’s hand. He said about it: “It appears to be the shape of one’s hand, but an examination as the material is of a porous type, it will absorb any foreign substance that may be on one’s hand and therefore you can’t tell just exactly what it is, whether a finger print or not. I can’t say definitely.”</p>

He does not claim that Wentzel admits putting a <em>bloody hand </em>on the bed. <em>The evidence of Wentzel’s hand on the bed was of such vague and unsatisfactory character that the trial judge did not even mention anything in his charge about Wentzel’s hand being on the bed. </em>This record clearly does not warrant the statement made in the majority opinion that Wentzel stated “that on the occasion of that very visit he had put his handprint on the bed sheet at the exact spot where the bloody impression, resembling the shape of a hand, was found”. If Wentzel’s hand <em>fitted </em>the bloody imprint on the sheet of Mrs. Green’s bed, the District Attorney would certainly have stressed that fact <em>and the trial judge in his charge would have mentioned that fact.</em>

The Assistant District Attorney saw fit to secure evidence against this accused by resorting to most unprecedented tactics. These were by addressing questions to the defendant during the various interrogations of him when he was not represented by counsel, which questions contained matters derogatory to him.

Will I have to point them out?” Wentzel answered: “If you call about her standing at the bar drinking when I asked her not to, maybe we had a few minor arguments, and they were all cleared up in the course of an hour or so.” That is the only evidence as to “frequent quarrels with the deceased”. The only evidence as to Wentzel’s “violent temper” is the statement which Mr. Scirica made to the defendant at the January 6th examination: “You had a mean disposition.” Wentzel said: “If there is one who says that, there are a hundred who will say the opposite. Any place I went with Mim will say we acted like a lady and gentleman. We didn’t do any rough stuff.” Q. “How about this fight you and Mim had in early September in Reading, and you stood her up against the wall in the Eagles Home?” A. “We didn’t have a fight. She threw her earring and I found it and said, ‘Wait a minute. That is a good earring’, and I found the other one in the car.” Q. “What did you have her up against the wall for?” A. “I didn’t put her up against the wall. I was only talking to her.” Q. “Did you have your hands on her?” A. “No.” Q. “Did you have them around the back of her neck?” A. “No. We walked out of the place hooked around one another.” Q. “What other fights did you have up there with her?” A. “We really never had fights. We had some arguments.”</p>

He was in her company at least twice a week and on Sunday night, December 8, 1946, he went to her apartment with a piece of venison he had secured on his hunting trip in Potter County. He said he planned to take her to Potter County some time later. That Wentzel made threats against Mrs. Green and that relations were other than friendly is demolished by the testimony of Mrs. Katie O’Meara <em>who would certainly not try to shield her daughter’s murderer. </em>Mrs. O’Meara testified that her daughter’s life with <em>her husband </em>(whom she had divorced on Wednesday before she was killed) was not a happy one; that she had seen a mark on her face where Green “had smacked her”. She was asked: “Do you know of your own knowledge whether Miriam was afraid of anyone?” She answered: “Well, she was shortly before she applied for her divorce.” Q. “Who was she afraid of?” A. “Mr. Green.” There is no member of the victim’s family who testified of any ill-treatment of Miriam Green by <em>Wentzel. </em>Mrs. Green’s sister testified that Mrs. Green’s married life with <em>her husband </em>was not happy. If Mrs. Green had been seriously threatened by Wentzel and had been afraid of him she certainly would not have let him have a key to her apartment or if she could not get her key back from him she would have changed the lock. All indications are that relations between Wentzel and Mrs, Green were of the <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>most amicable character.

In that case after two defendants had been convicted of murder, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction and ordered their release because incriminating statements had been extracted from them by long drawn out preliminary interrogations. At the time they were questioned, there were several officers present. As the Supreme Court said: “At no time during its course was a lawyer or any relative or friend of the defendants present.” The Supreme Court said further: “Zeal in tracking down crime is not in itself an assurance of soberness of judgment. Disinterestedness in law enforcement does not alone prevent disregard of cherished liberties. Experience has therefore counseled that safeguards must be provided against the dangers of the overzealous as well as the despotic.” This Court has not taken exactly the position in such matters as has the Supreme Court of the United States, but we did say in <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/358/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="358 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="8845559" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0350-01">358 Pa. 350</a>, 365: “The test to be applied to confessions secured by police officers is this long established and judicially sanctioned one, to wit: ‘Was the confession secured under such circumstances and by such methods as to make it testimonially trustworthy?’ ” Wentzel made no confession in this case but the statement about his putting his hand on the bed and about the handprint, if made by him at all, was made by him when no counsel was present and after repeated interrogation. We have <em>no stenographic record </em>as to what was said to him in regard to the hand being on the bed or what his reply was. Wentzel said when he was on the witness stand that he was “not permitted to see a lawyer”. They told Wentzel “he was cooperating beautifully and he did not <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>need a lawyer”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> That was told him by District Attorney Smillie and his Assistant, Mr. Scirica. In one of the examinations of Wentzel, the officers told him that he “was on the spot”. He was questioned one night until 2:00 or 2:30 in the morning. Wentzel should not be convicted on any alleged statements made by him under such circumstances and this is particularly true if such alleged statements are part of an unsigned statement attributed to him and there is no stenographer’s record of the questions asked him or his answers in respect to any alleged statement of his and which the Commonwealth asked the jury to accept as true.</p>

There are probably tens of thousands of individuals, including sailors, marines, and boy scouts and ex-boy scouts who are able to tie “square knots.” There is no proof whatever that <em>Wentzel </em>tied the square knot on the scarf around Mrs. Green’s neck. <em>Guessing </em>that he did so should not be permitted in a court of justice.

One of the most serious is the introduction of evidence, Exhibit C-59. This is the statement <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>made by defendant on January 6, 1947, in reply to questions addressed to Mm. He was asked whether or not Mrs. Green was pregnant on May 12th, last year (1946). He answered: “I think she was.” Q. “And there was an abortion performed?” A. “You mean she went to a doctor and had an illegal operation? No, indeed. I know that.” Q. “Then she took medicine?” A. “The way this woman told her to take some tea or something.” This was clearly charging Wentzel with another crime <em>in no way related to the crime </em>for which he was being tried, therefore, wholly inadmissible. It had <em>no probative </em>value, only <em>prejudicial </em>value. This Court as recently as January 1947 in a unanimous opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Jones, <a href="/pa/355/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="355 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="468874" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0594-01">355 Pa. 594</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="50 A.2d 342">50 A. 2d 342</a>, reversed a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree with the death penalty because the Commonwealth put in evidence the testimony of two detectives who testified to oral statements made to them by the accused while in their custody. These statements were that the defendant had been previously arrested for other crimes. In that case Mr. Justice Drew said in his opinion: “It is fundamental that no testimony is admissible unless it is relevant, i. e. unless it ■ is of a nature to afford evidence tending to prove or to disprove the matters in issue.” Even if Wentzel had been guilty of procuring an abortion on Mrs. Green, that would in no way tend to prove or disprove the charge that he murdered her. There are other prejudicial statements put in by the same methods, that is, by asking him about his temper, about his striking people. For example, in Exhibit C-59 Assistant District Attorney Scirica said to Wentzel: “We have statements from people who give us your work history and tell us about your temperament on a basketball court and tell about your habit of slapping or hitting a girl across the neck. You don’t deny that?” A. “No.” Q. “You were called down for it many times?” A. “That was a long while ago. I bet it is two years since I did that.” Q. “They tell us that you have a mean disposition when you are <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>drinking. You are not the calm, mild-mannered young man that you are when you are sober. There are times when you are very boisterous and playboyish and other times you have a pretty mean disposition.” Wentzel replied : “If there is one who says that, there are a hundred who will say the opposite.” The statement against Wentzel which Assistant District Attorney Scirica thus put in the record against the defendant was highly improper and it doubtless prejudiced this defendant before the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> I have never seen another case where such methods in prosecuting a criminal had been used by the district attorney or his assistant. Every District Attorney should remember the admonition of Chief Justice Paxson in <em>Commonwealth v.

He represents the commonwealth and the commonwealth demands no victims. It seeks justice only, equal and impartial justice, and it is as much the duty of the district attorney to see that no innocent man suffers, as it is to see that no guilty man escapes. Hence, he should act impartially. He should present the commonwealth’s case fairly, and should not press upon the jury any deductions from the evidence that are not strictly legitimate. When he exceeds this limit, and in hot zeal seeks to influence them by appealing to their prejudices, he is no longer an impartial officer, but becomes a heated partisan.”</p>

You won’t even admit that at first, but eventually you do admit you are in the apartment. You tell us how you got in and then you change your story, and then you swear by all that is Almighty you went into the living room. ... You admit being in the bedroom and there is no doubt in our minds that you were in the bedroom. And when you got in that bedroom, I don’t believe that there was not something between you and her that you haven’t told us about. I don’t believe that because I don’t believe a man like you would see a dead body and walk out immediately, and that is why I don’t believe that you walked in that bedroom when that body was dead. I think she was alive. I know she was alive, and now is the time to tell me what happened in that bedroom, and you have an answer. She may have threatened you. She may have said something to you. She may have been mad at you. She may have been drunk. You know the answer, and I say to you, Gerry, give the true answer. If she did threaten you, if she had been drinking, tell us.” To this long and unfair harangue on the part of the Assistant District Attorney, Wentzel made the following apparently honest answer: “She was going to her sister’s and didn’t go. She was going to call me from Heading Sunday night, and she didn’t.” Mr. Scirica said: ££When did you expect that telephone call from Reading?” Wentzel answered: “If she was coming on the 9:30 train she was going to call the Elks, but she didn’t call.”</p>

Wentzel apparently got the impression that this letter was the divorce decree. In any event, he learned from Mrs. Green before he went on his hunting trip that she had received her divorce.

The implication is that he threw away the key “to divert suspicion that he murdered Mrs. Green.” The obvious cause of his throwing away the key was his momentary fear that his possession of a key to her apartment would indicate a close intimacy with her, and at that time he was trying to minimize that intimacy. Within 45 minutes he corrected his statement about the key and admitted the fact of its possession. He was not obliged to admit this fact.

They did nothing of the kind. One of these two physicians is Dr. W. L. Franck. He went to Mrs. Green’s apartment about 3:00 P. M., December 9th. He examined the body only to determine whether or not she was alive or dead. He gave as his professional opinion that the body was not dead more than 12 hours. That would make the hour of death about 3:00 A. M. Monday or <em>4 </em>hours <em>after </em>Wentzel was in her apartment. But this same Dr. Franck reported to Coroner Rushong at 3:00 P.

The trial judge in his charge said nothing about the bloody hand on the sheet and in the court’s opinion refusing a new trial, all it said about the imprint of the hand was that Wentzel admitted that the bloody imprint resembled the shape of his hand and “might have been made” by his hand. Even this statement is not warranted by anything Wentzel had said. When Wentzel was on the witness stand at the trial of this ease, he said that when he was examined by the district attorney, the latter said: “now, make sure what you are saying did you or did you not <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>touch that bed.” Wentzel testified: “I said, ‘I did not touch the bed’, and he said, ‘there is a hand print of blood on there, tell us, did you touch the bed’. And I said that I did not. Then I got thinking. I said, I may have inadverently in the shock went down and touched the side of the bed. There is a drawing which the jury has seen. I made a drawing of where I stood along side of the bed.” It is very significant that when Assistant District Attorney Scirica cross-examined Wentzel at the trial he asked him <em>no question whatever about the imprint of the bloody hand on the bedspread </em>(or sheet, as it is sometimes referred to in the record). The manifestly correct and fair thing for the Assistant District Attorney to have done when Wentzel was on the witness stand was to ask him if the bloody imprint on the bedspread had been made by him and if Wentzel answered “No”, he should then have been asked to place his hand upon the imprint so that the jury might have made a comparison between the size of the imprint and the size of the hand.</p>

The statement in the majority opinion that Mrs. Green did not have a telephone in her apartment and therefore “might have found it inconvenient to call her mother” is no answer to the mother’s testimony that on any Saturday night when Mrs. Green did not come home she always telephoned her and that the daughter had promised to come home and spend the weekend with her on Saturday, December 7th.

Every fact proved by the Commonwealth in this case can be accepted as true <em>without any one </em>of such facts or <em>without all </em>of those facts <em>taken together </em>proving to a moral certainty or beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant, Gerald C. Wentzel, murdered Mrs. Miriam Green.

New, </em>supra. That verdict of murder in the first degree with the penalty of life imprisonment was based on suspicion as was the verdict of murder in the second degree in this case of <em>Commonwealth v. Wentzel. </em>The verdict in the <em>Knee New </em>case was set aside by this Court on May 28, 1946. In my judgment the verdict against the defendant should be set aside and the defendant released from custody, exactly as was done in the <em>Knee New </em>case.</p>

The <em>Inquirer </em>of June 10, 1948, stated “that Mrs. Katherine Mellor. 47, <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>was murdered by a prowler in her apartment at 1227 W. Girard Ave. on Monday afternoon . . . ber semi-nude body was lying in a bloodstained bed when her husband returned from his work . . . at 6:30 P. M.”. The <em>Inquirer </em>of the same date reported the arrest of a forty-six-year-old man “on a charge of attacking a woman in an automobile in a public garage Monday night”. The <em>New York Tribune </em>of April 10th reported the confession of one Julio Perez, an ex-eonviet, who had garroted a woman at 144 East 55th Street on March 30th. He obtained entrance to that woman’s apartment by using a screw driver and penknife, and when Mrs. Eolito discovered him and screamed, he fatally stabbed her with the screw driver. A few years ago there was executed in Winnipeg, Canada, a man who confessed to killing eighteen women in the United States and Canada who came to the back doors of their homes in answer <em>to the </em>killer’s knock on the door. His motive was not robbery; he killed just to satisfy his lust to kill, just as some prowlers prowl for the satisfaction of prowling. A little girl was killed in the same County in which Mrs. Green was killed about two years ago and the murderer has not yet been apprehended.</p>

It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion’: (Citing United States Supreme Court and other cases.) ‘The rule of substantial evidence is one of fundamental importance and is the dividing line between law and arbitrary power’ (citing cases). ‘Suspicion may have its place, but certainly it cannot be substituted for evidence’.”</p>
