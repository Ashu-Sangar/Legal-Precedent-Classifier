On January 24, 1942, the plaintiff went to defendant’s office for a dental examination. The defendant determined that the upper and lower <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>right third molars were extending toward the cheek, producing an irritation. The teeth, in other respects, were sound. Pursuant to his recommendation, defendant extracted the tooth from the upper jaw and also the one from the lower jaw. Defendant encountered difficulty in the extraction of the tooth from the lower jaw. He was required to use some force. Plaintiff testified that when the extraction was completed defendant was breathing heavily and was nervous. When he showed her. the tooth defendant dropped it on the floor. The tooth was large and had hooks at the ends of its roots. Immediately after the extraction, defendant packed the socket with the drug sulfanilamide. Defendant instructed plaintiff, on reaching home, to use an ice pack on the outside of her face and to wash out her mouth with a solution composed of a teaspoon of table salt, teaspoon of baking soda, fifteen drops of tincture of iodine mixed in a glass of warm water. On plaintiff’s return to her home her jaw began to swell. She applied the ice pack and medical solution in accordance with defendant’s instruction. The pain and swelling continued and increased. Plaintiff returned to defendant’s office on January 27, 1942. Upon further examination the defendant advised her to continue rinsing the mouth, the application of ice packs, the use of sedatives and massage with camphorated oil. Plaintiff again returned to the defendant’s office on January 29,1942. The swelling was then more pronounced, the pain greater, and she had a temperature. She could scarcely open her mouth. Defendant called in Doctor Euftyn Jones, a physician and surgeon, who examined the outside of the plaintiff’s jaw and told her to continue the treatment recommended by the defendant.</p>

He testified that her face, neck and the upper half of her chest were much swollen; she was unable to swallow or to take food and pus was oozing from' her mouth; and that he saw her at her home.on February 14, 1942. :He said, that she then had an incision on the outside of her . neck, which was draining.

The X-rays revealed a fracture of the condylar process of the lower jaw, which is the process that goes into the formation of the joint.. The fracture was about three quarters of an¡ inch from the ¡formation'of «the joint and about one and three quarters of an inch from the socket of the extracted ¡tooth. - Another- picture was-taken on March 13, ¡1942 which showed-that the fracture had-partially united...

The court correctly said (p. 170a): “All that'is shown is that the defendant did'certain things and failed to do other things.

It is urged that-a lay jury might find that ‘ plaintiff’s jaw was found to have been broken, and from this fact might conclude that defendant'had used'unwarranted force and was therefore' negligent; We disagree with such doctrine.</p>

      <em>Laymen cannot </em>be required to decide'what amount of force is necessary to extract a'tooth mnder any given set of circumstances. The-degree of force to-be used is an integral part in the <em>techniqke </em>of■ extracting teeth. This professional technique is developed only after study and practice under men of experience. Negligence may not be <em>inferred </em>by <em>laymen </em>merely because the jaw was found to have been broken. A jaw could be broken even though there was no lack of care or skill by the dentist.</p>
