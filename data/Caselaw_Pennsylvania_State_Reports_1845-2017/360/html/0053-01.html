They involve the property of Anna Fox Brindle who died April 7, 1944, leaving a will dated March 10, 1942, probated April 10, 1944. She left surviving a brother, Frank Fox, and a number of cousins. By this will she gave her property<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to F. W. Steffey in trust for her brother for life, with the right, in specified circumstances,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to use the principal. <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>She devised, her homestead, on the death of the brother, to Mildred Watts Zook, and directed that the rest of her property be divided equally between Mrs. Zook and F. W. Steffey. Neither Mrs. Zook nor Steffey was in any way related to her. Mr. Steffey was also appointed executor. Belleville, where she resided, is a small village of about 1200 inhabitants in Mifflin County. It contained a national bank of which Mrs. Zook’s husband was president, and F. W. Steffey, cashier. Testatrix was about 73 years of age when she made her will and about 75 when she died. Her only surviving brother, Frank Fox, was then about 67 years of age and was described as “a helpless, incurable incompetent, requiring constant attendance of some person to feed and care for him.” After testatrix’s death Frank L. Campbell was appointed guardian of Frank Fox in a proceeding initiated by F. W. Steffey. The first cousins, who, except her brother, were her nearest relatives, concluded that an appeal from the probate should be taken for lack of testamentary capacity, fraud and undue influence in procuring the will, but Mr. Campbell, the guardian of the incompetent, declined to proceed. They then applied to the common pleas, whose ward the incompetent was, for the appointment of a guardian ad litem, to take the appeal. The court appointed William A. H. Brindle guardian ad litem and authorized him to appeal. He was also appointed “guardian and trustee ad litem of Frank Fox” by the orphans’ court. F. W. Steffey and Mildred Watts Zook were permitted to intervene in the proceedings and petitioned both courts “to vacate the various decrees that had been made appointing William A. H. Brindle guardian ad litem and authorizing him to proceed with the appeal and praying the Court to strike the appeal from the probate of the will of Anna Fox Brindle, deceased, from the record.”</p>

The court received the evidence, revoked the appointments <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>of the guardian ad litem and the grant of authority to appeal from the probate and struck the appeal from the record. The present appeals complain of those orders.</p>
    <p id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[118,441,1152,427]]]'>In his opinion written in support of those conclusions, the learned judge said, “the only question now before the Court is whether the appointment of the guardian ad litem should be revoked, the decree authorizing him to take an appeal from the probate of the will of Anna Fox Brindle vacated, and the appeal so taken by him stricken from the record.” In our judgment, that was not the only question.</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[118,880,1152,534]]]'>The evidence on the appeal from the probate clearly shows a substantial dispute upon matter of fact. The statute provides what shall be done in such circumstances. The Orphans’ Court Act of 1917, P. L. 363, section 21(b), 20 PS 2582, provides:' “Whenever a dispute upon a matter of fact arises before any orphans’ court, on appeal from any register of wills . . . the said court shall, at the request of either party, direct a precept for an issue to the court of common pleas of the county for the trial thereof . . .”</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[117,1435,1153,692]]]'>The learned judge, in the course of his decision, did not discuss this phase of the proceedings, an omission probably explainable on the theory that, after he had concluded to vacate the order allowing the guardian ad litem to appeal, there could be no trial of an issue devisavit vel non. He referred to the fact that the incompetent was the ward of the court and that it was the duty of the court to decide what should be best for the ward; that as the will gave the entire net income to the ward with the right in the trustee to use the principal, the ward had substantially all that he could have if the appeal succeeded and the will was set aside and he inherited under the intestate law.</p>
    <p id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.7",81,[117,2156,1153,207]],["BL_82.1",82,[268,283,1159,1617]]]'>There is no doubt of the power of the common pleas, in a proper case, to determine what appears best for the ward: <em>Harris Estate, </em><a href="/pa/351/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="462747" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0368-01">351 Pa. 368</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20715" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 A.2d 715">41 A. 2d 715</a>. But before that question is reached on this record, a funda<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>mental and more important question must be decided. The evidence shows a prima facie case of lack of testamentary capacity, fraud and undue influence in obtaining the will. The statute provides what shall be done in such case. The ward is not the only party concerned; the next of kin and those who may claim under them have rights under the intestate law. If this will is set aside, as it may be, the basis of the comparison made by the learned judge falls. It falls because there has been no testamentary disposition, the property having passed pursuant to the intestate law. It is this possibility which distinguishes this case from the Harris case relied on by the learned judge; in that case, when the comparison was made, there was a valid will; the elements of thé comparison were lawfully established. In the present case, if the contestants succeed, there is no will; there is only a fraudulent transaction. The learned judge erred in assuming that, in passing on the ward’s right to appeal, it was immaterial whether a fraud had been perpetrated on the register of wills and on the parties contesting the probate. We think that if the register was fraudulently induced to admit to probate an instrument which was not a will and therefore not entitled to probate, it became the duty of the court, and of all parties to the proceeding, to see that the rights of the parties lawfully succeeding to a decedent’s property are respected. A court should not accept the contents of a void instrument as a measure of the exercise of judicial discretion by giving it the effect that would be given to a valid instrument.</p>

If the questioned testamentary document <em>toas </em>procured because of testamentary incapacity, or by undue influence, such a will is void and a nullity. There is no difference in the status of such an instrument and one which has been forged or procured through duress. In the eyes of the law no will exists. The decedent dies intestate.</p>

It is argued that the expense of a will contest might deplete the estate to the ward’s injury. It is also suggested that the contest is actually between the proponents and possible next of kin of the incompetent, hence, if the ward is protected for the period of his life, the court should withhold permission to institute a will contest.</p>

      <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>It is futile to argue that the expense connected with a will contest may jeopardize the care and maintenance of the incompetent. Under the terms of the questioned will the incompetent is entitled to have expended in his behalf all of the income and to consume any part or all of the principal at the discretion of Steffey, the executor and trustee, who takes one half of the estate in remainder. Should the will be sustained, the costs and expenses of the litigation will be paid out of the corpus of the estate — said to net approximately $140,000 — -for distribution. Such costs and expenses, however, must be approved by the court and must not be excessive. If, however, the will is set aside, the incompetent inherits the entire estate under the intestate law. The costs and expenses of the litigation will then probably be charged against the losing proponents of the will. In these circumstances, in the absence of an agreement between the litigants, an administrator <em>pendente lite </em>may be appointed, who, with leave of court, may advance, pending the litigation, the necessary funds for the incompetent’s maintenance and care.</p>

No such view, <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>to my knowledge, has ever heretofore been taken.

The sole question before us is, would such a contest . . . whether successful or unsuccessful, be for the welfare and best interests of Frank Fox, the incompetent.” In that connection I am wholly unable to understand what is meant in the majority opinion by the statement that “There is no doubt of the power of the common pleas, in a proper case, to determine what appears best for the ward: . . . But before that question is reached on this record, a fundamental and more important question must be decided,” — namely, whether or not the will should be upheld.

In the present instance Mrs. Brindle took care, to the fullest extent and in the most sensible and practical way, of every possible need and interest of the person who was nearest and dearest to her, namely, her brother, and it was only after she had thus provided for him that she gave whatever might remain after his death to her two closest friends in the community in which she lived. I cannot see anything in such a will that is not wholly normal and natural, or that would be calculated to excite suspicion on the part of any fair-minded and disinterested person.</p>

The majority opinion chooses to ignore them because they refer to the election of a mentally incompetent husband and wife-to take against the will of his or her spouse, and in such cases the integrity of the will itself is not under suspicion. This, of course, may be a distinction, but it is a distinction without a difference, for the two situations, from a legal standpoint, are not only analogous but identical. In both of them we have an incompetent person called upon to make a choice of conduct in regard to the repudiation of a will or part of it; in both of them that choice is to be made solely on the basis of expediency or personal welfare of the incompetent; in both of them, since the mental incompetent is unable to determine what is best for himself and he is the object of the court’s solicitude and protection, the court, acting on his behalf, must make the election for him. Indeed, if any different rule whatever were to be established between the two cases there should be required greater caution on the part of the court in authorizing the guardian of a mentally incompetent heir to <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>attack the probate of a will than in authorizing the guardian of a mentally incompetent widow to elect to take against her husband’s will, for the former case is bound to involve bitter, protracted, costly and, at best, doubtful litigation, whereas the latter calls merely for the exercise of an established, uncontestable legal right.</p>
