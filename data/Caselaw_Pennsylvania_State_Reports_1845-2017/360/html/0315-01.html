To prove parol contracts or gifts between parent and child the witnesses depended upon for that purpose must have heard the bargain when made and their testimony must bring the parties face to face; the transaction may not be inferred merely from the declarations of one of the parties: <em>Ackerman v.

In the present case such rigorous requirements do not apply, but, as a matter of fact, there is testimony here as to the making of the parol gift by Riffle to Shimek “face to face.” Shimek testified that Riffle and his wife stated to him that they were going to build him the house, and, on several later occa<a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>sions, that they gave it to him, that it was his. Mrs. Shimek said she was present several times when the Riffles talked the matter over with her husband and she heard them say that “it was our house, they had given it to us, we could do as we pleased with it.” In addition to this, seven witnesses, five of them apparently disinterested, testified to declarations by Riffle to the same effect, namely that he wanted to build Shimek a house, that he was building the house for him, that he had built it for him because he was not paying him very big wages; that the house was Shimek’s; that he had given it to him. While such declarations might not be adequate in themselves to prove the gift they effectively corroborate the more direct testimony of the Shimeks and go to show a continued recognition by Riffle of the parol gift which he had made: <em>Allison v.

The testimony is clear to the effect that the entire community knows of their occupancy. Mrs. Shimek testified that she and her husband always publicly claimed it as theirs,— that “everyone knows we claimed it as ours.” When asked whether she had ever told Riffle that it was their property she answered by saying, “He always told me it was ours”; and to the question “Did you ever tell him it was your property?” she replied: “I always talked to him in that way.” If, therefore, Riffle was constantly declaring that the property belonged to the Shimeks, and they occupied it in pursuance of that understand<a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>ing, their claim of title was sufficiently adverse; it was not necessary for them to deny physical access of the Riffles tó the house of to disturb the friendly relationship which existed with them up to 1946. While Riffle paid the taxes on the property this was explained by the fact that a tax-saving resulted from treating-the small tract as a part of his farm in the adjoining township. We think that the possession taken by defendants was sufficient to bring them within -the exception to the application to parol gifts of the Statute of Frauds.</p>

It is true- that he obtained the material for these improvements either as gifts or at small expense, but he himself performed the necessary labor, working nights and at odd hours when not on duty for the Riffles. Plaintiffs deprecate the importance of the improvements on the ground that -they were neither valuable nor incapable of being adequately compensated in damages; they were, however, óf a permanent nature and of such an extent as to render any attempted revocation of the gift unjust and inequitable. ’ Improvements that might be deemed inconsequential in connection with a property which was' itself-«extremely valuable might properly be regarded as of comparatively large value when made upon a $990 house, and, since Shimek made them by his own labor performed at various odd times, his contention would seem reasonable that compensation therefor' in damages must necessarily be inadequate'; the: requirement of the law that the improvements be such that compensation would be inadequate does not mean, of course, that no amount of compensar <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>tion, however large, would be sufficient, but that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to determine such amount with, any fair degree of accuracy by ordinary and available standards. There is peculiarly apposite to the present case what was said in <em>Greenwich Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. </em>Learn, <a href="/pa/234/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="234 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="982439" data-case-paths="/pa/234/0180-01">234 Pa. 180</a>, 187, <a href="/citations/?q=83%20A.%2074" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="83 A. 74">83 A. 74</a>, 76,—that “where a man under circumstances like these has spent the best-part of his life improving a piece of land for a home, compensation in damages is not adequate.”</p>
