Dearden. Robert R. Dearden, Jr., died September 21, 1938, survived by two sons, John E. Dearden, appellant, and Robert R. Dearden, 3rd, additional appellee. Edward C. Dearden, Jr., the son of Edward C. Dearden, died January 28, 1945. John E. Dearden, appellant, filed his bill in equity <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>to compel Edward C. Dearden, appellee, to specifically perform a contract entered into between Edward, Robert, Jr., and the United States Review Publishing Company, Inc., wherein Edward agreed, <em>inter </em>alia, that “within sixty (60) days after the death of the said Edward C. Dearden, Jr., . . . the said Edward C. Dearden .... must offer to sell” stock in the United States Review Publishing Company, Inc., to Robert R. Dearden, 3rd, additional appellee, and to appellant. Robert R. Dearden, 3rd, was named a defendant for the reason that he refused to join as a plaintiff in the action against Edward C. Dearden. After a hearing, the chancellor entered a decree <em>nisi </em>dismissing the bill. This appeal is from the decree of the court <em>en banc </em>dismissing exceptions to the adjudication and entering a final decree.</p>

Gn May 6, 1947, appellant filed this bill in equity. Answers were filed admitting most of the allegations but asserting that there was no liability. The hearing was continued and the following day appellee Dearden moved to. amend his answer and to set forth new matter. Counsel for appellant orally stated his reply to same and alleged, in substance that: (1) the purpose of the agreement had been accomplished and the contract was, therefore, no longer in force; (2) the provisions of-the agreement constituted at most an option which must have been exercised by appellant within sixty days after the death of Edward, Jr., and (3) appellant was guilty of unclean hands.</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[278,1219,1149,744]]]'>The chancellor in his adjudication found as a fact that Edward C. Dearden did not affirmatively offer to sell the 166% shares of stock in controversy to Robert R. Dearden, 3rd, and John E. Dearden within 60 days after the death of Edward, Jr.; that Robert R. Dearden, 3rd, and John E. Dearden did not, either jointly or individually, offer to purchase said stock within 60 days after the death of Edward, Jr., and that the right, if any, to purchase the stock terminated 60 days. after his death. He concluded as a matter of law that appellant, not having complied with the conditions of the sale and purchase as provided by the agreement of February 28, 1934, had no rights, and entered a decree dismissing the bill.</p>

    <p id="b253-3" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[139,394,1150,535]]]'>The correctness of the decree of the court below dismissing the bill is dependent upon a proper interpretation of Sections 10 and 11 of the agreement of 1934. Section 11 was intended to take effect only if Edward, Jr., associated himself with the business and subsequently died or withdrew from the business. Once these conditions precedent occurred “the agreement.covering the purchase of . the stock, referred to in Paragraph 10 hereof, shall apply to and be carried out, as is therein provided.”</p>

Dearden at an agreed purchase price of $15,000, the same to be paid at the rate of $2,000 per annum in equal quarterly .installments without interest, except on overdue payments.- This undertaking by Edward Dearden was clearly supported by consideration and effected an irrevocable offer for a period of 60 days after the death of Edward, Jr.; See Restatement, Contracts, Section 47; 12 Am. Jur., Contracts, Section 24. The agreement was self-executing and the. conditions precedent having been fulfilled, Edward Dearden did, for a period of 60 days after the death of his son, offer to sell the stock in question. This Option to purchase the stock, not having been accepted by the persons to whom it was given, expired at the end of the 60th day: <em>Rhodes v.
