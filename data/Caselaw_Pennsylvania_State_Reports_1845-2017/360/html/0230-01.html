Thereafter, appellant qualified as an employer and regularly paid contributions up to and including the full calendar year 1943. The Department of Labor and Industry, on April 15, 1944, notified appellant that its rate of contribution for the calendar year 1944 was 2.7%. On May 3, 1944, appellant filed its application for review and redetermination with the Department of Labor and Industry and the Bureau of Employment and Unemployment Compensation asserting that it must be credited with the benefit of its predecessor’s experience, that it and its predecessor had paid contributions for more than four full calendar years prior to the computation date, that three of these years were immediately preceding the computation date, and that the law as construed and applied violates the uniformity provisions of Article IX, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The application was denied and an appeal taken to the court below pursuant to Section 301(h) and (i) of the Unemployment Compensation Law: Act of 1936, P.

Its argument is based upon definitions applicable solely to an “employe”. The basic erroneous assumption is that an employe’s base year must refer to employment by a given employer who has made application for a reduced rate of taxation. It is argued that a claimant whose benefit year began at any time during the first quarter of 1941 would have as his base year the last quarter of 1939 and the first three quarters of 1940; that only wages earned by him during these quarters would be taken <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>into consideration in determining both financial eligibility for benefits and the amount thereof; that to be potentially chargeable for the first quarter of 1941, an employer must have given employment during a minimum successive period of 1941 and the last two quarters of 1940; and, that, to acquire employer experience during the three years immediately preceding the computation date, a minimum of three and one-half years continuous employment immediately preceding that date must have been given by the employer seeking the reduced rate.

The designated period of time does not refer to employment with any designated employer. The legislature has not so provided and any rule or regulation to that effect promulgated by the Department would be a nullity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> If appellee’s contention were sustained, an employe would be required to have been employed by a given employer throughout the period of his “base year”. Should he at any time thereafter voluntarily cease to be so employed, he would be required to again be employed by a given employer a sufficient length of time to enable him to again establish a “base year”. This result was never intended and to so hold would defeat the evident scheme of the Unemployment Compensation Law and not be in accord with its salutary purposes. An employe need not have been employed for the entire period included in his “base year”. The Act prescribed the period during which his earnings were to be considered in determining the amount of benefits to be received. An employe’s record of- employment for the required calendar quarters irrespective of where employed fulfills the statutory requirement as regards his “base year”. Whether benefits would have <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>been payable during his “benefit year” would have been dependent upon his earnings within that “base year”.</p>

The Act has never required any base period as regards an employer.
