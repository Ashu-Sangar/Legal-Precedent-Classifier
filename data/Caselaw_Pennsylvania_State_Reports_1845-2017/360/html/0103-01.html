The office of the writ, as at common law, is to prevent an unlawful assumption of jurisdiction, not to correct mere errors and irregularities in matters over which the court has cognizance. Where the general scope and purpose of the action is within the jurisdiction of the court, any error or overstepping of its authority in a portion of its judgment, or any other error in its proceedings, is only ground for a review or appeal, and not prohibition. That is to say, where there is authority to do the act, but the manner of doing it is improper, the writ will not lie. In other words, whatever power is conferred may be exercised, and, if it be exercised injudiciously, erroneously or irregularly, it amounts to error merely and not to a usurpation or excess of jurisdiction. In such a case, however gross the error, irregularity or mistake, the writ does not lie, not because, as is sometimes erroneously or irregularly, it amounts to error merely or such remedies are inhibited, but for the reason that there has been no usurpation or abuse of power.”</p>

A. 9) 8 F (2) 981, the defendant petitioned to quash the search warrant issued in the criminal action and to suppress as evidence certain property seized by virtue of the search warrant; The petition was denied and an appeal was taken. “Afterwards, the court, having signified its intention to proceed with the trial of the case, defendants applied . . for a writ- of prohibition, to have the District Court restrained from proceeding. The United States attorney moves to dismiss the writ of error, upon the ground that the order of the District Court was interlocutory, and not appealable.” Circuit Judge Hunt held “that, where one is charged with a criminal offense, an order denying his petition . . . for the exclusion of the use of property seized, as evidence in a criminal action, is not a final order or decision, within the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of this court.” He distinguishes the line of cases in the Federal Courts where the order was declared final only because it was in an independent proceeding and not, as here, in a proceeding then pending. There is an analogy between that case and the one <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>now before ns. Here also the proceedings are pending. By this independent writ, the Commonwealth now attempts' to control the introduction of evidence. The allegation that the evidence -whose introduction was sought was evidence forbidden by law does not in the slightest degree affect the jurisdiction of the court below, and therefore it creates no.reason for the issuance by this court of a writ of prohibition.</p>

In <em>Carpentertown Coal &amp; Coke Company v. </em>Laird, <a href="/pa/360/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="360 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="475080" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0094-01">360 Pa. 94</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="61 A.2d 426">61 A. 2d 426</a>, p. 100, Mr. Justice Horace Stern, after a painstaking review of the historical background of the writ of prohibition and its use in practice, pertinently observed that “. . . its [the writ’s] purpose ... is ... to control and manage the inferior court itself and prevent it from usurping jurisdictions and powers: which it does not constitutionally and legally possess”. The same opinion further points out that the writ is not issued <em>. </em>where there is. a complete and effective remedy by appeal, certiorari, writ, of error, injunction, or otherwise: [citing cases]”. Conversely, the writ may be appropriate where none of the above-listed remedies exists.</p>

The Secretary of Revenue seeks a writ of prohibition in order to supersede the subpoena because Sec. 731 of The Fiscal Code of 1929, P. L. 343, as amended by the Act of June 6, 1939, P. L. 261, and the Act of July 9, 1941, P. L. 305 (72 PS § 731), expressly provides that such returns and reports, as well as the informa<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>tion contained therein, shall be confidential and privileged (save in a certain contingency not presently material).</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[273,438,1148,310]]]'>Plainly enough, the issuance of the subpoena is not appealable; and, if the question of its propriety be made to await an appeal following final judgment (the subpoena having been enforced in the meantime), the statutorily prescribed confidence will have been irremediably breached.</p>
    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.5",138,[273,768,1148,753]]]'>There is, of course, another way open for testing the power of the court to ignore the provisions of the statute and that is for the Secretary of Revenue to disobey the subpoena and assign in justification of his action his sworn duty in the premises. Actually, this Court’s present decision goes no further than to hold that a writ of prohibition is not the proper means to thwart the enforcement of a questioned subpoena duly issued out of a court of competent jurisdiction. But, the subpoenaing of the tax returns for incorporation in a record open to public inspection is such a patent violation of the “Confidential Information” provision of the statute as to amount to a usurpation by the issuing court of a power which it does properly possess.</p>
    <p id="b138-6" data-blocks='[["BL_138.6",138,[273,1532,1148,480]]]'>Consequently, I cannot see any justifiable need or purpose for putting the Attorney General to the necessity of advising the Secretary of Revenue to disobey the subpoena in order that the controlling effect of the statute may be tested directly. And, particularly, is that so since a remedy which necessarily invites, as an alternative, possible punishment for contempt has been held not to be “an adequate remedy”: <em>Mayers v.
