Defendant’s only complaint is that its motion for judgment n. o. vl was refused. If there is evidence from which the jury could find negligence, the judgments must be affirmed. As,the plaintiffs have the verdict the evidence and inferences from it must now be taken in the sense most favorable to plaintiffs. So examined, the jury may have found the facts now to be stated. At about 1:15 on a Saturday afternoon, January 22, 1944, the minor plaintiff, aged five and a half years, accompanying John Parker, aged fifteen or sixteen, became a passenger on defendant’s bus. The route traversed by the bus in. the City of Pittsburgh included O’Hara street to Thackeray street, thence to Fifth Avenue, the “end of the run.” The bus was <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>crowded; the majority of the passengers were children. A regular stop was at the corner of O’Hara and Thackeray streets where the bus would make a right turn into Thackeray street. The regular stopping place was at the curb but on this day cars were parked along the curb so that the bus could not get nearer than within six or eight feet of the curb. Instead of stopping the bus so that it stood on O’Hara street alone, the bus driver testified, “. . . in order to prevent cars passing me on the right I cut the right end in on Thackeray street,” the rear end being ten or twelve feet away from the curb, and the front end six or eight feet from it. While the bus was in that position, partly turned from one street into the other, passengers were discharged. This stopping place was only a short distance from Fifth Avenue where, as the bus driver testified, “. . . the majority of them would get off at Fifth and Thackeray” not far from a “movie” theatre. The evidence is not as clear as it might be to determine whether the minor plaintiff and John Parker<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> stepped off the bus to allow others to alight, intending to get on again and proceed to Fifth Avenue, or whether they got off erroneously thinking they had reached the end of the run. At all events, they alighted with other passengers; they did not pass to the curb. The bus doors were closed leaving the two boys in the street, the older one knocking at the closed doors to attract the attention of the bus driver. The driver started his bus to complete the turn into Thackeray street and, while doing so, the right front wheel passed over the minor plaintiff’s foot and seriously injured him. The front part of the bus was then still crowded with passengers to such an extent that the driver could not see to his right to determine whether it was safe to proceed. He testified that a passenger got on the bus <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>“. . . and after this man got on he said it was all right, so I closed the doors and started out very slowly as I was watching these soldiers in front of me, I didn’t want any of them to step out in front of me, and I was slowly making the turn when I heard someone shout, ‘Stop,’ so I stopped . . .” In cross examination he said that four or five passengers were standing in the front of the bus on his right side, so that he “couldn’t see the door for the people.” The bus traveled from three to six feet from the time it started until it stopped, during part of which the boys walked beside it, the older one knocking on the door.</p>
    <p id="b491-3" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[166,931,1152,1197]]]'>The jury could find, as it did, that it was the duty of the driver not to start his bus until he had seen that the minor plaintiff-passenger had walked to the curb from the place where he was required to alight (compare <em>Vogel v.

Dr. Fetter, the only eye witness, testified that “the boys were standing between the curb and the bus.” Dr. Fetter was very familiar with the location in which the accident happened and was standing only four or five feet from the bus. He testified “He [the bus driver] had only moved several feet, I would say no more than a yard or a yard and a half, four or five feet, maybe six, when I noticed this bigger boy and a small boy; the big boy had the small boy by the hand and it seemed to me they were trying to get back on the bus. The bigger boy was rapping on the side of the door. The door happens to be in front of the wheel. I believe that type of bus has the motor in the rear; I don’t know, but they were: trying to get back on the bus, it seemed to me, and the right front wheel, it was going around that turn, and the little boy just got his foot and it ran right over it.”</p>

The jury might very properly say that he should not have relied, as he testified he did, on a man’s making the ambiguous statement- “all clear,” but should himself have looked where he was about to drive his bus. By “all clear” the man who was standing in the bits may have meant that the driver could close the doors without injuring the standing passengers.</p>

      <em>Vogel v. Stupi, </em>supra, involved transportation of school children. The bus was hired for that specific purpose. In view of that relationship a majority of this Court held that the driver of the bus was under a duty to refrain from discharging the children in the face of possible oncoming dangers. In <em>O’Malley v. Laurel Line Bus Co., </em>supra, the motorman, on a dark and stormy night, stopped his bus at a point 250 feet from the regular bus stop. Instead of being on the right side of the road and near the curb, the bus was in the center of the road and 16 feet from the curb. The passengers were not advised of the foregoing facts and, because of the inciement weather, they were not aware of'them. The plaintiff was struck by an automobile traveling in a direction opposite to that of the bus immediately after he stepped from the bus. That case is clearly inapplicable here. This Court emphasized the fact that (p. 256) : “Here, plaintiff was discharged at an ‘obviously perilous point.’ ” That is not true in the instant case. In <em>Lyons v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., </em>supra, a trolley had been stopped at the beginning of a curve and plaintiff, a passenger, was required to alight at a point where her path to the curb was temporarily blocked by automobiles. The trolley proceeded immediately after discharging the plaintiff and she was knocked down and injured when caught by the overhang of the rear as it swung around the curve. It was held that, having knowledge of the dangerous and perilous position in which- the passengers had been placed by his own act, the operator was negligent in failing to afford plaintiff passenger a reasonable time within which to reach a point of safety. In the instant case there is no evidence to support a finding that appellee was not afforded reasonable time to reach the curb safely. It is clear, therefore, -that all of the cases cited in the majority opinion are factually dissimilar and the holding of the cases inapposite.</p>

A careful reading of the opinion of this Court, however, shows clearly that this Court held there was no actionable negligence. It was said (p. 566) : “. . . 'the state of the record requires the testimony of the plaintiff, with all proper inferences deducible therefrom, to be construed in the light most favorable to her, but it is still for the court to say if, taken as true, actionable negligence, by defendant has been shown’ . . .”.

Here, appellee and Parker did alight safely, but remained standing at the side of the bus and to the rear of the door until after the doors had been closed and the forward motion of the bus resumed.</p>
    <p id="b497-3" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[117,1555,1151,645]]]'>The mere fact of an accident does not establish that a duty to the injured person has been breached. Nor does the fact that the injured person is a minor five and one-half years of age, and, therefore, not chargeable with contributory negligence, create a duty, The positive evidence establishes that appellant’s driver operated the bus with the greatest of care under the circumstances, that appellee alighted safely and was afforded ample opportunity to remove himself from any possible orbit of danger which might exist by reason of the fact that the bus was turning to its right, and that the accident did not result from any negligence of appellant’s driver.</p>
    <p id="b497-4" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[118,2212,1147,98]]]'>The judgment of the court below should be reversed and here entered for appellant.</p>
