    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[283,382,1151,1749]]]'>Prior to August 21, 1945, the plaintiff was the lessee of a siding on the Pennsylvania Railroad at or near Mahaffey, Clearfield County,-Pa., .known as the Troy No. 10 siding. He erected tipple, and dumping facilities at this point. He also possessed a strip mining lease on real estate known as the .Paul Duff property at Clover Run, Pa. The defendant was engaged in strip mining nearby and had his ow;n siding facilities on the Clover Run branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On August 21, 1945, plaintiff and defendant entered into a written contract providing, inter alia, as follows: “J. D. Walker, [Plaintiff] party of the first part, owning tipple and siding facilities at Mahaffey, Pa., and a coal stripping operation on the Paul Duff property at Clover Run, Pa., and it being planned to dump and ship the said coal at Mahaffey, Pa., and J. G. Saricks, [Defendant] having leased coal and developing a siding , and stripping operation along the Clover Run Railroad, it being close and nearby the J. D. Walker operation, desires for economical reasons to operate both propositions and agrees hereby to compensate J. D. Walker in the following manner for discontinuing his operation. . . Under the terms of the contract, compensation was to be paid to plaintiff at the rate of five cents per ton on thirtydhree and one-third percent of all the coal <em>"put over both tipples and sidings” </em>unless more than one-third of all the coal was marketed <em>over plaintiff’s tipple and siding </em>at Mahaffey <em>in which case </em>plaintiff was to receive five cents per ton on all coal marketed over this siding. The contract also contained the following provisions with relation to the plaintiff’s siding at Mahaffey:</p>

Plaintiff was paid in accordance with the terms of the contract until April 1, 1946. Defendant refused to make payment for any tonnage loadéd thereafter because on that date the railroad cancelled the plaintiff’s rights in the Troy No. 10 siding and thereafter plaintiff sold his tipple to a third person. Defendant contends that the discontinuance of the right to use the siding and the sale of the tipple excused him from further performance under the contract.</p>
    <p id="b621-7" data-blocks='[["BL_621.7",621,[129,1393,1152,638]]]'>In this appeal, defendant invokes the doctrine of <em>implied conditions, </em>whereby a contract may be discharged through subsequent impossibility of performance. He relies upon the principle enunciated in <em>Wertz v. Klinger, </em><a href="/pa-super/25/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="25 Pa.

Defendant maintains that the contract is ambiguous and testimony should be taken in order to show the surrounding circumstances under which'it -was executed. The learned , court below held that the written contract was <em>not </em>ambiguous and therefore parol testimony to establish implied conditions^ which would thus contradict or vary the terms of the written contract, should not be received.

The first part of.the.writing refers to the “J. D. Walker operation.” The contract provides that defendant “agrees ... to .compensate J. D. Walker . . . for discontinuing his operation.” The term “operation” as used in this contract embraced more than the mere right to use a siding and tipple. The agreement <em>recites </em>that plaintiff owned <em>“a coal stripping operation on the Paul Duff property at Clover </em>Run” and certain rights, in a railroad siding. When plaintiff promised to “discontinue - his operation” by written agreement, he gave up an - important property right. The complaint states, and it is admitted in the-amended answer, that plaintiff did assign the Paul Duff lease to defendant pursuant to the contract. Defendant therefore possesses certain mining rights which were assigned to him by plaintiff. This was the <em>material </em>part of the consideration given by plaintiff. That this is what the parties contemplated becomes even more apparent when the manner in which plaintiff was to be compensated is. examined. The contract provided that plaintiff was to receive five cents per ton on at least one-third of all coal carried over <em>both </em>sidings. This would be so whether or not <em>any </em>coal was ever carried over the Troy No. 10 siding. The only time, according to the terms of the contract, that the amount of coal carried over the Troy siding would become. important would be when more than one-third of all coal hauled over both sidings was' carried over the Troy siding, for which, as stated above, plaintiff was to be compensated at the rate of five cents per ton on all coal shipped over this siding. It is clear <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>the consideration given by plaintiff to defendant was <em>not </em>the right to use the Troy siding, <em>but the right to operate plaintiff’s strip mining lease. </em>As was said in <em>Sentry Safety Control Corp. v.

It is clear that the parties never intended that performance by defendant should be excused by the withdrawal of the railroad company of plaintiff’s right to use the Troy siding. The defendant still, continues to possess the right to operate the strip mining facilities given up-by plaintiff.</p>
