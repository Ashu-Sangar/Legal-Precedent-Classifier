By her will she gave to her son John a cash legacy of $1,000 and a pair of diamond earrings to him and his daughter Virginia (now Virginia Krecker). To her other two sons, Robert and Louis, testatrix devised absolutely, inter alia, the American Theatre Building (now the Hollywood Theatre), being premises No. 7 South Centre Street, Pottsville, and the building at No. 122 South Centre Street, Pottsville, giving Robert a one-third undivided interest therein and Louis a two-thirds undivided interest, with a proviso that in the event either Robert or Louis wished to sell his interest in these properties the other should have the preference. Her entire residuary estate, comprising Colorado mining properties and stocks and bonds appraised at $121,685, testatrix likewise gave to Robert and Louis, one-third thereof to Robert and two-thirds to Louis, and she appointed Louis as her executor.</p>

Brenneman, <em>in pursuance of an oral agreement with said Emma R. Brenneman in her lifetime, </em>do by these presents make known, admit and declare that the following bonds and stocks, a part of the personal estate of said Emma R. Brenneman, <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>deceased, are held by me in trust only as hereinafter set out, and that I have no beneficial interest therein.” There follows a schedule of securities representing in value one-half of the two-thirds interest in personalty given to Louis under the residuary clause. The instrument then provides for payment of the income to John for life, with remainder to John’s daughter, Virginia, the principal to be paid to her upon attaining twenty-one years of age, and in the event of her death before attaining her majority to the four sons of Robert or the survivors of them.</p>

Brenneman, <em>in consideration of one dollar and other good and valuable considerations to me in hand paid by John F. Brenneman </em>of the Borough of Schuylkill Haven, County and State aforesaid, do hereby acknowledge and declare that I hold a one third interest in said above mentioned real estate in trust for the benefit of John F. Brenneman during his lifetime,” with remainder to John’s daughter, Virginia, to be conveyed to her upon attaining twenty-one years of age, and in the event of her death before arriving at twenty-one years of age, to the four sons of Robert or the survivor or survivors of them in equal shares. Unlike the declaration of 1933, relating solely to personalty, this declaration of trust made no reference to any understanding between Louis and his mother, or to any request on her part regarding the two-thirds interest in real estate.</p>

L. 129, 20 PS 31, which provides : “The shares of the estate directed by this act to be allotted to the widow shall be in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower at common law, so far as relates to land of which the husband died seised; <em>and her share in lands aliened by the husband in his lifetime, without her joining in the </em>conveyance, <em>shall be the same as her share in lands of which the husband died </em>seised(Italics supplied.) By agreement of the parties one-sixth of. the rents from these properties was collected and held in escrow by the Miners National Bank of Pottsville pending a judicial determination of the widow’s rights. A petition for declaratory judgment filed by the widow on November 6, 1916, was dismissed by the court below for lack of jurisdiction, with the suggestion that a substituted trustee be appointed and an account filed by it at the audit of which the conflicting claims might be presented and adjudicated. The Miners Bank of Potts-ville was made substituted trustee on May 7, 1917, and filed its account on the same date, showing a balance of $11,-285.56 for distribution.</p>

This contention was rejected by the court below, on the ground of lack of evidence to establish an oral trust, and the balance for distribution was awarded to the widow, Anna B. Brenneman. Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed and John and Virginia Krecker filed appeals in this Court. Before the appeals were argued, however, the case was remanded on petition of appellants setting forth that after-discovered documentary evidence had been found which would “clearly and conclusively” establish the existence of an oral trust. The case was reopened by the court below for the purpose of considering the after-discovered evidence, consisting of the copy of the declaration of 1933, relating to personalty, and other evidence in the form of books and records of Louis’, establishing payment by him to John of one-third of the rents from real estate prior to as well as subsequent to the declaration of 1935. After hearing, the court below entered a decree reinstating its prior adjudication and ratifying and confirming its decree of distribution awarding the balance to Anna B. Brenneman.</p>

Here, as the court below states, “there is not one word of testimony to show when or under what circumstances or in what words Emma R. Brenneman charged her son with the trust declared by him in 1935.” Apart from the declaration of trust itself, which makes no reference to any understanding or agreement between Louis and his mother, the only evidence consists of the copy of the declaration of 1933 as to personalty, and Louis’ conduct in paying one-third of the rents to John prior to 1935. Belying on this, appellants argue that “Since Emma provided for John in the division of the personal residuary estate it would <em>logically </em>follow that the same provision was made as to the real estate; otherwise, why did Louis execute the second Declaration and why did he, for the four years prior to its execution, pay John his full share of the rents received by him as agent?”</p>

It may be conceded that Louis’ conduct in making payments of a one-third share of the rents, like his execution of the declaration of trust itself, is entirely consistent with the existence of an oral agreement with his mother: But that this is so does not provide the necessary legal proof of the fact of the existence of such understanding, for it is just as consistent with the theory of a voluntary declaration of trust, or with the theory that Louis was attempting to carry out a mere expression of desire on the part of his mother, not intended to impose any legal obligation upon him. Or, indeed, it may be conjectured, as appellee suggests, that Louis was motivated solely by a determination to defeat her rights rather than by any oral understanding with Emma R. Brenneman.</p>

Hollis, </em>supra, testatrix, gave three-fifths of her residuary estate, consisting of a manufacturing business and real estate, to a son, one of four surviving children, and appointed him as executor. The favored son wrote a letter to a disappointed brother stating that the business would be conducted for the benefit of the children equally, and a bill in equity was filed to enforce an oral trust. The court below dismissed the bill and its decree was affirmed on appeal to this Court. Referring to the evidence in that case, the opinion states, pp. 95, 96: “Its interpretation as indicating the existence of a trust imposed by the testatrix and accepted by defendant can rest upon nothing but a mere guess, which is not permissible. ... it may just as well be taken as an original voluntary declaration of trust, or as evidencing a family arrangement since the testatrix’s death. Neither the one nor the other of these, both being at variance with the right alleged in the plaintiff’s bill, would serve his case or warrant a decree in his favor. The possibility, however, of the - conflicting acceptations of its meaning makes the letter unavailable as proof of what <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>plaintiff wants to show by it. An item of evidence equally calculated to prove one or two other things, inconsistent with the proposition contended for, cannot be made the basis of a finding affirming that proposition.” This language applies with equal force to the evidence relied upon in the present case.</p>

Moodhard, </em><a href="/pa/341/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="341 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1204543" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0273-01">341 Pa. 273</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20101" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="19 A.2d 101">19 A. 2d 101</a>, was an action of assumpsit upon an oral agreement concerning the disposition of moneys received from the sale of real estate.
