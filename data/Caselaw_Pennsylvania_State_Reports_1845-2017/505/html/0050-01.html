Jones, (hereinafter referred to as “Candidate”), who was seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination for Senator in the General Assembly as the representative of the Third Senatorial District. The order of March 28, 1984 directed the Secretary of the Commonwealth to certify to the County Board of Elections of Philadelphia the name of the Candidate so that it would appear on the Democratic Ballot, within the said district, in the Primary Election to be held on April 10, 1984.</p>

Judge Rogers did not find that the candidate was not a resident of the address appearing in her nomination petition at the time she executed the candidate’s affidavit. Further, it is agreed that her listed residence in the petition is within the Third Senatorial District. Most important, Judge Rogers <em>did not find any false statements </em>in the affidavit filed by the Candidate. Thus the issue <em>is not </em>whether a nomination petition may be set aside where it is established that the petition contained a false candidate’s affidavit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Judge Rogers did not attempt to assign a defect in the petition as the basis for his order requiring that the petition be set aside. Rather, he concluded that in view of his determination that appellant had failed to establish that she was an <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>“inhabitant” within the district on or before November 6, 1983,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> she could not satisfy the provisions of Article 2, section 5 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and for that reason she should not be permitted to run for the office. Thus the question presented to us was whether or not Article 2, section 5 dictates that a court should make an <em>a priori </em>determination of whether a candidate meets the constitutional requirements for the office she seeks to obtain and on the basis of that judgment deny the candidate the right to put her name before the public for their consideration.</p>

The Objectors properly raised the issue of Ms. Jones’s residence and Judge Rogers properly considered it. We should have reviewed his decision on its merits. As a result of our failure to do so the ■ issue of whether Roxanne Jones can constitutionally serve remains undetermined and its determination is unnecessarily entrusted to a political branch whose decisions are routinely and properly based on the majorities of the moment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> to whom it is largely responsible. The essence of a constitution is the insulation of its commands from that type of determination wherever possible. The institution which is charged with providing that insulation is the judiciary. Ideally, we proceed on reason to which we are largely responsible and our decisions on the constitution, within the limits of our own constitutional power, thus gain an acceptance which constitutional decisions of the more political branches do not have. I cannot avoid the belief that this Court’s decision not to review Judge Rogers’s determination of Ms. Jones’s constitutionally required residential connec<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>tion with her prospective constituents is wrong, and the reasoning the plurality advances to support it is fallacious and internally inconsistent.</p>

The issue of justiciability was raised <em>sua sponte </em>ignoring the long-standing practice of considering such challenges under the Election Code. <em>See infra, </em>at 75. In this connection we note that the issue the plurality considers is precisely one of justiciability, not of jurisdiction.</p>

They satisfy the requirements of our Rules of Civil Procedure. They also satisfy the statutory requirement that they be specific.</p>

It seems to use them indiscriminately to support: its holding of non-justiciability under the Election Code; its later holding that judicial enforcement of Ms. Jones’s right to be on the ballot is justiciable; and its dictum that matters involving the Senate’s Article II, Section 9 power "to judge of the election and qualifications of its members” is the subject both of concurrent jurisdiction and judicial review. On the last issue see Part III of this dissent.</p>

Moreover, by leaving the very serious challenge to the qualifications of candidate Jones unresolved until after the general election, the opinion supporting the orders of the court creates an unnecessary likelihood of a special election should Ms. Jones win the general election and the Senate determine that she is not qualified under Article II, Section 5. Such special elections are sometimes necessary but never desirable. They frequently leave the residents of a district unrepresented for substantial periods of time. They require constitutionally qualified candidates to face a second campaign, a costly and demanding process, as a result of a constitutionally unqualified candidate’s participation in the first election.</p>
