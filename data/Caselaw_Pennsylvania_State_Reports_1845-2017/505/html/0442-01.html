On or about 1:00 p.m. on December 22, 1977, Richard Brooke and Charles Haag were making door-to-door Christmas deliveries of fresh poultry and eggs in the Strawberry Mansion section of Philadelphia. As Mr. Haag was about to enter the truck following a delivery, appellant and his accomplice, June O’Bryant, accosted Haag from behind, each wielding a .38 caliber revolver. June O’Bryant went into the truck where he forced Mr. Brooke to turn over the day’s proceeds, while outside the truck, appellant fired a single shot into Mr. Haag’s chest. Mr. Haag started to run but collapsed on his back in the gutter. Appellant then turned Mr. Haag face down in a puddle, knelt on his neck and back, and rifled his pockets. Appellant and O’Bryant then fled.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Mr. Haag died as a result of this gunshot wound.</p>

It was also established that Mr. Haag had been killed by an unusual .38 caliber copper-coated bullet.

At trial, seven witnesses were called for the defense. As the prosecutor began to cross-examine these witnesses, he asked each if they had previously given any statements to defense counsel.

Appellant argues that the comparison between himself and the star of <em>In Cold Blood </em>was calculated to, and did in fact, “inflame and prejudice the members of the jury”. We do not agree. While the prosecutor’s theatrical comparison may have been poorly chosen, we think it apparent, in the context of the record as a whole, that the reference to certain movies was simply a dramatic device intended to put the jury’s task into perspective, that is, the task of making a “movie” from the “still pictures” (the evidence) presented. Moreover, we <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>hardly think the jury could have been swayed by this passing reference to a movie that was more than fifteen years old, the violence level of which had been more than equaled in 1978 by daily, prime-time television fare.</p>
