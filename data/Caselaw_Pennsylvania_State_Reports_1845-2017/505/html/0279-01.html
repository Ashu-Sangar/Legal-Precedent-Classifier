Appellant fled from the scene of the crime, and, until July 16, 1980, remained at large. On the latter date, appellant again committed murder, the victim this time being a Philadelphia police officer. Appellant was brought to trial and convicted in the police killing case prior to commencement of trial for the Singleton homicide. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Upon being stopped, appellant exited from the van and was chased by the detective a short distance before stumbling to the ground and being apprehended. While appellant lay upon the ground, the detective noticed that the van contained yet another person, and, in the course of positioning himself to order that other person out of the van, the detective saw appellant throw his shirt into the air and then heard a loud thud, after which the shirt fell back to the ground. At the time he threw his shirt into the air, appellant was recumbent upon the ground in close proximity to an eight foot high cinderblock wall. Police recovered from the roof above the cinderblock wall a sawed-off shotgun, in addition to a revolver that appellant had used to kill the policeman. While appellant was in custody in connection with the police shooting, it was scientifically determined that the shotgun had been used in the Singleton homicide three months earlier; hence, appellant was charged with an additional crime, the Singleton murder.</p>

During cross-examination of the detective who found the shotgun, defense counsel intentionally elicited, for the first time in the trial, the fact that an additional weapon, the revolver, was found on the roof with the shotgun. No mention was made, however, of the fact that the revolver had been used to commit a crime. Cross-examination proceeded in a manner directed at showing the improbability of appellant having been able to throw two weapons onto the roof, from a reclining position on the ground several feet from the cinderblock wall. In pursuing this line of questioning, defense counsel’s strategy was to show that appellant threw his shirt onto the roof in an effort to disassociate himself from a quantity of marijuana which was later discovered by detectives to have been in the shirt pocket, and, thus, to show that the shirt hit the roof, by mere coincidence, near two weapons that had been placed there at a previous time by some other person.</p>

    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[192,559,1154,1510]]]'>It is alleged that the jury was improperly permitted to consider as a prior murder conviction a verdict of guilt of murder of the first degree rendered three months prior to the instant trial, a verdict as to which a judgment of sentence had not yet been entered because post-trial motions were still pending. Post-trial motions had been continued at the request of the defense, but were denied subsequent to the instant trial. In short, it is argued that a verdict of guilt may not be considered a prior “conviction,” constituting an aggravating circumstance under 42 Pa.C. S.A. § 9711(d)(9) supra., until a judgment of sentence has been entered. This Court recently rejected this argument in connection with determining what constitutes a conviction for purposes of one of the other enumerated aggravating circumstances set forth in the same sub-section of the sentencing code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(10), which states that it is an aggravating circumstance when “[t]he defendant has been <em>convicted </em>of another Federal or State offense, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable____” (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Travaglia, </em>we held that a judgment of sentence need not already have been entered following a finding of guilt in order for the finding to be considered as a conviction constituting the aggravating circumstance in (d)(10), thus ruling that the legislature employed the term “convicted” in this provision to mean “found guilty” rather than “found guilty and sentenced.”</p>

Under this approach, no error accrues unless the subsequently entered judgments of sentence are overturned on appeal. This comports with the traditional function of the penalty stage to focus upon aspects of a defendant’s character. See <em>Commonwealth v.

The relevant sentencing provision, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(9) supra., contains no <em>express </em>reference to the factual settings of past crimes or to the sentences imposed as being matters appropriate for the jury’s consideration. Thus, it is asserted that the prosecution’s evidence should have been limited to establishing the mere fact that appellant was convicted of previous murders, without elaboration as to the facts and circumstances, or as to the types of sentences imposed. Inasmuch as 42 Pa.C. S.A. § 9711(d) begins with the preface, “Aggravating circumstances shall be limited to the following ... ”, it is clear that the legislature did not intend consideration by the jury of matters extraneous to the enumerated aggravating circumstances. The relevant provision, (d)(9), focuses upon past “convictions” as being an aggravating circumstance. We do not believe the legislative reference to “convictions” is so narrow in scope as. to render extraneous all of the facts and circumstances of the convictions, or the sentences imposed.</p>

Consideration of prior “convictions” was not intended to be a meaningless and abstract ritual, but rather a process through which a jury would gain considerable insight into a defendant’s character. The nature of an offense, as ascertained through examination of the circumstances concomitant to its commission, has much bearing upon the character of a defendant, and, indeed, without reference to those facts and circumstances, consideration of “convictions” would be a hollow process, yielding far less information about a defendant’s character than is relevant.</p>
