A jury found Garcia guilty of felony murder and robbery.

This is Garcia’s direct appeal from these sentences. Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, 42 Pa.C.S. § 722(1), right abolished by Act of September 23, 1980, P.L. 686, No. 137.

He argues that psychiatric testimony should be admissible to negate "specific intent" with respect to any crime requiring such an element. Our Crimes Code does not include either the expression "specific” or “general” intent. However, we have used the expression "specific intent to kill” to refer to the culpable mental state required for first degree murder which is defined in the Crimes Code as an "intentional killing.” <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a). The term “intentional killing” in turn, is defined for purposes of first degree murder as a “willful, deliberate and premeditated” killing. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d). The Crimes Code does not use the expression "specific intent” to describe the culpable mental state included as an element of robbery or any other crime. Instead, where the word "intent” describes the culpable mental state for an element of an offense, it is defined as the <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>actor's "conscious" object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result. 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(b)(1). In this case appellant argues that psychiatric testimony is admissible to show he was incapable of forming the "intent” or "conscious desire” to steal.</p>
      <p id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.2",360,[285,471,1118,779]]]'>That argument involves the question of whether the defense generally denominated diminished capacity, heretofore recognized in this Commonwealth as available only on a first degree murder charge, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walzack, <a href="/pa/468/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="468 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1719630" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0210-01">supra,</a> </em>should be extended to robbery. That issue is not open to appellant because he admitted the theft which is a necessary component of robbery and by so doing admitted precisely the same “specific” intent, <em>i.e., </em>intent to withhold the property of another, which robbery requires. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3701, § 3901 and § 3921. Furthermore, the question posed at trial which he says raised this issue, <em>see </em>at 476, <em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">supra,</a> </em>is plainly intended to pose the defense that such intent must be formulated before the homicide. In asserting this defense, appellant apparently relies on our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Legg, </em><a href="/pa/491/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="491 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1765683" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0078-01">491 Pa. 78</a>, <a href="/pa/491/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="491 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1765683" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0078-01">417 A.2d 1152</a> (1980), in which we held that the felony-murder doctrine is inapplicable where the actor kills prior to forming the intent to commit the underlying felony. As Mr. Chief Justice Nix notes, this holding represented a departure from prior law and has been criticized. However, the issue of whether the defense announced in <em>Legg </em>should continue to be the law of this Commonwealth is not before us on this appeal and, therefore, we will not consider it here.</p>

In fact, any such contention would be irreconcilable with his defense at trial, <em>i.e., </em>that he is guilty only of third degree murder and theft. Considering these facts, as well as the difference between the “intent” required for first degree murder and the “intent” defined in Section 302 of the Crimes Code for all other crimes which require "intent" as the element of an offense, we are not inclined to use this case as a vehicle to expand the diminished capacity defense beyond first degree murder. Indeed, were we to do so, the so-called limited defense of diminished capacity would become an absolute defense to all those crimes which include in their particular definition mental states of greater culpability than those set forth in our Crimes Code’s section on general culpability. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 302(c). <em>See abo </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 308, which permits evidence of voluntary intoxication, when relevant, only to reduce murder from a higher to a lower degree.

Although the defense of intoxication is not entirely analogous to that of diminished capacity <em>(see </em>Mr. Justice Eagen, dissenting in <em>Graves, <a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">461 Pa. at 128</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">334 A.2d at 666</a>) they share the common element of a mental impairment which prevents cognitive formation of intent at the conscious level.

However, I strenuously disagree with Mr. Justice Hutchinson’s bald conclusion that psychiatric testimony is admissible only to negate the specific intent required to establish first degree murder. If the defense had offered proper evidence, either psychiatric or otherwise, to negate the specific intent required by the underlying felony, that evidence should have been submitted to the jury for their assessment in the determination of the applicability of the felony murder principle to the case. Additionally, viewing the entire trial record I agree that the behavior of the attorney for the Commonwealth does not warrant the conclusion that the judgment of sentence must be vacated and a new trial awarded.</p>
