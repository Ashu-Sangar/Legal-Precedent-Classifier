The Commonwealth contends the District Justice clearly intended to issue a warrant when he took the policeman’s oath to the affidavit of probable cause and his failure to sign the order issuing the warrant is a technicality which can be ignored. We hold that both our Pennsylvania Constitution and the federal Constitution require an order by the District Justice, as a judicial officer, and that his jurat on a policeman’s affidavit of probable cause is no substitute for the judicial decision our Constitution requires for issuance of a search warrant. In the absence of an order by an independent judicial officer no search warrant could issue. Thus, the State Police’s search in this case must be analyzed as one without warrant. As such, it can stand only if exigent circumstances are present. They are not. Indeed, there is not even an effort to show them. Under these circumstances, Common Pleas correctly suppressed the fruits of the search under the federally mandated exclusionary rule. Therefore, we reverse the order of Superior Court and reinstate the order of Common Pleas.</p>

The application recited that the premises to be searched were those of James M. Chandler a/k/a “Jumbo” Chandler and that the items to be seized were narcotics, amphetamines and barbituates. Trooper Pompei’s detailed affidavit was based on information received from two confidential informants. Trooper Pompei signed the affidavit and District Justice Tempest merely affixed his jurat to the affidavit on a printed line below large type stating “sworn to and subscribed before me.” By doing so he only evidenced the policeman’s recitation to him of those facts, under oath. He did not find them to be true nor conclude that they justified a warrant.</p>

By definition, an affidavit is a statement of facts confirmed by oath before an officer having authority to administer the oath. The jurat is merely the certificate of the judicial officer stating that the affidavit was sworn to and subscribed by the affiant before him. Such a sworn statement before the District Justice or some other person authorized to administer oaths is necessary before the District Justice can consider the facts set forth to in it as evidence of the probable cause required to issue a warrant. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 2003.</p>

Super. 107" data-case-ids="817956" data-case-paths="/pa-super/240/0107-01">240 Pa.Superior Ct. 107</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=368%20A.2d%20324" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="368 A.2d 324">368 A.2d 324</a> (1976), the magistrate failed to sign either the affidavit or the warrant. Defendant filed a motion to suppress on the grounds that the magistrate had not issued a warrant. The suppression court granted the Commonwealth's motion to amend the affidavit and warrant and permitted the magistrate to sign and seal it. Superior Court concluded that the defect in the warrant was informal and, therefore, the Commonwealth had the right to amend at any time pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 150. To the extent that <em>Lardo </em>holds that an unsigned warrant may be amended, it is overruled.</p>
