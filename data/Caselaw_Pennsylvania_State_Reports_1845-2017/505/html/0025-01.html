On June 16, 1981, appellee Jones, a member of the Pittsburgh Fire Department, returned home from his shift at 7:30 A.M. to find his home burglarized and his stereo system stolen. Jones spoke with several neighbors and learned that the stereo was probably being hidden in an abandoned building behind <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>Jones’s house. Jones reported the theft to the police, and requested their help in retrieving his property. The police told Jones that because of lack of manpower, they could not stake out the building or accompany him to get his property. They told him to retrieve it 'himself.</p>
    <p id="b76-4" data-blocks='[["BL_76.4",76,[267,568,1156,356]]]'>Jones armed himself with a .22 caliber pistol and began searching the building. During the search, he was surprised by two boys<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> who had returned. A scuffle .ensued, with one of the youths coming after Jones, the other running away from Jones. Jones opened fire, wounding both youths. The fleeing juvenile died from a shot in the back of the head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[264,952,1157,521]]]'>Jones himself admitted that the other wounded boy called him by name and asked for help. He responded by demanding to know where his stereo was. The wounded boy indicated it was in a green van parked outside the building. Jones stepped over him, went to the van and retrieved the stereo. Jones did not call for aid, and fled as police and paramedics, called by neighbors who saw the wounded boy, were arriving. Shortly thereafter, Jones turned himself in to the police and voluntarily gave a statement relating the incident.</p>
    <p id="b76-6" data-blocks='[["BL_76.6",76,[262,1501,1155,412]]]'>On that record the Civil Service Commission concluded that Jones acted in self-defense and not in an unbecoming manner. We believe Jones’s prior conduct in arming himself before seeking self-help to right a personal wrong established his willingness to act violently and use deadly force in circumstances the law does not permit. Such conduct is conduct unbecoming an officer in the uniformed fire service as a matter of law.</p>

The Fire Trial Board<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> convened on July 1, 1981 to hear charges that Jones had violated Department of Fire Regulations 19.02, 19.03 and 19.04.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Jones pleaded not guilty. At that time, charges of criminal homicide and aggravated assault were pending against Jones, and the City offered to postpone the hearing until after the criminal trial if appellee would agree to a suspension without pay. He refused, and the Board took testimony, adjourning without a decision, pending the outcome of appellee’s trial.</p>

The City offered to resolve the charges by allowing him to return to work without back pay, a total of some $8,000. The Board ultimately found Jones guilty of all charges of conduct unbecoming an officer, fined him $5,000 (to be covered by his back pay), and <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>returned him to work with the balance of his back pay restored. The mayor of Pittsburgh approved this recommendation pursuant to 53 P.S. §§ 23495 and 23496.</p>

Allegheny County Common Pleas reversed, holding that he was guilty of unbecoming conduct as a matter of law. Commonwealth Court vacated Common Pleas’s order and remanded the case to the Commission for a finding of fact as to what occurred after the shooting. We granted the City’s petition for allowance of appeal, and now reinstate the order of Common Pleas Court.</p>

As the majority correctly states, it is the duty of the Commission to make a record of the proceedings and determine findings of fact. Our function is limited to determining whether the Commission committed an error of law, abused its discretion, or entered a decision unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Williams v. Civil Service Commission, </em><a href="/pa/457/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="457 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="478079" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0470-01">457 Pa. 470</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%2070" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="327 A.2d 70">327 A.2d 70</a> (1974); <em>Foley v.

Failing to meet this criteria we are bound to adopt the adjudication of the Commission.</p>
    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[281,914,1157,777]]]'>The majority has concluded that “[t]he Commission ignored the evidence and admissions on what happened after the shooting and avoided any specific findings of fact on the post-shooting events.” (At 30). With this conclusion I cannot agree. It is clear that part of the record before the Commission included the transcripts of both.hearings before the Fire Trial Board. Furthermore, during the Commission hearing, the Appellee testified that he did not call the police or medical assistance because upon exiting the house, he heard that someone else was summoning them and shortly thereafter heard sirens. Clearly, the issue was raised and considered by the Commission. Contrary to the majority’s Opinion, the Commission decided to believe the Appellee and determined that his conduct after the shooting did not demonstrate conduct unbecoming of an officer.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[278,1709,1155,611]],["BL_83.1",83,[180,293,1152,255]]]'>Furthermore, the majority holds that the record supports the conclusion that as a matter of law, the Appellee’s conduct was conduct unbecoming of an officer. In so holding, the majority relies upon certain facts of record. The majority concludes that the Appellee’s decision to engage in self-help to retrieve his stolen property belittled the position of firemen. The record before the Commission indicates that the Appellee had no intention of taking the law into his own hands. Instead, the Appellee first requested police assistance to retrieve his stolen property, only to be rebuffed. It was only then that the Appellee attempted to secure his stolen items. At no time does the record <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>reflect any intention to inflict retribution against the thieves. Furthermore, both at the criminal trial and at the Commission hearing, the Appellee testified that he was attacked while in the house and that the subsequent shooting was an accident.</p>
    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[179,564,1155,410]]]'>Although I might reach a different conclusion than the Commission, if given the opportunity to observe the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, under the law I must defer to its determination provided it is supported by substantial evidence. Based upon the foregoing, I cannot say as a matter of law that the Appellee’s conduct was unbecoming of an officer and must therefore dissent from the majority Opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

      <p id="b83-13" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[181,1876,1151,470]]]'>. In reviewing this record, I found the City Solicitor’s position in this case quite disturbing. In particular, I disagree with the prosecutorial rule he adopted, thereby effectively leaving the Fire Trial Board without legal counsel. If the Solicitor intends to continue as a quasi prosecutor, then the City better provide special legislation to provide a legal advisor for the Fire Trial Board. Furthermore, I must comment on a second peculiarity with this appeal. Although the Appellant now expresses deep concern about the Appellee’s conduct after the shooting, such was not the case at the second Fire Trial Board hearing. At that hearing, the City was concerned only with the issue of back pay. Apparently, the issue of the Appellee’s post-shooting actions only surfaced during the arguments before the Commonwealth Court.</p>
