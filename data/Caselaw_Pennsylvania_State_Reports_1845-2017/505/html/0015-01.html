Paris Manufacturing Company, a producer of garment finishing equipment, is incorporated in this Commonwealth and maintains just one manufacturing facility, that plant being situated in Brockway, Pennsylvania. Executive offices, including those of the company’s president, are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and from those offices emanate all activities affecting sales of equipment manufactured in Pennsylvania. Sales efforts are comprised of advertisements in trade journals, trade show exhibitions in New Jersey and Illinois, and the services of three salesmen retained through an affiliated corporation, over which Paris Manufacturing Company’s president in Cambridge also presides, who solicit orders nationwide. All orders received are subject to approval at the offices in Cambridge. During the tax year in question, ending December 31, 1971, sales were made to customers in forty-three states, the District of Columbia, and several foreign countries.</p>

It maintains manufacturing facilities and several factory-outlet retail stores in Pennsylvania and Maryland, office facilities in Pennsylvania and New York, and a large showroom in New York City. During the tax year in question, ending April 30, 1975, sales were made to customers in each of the fifty states and in the District of Columbia, such sales having been procured through eighteen salesmen, each stationed in his own territory. Supervision of the salesmen’s activities, as well as initial processing of the orders they procure, occurs in New York City. Certain customers having long-established relationships with Doe Spun, Inc. deal directly with sales executives at the showroom-office in New York City rather than through regional salesmen. The showroom is utilized for meetings with customers’ buyers, and contains exhibits of the compa<a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>ny’s entire product line. Sales promotions are also directed from that location, and include trade show exhibitions conducted throughout the country and advertisements in national trade publications. In addition, all of the company’s designers and fashion coordinators are located in New York City, due to the fact that their functions are integrated with sales efforts.</p>

The Tax Reform Code of 1971 provides for this amount to be determined by multiplying a corporation’s total net income by an apportionment figure calculated for each tax period as the average of three statutory fractions: 1.) the property fraction (value of real and tangible personal property owned or rented in Pennsylvania value of all such property of the taxpayer everywhere); 2.) the payroll fraction (compensation paid in Pennsylvania -f-total compensation paid by the taxpayer everywhere); and 3.) the sales fraction (sales in Pennsylvania total sales by the taxpayer everywhere). 72 P.S. § 7401(3)2(a)(9), (10), (13), (15) (Supp.1983). Calculated in this manner for each of the appellants, the three fractions, and the related apportionment figures, are as follows.</p>

This resulted in the exclusion of approxi<a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>mately 85% of the sales of Paris Manufacturing Company and 78% of the sales of Doe Spun, Inc., since the former pays taxes in only Pennsylvania and Massachusetts while the latter is taxed in just Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New York. The consequent increases in the sales fractions, to .9273 and .4580 respectively, and, hence, in the apportionment figures, to .9265 and .6729 respectively, caused additional taxes to be assessed against both appellants.

Thus, modification of the statutory apportionment calculation is authorized, under provision (D), but <em>only </em>upon satisfaction of the precondition that the standard formulas be not fairly representative of the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in Pennsylvania. The Board’s general practice<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>, in determining whether that precondition is satisfied, is to ascertain, first, whether the sales <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>fraction is disproportionate to the property or payroll fractions, and second, whether sales not included in the numerator of the sales fraction are destined to states where the taxpayer is not jurisdictionally subject to tax on income, and third, whether exclusion from the sales fraction denominator, via the “throw out” process, of all such untaxed sales would result in an increase in tax liability of ten percent or more. If all of these criteria are satisfied, the Board concludes, as it did with respect to the appellants, that the statutory apportionment formula does not fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activities in Pennsylvania, and that the “throw out” rule should be applied to revise upwards the tax liability.</p>

Appellants attempt to distinguish the instant cases from that of <em>Hellertown </em>where the taxpayer’s property and payroll fractions were both 100%, while its sales fraction was just 1%, by contending that the taxpayer therein was involved in certain unusual inter-corporate transactions, as a wholly-owned subsidiary trading only with its parent company, that caused 99% of sales to ostensibly have been made outside of Pennsylvania while there were allegedly no activities conducted out-of-state to generate those sales. The question of whether the statutory formula for apportionment, under the facts present in <em>Hellertown, </em>inadequately reflected the taxpayer’s business activities in this Commonwealth is not presently to be re-examined. We cannot, however, with any degree of intellectual credibility, distinguish the facts relied upon by this Court in that decision from those of the present case, where a contrary result is indicated. The allegedly distinguishing facts, regarding inter-corporate dealings and lack of actual out-of-state sales activities, now claimed by appellants to have been pivotal to the sustainment by this Court of application of the “throw out” rule in that case were in fact not relied upon, or even referred to, in our decision, though <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>they were set forth in the lower court’s opinion in that case.

Rather, our decision in <em>Hellertown </em>must fairly be read as according the statutory provision in question, allowing for modification of the apportionment formula when business activity in this Commonwealth is not thereby fairly reflected, a construction which <em>deems </em>as business activities in this state such activities as occur in other states that lack jurisdiction to impose taxes. Re-examination of the rationale underlying that construction, however, reveals a misplaced reliance upon concepts of jurisdiction to interpret a provision that is, in plain terms, clear in meaning and not jurisdictionally dependent. We are, therefore, compelled to overrule our decision in <em>Hellertown.</em>

In determining whether a taxpayer is “taxable both within and without this State,” the taxpayer is regarded as “taxable in another state if, in that state he is subject to a ... tax, or that state has <em>jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not.” </em>72 P.S. § 7401(3)2(a)(3) (Supp.1983) (emphasis added). Thus, although resort to the apportionment provisions is conditioned upon being subject to another state’s tax jurisdiction, once qualification for apportionment is established then net income must be apportioned “as provided”, 72 P.S. § 7401(3)2(a)(2) <em>supra., </em>and the legislature has provided for apportionment to be governed by a statutory formula, except where that formula does not fairly reflect the extent of the taxpayer’s business activities in Pennsylvania.</p>

We perceive no defect in the logic, or fairness, of a statutory scheme that results in income being apportioned to states not imposing a tax, provided the scheme assures, as does the present one, that tax burdens are borne so as to correlate with benefits derived from business activities in fact conducted in this Commonwealth. To <em>deem </em>as business activities in this Commonwealth such activities as occur elsewhere, simply because those activities are not elsewhere taxed, is to vitiate the apportionment provision designed to tax “business activity <em>in this State.” </em>(emphasis added.) It is to be emphasized, therefore, that whether other states in which a corporation does business choose or do not choose to levy an income tax on that corporation is irrelevant to a determination of the corporation’s taxable income in Pennsylvania.</p>

Indeed, for the typical company, such activities are of varied types and may normally occur in widely differing concentrations in multiple states. In recognition of this, the legislature has provided a standard apportionment formula comprised of the foregoing three fractional components, each of which reflects a realm of business activity capable of having its primary locus in a different state. When, as applied to a given taxpayer, the fractional components do in fact widely vary, the apportionment formula will normally provide the measure of business activity contemplated by the legislature, absent circumstances subverting the representations provided by the fractional components.</p>
