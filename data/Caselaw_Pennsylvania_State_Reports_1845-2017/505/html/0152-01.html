Paul Kent visited the appellant and his live-in paramour, Ann Gasper, at appellant’s house, but no encyclopedias were purchased because neither of them had any funds.</p>

According to Ann Gasper’s testimony, appellant told her and co-defendant Gary Mobley, who had been present in appellant’s house that day, that he was going to rob the salesman and kill him if necessary. At appellant’s request Gary Mobley went to a nearby store to buy some trashbags. Appellant told Ms. Gasper to go upstairs and get the children ready as they were going to the store. In the meantime, Mr. Kent arrived at appellant’s house and for a brief while they discussed the books.</p>

When she descended Ms. Gasper observed Paul Kent’s body slumped in a dining room chair, dead. He had been shot twice in the head at close range. Appellant told Ms. Gasper to wash Mr. Kent’s blood from the wall, carpet and chair while he and Gary Mobley stuffed the lifeless victim in trash bags and carried it to the cellar, where they removed the victim’s wallet. Taking Mr. Kent’s car the trio drove to Wanamaker’s Department Store in Philadelphia, where they purchased a purse and two television sets with the victim’s credit card, being the exchange for Paul Kent’s life. The television sets were never claimed at the pick-up depart<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ment because the Wanamaker’s salesman became suspicious of appellant’s purchase and had the sets returned to his department.</p>

The following morning, appellant broke the basement door to prevent his teenage girls from entering the basement. Ms. Gasper wrote a note to the children informing them of the basement door and that she and appellant were out shopping and would return later that evening.</p>

The girls went outside to a pay booth to telephone their grandmother. En route they approached two police officers who were observing the house from a car across the street and informed them of what they had seen. The police had been waiting for the arrival of a search warrant for appellant’s house. The police officers requested permission to enter the house and the daughters granted it.</p>

Moreover, under subsection (d)(1) of Rule 1100, the fourteen months that appellant evaded the police after the June 6 complaint was filed are explicitly excluded from calculating the 180 day period.

Appellant, however, ignores the uncontradicted evidence that it was Yolanda who approached the police officers in their car and asked them to come inside the house because she wanted to show them what was in the trash bag in the basement. The police neither forced themselves upon Yolanda nor used their authority as a pretext to gain entry into appellant’s house.

These studies now demonstrate convincingly that persons favoring the death penalty are significantly more likely to vote for conviction in capital cases and that persons excluded from jury service on the basis of their unwillingness to impose the death penalty represent a distinct and sizeable group in the community. Thus it would appear that <em>Witherspoon </em>no longer presents a valid obstacle to the challenge raised herein.

Those indicating an unwillingness to impose the death penalty in any case were classified as <em>“Witherspoon </em>-excludables” while those who stated they would consider voting to impose it in some cases were labeled “death qualified.” The participants were also asked whether they would be fair and impartial in deciding the question of*guilt or innocence, and those who answered that they would not were excluded. The remaining subjects were shown a videotape of a simulated trial “complex enough to afford several plausible interpretations and verdict preferences.” <em>Id. </em>at 63. A verdict questionnaire was distributed to each participant at the conclusion of the videotape. A tabulation of the votes revealed that <em>77.9 percent </em>of the death qualified subjects voted to convict of some level of homicide, as opposed to only 53.3 percent of the <em>Witherspoon </em>-excludables, a highly significant difference of <em>25 </em>percent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> The Cowan study is of considerable <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>importance not only for its finding of a high correlation between death penalty attitudes and conviction-proneness, but also because it successfully replicated the results of prior <em>post-Witherspoon </em>studies. <em>See </em>Jurow, <em>New Data on the Effect of a Death Qualified Jury on the Guilt Determination Process, </em><a href="/citations/?q=84%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20567" class="citation" data-index="164" data-cite="84 Harv.

That study also found that “relative to excludables, death-qualified subjects express less regret for erroneous convictions and more for erroneous acquittals,” <em>id. </em>at 109, “indicating that less evidence is necessary to convince death-qualified jurors beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>Id. </em>at 111.</p>

As compared with <em>Witherspoon </em>excludables, death qualified jurors are more punitive, less sensitive to procedural and constitutional guarantees, biased in favor of the prosecutor and against defense counsel, <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>and more willing to ignore a judge’s instructions regarding pretrial publicity, in each case to a statistically significant degree. <em>Id. </em>The causal relationship between such attitudes and the tendency to convict requires no elaboration.</p>
    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.4",223,[139,518,1153,792]]]'>Like death qualified jurors, <em>Witherspoon </em>-excludables have been shown to share a set of interrelated attitudes toward the criminal justice system. These attitudes are distinct from those possessed by death qualified jurors, even those who express some opposition to capital punishment. <em>Fitzgerald, supra; Bronson, supra; see Grisby v.

    <blockquote id="b223-7" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[180,1441,1110,904]]]'>The evidence ... clearly establishes that a juror’s attitude toward the death penalty is the most powerful known predictor of his overall predisposition in a capital criminal case. That evidence shows that persons who favor the death penalty are predisposed in favor of the prosecution and are uncommonly predisposed against the defendant. The evidence shows that death penalty attitudes are highly correlated with other criminal justice attitudes. Generally, those who favor the death penalty are more likely to trust prosecutors, distrust defense counsel, to believe the state’s witnesses, and to disapprove of certain of the accepted rights of defendants in criminal cases. A jury so selected will not, therefore, be composed of a cross section of the community. Rather, it will be composed of a group of persons who are uncommonly predisposed to favor the prosecution, a jury “organized to convict.” <em>Grisby v.
