The District did not accept this offer. On October 20, 1978, REA reiterated its offer by “Mailgram,” expanding the strike-notice period to fifty (50) hours. The District also rejected this offer. Finally, by letter of October 24, 1978, REA again offered to continue working under the expired agreement’s terms and conditions. Because the students’ scheduled day then extended beyond that of the teachers under the expired agreement, the offer was made on condition that the District make arrangements for student supervision at the end of the school day. This letter was hand-delivered to the District Superintendent of Schools, Jack Neal, who assured REA that the requested supervision would be provided.</p>

In effect, the District demanded that the teachers work a longer day than provided for under the terms of the expired contract or suffer a proportionate cut in pay.

The teachers did not return to work throughout the labor dispute, which was settled on November 28, 1978.</p>

That section provides a benefit disqualification for those whose unemployment is due to a work stoppage other than a lock-out. The Referee reversed, but provided no clear rationale in his decision for the reversal. The Board reversed the Referee’s decision, stating that benefit determinations under the Unemployment Compensation Law are to be made on a week-by-week basis and that the conditions existing in a given week are determinative of benefit eligibility, and held that REA’s rejection of the District’s offer constituted the work stoppage a strike and not a lock-out and, thus, rendered the Claimants ineligible for benefits respecting the weeks which included and followed the rejection.

Prior to the expiration of the agreement, the School District and the Association conducted negotiations in an attempt to reach a new contract.

When the appellant reported for work on October 25, 1978, the workday had not been reduced and he and the other Association members were expected to continue working the enlarged workday. The Association made more than one bona fide offer to continue to work under the same terms and conditions of the expired collective bargaining agreement, however, the School District did not agree to the offers. Since the appellant was unable to continue to work under the same terms and conditions of the lapsed agreement, he withheld his services from the School District beginning on October 26, 1978. This action was taken by appellant along with the other members of the Association pursuant to a vote by the Association membership.

I disagree, however, that this statutory requirement provides a basis for the conclusion that the work stoppage in this case was converted from a lockout to a strike. Whether a work stoppage is a lockout or a strike is determined by the circumstances that caused the stoppage in the first instance.</p>

After repeatedly offering to continue working under the status quo before the start of the new school term on September 5, 1978, the Association reiterated the offer, in writing, immediately prior to October 24, 1978, the day which marked the exhaustion of mediation and fact finding. At no time previous to the work stoppage did the School District agree to the Association’s offer. In this background of the Association’s offer and the School District’s refusal to accept the offer, <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>the Association’s membership, which included the appellant, voted to withhold services and a work stoppage resulted. It is clear that it was the School District who first refused to continue to operate under the status quo.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> In this context, it is the School District who bears responsibility for the work stoppage. This <em>initial responsibility </em>establishes the work curtailment as a lockout. It remains a lockout during each week of the stoppage.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[247,721,1157,1313]]]'>I would hold that the School District’s belated offer does not extinguish its initial responsibility. Its actions, coming after the commencement of the work stoppage does not restore the parties to the positions they respectively held prior to the stoppage. Responsibility for the work stoppage and thus, the determination of whether the stoppage is a strike or a lockout is established at its inception. Actions taken after the cessation of work activity cannot erase the initial responsibility and place the parties in the positions they previously occupied. If it were otherwise, responsibility for a work stoppage would be subject to repeated change. A lockout on Monday could be a strike on Wednesday, a lockout again on Friday, and so on and so forth. This would tend to encourage parties to continually jockey for position at the expense of sincere negotiations toward a settlement. Where the labor dispute involves a School District and teachers, as it does here, the education of the Commonwealth’s children is also at stake. Fixing responsibility at the outset forces the parties to act responsibly, sincerely and in good faith at the initial stages of a potential work stoppage. Conduct on the part of either side which fails to meet this standard results in responsibility for the stoppage (lockout or strike) and the legal ramifications following therefrom. I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
