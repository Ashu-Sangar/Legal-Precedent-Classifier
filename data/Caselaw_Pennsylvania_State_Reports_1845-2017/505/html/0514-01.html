Daniels left it. Daniels filed a complaint in equity in June of 1980 asking for the appointment of a receiver, an accounting and apportionment of assets. In July, he filed a petition for the appointment of a special judge and impoundment of the record. By order of the President Judge of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, Judge Edwin S. Maimed was assigned Daniels’s case. He issued orders impounding the record and providing for: (a) an inventory, (b) distribution of certain assets, (c) establishment of a custodial account for all fees under the joint control of the various counsel for the parties and (d) designation of a C.P.A. to prepare and submit an account of the firm’s operations from February 29, 1976 through May 31, 1980.</p>
    <p id="b567-7" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[185,1436,1150,636]]]'>In March of 1981, Marvin J. Levin notified his four partners in the successor firm of Barish, Adler, Levin and Creskoff of his withdrawal, resulting in termination of the firm as then constituted. That withdrawal and termination was effective March 31, 1981. On November 12th of that year, Marvin Levin filed his complaint in equity claiming that he had been wrongfully excluded from his proportionate partnership interest in the assets of the several firms. In his prayer for relief he sought appointment of a receiver, an accounting of the assets, and other equitable relief. At this point Marvin Levin and Robert Daniels were both seeking similar equitable relief in their separate actions.</p>

Levin. The remaining partners <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> were then also engaged in yet a third termination dispute among themselves. After several conferences in January among the court and all parties, the three cases were consolidated and Judge Maimed issued an order on February 22, 1982 appointing Morris M. Shuster temporary receiver of the property, assets, business and affairs of all the several firms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> That order specified that “counsel for all parties have also agreed that no bond or security is required.” This appointment was rescinded on May 25, 1982, after the court approved the settlement negotiated among all the parties, with the exception of Marvin Levin. In accordance with that settlement, Howard J. Creskoff, one of the ex-partners, was named escrow agent for the funds in dispute among Avram G. Adler, Marvin I. Barish, Arnold Levin and Howard J. Creskoff. The court’s order of May 25, 1982 approving the settlement agreements specifically noted: “Nothing in any of the described Agreements or in this Order shall in any way affect such claims or obligations as may be held or due from Marvin J. Levin and all proceedings are without prejudice to such rights as he may have.” This escrow arrangement has not been challenged by the parties to these appeals although it serves as the foundation on which the two challenged escrow accounts were subsequently created.</p>

Creskoff to escrow 10% of the funds he receives under the May agreements and order. It directs Robert C. Daniels to escrow 5% of the funds which he receives. These percentages are based on the net after certain mandatory payments to creditors. The order setting up these two escrow accounts specifically for Marvin J. Levin’s potential benefit also requires a certification to him of all funds received by the former partners and by the receiver, Morris M. Shuster, between March 31 and May 25, 1982. No bond was required of any of the escrow agents. Common Pleas in its December 3, 1982 Opinion Sur Entry of Order of Court supported its omission of a bond from the two escrow agents with the following statement:</p>

Superior Court accepted this position and set aside that portion of the Common Pleas order, but it affirmed the Common Pleas direction to certify the accounting of fees to Levin. In doing so, Superior Court necessarily rejected former partner, Robert C. Daniels’s argument, first made on the appeal to it, that Common Pleas lacked <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over him because he was not named as a defendant nor served by original process in Marvin J.

That rule requires a bond from the plaintiff as a condition precedent to an injunction. Pa.R.C.P. 1533 requires a plaintiff seeking a receiver to file a bond only in those circumstances in which he seeks the appointment without notice to the defendant. An injunction is a court order prohibiting or commanding virtually any type of action. Traditionally a plaintiff seeking a receiver to protect a <em>res </em>in which he has an interest has not been required to file a bond unless he asks the court to proceed, for exigent reasons, <em>ex parte without notice </em>to the defendant.</p>

In contrast the September order, directing Howard J. Creskoff and Robert C.

Levin escrows. To us, the continuing absence of bond on the main escrow contradicts the argument that the parties’ rights are violated by its absence on Levin’s much smaller derivative escrows. Both the Levin escrow accounts and their joint escrow agents will continue to be subject to the equitable jurisdiction of the court until such time as Marvin Levin’s claims are adjudicated or the court approves a negotiated settlement agreement. The escrow agents will answer to the court for any expenditures from the escrow accounts. In the meantime, these funds will continue in their custody and Marvin Levin will have no access to them. Such limited responsibilities are those of a mere custodian and a substantial diminution from the normal authority and responsibilities of a receiver.</p>
