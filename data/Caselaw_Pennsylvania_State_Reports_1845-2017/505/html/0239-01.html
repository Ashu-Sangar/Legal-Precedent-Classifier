On November 27, 1973, Maria Baldino, nee Bianco, consulted <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>Dr. Armand Castagna, a general practitioner, for treatment of lower back pain. After a brief examination Dr. Castagna diagnosed her condition as an inflamed coccyx and prescribed Butozoiden-Alka, a drug manufactured by CIBA-GEIGY. The prescription was for 30 capsules to be taken over 10 days. Dr. Castagna prescribed this medication without having taken a complete medical history of the patient, and without having taken a blood test.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[162,746,1151,1016]]]'>On January 24, 1974, Mrs. Baldino telephoned Dr. Castagna’s office complaining of a recurrence of pain in the same area, and requested permission to have the Butazolidin prescription refilled. At trial there was some dispute as to whether Dr. Castagna ever authorized the refill, but this dispute was resolved by the jury contrary to Dr. Castagna’s contentions. It is undisputed that the prescription was refilled by the Morris Park Pharmacy. Again, Dr. Castagna did not request a medical history or blood test, nor did he make any effort to ascertain whether Mrs. Baldino had experienced any side effects or adverse reactions from the first prescription. This latter omission was particularly significant since five days prior to the request for a refill (i.e. January 19, 1974), Mrs. Baldino had been to another physician, Dr. Herbert Lipkin, complaining of a sore throat, swollen glands, fatigue and bruising: all of which were listed in the then current prescribing information contained in the Physicians’ Desk Reference as symptoms of possible adverse reaction to Butazolidin.</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[162,1806,1151,530]]]'>In August of 1974, Mrs. Baldino was diagnosed as suffering from aplastic anemia: a serious blood disorder which has resulted in a shortened life expectancy, an inability to have children, and general physical malaise; requiring her to undergo blood transfusions every two months, and take male hormones which have deepened her voice and caused abnormal growths of body hair. The jury found, and we agree that there was sufficient evidence to support this finding, that Mrs. Baldino’s condition was proximately caused by the Butazolidin capsules.</p>

We also held that a drug manufacturer can be held to have breached his duty of reasonable care by promoting its product in such a way as to nullify printed warnings. However, resolution of “whether or not the printed words of warning were in effect cancelled out and rendered meaningless in the light of the sales effort made by the detail men, were questions properly for the jury.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20206" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="282 A.2d 206">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/444/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="444 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1938647" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0263-01">444 Pa. at 289</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20206" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="282 A.2d 206">282 A.2d at 220</a>.</p>

Secondly, these warnings were published in the Physicians’ Desk Reference volume, a standard reference work, published annually, containing the current warnings of drugs authorized for distribution by the FDA, and which Dr. Castagna owned.
