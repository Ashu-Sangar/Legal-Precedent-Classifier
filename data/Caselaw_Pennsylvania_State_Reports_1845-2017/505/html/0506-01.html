This conviction arose in connection with the fatal shooting of one Glenn Scott in the parking lot of a bar in Pottstown, Pennsylvania on September 15, 1978. On June 23, 1980 the trial court imposed a sentence of five to fifteen years. On July 21, 1980 Berkheimer appealed to this Court from the judgment of sentence (Berkheimer I), raising eleven assignments of error. In Berkheimer I, we addressed two of these issues: we held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction, but vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the case to the Court of Common Pleas for an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether one Thomas Brown — a Commonwealth witness and Berkheimer’s cellmate — was a police agent at the time he <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>talked with Berkheimer and allegedly obtained incriminating admissions, to which Brown testified at trial. <a href="/pa/501/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="501 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1782450" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0085-01">501 Pa. 85</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="501 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1782450" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0085-01">460 A.2d 233</a>.

There is no evidence distinguishing those statements appellant gave Brown prior to September 26 from those statements appellant gave him after that date but before October 2. Thus, considering the evidence under the standards governing suppression matters, the facts are that Brown spoke to detectives about defendant’s role in this homicide and on September 26 Brown had an audience with detectives investigating this crime and offered his services as an informant, in return for favorable treatment within the penal system. No express agreement to accept that offer was made by any official, but the informer was returned to the same cell he had previously occupied with defendant. Less than a week later, on October 2, detectives again responded to a request from Brown and met with him a second time. At this meeting, appellant’s role in this homicide was again discussed and statements of appellant’s incriminating admissions to Brown were taken by the detectives.</p>

In the instant case Brown was not a paid informant nor was he under instructions to do anything for the government. I do not believe the mere act of returning Brown to appellant’s cell after he had offered to obtain information from appellant establishes the government’s intention to create a situation likely to induce appellant to make incriminating statements. The Commonwealth’s testimony, if believed, would tend to prove that the government did not induce or in any way agree to Brown’s offer to obtain information. Absent such agreement or inducement, I am unwilling to conclude that the suppression court erred in admitting Brown’s testimony.</p>
