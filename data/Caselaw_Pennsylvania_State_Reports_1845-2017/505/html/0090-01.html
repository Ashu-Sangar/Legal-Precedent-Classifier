The complaint was forwarded to Erie’s counsel in Philadelphia who received it on March 8, 1979, more than 20 days after service. On March 14, 1979, 28 days after service of the complaint, a default judgment was entered in favor of Mr. Schultz. On March 26, eighteen days after receipt of the Complaint, Erie’s attorney mailed a letter, dated March 15, to Mr. Schultz’s attorney requesting an extension of time to file the Answer. The letter did not leave the office until March 26 due to “an office administration problem.” Two days later, on March 28, Erie’s attorney received notice of the entry of the default judgment. On Erie’s petition, the court, on April 10, 1979, granted a rule on Mr. Schultz to show cause why the judgment should not be opened. Mr. Schultz filed an answer. No depositions were taken pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 209, and on October 5, 1979, more than five <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>months after service and filing of the Answer, the court denied Erie’s petition on the pleadings before it.</p>
    <p id="b141-4" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[164,455,1150,478]]]'>A petition to open a judgment is addressed to the equitable powers of the court and is a matter of judicial discretion. The court will only exercise this discretion when (1) the petition has been promptly filed; (2) a meritorious defense can be shown; <em>and </em>(3) the failure to appear can be excused. <em>Balk v. Ford Motor Co., </em><a href="/pa/446/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="446 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1941825" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0137-01">446 Pa. 137</a>, 140, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20128" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="285 A.2d 128">285 A.2d 128</a>, 130 (1971).

    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[162,998,1152,961]]]'>The relevant portion of Erie’s petition, Paragraph 14, averred only that its attorney “had not been informed as to when the Complaint was received ... so that he could take appropriate action by responding to the Complaint in other than a routine fashion.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In his responsive pleading, Mr. Schultz answered the allegation contained in Erie’s Paragraph 14 merely by stating, “No explanation is offered by [Erie] for its failure to answer plaintiff’s Complaint within 20 days.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This statement constitutes no more than a general denial, which has the effect of an admission. <em>Cf, </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1029(b). The facts set forth in Erie’s petition, though uncontroverted, are nevertheless inadequate to provide a justifiable <em>explanation </em>why it failed to comprehend the applicable time limits and respond in a timely fashion. Erie’s petition merely restates what is already known: no timely answer was made. Thus, assuming the averments contained in Erie’s petition to be true, they do not support the relief sought.</p>

      <em>“A </em>lower court’s ruling refusing to open a default judgment will not be reversed unless there has been an error of law or a clear, manifest abuse of discretion.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20128" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="285 A.2d 128">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/446/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="446 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1941825" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0137-01">446 Pa. at 140</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20128" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="285 A.2d 128">285 A.2d at 131</a>. Erie argues the Court of Common Pleas abused its discretion by rendering its decision before either party took further action pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 209. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b142-4" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[253,736,1154,1323]]]'>Pa.R.C.P. 209 sets forth the manner of proceeding on petition and answer. Ordinarily, after the filing and service of an answer, the petitioner would proceed within 15 days to take depositions or move the case for argument on petition and answer. Should petitioner fail to proceed according to this practice, the respondent could take a rule upon the petitioner to show cause why the petitioner should not take depositions or put the case down for argument on the petition and answer. In either case, if the case is ordered for argument on petition and answer alone pursuant to Rule 209, “all averments of fact responsive to the petition and properly pleaded in the answer shall be deemed admitted for the purpose of the rule.” <em>See, </em>Goodrich-Amram 2d § 209:2. Instantly, however, Erie did not produce any evidence pursuant to the practice set forth in Rule 209; and, as the facts set forth in Erie’s petition are uncontroverted by Mr. Schultz’s answer, no such evidence was required. The averments contained in Erie’s petition being admitted, the court rendered its decision, denying Erie’s petition, on the pleadings. Under the circumstances the court’s action was quite proper; and Erie’s argument, that the court’s failure to wait for one of the parties to take depositions pursuant to the practice set forth in Rule 209 constituted an abuse of discretion, is without merit.</p>
