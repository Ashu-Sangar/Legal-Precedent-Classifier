Further, the agreement stipulated that no contract for trade services or supplies could be made by Mellon-Stuart without the prior approval of Children’s. Additionally, when the actual construction phase of the project started, Mellon-Stuart was required to provide all necessary construction site supervisory and administrative services for complete construction within the budget and time schedule.

In cases where construction is initially undertaken or subsequently assumed by the Authority, the Guidelines explicitly state that all work shall be competitively bid “as required by the Act,” and all contracts shall be awarded “in accordance with the Act.” (Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, 53 P.S. § 312(A), which calls for public competitive bids). The paragraph of Section VI(a) dealing with projects involving guaranteed maximum contracts sets forth that all subcontract work is to be awarded on a <em>competitive basis. </em>Inasmuch as no form of the qualifying phrase “as required <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>by the Act” is included in the paragraph pertaining to guaranteed maximum contracts we conclude that <em>private </em>as well as public competitive bids are permitted.</p>

    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[251,448,1158,841]]]'>If we were to endorse this exemption from the competitive bidding process, nothing would prevent other Commonwealth authorities from skirting competitive bidding requirements: merely employ the device the majority provides for them. Rather than have the authority itself construct and contract for a project, funnel the tax-free funding through the authority to an agent, a private company, which would in turn manage the project and make all the contracts for the project. With the perceived annoyance of competitive bidding out of the way, the agent or the public official who appointed the agent could award his friends and political allies lucrative contracts. The concerns of favoritism, improvidence, fraud and corruption, while not hinted at in this case, are implicated when competitive bidding procedures are avoided through a scheme like the one employed here.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[248,1308,1157,577]]]'>Appellees might complain that competitive bidding is an onerous burden. The Children’s Hospital project is certainly an important one. However, it cannot be said that competitive bidding would unduly handicap such a project. Competitive bidding has successfully passed the test of time, governing the award of municipal authority contracts in the Commonwealth since 1945, and other governmental contracts since the turn of the century. It is not so much to ask that, in exchange for the $54 million of tax-free financing, the parties competitively bid out contracts as required by statute.</p>
