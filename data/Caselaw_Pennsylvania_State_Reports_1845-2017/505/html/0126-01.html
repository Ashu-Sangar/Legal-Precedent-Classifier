Based on an informant’s tip that appellant was going to commit another robbery, the police set up a surveillance team around the site of the proposed robbery.

After a half-hour long chase appellant entered a private residence and took hostages. He then telephoned an attorney, Lewis Small, who went to the scene and assisted appellant in surrendering.

    <p id="b183-4" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[151,365,1151,858]]]'>I join the opinion. I write to emphasize that this is not a case where the police, in disregard of retained counsel’s express desire to be present during interrogation, sought to elicit an incriminatory statement in counsel’s absence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hilliard, </em><a href="/pa/471/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="471 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="1725162" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0318-01">471 Pa. 318</a>, 322, <a href="/pa/471/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="471 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="1725162" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0318-01">370 A.2d 322</a>, 324 (1977); <em>Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em><a href="/pa/448/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="448 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="1944684" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0206-01">448 Pa. 206</a>, 220, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20302" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="292 A.2d 302">292 A.2d 302</a>, 309 (1972) (Nix, J., dissenting opinion joined by Roberts and Manderino, JJ.) I am still of the view that where counsel has been engaged to represent a defendant and has expressed specifically a desire to be present during any police interrogation, a waiver of counsel obtained in counsel’s absence should be held invalid as a matter of law. I am satisfied that the record amply supports the majority’s conclusion that the police in this instance were not attempting to interrogate Mr. Lark. <em>Commonwealth v.
