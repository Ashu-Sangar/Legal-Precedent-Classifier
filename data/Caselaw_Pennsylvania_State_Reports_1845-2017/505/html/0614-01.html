The issue presented was whether a Commonwealth agency with general power to establish pre-release centers throughout the Commonwealth could preempt the municipality’s zoning authority. We held that in the absence of a clear legislative intent that one governmental activity should transcend the other, a balancing analysis should be carried out in which the legislative grants are examined along with their purposes and the facts of the individual cases. <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">468 Pa. at 182</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">360 A.2d at 612</a> (1976).

This Court reversed, holding that because the township’s right to relief was not clear, the injunction must be vacated. In determining the right to relief, this Court reiterated its balancing approach enunciated in <em>City of Pittsburgh, </em>and formulated six specific considerations to be used in balancing the interests of the <em>South Fayette </em>parties: (1) whether the intended use violated the zoning ordinance; (2) the significance of the Commonwealth’s ownership of the property; (3) the <em>parens patriae </em>responsibility of the Commonwealth; (4) the authority to establish juvenile centers; (5) the absence in the first class township zoning authority of a conflict of laws provision, “such as was present in City of Pittsburgh”; (6) particular circumstances of the case. <a href="/pa/477/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="477 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1738277" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0574-01">477 Pa. at 581-82</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="477 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1738277" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0574-01">385 A.2d at 347</a>.</p>

    <p id="b674-4" data-blocks='[["BL_674.4",674,[235,491,1147,627]]]'>In <em>City of Pittsburgh </em>this Court also stated that legislative intent to override municipal zoning powers may be indicated “either by the inclusion <em>of the power of eminent domain to the state agency </em>or clear language showing the overriding intent____” <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">468 Pa. at 184-85</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">360 A.2d at 613</a>. (Emphasis added). This sentence from <em>City of Pittsburgh </em>is of especial importance in this case, for, as mentioned earlier, both the Court of Common Pleas and the opinion in support of affirmance in Commonwealth Court relied on the Commonwealth’s eminent domain power in holding that the Commonwealth was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Zoning Board.</p>
    <p id="b674-7" data-blocks='[["BL_674.5",674,[232,1142,1150,684]]]'>It now appears to us that although our past emphasis on discovering the legislative intent was correct, this Court’s earlier view that eminent domain powers necessarily indicate a legislative intent that the agency may override local zoning regulations, should no longer control. We do not believe that the grant of eminent domain power to a state agency invariably indicates legislative intent that the state agency may act without regard for local zoning regulations. Accordingly, insofar as <em>City of Pittsburgh </em>stands for the proposition that the grant of eminent domain powers to a state agency may be taken as an indication of legislative intent that the state agency may override local zoning regulations, it is expressly overruled.</p>

Rather, it is a kind of <em>ad hoc </em>judicial legislation of authority to the governmental unit which, in the circumstances, seems to have the most compelling case. <em>Pemberton Appeal </em>and <em>City of Pittsburgh, </em>in fact, are illustrative of this point. The grant of power to the Bureau of Correction in <em>City of Pittsburgh </em>was “to. <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>establish ... such prisoner pre-release centers at such locations throughout the Commonwealth as it may deem necessary____” The School District’s grant of power in <em>Pemberton Appeal </em>was to “locate, determine, acquire, and if necessary condemn all real estate deemed necessary for schools.” Basically, these grants of power are the same: both agencies are empowered to establish their respective facilities in cases where they deem it necessary. “Locate and determine” are merely words relating to planning; and “acquire and if necessary condemn” only relate to the method of obtaining the ownership necessary to establish the facility. Yet this Court held that the statutory grant in <em>Pemberton Appeal </em>was “precise and specific,” whereas that in <em>City of Pittsburgh </em>indicated no legislative intent to override zoning regulations.</p>
    <p id="b675-6" data-blocks='[["BL_675.4",675,[182,1106,1152,612]]]'>While we have no quarrel with the results reached in these cases, it is evident that the cognitive differences in the statutory language in the two cases are so slight that statutory language alone does not explain the difference in the results. Rather, it appears that the Court considered all the circumstances of the cases, balanced the interests of the parties, and decided the cases on the apparent equities of the situations. Whatever virtue there may be in this approach, it has the disability of leading to uncertain results at every level. This, in turn, fosters layer upon layer of litigation, tying up land, the courts and Commonwealth agencies for years.</p>
    <p id="b675-7" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[180,1736,1150,410]]]'>Apart from the inevitable litigation which results from the knowledge that the next court might “balance” differently than the last, the real difficulty with the balancing approach is that it has nothing to do with legislative intent. Rather, it amounts to a judicial determination that since the legislature did not provide for the situation at hand, the courts will. It seems to us a better approach to return to the original task of determining legislative intent.</p>
    <p id="b675-8" data-blocks='[["BL_675.6",675,[179,2169,1150,200]],["BL_676.1",676,[236,313,1151,1765]]]'>When we approach this task, however, we are immediately faced with a paradox: determination of legislative intent as to priority of the two governmental entities is necessary to decide the case, but that intent is indeciphera<a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>ble from the applicable statutes. Having rejected balancing, and being unable to determine legislative intent as to which agency is to prevail, we turn to the statutory construction rule that legislative intent may be determined by a consideration, <em>inter alia, </em>of the consequences of a particular interpretation. Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c)(6). The consequences of deciding that the Commonwealth should be preeminent in this matter are that Philadelphia’s zoning scheme would be frustrated in this case and in every other case where a Commonwealth land use plan conflicted with the city plan. On the other hand, if the city were to prevail, the Commonwealth’s mandate to establish mental health facilities at various locations in the state would not necessarily be frustrated, for the loss of one location might well be compensated for by substitution of another. Thus, deciding that the city’s zoning authority supersedes that of the Commonwealth agency to establish a mental health facility in a particular geographical location arguably would give effect to the legislative mandates of both governmental entities, a consequence which, absent more certain legislative direction, seems advisable. Accordingly, we hold that DPW is subject to the jurisdiction of the Zoning Board and that in the case of a conflict between DPW’s land use plans and the zoning use regulatory scheme of Philadelphia, the zoning scheme shall prevail. We decline to infer a legislative intent that the Commonwealth agency has preemptive land use powers. Of course, should the legislature determine that one or more Commonwealth agencies or projects should be empowered to supersede local land use regulations, it need only pass legislation to that effect. Therefore, Commonwealth Court’s holding that the Commonwealth is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Zoning Board with respect to local use restrictions is reversed.</p>

It is well settled that a Zoning Board of Adjustment has no right to <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>appeal an adverse decision by a court of common pleas. <em>Lansdowne Borough Board of Adjustment’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/313/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="313 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1152623" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0523-01">313 Pa. 523</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.%20867" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="170 A. 867">170 A. 867</a> (1934). Further, since the city petitioned for substitution as a party more than a year after the appeal period had run, it was not error to deny the city’s petition. Pa. R.A.P. 1512 provides that a petition for review of an appealable order shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the order.</p>
