The Rate Act evidences the clear legislative determination that the public welfare requires both statutory channeling of the ratemaking process and administrative scrutiny of the resulting rates. One of the principal justifications for governmental involvement identified by the legislature is the need to prevent “unfairly discriminatory” rates. To achieve that goal, the legislature has directly prohibited insurers from making “unfairly discriminatory” rates, and has entrusted enforcement of that prohibition to the Commissioner, and, if need be, to the courts. Thus the Rate Act, independent of any federal or state constitutional provision, proscribes “unfairly discriminatory” ratemaking by insurers in this Commonwealth and provides administrative and judicial remedies therefor.</p>

That phrase is not defined in the Rate Act itself. The Commissioner concluded that he was compelled to interpret the statutory prohibition against “unfairly discriminatory” <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>rates in a manner consistent with the strong public policy against gender-based discrimination under law as expressed in Pennsylvania’s Equal Rights Amendment. Appellants Hartford and State Farm attack that conclusion arguing in favor of a narrow interpretation of the phrase which would limit the prohibition of section 3(d) to rates which are not “actuarially sound.” Under the latter view the Rate Act would not only permit insurers to impose gender-based rates but would also prohibit the Commissioner from denying approval to such rates provided the insurer is able to support them with actuarial data.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[273,884,1152,580]]]'>In the proceedings before the Commissioner, Mattes established conclusively that Hartford required him to pay a significantly higher premium than a similarly situated woman would be charged for identical Hartford coverage solely on the basis of his gender. There is no attempt to suggest that Mattes was not in fact discriminated against because of his sex. The inquiry must begin by accepting that <em>•&amp; </em>gender-based discrimination exists. The question to be resolved is whether such discrimination falls within the parameters of the Rate Act’s prohibition against “unfairly discriminatory” rates.</p>

They argue that the target of the Rate Act’s prohibition, therefore, is the type of price discrimination which would violate the antitrust laws. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this proposition logically follows, appellants fail to justify its application to the Pennsylvania Rate Act. There is no evidence that the General Assembly made use of the report or that the Rate Act was enacted in response to the McCarron-Ferguson Act. Thus it cannot be presumed that the report reflects the legislature’s intent. To the contrary, the legislative response to the McCarronFerguson Act was the original Unfair Insurance Practices Act, Act of June 5, 1947, P.L. 445, § 1, 40 P.S. §§ 1151 <em>et seq. </em>(repealed 1974), as is . explicitly stated in section 1 thereof, 40 P.S. § 1151.

Section 3(c) of the Rate Act, 40 P.S. § 1183(c), establishes the requirement of actuarial fairness by permitting an insurer to vary rates within a class only where the risk insured can be “demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.” If actuarial fairness were the only concern of the Rate Act, the proscription of “unfairly discriminatory” rates contained in section 1 and 3(d) would be redundant and of no independent effect; satisfaction of section 3(c) would be dispositive of the requirement of actuarial soundness. In order to give meaning to that proscription, the “fairness” of rates must be recognized as a legislative concern distinct from and transcending the need for sound actuarial justification. Thus we conclude that section 3(d) manifests separate legislative objectives which represent the recognition that a rate may be justified by the actuarial data offered in its support, yet unfair in its underlying assumptions and its application to the individual. Accordingly, appellants’ narrow, technical view of the Rate Act’s mandate of “fairness” must be rejected.</p>

We disagree. As we have already concluded, it was appropriate for the Commissioner to look beyond actuarial statistics in evaluating the fairness of Hartford’s discriminatory rates.

Unquestionably, sex discrimination in this Commonwealth is now unfair discrimination. It is a cardinal principle that ambiguous statutes should be read in a manner consonant with the Constitution. To read the term “unfairly discriminatory” as excluding sex discrimination would contradict the plain mandate of the Equal Rights Amendment to our Pennsylvania Constitution.

I would hold that, like the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, our ERA requires effectuating legislation to enable the Insurance Commissioner to bar gender based classifications in insurance rates. Rather than enacting such implementing legislation, the Legislature on two occasions since the enactment of the ERA has specifically <em>allowed </em>the use of gender based classifications in insurance rates.</p>

The Human Relations Commission had the power to investigate and pass upon "unlawful discriminatory practices,” 43 P.S. § 957(f), but, until 1978, was only given the power to remedy discrimination in places of public accommodation on the basis of “race, color, religious creed, ancestry or national origin," not gender. 43 P.S. § 953. And while the ERA was in effect at the time the Human Relations Commission sought to act, the Legislature failed to enact implementing legislation until 1978. Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 909, No. 173, § 1, 1 Pa.C.S. § 2301.

Upon review of the decisions cited by the majority, however, it is apparent that the issue presented by this appeal is critically different. In <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>the earlier cases, we construed statutes that were written as gender specific to include both sexes. We rejected the employment of presumptions which were based upon social prejudices or meritless characteristics ascribed to a class. Clearly such presumptions are anathematic to our legal system. But this reasoning cannot resolve the issue of whether different insurance rates for men and women, which are based upon a statistical analysis of projected risks and losses, are unfairly discriminatory.</p>

The language of the Amendment — “under the law” — has long been interpreted to require state action. Today the majority has reduced it to a generic term. I am also deeply disturbed by the manner in which the majority interprets “under the law” as circumscribing decisional law.</p>
    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[232,1158,1150,897]]]'>There is no dispute that it is unfairly discriminatory to subject individuals who are in the same position to disparate treatment based upon gender. If the insurance rates here had been determined without reference to the projected loss experience of male and female drivers, the rates would be unfairly discriminatory. It is not unfairly discriminatory, however, to treat individuals who are not in the same position differently. It is self-defeating to suggest that similar individuals should be treated as such not only where differences do not exist, but also that they should be treated as the same where differences undeniably do exist. We are presented here with differences which exist, not those which are presumed or manufactured to reinforce social prejudices. By treating a class without reference to the actual characteristics of the class, the majority in fact adopts the discriminatory analysis which it has previously abhorred.</p>
