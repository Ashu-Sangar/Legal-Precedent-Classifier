The Workmen’s Compensation Referee and the Appeal Board both found that appellee Alice M. Brown’s injuries had occurred in an area where she was not required to be by reason of her employment and, therefore, the public area of the Chatham Center lobby could not be held to be included in her employer’s premises.
