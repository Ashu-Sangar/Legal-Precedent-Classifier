The question is whether the lessee who has not exercised his fixed price option prior to notice of a third party offer, may purchase the property for the fixed price, after he has been notified of a third party offer for an amount greater than the fixed price, or whether he must purchase — if he is to purchase at all — by matching the offer of the third party.</p>

Amoco did not give notice of its intention to purchase the property at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as those agreed to by the third party, but instead, in January of 1979, prior to the expiration of the original term of the lease, gave notice of its intention to purchase the property under the fixed price option provision of the lease, for $45,000. When Snyders refused to convey the property to Amoco under the terms of the fixed price option, Amoco filed an equity action against Snyders seeking specific performance of the fixed price option.</p>

    <p id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[173,1145,1152,1187]]]'>Snyder, on the other hand, argues that if the fixed price option were not terminated by notice of a third party offer which they are willing to accept, the fixed price option would place a ceiling on the amount for which the lessor could sell his reversionary interest in the property, for no buyer would pay more than he could recover from the lessee under the fixed price option. Secondly, when paragraph 3(b) states that if lessee does not exercise its right of first refusal, the lease and all of the terms and conditions remain in effect against any purchaser, this must be understood to mean all of the terms and conditions except the fixed price option, for otherwise the provision would be mere surplusage, since lessor had the right to sell subject to the terms of the lease anyway. Thirdly, a reasonable interpretation of the lease would protect lessor’s right to sell their reversionary interest for its fair market value during the twenty years which the lease might run. Finally, Snyders argue that any ambiguity or uncertainty in the lease should be resolved against the lessee, who drafted the lease, and that in any event, an option must be strictly construed against the optionee and in favor of the optionor, here the Snyders.</p>

Tamapa Company, </em>supra, to the effect that a decision construing one instrument containing both a fixed price option and a right of first refusal option will not necessarily control a case involving a different instrument. <a href="/pa-super/235/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="235 Pa.

In <em>Bobali </em>the instrument provided that the lessee could exercise its fixed price option for a certain period of time “unless earlier terminated as hereinafter provided.” Thereinafter appeared a right of first refusal option, which the court interpreted as terminating the fixed price option. There is no provision in the lease at bar which terminates the fixed price option, and so the rationale of <em>Bobali </em>is not applicable to this case. Similarly unhelpful is the case law of other jurisdictions, which, like <em>Bobali, </em>often concerns instruments different from the lease in this case, and which in any case is split on the question of whether notice of an offer under the right of first refusal clause in a lease terminates a fixed price option. <em>See </em>Annot. <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.L.R.%202d%20604" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 A.L.R. 2d 604">8 A.L.R.2d 604</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.L.R.%204th%201293" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="22 A.L.R. 4th 1293">22 A.L.R.4th 1293</a>.</p>

The two clauses can be interpreted so as to give effect to both. This can be done by construing the fixed price purchase option as applicable only until there is a purchase offer by a third party. At that point, the fixed price option would be extinguished and could not be invoked against either the original lessor or a party purchasing from the original lessor. Otherwise, the right of first refusal would be meaningless. The lessee would never have to meet a higher price offered by a third party if the fixed price option could be invoked after the making of such offer. A third party would not make a higher offer if the fixed price option <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>could be invoked so as to force a sale at a loss. I do not find such a result to be fair, reasonable, and likely to be bargained for by reasonable parties. Further, where an ambiguity exists, we must then look to the intent of the parties. I believe that the intent of the parties in including the fixed price option and right of first refusal was to protect Amoco’s leasehold interest, not the acquisition of a fee. Such interest is adequately protected by allowing Amoco to purchase at the price offered by the third party. I would find that the parties intended both provisions of the contract to be operative and did not intend to prevent Appellants from selling the property to a third party for more than the amount of the fixed price option. In so doing, we would reach a fair and reasonable result that gives effect to both of the clauses in question. The propriety of such a result is further indicated by the fact that Amoco’s predecessor, American Oil, drafted the lease. If we follow the established rule and construe the lease strictly against Amoco, we cannot permit Amoco to purchase the property without meeting the price offered by the third party.</p>

We considered this policy in a different context in <em>Mahoney v. Furches, </em><a href="/pa/503/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="503 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1785957" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0060-01">503 Pa. 60</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="503 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1785957" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0060-01">468 A.2d 458</a> (1983). In that case, a mortgagor entered into agreements to sell certain tracts of land she had mortgaged and attempted to prepay the mortgage. The mortgagee would not accept the prepayment. The mortgage note did not say whether prepayment was permissible. We found that inability to prepay would restrict the alienability of the property by preventing the mortgagor from conveying clear title. We held that our policy did not favor restrictions on alienability and that therefore, a mortgage could be prepaid in the absence of any provision to the contrary. That policy is applicable in the instant case. As pointed out <em>supra, </em>the majority’s interpretation of the lease would discourage a third party from purchasing the property. That would be a <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>restriction on alienability and is not to be favored. In accordance with our policy, I would find that the fixed price option cannot be invoked after a third party offer in the absence of specific provision therefor.</p>

Such cases have arisen in other jurisdictions. <em>Amoco Oil Co. v. Kraft, </em><a href="/mich-app/89/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="89 Mich.

The court held that where the lessee did not invoke the right of first refusal when a third party offered to purchase for an amount greater than that of the fixed price option, the lessee could not thereafter invoke the fixed price option. The court found that result to be required by principles of equity and fair dealing and observed that otherwise, no one would purchase the property for more than the amount of the fixed price option. A lease that contains both a fixed price purchase option and a right of first refusal may contain a provision stating which of the two takes precedence, but in the absence of such provision, the fixed price option terminates on the making of an offer to purchase by a third party, <em>M &amp; M Oil Co. v.
