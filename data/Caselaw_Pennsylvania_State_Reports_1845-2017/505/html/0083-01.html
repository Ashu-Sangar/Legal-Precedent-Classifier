Laura Smoyer died as a result of the incident. The vehicle driven by Mrs. Smoyer also contained two passengers, Jeremy Smoyer, the son of appellant, and Dennis Lucas, a friend of the deceased.

Before the trial Lucas had undergone hypnosis in order to enhance his recall of the details of the accident. Prior to hypnosis he was able to recall being involved in a high speed chase with appellant during which appellant’s car struck the victim’s car on at least two occasions. Additionally, he remembered the victim, upon seeing appellant, say “he’s going to kill me.” All this information was given to the police a little more than a week after the incident. As a result of the hypnotic session, which was conducted approximately three months after the accident, Mr. Lucas recalled being struck by appellant’s car a third time. This third jolt sent the victim’s car into a telephone pole, resulting in her death. The <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>hypnotic session was conducted by a detective for the Chester County District Attorney’s Office.
