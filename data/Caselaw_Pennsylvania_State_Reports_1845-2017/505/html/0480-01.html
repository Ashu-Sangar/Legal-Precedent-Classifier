Shortly before the expiration of an existing collective bargaining agreement (“Agreement”), the Employer and the Union began negotiations on a new contract. Although the parties were unable to reach <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>a new agreement prior to expiration, the Union offered to continue working for a reasonable period of time under the terms and conditions of the expired Agreement pending the outcome of the ongoing negotiations. The Employer permitted the employees to continue to work under the terms and conditions of the Agreement until June 15, 1979. On that date, during a meeting with Union representatives, the Employer presented a list of changes in economic terms and conditions of employment, including an across-the-board hourly wage increase and enhanced fringe benefits, which it intended to implement the following Monday (June 18). The Union refused to present the list to its membership for a vote, and the Employer implemented its proposals as scheduled. The employees continued to work under these changed terms and conditions until July 20, 1979. On the following day, the Union membership, having been apprised of the Employer’s economic proposals, voted to reject them and to stop work. The parties ultimately arrived at a new collective bargaining agreement on October 9, and work resumed on October 10, 1979.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[201,1341,1150,674]]]'>The dispute, during the negotiations, centered on wages and fringe benefits. It appears that the parties were tentatively in agreement as to the non-economic items prior to the April 2 expiration date. The altered status unilaterally imposed by the Employer, effective June 18, represented the wage and fringe benefit increases which were part of the package offered by the Employer and rejected by the Union at that point in the negotiations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Between June 18 and July 21 the employees remained at work under the improved wage and fringe levels. This change in status was placed before the Union membership on July 21, at which time the Union membership rejected the offer and the work stoppage began.</p>

The Employer argues that the continuation of work by the Union membership for a thirty-three day period after the Employer’s unilateral implementation of wage and benefit increases and the employees’ failure to protest those changes evidences the Union’s acquiescence in a “new status quo.” Under this theory the Union’s ultimate work stoppage is to be viewed as a refusal to maintain this “new status quo” for a reasonable time. While a modification by mutual agreement of terms and conditions of employment pending the outcome of on-going negotiations would not be inconsistent with the objectives of <em>Vrotney, </em>the instant record does not support the existence of such an agreement. The Union’s negotiators explicitly rejected the Employer’s proposals prior to implementation and declined to present them to the Union membership. The employees’ tacit acceptance of paychecks which reflected an hourly wage increase does not in itself support the conclusion that the Union agreed to or that the employees were even aware of the numerous changes in annual insurance, vacation and pension benefits implemented by the Employer. Moreover, the time elapsed between the implementation of those changes and the Union’s work stoppage is insufficient to establish an agreement. The Union’s representatives clearly required sufficient time in which to ascertain the consensus of the membership regarding the difficult decision whether or not to stop work. Further, the Employer’s implementation of its changes did not signal an end to pre-strike contract negotiations. Toward the close of the thirty-three day period in question, the parties conducted a negotiation meeting at which the Union representatives agreed to submit the Employer’s proposals to the membership. The possibility that a settlement might still be <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>reached would further justify the Union’s slowness to declare a work stoppage. The evidence supports the conclusion that the parties’ positions were not so far apart that such an expectation would have been unreasonable. On these facts, acceptance of the Employer’s “acquiescence” theory would encourage a union to call a work stoppage upon the implementation of any unilateral change by an employer in order to protect its membership’s right to unemployment compensation. Such a rule would defeat <em>Vrotney’s </em>crucial objective of encouraging the continuation of the employment situation during good faith negotiations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Under that law this result is anomalous at best. Section 402(d) speaks of “stoppage of work” and “lockout,” not “disruptions in the status quo.” This provision of the statute simply makes striking employees ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits. Had the Employer in this case continued its operations indefinitely under the terms of the expired agreement, a work stoppage by the employees would be characterized as a “strike” even under the <em>Vrotney </em>standard, and, therefore, ¡the employees would have been ineligible for unemployment benefits. It is wrong to hold, as the majority does, that employees who initiate a work stoppage when the Employer has properly implemented better terms and conditions of employment than those contained in the old collective bargaining agreement, have been constructively “locked out” of their place of employ<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>ment. Today the majority ignores the meaning of the terms “strike” and “lockout” and, in the process, distorts the basic purpose of the Unemployment Compensation Law which is to compensate workers whose loss of employment occurs through no fault of their own, not those who choose to temporarily withhold their labor in order to force their employer into additional economic concessions.</p>

Although I do not believe the federal law of unfair labor practices controls our Unemployment Compensation Law’s definition of “lockout," there is not a hint in this record that the Employer’s implementation of these beneficial changes was an unfair interference with the rights the federal Labor Management Relations Act guarantees to the workers or their Union. Indeed, the Employer’s actions appear consonant with federal labor law. Specifically, the United States Supreme Court has distinguished the increases at issue here from unilateral increases higher than any offer submitted to the union during negotiations, the implementation of which demonstrates the employer’s refusal to bargain in good faith. For example, in <em>N.L.R.B. v. Crompton-Highland Mills, Inc., </em><a href="/us/337/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="337 U.S. 217" data-case-ids="572550" data-case-paths="/us/337/0217-01">337 U.S. 217</a>, 224-25, <a href="/us/337/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="337 U.S. 217" data-case-ids="572550" data-case-paths="/us/337/0217-01">69 S.Ct. 960</a>, 963-64, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%201320" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="93 L.

Instead of being regarded as an unfair labor practice, it might be welcomed by the bargaining representative, without prejudice to the rest of the negotiations. See <em>Re W. W.
