A tractor trailer driven by the appellee was proceeding along Interstate 81, near Harrisburg. A small pickup truck driven by Dale Hershey, who was accompanied by his fiance, Rose Marie Swelfer, was also proceeding on Interstate 81. It was eight o’clock on a summer Sunday night. Ms. Swelfer testified that appellee’s truck swerved in the direction of their pick up truck and forced them off the road. The Furies quick to scent incipient violence twitched their wings. They know well how men can make trifles reek with feckless ruin. Mr. Hershey was on the path to his grave; Mr. Clemmons to prison, for life. Mr. Hershey picked up his CB radio and vented himself to appellee. Both Mr. Hershey and appellee pulled off to the side of the road. Mr. Hershey’s vehicle stopped several hundred feet behind appellee’s truck. Mr. Hershey left his pickup and walked rapidly to the cab of the larger vehicle. Ms. Swelfer, who observed the entire incident, testified that as Mr. Hershey approached appellee words were briefly exchanged between the two when she saw appellee lift a shotgun point it at Mr. Hershey and fire a shot striking the victim in the lower neck area. Ms. Swelfer’s version of the shooting was substantiated by Mr. Thomas Moore, a trucker who was driving by the scene when the shooting occurred, who <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>testified that the victim had been shot by appellee when his hands were in plain view.</p>

The jury chose to disbelieve appellee’s version of the events. Appellee was found guilty of first degree murder. It is not our function to say what the verdict might also have been; what the jury writes upon evidence that can support a verdict is beyond our powers to change. Words in the record are cold because they are frozen in place by the verdict. Words are simply words. They are given life only by those who speak them. The jury hears them.

The problem with this claim is that the record clearly reveals that trial counsel fully explored the possibility of an accidental discharge. After the Commonwealth presented the testimony of the state police trooper, who examined the gun and testified that it would not have discharged without pulling the trigger, trial counsel elicited on cross-examination the fact that guns do accidentally discharge and that was a possibility in this case. Moreover, a good portion of appellee’s testimony described how the gun had accidentally misfired, notwithstanding the fact that it was appellee’s intention to fire a shot over the victim’s head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Thus, the question of accidental discharge was left to the jury and it simply chose to believe the Commonwealth’s evidence.

Specifically, appellee claims that the first witness on the scene, Phillip J. Kockler, a retired state police officer, unlawfully detained him when he showed him his identification and told appellee not to leave the scene. Appellee asserts that Mr. Kockler’s display of identification was tantamount to invoking his authority as a police officer.</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[266,656,1160,1271]]]'>This argument is meritless for a number of reasons. First, appellee’s own testimony refutes the allegation that he was detained against his will. After the shooting appellee testified that he “tried to get help ... [by] stop[ping] traffic along the roadway.” This testimony was consistent with appellee’s averment in his Petition for Release and Setting of Reasonable Bail when he pled that “On the 8th day of June, 1980, petitioner <em>voluntarily </em>remained at the scene of an alleged homicide and surrendered to State Police at the scene.” Secondly, since Mr. Kockler was retired, his capacity was equivalent to that of a private citizen. Persons lacking police powers can detain an individual if they have personal knowledge of a felony. <em>See Commonwealth v. Gregg, </em><a href="/pa-super/262/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="262 Pa.

In the instant case Mr. Kockler testified that he observed the two vehicles pull off the road and then proceeded to watch the victim alight from his vehicle and approach appellee’s truck. After making a U-turn Mr. Kockler arrived at the scene only to discover the victim’s motionless body, with a gunshot wound to the neck, lying on the shoulder of the road. Finally, even if we assume that Mr. Kockler was acting under the color of state authority by telling appellee to wait for police, his actions were entirely proper by virtue of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a)(6)(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellee, however, fails to provide the names and whereabouts of these witnesses, the substance of their testimony and how they would have appreciably strengthened his defense. Moreover, appellee does not allege that his trial counsel knew of the existence of the witnesses who purportedly should have been called. In this respect, appellee’s case is similar to <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra, </em>where this Court was confronted with a challenge to the trial counsel’s stewardship on the grounds that counsel failed to call character witnesses to testify. We rejected that claim because there had been no showing that such witnesses ever existed. We further reasoned that absent a showing that the proposed testimony would have been helpful, counsel could not have been deemed ineffective. <em>Id. </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. at 609-10</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d at 355</a>.

This claim overlooks two considerations. First, Ms. Swelfer personally observed the entire incident from the front seat of the victim’s vehicle. Her identification certainly became credible when she testified that after the shooting appellee put down his gun and walked toward her indicating that he had no intention of harming her. Second, appellee identified himself to all on-the-scene witnesses claiming that he acted in self-defense and that the shooting was accidental. The identity of appellee was never at issue. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Caswell, </em><a href="/pa-super/316/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="316 Pa.

Again, the record refutes this claim. The only alleged inconsistent statement made by Ms. Swelfer was brought to the jury’s attention by appellee’s trial counsel. During the preliminary hearing, Ms. Swelfer testified that Mr. Hershey pulled out into the middle lane of traffic in order to cut-off appellee. At trial on direct examination, she simply stated that her fiance pulled into the middle lane of traffic. On cross examination trial counsel read to Ms. Swelfer that portion of her preliminary hearing testimony that differed from her testimony given on direct examination. Ms. Swelfer acknowledged her earlier testimony. Thus, trial counsel <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>did use the preliminary hearing as a means of impeachment. This is a classic hindsight evaluation of the record: that appellee would have perhaps impeached the witness in a different way or by a different style does not constitute ineffectiveness of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[195,573,1155,680]]]'>The sixth allegation of ineffectiveness of trial counsel deals with counsel’s failure to examine the possibility that the victim had an aggressive personality and that appellee was justified in fearing for his life. Appellee points to the fact that trial counsel failed to introduce as evidence the coroner’s report which both confirmed the presence of alcohol in the victim’s blood and described the victim’s personality type as aggressive. Notwithstanding this omission, these facts were clearly brought to the jury’s attention. On cross-examination trial counsel elicited from Ms. Swelfer that her boyfriend had been drinking earlier that day, and then he proceeded to question her about the amount of alcohol the victim had consumed.</p>

Amos, </em><a href="/pa/445/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="445 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1939994" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0297-01">445 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=284%20A.2d%20748" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="284 A.2d 748">284 A.2d 748</a> (1971).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Here, however, it is undisputed that the victim was in fact the initial aggressor. The Commonwealth was forced to proceed on the assumption that Mr. Hershey provoked the vehicles into stopping and pursued a confrontation. Thus, there would have been no need to introduce the medical report for that purpose. As to corroborate appellee’s knowledge of the victim’s alleged violent character, this is clearly inapplicable. Up until their encounter on Interstate 81, appellee and the victim had never previously met. Nowhere in the record does appellee allege that he knew of the victim or his <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>supposedly aggressive personality at the time of the shooting. Thus, the medical report could not have served as a source of corroboration, because there was nothing to corroborate. <em>Commonwealth v. Horne, </em><a href="/pa/479/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="479 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="1742229" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0496-01">479 Pa. 496</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="479 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="1742229" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0496-01">388 A.2d 1040</a> (1978).</p>

Accordingly, the report’s omission from trial had no bearing on the outcome of this case. Consequently, trial counsel’s strategy of establishing the victim’s aggressiveness through witnesses rather than a medical report cannot be said to have been unreasonable and against appellee’s interests.</p>
