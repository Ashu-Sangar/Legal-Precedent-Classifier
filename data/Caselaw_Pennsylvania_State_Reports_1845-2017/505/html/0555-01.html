In November, 1979, the appellee sold and conveyed a 5.4 acre parcel carved out of the original 76.39 acre tract.

To encourage this end counties are authorized to extend a tax benefit in the form of a lower assessment to owners of such lands who covenant to preserve the land in an undeveloped state for at least a period of 10 years. The Act is specific as to the land that qualifies for the special tax treatment. “Farm land” must be <em>at least twenty acres </em>in area; it must be in <em>common ownership; </em>and it must be used for growing crops or raising livestock.

The Act contemplates that the entire tract covenanted will remain continually eligible for special tax consideration by preserving the integrity of each of the essential qualifications during the term of the covenant. All of the statutory requirements which make the land eligible in the first instance must continue until the expiration of the covenant. A change in any of the requirements during the term of the covenant constitutes a breach in the sense that the property which is the subject of the covenant is no longer qualified under the Act. One of the essential requirements is that the tract must be in common ownership. During the period of the covenant it must remain in common ownership, otherwise a landowner could obtain preferential tax treatment for a qualified tract which exceeds the acreage requirement and then, with impunity, subdivide the land into parcels smaller in area than is required by the Act.

Preserving land use in this manner, however, has no necessary relationship to ownership or size of these parcels. In fact, if an owner held land under covenant, maintaining the land in farm use, and sold a small parcel of the land to another, it should be irrelevant under the act whether the plot under covenant is owned by one or more persons, providing that the new owner of the small parcel were to maintain the farm use. Common ownership and a certain minimum acreage requirements may be relevant to entering into the covenants, for purposes of administrative convenience, but after the covenants have been executed, these matters are irrelevant to the purpose of the act.</p>

The clear purpose of the Act is to allow for covenants “preserving land uses” not land ownership. The Section of the Act covering breach of the covenant by a land owner makes it clear that it is an altered <em>use </em>and not a change in the status of ownership which will breach the covenant.</p>

This definition of common ownership is the only one that carries out the intent of the Act, which is to preserve land <em>use. </em>In sum, it does not matter who or how many persons own the land or what kind of interest they own, as long as there are twenty acres used and being preserved as farm land.</p>
