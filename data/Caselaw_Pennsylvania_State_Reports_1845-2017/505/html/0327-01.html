    <p id="b383-4" data-blocks='[["BL_383.4",383,[191,793,1162,903]]]'>Appellant argues, however, that the judgment creditor has no property right jeopardized by a tax sale, and that no notice is due to him. We disagree. It is true that a judgment lien is called a general lien — unlike a mortgage which is a specific lien against a particular piece of real property. Such has been the recognized law in this Commonwealth for some time. <em>Ruth’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/54/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="54 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1006320" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0173-01">54 Pa. 173</a> (1867). Our law recognizes that a judgment is a hold on all the debtor’s real estate without discrimination, but our courts have consistently concluded that the judgment creditor is not interested in the property as property, but only in the lien. As was said in <em>Cover v. Black, </em>1 Barr 493 (1845): “The judgment creditor has neither <em>jus in re </em>nor <em>ad rem </em>as regards the (debtor’s) property. He has a lien, and the law gives a right to satisfaction out of the property, and that is all.” <em>Grevermeyer v.

Quite to the contrary, the judgment itself is property which may be defended by forced judicial sale of the debtor’s land. It is quite properly said that judgment creditors are interested in the property of the debtor only because they have a right to seize it, sell it, and satisfy the debt from the proceeds of the sale. It is this very right of execution which gives a judgment lien its effectiveness and great value. Any judicial proceeding which impairs or diminishes the value and reach of the <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>judgment certainly affects its holder adversely.

It does not distinguish between general and specific liens. Mortgages are liens — and hence property interests — on specific assets. A judgment is also a lien — and hence a property interest— covering all real property of the debtor against whom it is entered. Judgments are no less property interests because they are general security interests, attaching to all of a debtor’s real property within the territorial jurisdiction of the court among whose records they are filed, rather than to a specific parcel.

It is this distinction between secured and unsecured creditors that mandates different treatment in our judicial system. Once properly perfected, a secured interest can only be eliminated upon personal notice, and an opportunity to protect such interest. The protection of this valuable property interest served as the basis for the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Mennonite Board of Missions v.

In <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank and Trust Co., supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court was faced with the issue of the sufficiency of notice given to beneficiaries of a common trust fund of the scheduled judicial settlement of the accounting. The effect of this proceeding was to terminate any questions of mismanagement of the common fund, including negligent or illegal impairment of monetary interests or diminution of the trust fund through the payment of fees and expenses. Thus the Court found an actual deprivation of property. Having determined that a beneficiary’s property interest may be substantially impaired by the judicial proceeding, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment mandated that personal notice of the hearing was required to any known beneficiary.</p>

Scott, supra, </em>to buttress its position that “a judgment is property and that a judgment creditor’s interest cannot be deprived without due process of law”. At 335.

In <em>Pennsylvania Company, </em>the plaintiff argued that the legislature attempted to obviate perfected judgments through the use of its lawmaking powers, and as a result was diminishing its property. The judgment was the legal obligation incurred by the judgment debtor. Thus, <em>Pennsylvania Company </em>is in complete accord with my analysis that an underlying obligation cannot be impaired without due process of law. Contrary to what the majority holds today, an underlying obligation is quite different from a lien. The majority’s attempts to equate an underlying debt with a lien are misplaced.</p>

Meyer, supra, </em>for the proposition that a judgment lien represents <em>security </em>for the underlying debt. At 335. In <em>Meyer, </em>the defendant tendered a judgment note containing a confession of judgment clause as restitution to his victim in return for a reduced sentence. The defendant then failed to satisfy the note, and based upon the court’s determination that the defendant misrepresented his penitent state of mind, revoked probation and incarcerated the defendant. The defendant then appealed his sentence. While Judge Hirt does state that “a judgment until made productive by payment is but security for the acknowledged debt” (citation omitted), <a href="/pa-super/169/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="169 Pa. Super. 40" data-case-ids="473071" data-case-paths="/pa-super/169/0040-01">169 Pa.Super. at 44</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%20298" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="82 A.2d 298">82 A.2d at 301</a>, nowhere does the <em>Meyer </em>decision equate a judgment with a secured lien. Relying upon <em>Meyer </em>to support the majority’s conclusion that a general lien is a secured interest creating a valuable property interest extends <em>Meyer </em>far beyond its intended purpose.</p>

For example, under our Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, the Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508 No. 164 § 2, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq., <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>publication is sufficient notice to extinguish a general lien on all the decedent’s property involved in probate administration. 20 Pa.C.S. § 3162. An executor or administrator is under no duty to search the court records and personally advise any and all judgment creditors of distribution. This has been upheld even when the executor has actual knowledge of a creditor. <em>In re Doster’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/346/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="346 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1216487" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0455-01">346 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20142" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="31 A.2d 142">31 A.2d 142</a> (1943). Not only is a judgment creditor’s lien extinguished, but the underlying debt is extinguished as well. Yet, personal notice is not required.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[263,864,1154,426]]]'>Furthermore, a general lien not revived may be extinguished. Unlike a secured lien, a judgment lien must be revived every five years or lose its priority and possibly its status as a lien. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5526. Yet the law is quite clear that although a lien may be extinguished by its failure to be revived, a judgment neither satisfied nor discharged remains in full force and effect. <em>Hinds v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/11/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="11 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="404607" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0019-01">11 Pa. 19</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2019" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="1 Jones 19">1 Jones 19</a> (1849).</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[258,1327,1159,757]]]'>Consequently, it is clear that we have always treated secured creditors, such as mortgagees, and judgment creditors differently. No reason has been advanced to afford a judgment creditor protection which he has neither sought nor bargained for. The majority concludes that failing to give judgment creditors personal notice could impair the judgment creditor’s judgment because he would have “no real opportunity to redeem the property, bid at the tax sale or assert any defects to the sale.” At 338. The majority fails to comprehend that it is not the judgment or underlying debt that will be extinguished, only the lien. The judgment creditor still has the right to proceed on the debt and, if necessary, index another lien upon different property-</p>
    <p id="b392-6" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[260,2120,1153,98]]]'>Accordingly, I would not require actual personal notice be given to an unsecured judgment creditor.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b392-7" data-blocks='[["BL_392.7",392,[302,2296,963,43]]]'>McDERMOTT, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>
