The Unions were on strike between November 7 and December 1, 1975. Employees lost between eleven and fourteen days of work. At the conclusion of the strike, the parties entered into two-year collective bargaining agreements retroactive to July 1, 1975.</p>
    <p id="b52-4" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[266,777,1162,1448]]]'>The agreements provided for 185 days of work per school year for professional employees, and 180 days for non-professional employees. The employees did not work the contracted number of days during the 1975-76 school year because the days missed during the strike were not rescheduled. The Unions claimed that Appellee was required to provide the contracted number of work days by rescheduling the days missed or, failing that, to pay the employees for the days missed. They filed grievances asserting such claim. Appellee refused to arbitrate. The Unions filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, which found the refusal to arbitrate to constitute an unfair labor practice and ordered Appellee to proceed to arbitration. The order was appealed to Commonwealth Court and affirmed. <em>Appalachia Intermediate Unit 08 v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Pa.Cmwlth. 274, <a href="/citations/?q=406%20A.2d%20823" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="406 A.2d 823">406 A.2d 823</a> (1979). Subsequent to the Commonwealth Court’s order and following an arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator ruled in favor of the Unions and ordered Appellee to pay the employees for days missed with interest at a rate of six (6%) percent, running from July 1, 1976 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and compounded annually from that date. The Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County upheld the arbitration award insofar as it ordered payment for days missed, but disallowed the payment of interest. Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas, 75 Pa.Cmwlth. 40, <a href="/citations/?q=460%20A.2d%201234" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="460 A.2d 1234">460 A.2d 1234</a> (1983).

We held there that an arbitration award must be upheld if it can in any rational way be derived from the collective bargaining agreement in light of language, context and other indicia of the parties’ intention. In so holding, we cited the Arbitration Act of April 5, 1927, P.L. 381, No. 248, § 11, 5 P.S. § 171, which provided that a court could modify or correct a statutory arbitration award</p>

      <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>We conclude that this is a substantial reenactment of the corresponding provision of the Arbitration Act of 1927 and that the standard of review of an arbitration award under the Public Employee Relations Act is the same regardless of which arbitration act applies. In the instant case, the collective bargaining agreement stated that professional employees were to work on 185 days and non-professional employees on 180 days. We find that the agreement can rationally be interpreted so as to require Appellee to provide the specified number of work days notwithstanding the strike by rescheduling days missed during the strike. We uphold the arbitrator’s finding to that effect.</p>

Ten days were rescheduled after settlement. The school district later announced that teachers would be required to work a full day on the last day of school. This was contrary to past practice. We upheld the arbitrator’s finding that the collective bargaining agreement did not permit that. We also upheld the arbitrator’s award of damages calculated to compensate the teachers for the extra time they were required to work. We found that to be a proper remedy within the arbitrator’s discretion. We will uphold the damage award in the instant case as well.</p>

The draftsmen may never have thought of what specific remedy should be awarded to meet a particular contingency.”</blockquote>
    <p id="AR" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[176,909,1154,472]]]'>Commonwealth Court concluded that the arbitrator had broad power to fashion a remedy, and such power included the award of interest. It found the award of interest to be reasonable in light of the equities of the case. In the instant case, the arbitrator took note of the delay and the fact that the delay was largely attributable to Appellee’s initial refusal to arbitrate. We find that the arbitrator’s decision to award interest was reasonable in light of the equities and within his power.</p>
    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.6",55,[173,1401,1157,847]]]'>There remains an issue as to whether interest, if awardable, should be simple or compound.

That case involved a retired county employee who was wrongly denied pension benefits. We held that he was entitled to simple but not compound interest on the withheld benefits. We found that the law does not favor compound interest and will permit it only when it is explicitly provided for by contract or statute. There was no such explicit provision in the instant case. In view of the clear statement as enunciated in <em>Powell, </em>we find that the awarding of compound interest is contrary to the existing status of the law. If the award had been made by a jury, it would have resulted in judgment notwithstanding the verdict. It cannot rationally be derived from the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
