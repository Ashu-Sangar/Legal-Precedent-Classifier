    <p id="b58-11" data-blocks='[["BL_58.11",58,[263,1417,1157,584]]]'>Raymond J. Miller appeals by allowance an order of Commonwealth Court which quashed his petition for review of a decision of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board). The court held that Miller’s petition was untimely because it was not filed within thirty (30) days of the entry of the Board’s order. Commonwealth Court based its holding on its determination that Miller’s petition for review was not filed in the Prothonotary’s Office until three days after the final day for filing, and the petition was not accompanied by a date-stamped United States Postal Service Form 3817 evidencing the date of mailing.</p>

Examination of Commonwealth Court’s own internal records would have revealed that the petition was timely mailed, and thus timely filed. Under such limited circumstances the quashing of appellant’s petition by Commonwealth Court was improper, despite the absence of Postal Service Form 3817. The periods of time set by the General Assembly for filing appeals are jurisdictional and efficient court administration requires rules permitting summary determination of whether these requirements have been met. Nevertheless, adherence to such rules prescribing the only evidence of timely mailing which will be acceptable should not result in dismissal if timeliness can be determined by reference to the internal records of the court, and petitioner’s counsel can bring the relevant facts and records which show timeliness to the court’s attention, without the necessity of an evidentiary hearing.</p>

Prior to his layoff, appellant had secured part-time work with a security company during a strike at Mesta. Because his prior application for part-time work was still marked “part-time” when he applied for unemployment compensation after being laid off, the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation held that appellant was not “able and available” for work and denied his claim.</p>
    <p id="b59-6" data-blocks='[["BL_59.6",59,[156,1789,1154,364]]]'>Miller appealed to a referee, who affirmed the Bureau’s decision. He then filed an appeal with the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review. The Board affirmed the referee’s decision on August 18, 1982.

Because the secretary did not mail the petition until after 5:00 P.M. on the 15th, she could not obtain a postal form 3817 or have the certified mail form date-stamped.

All mailings to Commonwealth Court first go to the main post office in Harrisburg. They are then transferred to the court’s post office box at a second post office in Harrisburg where they are picked up by a court employee. Because the second post office is closed Saturdays and Sundays, appellant’s petition could not have been transferred on the 18th or 19th of September, and in order to be present at the second post office on Monday morning when the court picked up its mail, it must have been transferred before 9:20 A.M. Monday the, 20th when the court employee signed for appellant’s petition, or it had to have been transferred there before the weekend.</p>

The Prothonotary stated in a reply letter that in the absence of either a Form 3817 or a date-stamped Form 3800 (Receipt for Certified Mail), he was without authority to amend the dockets of the court to show a filing before September 20. Commonwealth Court granted appellee’s motion to quash <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>the petition, simultaneously denying appellant’s motions for briefing and argument on the motion to quash, his offer of proof of the date of mailing, and his petition to allow appeal <em>nunc pro tunc.</em>

Provision must also be made for determining when the timeliness requirements have been met. It must be possible to determine the timeliness of a filing from either the face of the document or from the internal records of the court. It would be inefficient and unduly burdensome to require courts to hold evidentiary hearings to determine timeliness.

Because it was mailed after 5:00 P.M., no date-stamping was possible. It is manifest, however, that the petition was deposited in the mail before the 30th day, September 17. The fact that it was in the Commonwealth Court post office box at the second Harrisburg post office indicates that it must have been in Harrisburg no later than the 17th, and must therefore have been mailed at the latest on the 16th of September. In short, appellant’s petition could not have arrived “late” on Monday, September 20 unless it had been timely mailed from Clairton before Friday, September 17. Thus, there can be no doubt that appellant “substantially complied” with the 30-day requirement of Pa.R.A.P. 1512(a)(1), and that the dismissal of his petition, under the facts of this case, was improper.</p>
