Zerance, guardian of the estate of Nicholas A. Zerance (insured), seeking judicial construction of a group medical benefits insurance policy issued pursuant to a group plan by the appellant, Guardian Life Insurance Company of America (Guardian Life). The policy in question provided for, inter alia, medical and health benefits coverage for employees of Middletown East End Warehouse Company (Middletown) who qualified under the group plan. We are asked to construe the group insurance policy to determine whether the appellant properly termi<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>nated the insured’s disability benefit payments as of December 31, 1979.

He was insured under the group insurance policy issued by Guardian Life. On February 16, 1974, the insured became disabled due to certain after-effects of surgery.

The medical and nursing expenses necessitated by his disability were covered under the Guardian Life group medical policy from February 16, 1974 until December 31, 1979.</p>

Turley became totally and permanently disabled when he was a member of the association and an employee of the company. He was unable to continue his employment. When that condition arose he became entitled to the benefit from the insurance to be paid to his beneficiary at death. His rights became vested.

The insurance contract in <em>Turley </em>provided that when an insured became totally and permanently disabled, a lump sum benefit vested. The time when payment of that benefit was due depended upon the age of the disabled insured. If the insured was under 60 years of age payment was due immediately to the insured himself. If the insured was over the age of 60 then payment was due upon his death. The total and permanent disability of the insured activated the insurer’s obligation to pay the lump sum benefit and vested the insured’s right to receive it. Under the terms of the policy, this obligation of the insurer and right of the insured was not dependent upon continuation of the insurance contract.</p>

Indeed, subject to the terms of the policy, the disability of the insured activated his right to receive reimbursement for necessary medical expenses as such expenses were incurred. The question here is whether that right can be terminated by cancellation of the policy.</p>

Under the policy, cancellation extinguished the right to benefits, subject to the provisions extending benefits in particular cases. When the insurance terminated for any reason other than non-payment of premium or exhaustion of benefits, the policy provided for “coverage after termination” which extended the insurance coverage until, “the date total disability ends but in no event beyond the last day of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which [the] insurance terminated.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Where the policy language is unambiguous, a court cannot adopt a construction which conflicts with the clear meaning of the language. <em>Patton v.

Accordingly, the argument goes on, the appellant should be estopped from denying payment of benefits up to the stated policy limit. The flaw in appellee’s argument is that there is no evidence establishing the essential element of prejudicial reliance on the part of the appellee or the insured. The memo allegedly relied upon, written in response to a request made by appellee, merely informs appellee of the coverage under the policy. That coverage, of course, was subject to all of the terms of <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>the policy, including the termination provisions. When the memo was sent to the appellee the insured was already disabled and there is no evidence of any action taken or omitted by appellee or the insured in reliance on the information contained in the memo. The appellee did testify that because of the benefits outlined in the memo she continued her employment. She stated that the benefits enabled her to remain employed and have the insured at home under the care of a private nurse. Without the benefits she could not have afforded this in-home care. We find no prejudicial reliance on these facts.</p>
