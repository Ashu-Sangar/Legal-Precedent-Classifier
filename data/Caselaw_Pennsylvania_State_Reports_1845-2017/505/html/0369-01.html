The Commonwealth’s 1983-84 budget reflects that assumption. Section 7’s requirement of an additional one and one quarter percent (1V4 %) of each member’s gross income would lower the Commonwealth’s required contribution for fiscal 1983-84 by one percent (1%) to fifteen and seventy-seven hundredths percent (15.77%). Second, none of the funds saved as a result of this one percent (1%) reduction would be transferred or applied to or used for the benefit of the System or its members. Third, with the exception of an amendment to the definition of “total accumulated deductions” permitting a member to withdraw all contributions to the Fund, including the “additional member contribution,” upon termination, Act 31 includes no amendment or addition to the level of pension benefits or the calculation of annuities provided to members under the Code.</p>
