Durkin and Sons, Inc., (Contractor) entered into a contract on June 12, 1968, under which the Contractor was to construct a new high school for the Authority at a price of $586,000.00. Not long after construction began, the Contractor noticed discrepancies between the site plan topography contour lines and the actual topography conditions. Resolution of these discrepancies required the clearing of an additional three-fourths of an acre of ground at the job site. A dispute arose as to who would bear the cost of clearing and grading this land.</p>
    <p id="b93-8" data-blocks='[["BL_93.8",93,[147,1382,1155,529]]]'>The Authority’s President authorized its secretary to correspond with the Contractor, acknowledging the disagreement and recommending continuation of the work with resolution of any problem at a later time. The Contractor completed the job and billed the authority $22,200.18. for the extra work, claiming he had been induced to perform this work by the letter of April 29, 1969. Work orders submitted to the Authority were rejected except for a tree removal claim of $350.00; the other claims were held to constitute part of the original contract.</p>

The Authority joined the engineers who prepared the sketches. They in turn joined the architects, but both were dismissed from the action during the course of the trial and non-suits were entered in their favor. A jury <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>returned a verdict against the Authority for $32,856.10 (the full claim plus interest) and post trial motions were denied by the trial court in its September 28, 1979, order. That order was affirmed by the Superior Court which held that the April 29, 1969, letter was a waiver of the contract provisions regulating extra work, <em>Durkin v.

The contractor was aware of these <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>duties and had every opportunity to make his own estimate of the necessary excavation and submit a bid including the additional excavations costs, or bring the discrepancy to the Authority’s attention. Once his bid was accepted and the contract was executed, however, he became bound by it, irrespective of discrepancies in the site plan with the actual job conditions. The contractor’s obligation thus was to complete the excavation as part of the original contract at the agreed upon price unless a change order for extras was submitted and approved as provided in the contract. Section 16A of the contract specifically regulates change orders as follows: “No change in the contract shall be made without the written approval of the Board. A request for any change must be in writing.” “Approval” is defined in Section 2 as the “written approval of the Authority and the architect or their authorized representative.”</p>

Here it is argued that the preparation of the change orders was supervised by the architect, contractor, and two members of the Authority Board, and that these members had authority to bind the Board on the change orders. We disagree. There is no evidence that the members were in fact authorized by the Board to prepare these change orders or bind the full Board with their representations. The contract requires written approval of the <em>Board </em>or its authorized <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>agent, and nothing short of this can satisfy the contract provisions. These orders were no more than requests which the Board was free to accept or reject. Accordingly, we find that the Contractor’s change orders were not submitted strictly in accordance with the contract provisions; thus, the claims cannot be allowed.</p>
