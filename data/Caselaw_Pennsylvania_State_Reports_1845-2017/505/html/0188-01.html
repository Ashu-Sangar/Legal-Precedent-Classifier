Pursuant to a negotiated plea, appellee pled guilty to robbery and recklessly endangering and the Commonwealth nol prossed the weapons charges.

Although <em>Shaffer </em>had been decided prior to the Superior Court’s decision in this case, the Superior Court read <em>Shaffer </em>as creating only a limited exception to <em>Ingram’s per se </em>approach; i.e., to be applied only in fact situations similar to that in <em>Shaffer </em>(the defendant pled guilty after the Commonwealth had presented its entire case).</p>
