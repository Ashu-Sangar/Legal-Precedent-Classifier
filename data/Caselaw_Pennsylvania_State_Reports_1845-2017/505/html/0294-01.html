The Commonwealth Court interpreted this requested relief as one for counsel fees and costs incurred in the litigation of <em>Cianfrani I </em>ending in 1982 in which the constitutionality of Act 140 as applied to Cianfrani was resolved. Inspection of the pleading before the Commonwealth Court does not <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>support the interpretation that the requested counsel fees and costs are for those incurred in <em>Cianfrani I, </em>the only reference to a request for counsel fees and costs being in the prayer for relief.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Having determined that Commonwealth Court correctly sustained the demurrer to the cause of action asserted, it follows that any claim for counsel fees and costs falls along with the cause of action, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 1726(2) (establishing guideline for award of costs and counsel fees in certain cases, but only to a prevailing party).</p>
