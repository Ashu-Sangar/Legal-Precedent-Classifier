After filing an omnibus pretrial motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant, the Appellant presented a motion for reconsideration of his discovery request, asking the court to order disclosure of the informant’s identity “to afford [the Appellant] an adequate opportunity to challenge the veracity of the sworn statement included by the police in securing the search warrant.” In addition, the motion set forth the following averments: that the “underlying circumstances” contained in the warrant application were false; that the affiants knew or should have known that this information was false; and that the affiants nevertheless deliberately included this false information in their application, or included it with reckless disregard for the <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>truth.

It is clear that the Commonwealth had no intention, nor did it have any need, to call the informant as an eyewitness at the trial of these charges.

It is important to note that the Rule speaks in terms of a showing <em>by the defendant. </em>These conditions cannot be assumed, and they must be supported by evidence on the record. It is in this context that the evidence presented at the hearing must be examined to determine whether the defendant met his burden (or more precisely whether the court abused its discretion in determining that he had).</p>

A thorough review of the record leaves no doubt that because of serious gaps in the evidence actually produced the Appellant failed to substantiate this offer of proof. Taking all of the testimony of the defendant’s witnesses as true, that testimony does not so directly and completely contradict the informant’s “tip” as recited by the policemen in the affidavit as to require the conclusion that the “underlying circumstances” of the affidavit were false. It is readily apparent that during the period from 2:00 to 6:00 or 7:00 a.m., neither witness had the capacity to be aware of whether anyone else was present in the house. Indeed, the Appellant’s mother testified that at one point she heard one set of footsteps which she assumed were her son’s. Given that she was asleep for at least some period of time, it cannot be concluded that there were no other footsteps that night, that she would have heard other footsteps if there were any, or even that the footsteps she heard were actually those of her son. It is thus by no means established, from the entirety of the Appellant’s proferred evidence, that the “underlying circumstances” of the warrant were false.</p>

Fundamental fairness requires that disclosure of an informant be permitted where pretrial proceedings cast substantial doubt upon the veracity of an affiant who has supplied probable cause information for a search warrant and where disclosure is needed to confirm or dispel those doubts. This Court established over a decade ago that “the veracity of facts establishing probable cause recited in an affidavit supporting a warrant can be challenged and examined at a [pretrial] suppression hearing.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Further, the court found inherently incredible the affiant’s testimony that an informant who feared for his life would walk into the highly visible headquarters of the Pittsburgh Police Department at 9:00 a.m. to meet with a narcotics detective.

The Supreme Court held that as a matter of federal constitutional law a state could not absolutely prohibit challenges to the veracity of a search warrant affidavit, but that such challenges must at least be allowed where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that the affiant knowingly or intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, included in the warrant affidavit a false statement necessary to the finding of probable cause. This Court has held as a matter of state constitutional law that a defendant is entitled to make such an inquiry into the veracity of statements included in an affidavit without a “substantial preliminary showing” of the potential falsity of those facts. <em>Commonwealth v. Hall, </em><a href="/pa/451/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="451 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1948559" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0201-01">451 Pa. 201</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=302%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="302 A.2d 342">302 A.2d 342</a> (1973).

It must not be overlooked that the ultimate issue in the suppression hearing is whether the policemen/affiants had probable cause at the time they applied for the search warrant. The Commonwealth, of course, carries the burden of proving that the facts presented to the magistrate demonstrate probable cause. The defendant, however, must carry the burden of proving his allegations that the information was not factual and that the affiants nevertheless deliberately presented it to the magistrate. Moreover, as was recently emphasized by the United States Supreme Court, "the task of a reviewing court is not to conduct a de novo determination of probable cause, but only to determine whether there is <em>substantial evidence in the record supporting the magistrate’s decision </em>to issue the warrant." <em>Massachusetts v.

N.T. December 19, 1978 at 6-7. The mere fact that one possible outcome of disclosure might be suppression does not convert a discovery proceeding into a suppression hearing. Thus, the Superior Court erred in treating this proceeding as a suppression hearing and in applying standards of appellate review appropriate to the latter.

The Opinion in Support of Affirmance restricts the operation of subsection (a) to names and addresses of ‘"eyewitnesses’ to these crimes of possession.” At 424. There is no need to analyze the propriety of this construction of Pa.R.Crim.Pro. 305 B(2)(a) as subsection (d) fully supports the court’s disclosure order in this case. I would point out, however, that the rule does not by its terms limit “eyewitnesses” and that, if a person observes a material fact or event relevant to an issue in the proceeding, that person could be considered an "eyewitness” to that fact or event.
