The panel affirmed an order of the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. Orphans’ Court entertained the appeal of George A. Butler, Jr. from a decree of Philadelphia’s Register of Wills, reversed the Register and directed him to admit to probate testator Joseph C. Pedrick’s September 27, 1979 will written by appellee George A. Butler, Jr. That will distributed the testator’s entire estate to appellee and his brother, Edmund B. Butler. It also named appellee executor. The sole question before us is the effect of appellee’s conduct as attorney-scrivener-beneficiary on his right to use Orphans’ Court process to secure a benefit under the will from conduct which, while not illegal, is not only far below those standards acceptable in the legal profession, but additionally plainly frustrates full equitable inquiry into the substantive issues presented. On the undisputed facts of this case, we hold that appellee, proponent of the September 27, 1979 will, came into equity with unclean hands. Thus, the Orphans’ Court erred in granting him affirmative relief. Therefore, we reverse.</p>

Pedrick, unmarried and childless, one time Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, made at least four wills in his lifetime. The first two were prepared in 1959 and 1972 by his long time personal attorney, appellee’s father. In them he left his modest estate to that attorney. In the course of time the father was joined in his legal practice by his sons, this <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>appellee and Edmund, appellee’s brother. Still later, in 1975, death came to the father, but his two sons continued the family law firm. In August of 1977 testator came one day to the law firm his dead friend had founded. That he did so is undisputed. Whether he and appellee quarreled is unclear.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> However, about one month later he sought the services of Thomas Mettee, Esquire. Mr. Mettee prepared a third will in which Mr. Pedrick left his entire estate to a boy he had raised, John Gregory, the appellant here.</p>
    <p id="b582-5" data-blocks='[["BL_582.4",582,[243,787,1153,1221]]]'>On September 27, 1979, Mr. Pedrick, old and sick, lay in St. Mary’s Hospital. On that day he learned from his doctor that the cancer which now invaded his prostate, spine, liver and lung would kill him and that he should prepare for death. Along with this terminal process he then suffered from acute congestive heart failure, acute dyspnea, arteriosclerosis, diverticulosis and hernia. These maladies had visited his mind and body with a downhill course over the two years since his last will. Impending death medically confirmed, he asked a nursing sister to call the Butler law firm to see to his will. The nurse, Sister Catherine Joseph, called appellee to come to the hospital. In response to that call appellee went to the hospital although he found it most inconvenient. There, on that day, in that condition, while alone with the son and namesake of his dead friend and attorney, testator signed his fourth will leaving his still modest estate to the scrivener and the scrivener’s brother. No witness, disinterested or otherwise, attested that will. That will was not re-executed or republished in the presence of any witness whatsoever when appellee returned alone two days later to have testator name appellee himself beneficiary on testator’s federal pension.</p>

Appellee then sought the aid of the Orphans’ Court Division, a court in which equitable principles apply. That court noted appellee’s “unfortunate and inexcusable” conduct, but nevertheless opened its halls to aid him because it could not find undue influence under our governing case law. However, it did ignore the maxim that he who asks the sovereign, in its conscience, to support him, must put out hands undirtied in the matter where he seeks the sovereign’s aid.</p>

Thus, appellee’s failure to live up to that Code, standing alone, would not invalidate this will. Here, however, we have not only a clear departure from ethical standards, but other conduct which plainly frustrates a determination based on untainted disinterested evidence as to whether this testator freely willed his worldly goods to appellee and appellee’s brother. Appellee’s failure to secure any witness to what transpired between him and the testator, despite the second opportunity created when he came back two days later to effect a beneficiary change in his own favor, effectively insulated the will he prepared to his own benefit from any acceptable inquiry into the very issue before the court, undue influence. A court applying equitable principles is not open to such a supplicant.</p>

He also testified that although Mr. Pedrick did not <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>know he was George Butler, Mr. Pedrick recognized him as one of the Butler brothers and asked him about his brother’s family. N.T. 140-43. He said that Mr. Pedrick then told him he wanted to make a will. When Mr. Butler asked Mr. Pedrick “what do you want in your will,” he gestured and said “I want you to take it.” Appellee said he replied, “... Joe, that’s very kind of you, thanks for that, but is there anybody else you want to consider?” The decedent was said to answer, “No. I want you to take it.” Appellee continued by stating that he then thanked the testator and asked, “... since you are giving it to me ... would you have any objection if I would divide that and give part of it away to my brother?” The testator is said to have answered that he had no objections and to again have stated that he wanted appellee to have everything. N.T. 143-44. According to Butler, he then asked Mr. Pedrick whom he wanted to name as his executor and Mr. Pedrick replied “you are taking it ... you act.” N.T. 144. Appellee then hand drafted the will and Mr. Pedrick executed it. Appellee said they then talked about mutual friends and appellee’s father. By his own admission, appellee made no effort to obtain subscribing witnesses to the will because, in his experience, medical personnel are reluctant to become involved in preparation of such documents and he did not “think” there were any ambulatory patients around.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> N.T. 168-69.</p>

However, he stated that he did not have someone else draft the will because “the call I received from Sister Catherine placed emphasis on the fact that he wanted to see me that night.” Most experienced practitioners would find such an explanation not implausible. Indeed, in the case of a testator <em>in extremis, </em>or one who dies without further opportunity to republish his will, the need for immediate preparation may well render execution in this manner wholly ethical, despite a testamentary disposition to the receiver. However, that explanation fails in the face of appellee’s own testimony that he returned to the hospital on September 29 to obtain Mr. Pedrick’s signature on a change of beneficiary form naming appellee himself beneficiary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Although he did not believe that Mr. Pedrick was dying appellee thought it “prudent” to execute the change of beneficiary form immediately because he expected to be away from Philadelphia for six weeks.

After that hearing, the Register entered a decree admitting, the third will to probate and denying probate of the fourth will appellee had prepared. Mr. Butler appealed to Common Pleas’ Orphans’ Court Division. After a series of hearings on the same questions raised before the Register of Wills, the Court held that the fourth will was not obtained by undue influence, vacated the Register’s decree and ordered him to admit the fourth will to probate.

In so doing the court seemed to ignore the difference between the general debilitation that so weakens the intellect as to make the old and the sick peculiarly subject to influence and the markedly more serious loss of faculties which deprive a testator of the capacity to make a will. <em>See supra </em>at 218, n. 3. So treating the matter the hearing judge first concluded, based on appellee’s testimony, that appellants had failed to produce clear and convincing evidence that Joseph Pedrick’s intellect was weakened and, therefore, that they retained throughout the burden of persuading him of undue influence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The hearing <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>judge then determined that appellants had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that appellee exercised undue influence over Mr. Pedrick. Alternatively, the hearing judge stated that even if the burden of proof with respect to undue influence had shifted to appellee under the medical and other evidence, appellee’s own testimony clearly and convincingly showed that he had not exerted undue influence. We note, however, that the hearing judge relied heavily on Mr. Pedrick’s previous wills as evidence of an unfettered intention to confer a benefit on the Butlers. In so doing he emphasized the long years of service which Mr. Butler, Sr. had provided to Mr. Pedrick. Although the Orphans’ Court <em>en banc </em>affirmed these findings, it did conclude that appellee, who, “over the years had earned the <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>confidence of this court,” here “engaged in unfortunate and inexcusable” conduct. The court <em>en banc </em>stated appellee’s failure to advise the testator to seek the advice of independent counsel violated Ethical Consideration 5-5 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

The hearing court chose not to believe testimony of Dr. De and Dr. Connor, Mr. Pedrick’s treating physicians, to the effect that as a result of organic brain syndrome and arteriosclerosis he was forgetful, disoriented and depressed. Dr. De, who was treating Mr. Pedrick for arteriosclerotic heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiomegaly, described Mr. Pedrick as “quite forgetful, depressed” and withdrawn and stated Mr. Pedrick’s memory was grossly impaired and that he frequently lost his train of thought. The hearing judge erroneously stated that Dr. Connor’s testimony was “vague" and "ambiguous.” Dr. Connor specifically testified that decedent was “not capable of physically or mentally taking care of himself’; that decedent was at times "cognizant” but would then “go off on a tangent”; and that his arteriosclerosis affected his mental capability.

In <em>Younger, </em>however, Superior Court accurately notes that at the time we decided <em>Paul </em>and <em>Gold </em>the American Bar Association Canons of Professional Ethics which governed the conduct of attorneys did not proscribe an attorney from drafting an instrument under which he takes as a beneficiary. Canon 11 merely admonished a lawyer "to refrain from any action whereby for personal benefit or gain he abuses or takes advantage of the confidence reposed in him by his client.” For the reasons noted in the text, at 541, we disapprove the <em>Younger </em>court’s holding that an attorney-scrivener-beneficiary’s violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides a basis for shifting the burden of proof on the issue of undue influence to him.</p>

[T]he principle was established from the earliest days, that while the court of chancery could interpose and compel a defendant to comply with the dictates of conscience and good faith with regard to matters outside of the strict rules of the law, or even in contradiction to those rules, while it could act <em>upon the conscience </em>of a defendant and force him to do right and justice, it would never thus interfere on behalf of a plaintiff whose own conduct in connection with the same matter or transaction had been unconscientious or unjust, or marked by a want of good faith, or had violated any of the principles of equity and righteous dealing which it is the purpose of the jurisdiction to sustain.

However, he admitted that he called the funeral director and told him "as far as I know, I am named as the executor and there has been verbal instructions about cremation.” N.T. 181.

Dr. De, the decedent’s treating cardiologist, testified before the hearing court that, .as a result of organic brain syndrome and arteriosclerosis, the patient exhibited forgetfulness, disorientation and depression. Further, Dr. Connor, the decedent’s treating physician of over twenty years, testified that he treated the decedent for congestive heart failure, arteriosclerosis, pleural effusion of the lung, cardiomegaly, and cerebral metastatic carcinoma, among other ailments. Dr. Connor testified that the decedent was “not capable of physically or mentally taking care of himself”, that he was “decrepit and feeble”, and that his physical abilities were impaired. Indeed, in the summer of 1979, Dr. Connor testified that the decedent visited his office wearing clothes covered with urine and excrement. Dr. Connor further testified that Mr. Pedrick would often be conversing coherently only to go off on a tangent, that he had a poor ability for prolonged concentration and that he was unaware of his assets.

The majority concedes that the lower courts did not commit reversible error in <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>determining that undue influence had not been established by the contestant to the will, but interjects its equity analysis to justify its conclusion. The foundation for its holding is that the Appellee’s conduct interfered with the court’s "... determination based on untainted disinterested evidence, as to whether this testator freely willed his worldly goods to Appellee and Appellee’s brother.” [Majority op. at 535]. The conduct of the Appellee to which the majority refers is:</p>
    <blockquote id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[221,762,1107,365]]]'>“Appellee’s failure to secure any witness to what transpired between him and the testator, despite the second opportunity created when he came back two days later to effect a beneficiary change in his own favor, effectively insulated the will he prepared to his own benefit from any acceptable inquiry into the very issue before the court, undue influence.” [Majority op. at 535].</blockquote>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[176,1146,1151,518]]]'>The majority opinion unduly emphasizes the Appellee’s failure to have the decedent re-execute the will in the presence of disinterested subscribing witnesses. The error in this reasoning is that it disregards the function of a subscribing witness to testify to the authenticity of the testator’s signature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> The presence of subscribing witnesses would not eliminate the need for a court’s determination of undue influence, nor would it resolve the issue. Even if witnesses had been secured, inquiry into the presence of undue influence would not have been foreclosed.</p>
    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[175,1691,1150,366]]]'>Typically, the witnesses are unaware of the contents of the document. Subscribing witnesses would rarely be privy to discussions between an attorney and client related to the dispositive provisions of a will. Nor would witnesses necessarily be aware of whatever pressures may have been brought to bear on a testator’s scheme. This is the common experience whether or not the beneficiary is the attorney.</p>

      <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>Since procuring witnesses would not have prevented the contestant to the will from challenging the validity of its provisions by claiming undue influence, his failure to do so may not reasonably be interpreted as conduct barring the attorney from receiving property which has been devised to him. The majority ignores the very nature of the attorney-client relationship. The practical, but unintended, effect of the majority’s opinion is that the Appellant is permitted to accomplish through a circuitous route what the Court expressly disdains — enforcing the Code of Professional Responsibility by affecting the substantive rights of an attorney-beneficiary during litigation of the contestant’s claim.</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[274,922,1151,950]]]'>It is inconceivable to me that a contestant should be permitted to successfully raise a claim of undue influence without having to establish the claim at trial. And, yet, that is the outcome of the holding in the majority’s opinion. The majority accepts the hearing court’s finding, supported by the record, that the will was not procured by the exercise of undue influence, but permits the contestant to prevail. If, as the majority finds, the Appellee’s conduct inhibited inquiry into the issue of undue influence, so too has the majority prevented such inquiry by creating a rule which would prevent a hearing court from making an independent finding based on evidence presented. The majority recognizes that the Appellee had the burden of going forward with evidence to demonstrate that there was no undue influence. The effect of the majority’s reasoning, however, is that the attorney-beneficiary is put out of court because of “unclean hands” without the opportunity to meet his burden.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[274,1901,1149,312]]]'>I agree with the majority that the Code of Professional Responsibility does not have the force of substantive law. Until such time as the substantive law relating to an attorney-beneficiary has been altered by statute or rule, it should not be legislated by this Court in individual cases under the guise of equity.</p>
