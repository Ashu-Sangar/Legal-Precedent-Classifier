Her residuary estate, after other pre-residuary gifts, passed in equal shares to Appellant and ten other residuary legatees. A codicil dated October, 1970, reaffirmed these gifts. The record reveals that at decedent’s death she did not own the New Stanton property, having conveyed her interest on July 28, 1976 to Antonio and Rose Josephine Pagano. At decedent’s death, it was discovered that her share of the proceeds of the sale (approximately $127,000.00) had been commingled with other funds and was in her husband’s (Harry L. Schofield) possession. The executor instituted an Equity action against the husband, alleging that he misappropriated the sale proceeds for his own use. The Executor ultimately recovered the full amount claimed, less attorney fees, and included this net recovery of $99,500.00 in his Petition for Distribution, <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>recommending that it be distributed among the eleven residuary legatees.</p>

Appellant bases these arguments on a comparison of the current 20 Pa.C.S. Section 2514(16.1) with former 20 Pa.C.S. Section 2514(16) which provided prior to July 9, 1976 as follows:</p>

The Uniform Probate Code language refers to a “conservator,” the use of which clearly implies that a formal adjudication of incompetency has occurred prior to death. Although our. Section 2514(16.1) does not refer to “guardians” or “conservators,” it concludes with the sentence “this paragraph does not apply if subsequent to the sale, exchange, condemnation, or casualty, the Testator has been adjudicated competent and sur<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>vives the adjudication by one year.” Since only an adjudged incompetent can be subsequently adjudged competent, it is clear that the legislative intent was not to change the former provision of 2514(16) and thus create a new proceeding in which the Court would be compelled to make an adjudication of competency or incompetency <em>after </em>the death of the Testator. Our reading of this Section as a whole convinces us that its scope encompasses only formal pre-death adjudications of incompetency.</p>

In furtherance of that end, both sections establish a rule avoiding ademption where specific devises are destroyed by sale, condemnation, or act of God at a time when the affairs of the testator are formally in the hands of a court appointed guardian. Each section specifically provides for its inapplicability where an adjudication of competency is made and the testator survives for a one year period.</p>

(See Sections 5511(a), (c)). All of these sections indicate a consistent use of “incompetent” in our Probate Code which carries over into Section 2514(16.1).</p>

After all, if a testator, during his lifetime, divests himself of (or is involuntarily divested of) property which he had by will devised to a named beneficiary, the subject matter of the devise is no longer a part of his property. What a testator no longer has he cannot pass on to an heir. If, however, there is added the additional fact that the divestiture was procured by fraud and undue influence intended to enrich the fraudulent schemer, or his objects, to the detriment of the intended testamentary beneficiary, the logical appeal of the ademption rule evaporates.

By rephrasing the exception provided in section 14 of the Wills Act of 1947 the legislature not only rewrote the words but intended to change their consequence. The amended exception is now entitled, “Nonademption; incompetency” and it seems to me most clear that incbmpetency, whether adjudicated or not, is an exception to ademption. By removing the necessity for an “adjudged” incompetency before the exception applies, it seems most clear that incompetency may be raised whenever it is ascertained, before or after death.</p>
