L. 544. There is no evidence that the association accepted the act of April 10, 1879, P. L. 16. In October, 1874, the defendant became a member of the association by subscribing for five shares of its capital stock, second series; and in October, 1876, he subscribed for twenty additional shares in the third series, but subsequently withdrew six of these last mentioned shares, which left him the owner of nineteen shares. The’ by-laws of the association provide inter alia as follows: Each stockholder for each share held by him must pay into the treasury at each stated monthly meeting the sum of one dollar, which are called his monthly dues, until the value of the whole stock shall be sufficient to divide to each share of stock the sum of $200. The holder of each share of stock is entitled to a loan from the association of $200. These loans must be made in open meeting to the highest bidder, but no loan can be accepted at less than ten per cent, premium. When a loan is effected the borrower receives the amount of loan bid, less the premium, but he must give his obligation for the full amount and must pay interest on the same monthly. To secure the repayment of the loan, with interest, the borrower is required to give a satisfactory bond and mortgage, and in addition for every loan of $200 he must transfer one share of stock to the association as collateral security.</p>

The mortgage calls for the payment of $5,000, but the correct sum is $8,800. After giving the mortgage the defendant frequently defaulted in the payment of both his monthly dues and interest, in consequence of which he was charged with a fine of ten cents monthly on each dollar of his indebtedness at the time the fines were imposed. To illustrate: Defendant’s monthly dues and interest amounted to $38. In February, 1879, he defaulted. By adding the ten per cent, we have his total indebtedness for that month $41.80. He defaulted again the next month, making his total indebtedness, including the fine for February, $79.80. To get at the amount of his fines for March, ten per cent, on the $79.80 was calculated, and so on to the end of the chapter. An account of these fines was kept, not only in the books of the association, but also in a book furnished to the defendant for his information.</p>

In addition to <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>these sums the defendant was then indebted on protested checks -given for fines and dues, for which he had received credit, in a sum sufficient to increase his indebtedness for fines,, dues and interest to considerably more than $1,000. On the said 22d day of May the defendant, under the threat that his mortgage would be foreclosed, paid $1,000. A few days after-wards he paid in addition a sum sufficient to cancel his entire indebtedness to the association for fines, dues and interest. These payments were made by the defendant voluntarily, with a full knowledge of the facts, and for the purpose of squaring his accounts with the association, and they were so applied. After thus squaring his accounts the defendant continued to be a ■ member of the association, sometimes paying his dues and interest and sometimes defaulting as before, until Feb. 14, 1885, when his stock was declared forfeited at a meeting of the board of directors, the defendant having neglected to pay his monthly dues and fines for the space of six months prior to the date last mentioned.</p>

During the same period he made payments, as appears from the books of the association, as follows: Dues, $335; interest, $335; fines, $442.59; total, $1,112.59.

This would include fines previously imposed, as well as the amount previously owing for dues and interest. The question then arises whether such a by-law is a valid exercise of the legislating power of the association.</p>

The provision of the sixth section of the act of 1859 that no premiums, fines or interest on such premiums that may accrue according to the provisions of the act shall be deemed usurious, must be held, so far as fines are concerned, to be limited to such fines as are imposed under by-laAvs which are lawful. Is then the by-law in question a valid by-law? That depends upon a consideration of its meaning and effect.</p>

The words are, “ each and every stockholder or trustee who shall neglect or refuse to pay his monthly dues or interest as often as the same shall become due and payable shall forfeit and pay the additional sum of ten cents monthly on each and every dollar due by him.” It is clear the ten cents penalty or forfeiture is to be paid monthly. This being so, it is to be repeated every month during which the amount due remains unpaid. The effect of this would be that if at the end of December in any year the member was indebted fifty dollars to the association and remained so throughout the year following, he would then owe as a fine twelve times the original penalty on that one default, in other words, one hundred and twenty per cent, upon the principal sum for which default was made. In addition to this he would also owe the full interest he might be paying on the amount expressed in his obligation, no matter how usurious that interest might be. Still further, as the balance is to be struck at the end of each month, the member would owe at that time all that he owed at the end of the preceding month, and, in addition thereto, the interest and penalty for the eurrentmonth besides the dues; and the account would be made up by charging him with ten per cent, upon the principal, the interest and the fine, due at the end of the preceding month, and adding them to the dues and interest of the current month. If another default was then made, the same process would .be repeated at the end of each succeeding month during the continuance of the defaults. It is needless to enter into a detailed computation to show what the aggregate result of such a process would be in any given case. That it is unreasonable, extortionate and oppressive to the last degree must be at once conceded. If the .monthly penalty were a hundred per cent, instead of ten it would only be a difference in degree, not in character. Of course if there is an unlimited right to impose, by means of a by-law, any amount of fine or penalty which the association may please to ordain, and the law is powerless to interfere, the results must be accepted, no matter how unjust or oppressive they may be. But we do not so understand the law upon this subject.</p>

While it may be conceded, that as between a corporation and one of its members a somewhat different rule would prevail, from that which would be applicable as between the corporation and strangers, yet there is a limit of authority even when corporators only are affected. We have not been referred to any case in which an unlimited authority to impose fines by a building association, has been declared by any court. A number of decisions adverse to such a right have been made by courts of last resort though none by this court, the direct question having, apparently, never been before us. The legislature of Pennsylvania by the sixth section of the act of April 10, 1879, P. L. 17, enacted that “fines or penalties for the nonpayment of instalments of dues, interest and bonus or .premiums, shall not exceed two per centum per month on all arrearages.” If this plaintiff were subject to this law the question would be settled at once, and all of the fines in excess of two per cent, per month would be undoubtedly illegal. But the plaintiff was chartered under the act of 1859, and it is admitted, or at least found by the court below and the finding not challenged, that it has never accepted the provisions ■of the act of 1879, and therefore is not subject to it. We do not, however, see that this circumstance is very material, because there is no previous statutory authority to exact any specified fine, and the open question we are considering is, what is the law in the absence of such authority ? It is very clear now, and since 1879, that the policy of the law in this commonwealth, is that building associations shall not exact oppressive and extortionate fines from their defaulting members, and we feel amply justified in deciding, as we now do, that a fair inference flows from this legislation that fines in excess of two per cent, per month are oppressive and unreasonable by policy of law. That policy is put in the form of explicit statutory mandate as to all associations which are subject to the operation of the act of 1879, whether by subsequent incorporation, or by previous incorporation, and subsequent acceptance. As to the time anterior to the statute we feel no hesitancy in saying that a monthly penalty of ten per cent, repeated by arithmetical progression with each succeeding default, was clearly oppressive, extortionate and unreasonable, by policy of law and by the teachings of the enlightened con<a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>science of men. The effect of such a taint upon a by-law is to render it void, and hence we are not called upon to fix upon any rate of fine which would have been reasonable and hold the by-law good for that rate and void only as to the excess. The taint is fatal to its validity and it is therefore without any force. The purpose of the fine is merely to enforce the payment of the dues and interest, and as this is only an obligation for the payment of money, the extortionate character of the penalty becomes the more conspicuous in proportion to the amount by which it exceeds the ordinary rate allowed by law, and by general consent, for the use of money. .No sound reason can be advanced for the necessity of exacting so gross a penalty for a mere omission to pay a debt.</p>

Thus in Ohio, the legislature of the state expressly authorized building and loan associations to levy and collect from their members, “ such suifis of money by rate of stated dues, fines .....as the corporation by its laws may adopt.” Here would <em>seem </em>to be an unlimited authority to the associations to impose any amount of fines they might see fit, but the Supreme Court of Ohio said, in a case arising under its provisions: “ It is to be regretted that the legislature was not more specific in making the grant of power thus intended to be conferred. .....That there are limits, however, beyond which the corporation by its by-laws cannot go, is undoubted. (1) The amount of the fine must be reasonable. (2) It can be imposed only by way of punishment for some delinquency in the performance of a duty which the member may owe to the corporation by reason of his membership. (3) It is unreasonable, and therefore, we assume that the legislature did not intend that more than one fine should be imposed for the same delinquency: ” Hagerman v. The Ohio B. &amp; S.

Gallier, cited by Birdseye, J., in the Citizens’ Mutual Loan and Accumulating Fund Association v. Webster, <a href="/barb/25/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="25 Barb. 263" data-case-ids="5002789" data-case-paths="/barb/25/0263-01">25 Barb. 263</a>. Mr. Endlich, in § 413 of his excellent work, says : “ The proper measure of fines is the real damage the building association sustains from the failure of a member to pay his dues, which damage is really equal to interest upon the amount together with the proportion coming to it from the then attainable premiums upon the sale of money. The fine should be slightly in excess of this, so as to make it more profitable to the member to pay promptly than to lag behind...... A fine of from one to two per cent, per month would in nearly all cases be sufficient and just;” citing Ocmulga Building &amp; Loan Association, <a href="/ga/52/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="52 Ga. 427" data-case-ids="868955" data-case-paths="/ga/52/0427-01">52 Ga. 427</a>.

This is not an action to recover back the illegal fines, but a scire facias by the association on the mortgage given by the defendant; and the question is, for what amount shall judgment be entered, or, rather, how much is legally due on the mortgage. There is a clear distinction between a suit to recover back moneys which have been paid by mistake either of law or fact, and interposing as a defence such payments as could not have been recovered on account of their illegality. In the latter class of cases, the payments as a rule are credited on the amount legally due. This is always done in cases of usurious payments where the obligation is still outstanding. We can see no difference in principle between that class of cases and the present. While it may be true that the fines are no part of the mortgage debt, it is also true that they are moneys paid by defendant to plaintiff in consequence of a relation of debtor and creditor existing between them; and if the creditor have no right to receive them as fines, he has no right to receive them in any other capacity than as creditor. Being received by a creditor it is obvious the moneys thus paid must be applied to whatever was legally due. Even if the question depended upon whether the defendant made the payments distinctively as for fines, the evidence is not at all clear that such was the fact. A gross sum was paid of which the fines were a part, but no specific receipt was given and the credits entered in the account were in aggregate sums. But we think this feature of the case quite immaterial; since the payments, so far as the fines are concerned, were for illegal demands which the plaintiff could not claim, and having received them, cannot either in law or in conscience retain them. The question in this proceeding is only how much is legally due upon the obligation in suit, and in determining <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>tliat question, credit should be given for ail moneys claimed and received as fines.</p>
