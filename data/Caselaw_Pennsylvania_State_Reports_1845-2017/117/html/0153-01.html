    <p class="summary" id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[252,490,1182,1268]]]'>The evidence shows that Kingsbury conveyed this land, whether by valid conveyance or not, in the view we take of it, is a matter of no consequence now, to A. W. Newell, and A. W. Newell within a year or so after he acquired title conveyed the title to the present plaintiff, Lewis Emery, Jr. In 1869, some years prior to the date of the deed from Kingsbury to Newell, Newell contracted the land to Frances DeGolier, who was to pay for it $520 in instalments of $60 per annum. The contract was in writing and signed by himself and her. She and her husband went into possession under it and remained in possession some years. They were in possession at the time this writ was served, and occupying a house on the premises of which there were some ten or twelve acres cleared. During the time intervening between the taking of this contract and the bringing of this suit there was a year or two that they were out of possession. The premises were unoccupied and the doors of the house were allowed to swing open, and the fields, so far as the evidence indicates, were uncultivated. Upon the evidence thus given several questions have been raised. On the part of the plaintiff we are asked to instruct you in the first place, that Mrs. DeGolier having been a married woman at the time this contract was entered into was incompetent to enter into a valid and binding contract, and that the contract which she did enter into is not capable of enforcement in her favor in this action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[251,1777,1181,660]],["BL_175.1",175,[160,377,1185,613]]]'>It is true, gentlemen, that a married woman is incompetent to make a contract; yet such contracts for the purchase of land have been in many instances in this state — where the purchase money has been secured by judgment bond or note on which judgment has been entered — recognized as conveying the land validly, sufficiently to the vendee, and such security has been recognized as an equitable lien on the land conveyed; and in this qualified manner these contracts have been enforced. In this case Mrs. DeGolier made the first three payments on this contract substantially in accordance with its terms. Improvements were made upon the land, and they were for several years in possession and, according to her testimony, cultivating the land, and were found in possession <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>when this action of ejectment was brought; and we instruct you in reply to the first point submitted by plaintiff’s counsel, that the fact that she went into possession under the contract from A. W. Newell, the plaintiff’s vendor, and that there is due upon that contract a portion of the purchase money, are facts that it is entirely competent for the court and jury to take into consideration, and as justice and equity can be done by securing the purchase money which the vendor contracted for on the one hand, and secure to his vendee the benefit of her contract on the other, [we say to you that under the circumstances of this case this contract is capable of enforcement in such a way, in equity.] 1</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[161,998,1186,1436]],["BL_176.1",176,[237,368,1188,611]]]'>The second point of plaintiff’s counsel is one in which we are asked to charge you that this contract was forfeited. There were certain stipulations in the contract, and among them this: That in case the premises should remain unoccupied six months or in case the purchase money should remain unpaid — any of the instalments — the contract should thereby become void as to the first party. Now, such stipulations are enforced under proper circumstances; and if A. W. Newell had entered on this ground during the time possession was vacant, and had resisted the return of the defendant, and insisted that he had entered under this covenant or stipulation and availed himself of the forfeiture, we tbink he would have been in by virtue of his legal right and it would have been incompetent for the defendant to have dispossessed him; and the question of the enforceability of this contract would have been raised under circumstances when we should have had to say to you that it could not be enforced. If this woman were out of possession, seeking to recover as against her vendor the possession of this property as against any condition broken, we should have to say that the contract could not be enforced. But no entry was made by the vendor, and there was no effort to take advantage of any forfeiture or to collect this money or to take possession of the land that was left vacant. On the other hand she was allowed to return to it and resume her possession and cultivation, and this action of ejectment was not brought until some time subsequently. We instruct you in answer to the second point, that the forfeiture, or grounds of forfeiture that may have existed, not having been taken ad<a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>vantage of properly, are to be regarded as waived; and that ,the defendant having been in the quiet and peaceful possession of these premises when this action of ejectment was brought, is entitled to the benefit of the contract under which she entered. It has not been terminated by any act of the vendor by prompt effort of the vendor to avail himself of the existence of any clause of forfeiture, and not having been so terminated by his act while the possession was vacant, this action of ejectment, brought a considerable time after her return and that of her husband to possession, does not place her vendor, or the plaintiff who here represents him, in a position to insist upon these forfeitures.</p>

[We think your duty so far as this case is concerned will be discharged when you have ascertained the amount due upon this contract and have fixed a reasonable time, and in view of the great length of time which has elapsed you should not allow it to be very long, within which it shall be paid.

By the express terms of the contract the vendee stipulated that she would reside on and improve the land; would pay five hundred and twenty dollars for the land in annual payments of sixty dollars each, the whole sum bearing interest from the date of the agreement; would pay all taxes and assessments whatever; that no pine timber should be cut until three fourths of the purchase money should be paid, “ and that in case of failure to make the payments aforesaid at the times herein-before stipulated — and interest — and the taxes — or shall leave said lot of land untenanted for the term of six months at any time previous to the full payment of the sums aforesaid — the <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, in either case shall have full power and lawful authority to sell and dispose of said lot of land to any other person; and this agreement so far as relates to the party of the first part hereof shall be void and of none effect from and after any such delinquency in payment thereof, or abandonment for six months as aforesaid— or failure to pay taxes thereon — and all sums that shall have been paid to the party of the first part on account thereof shall be forfeited and he shall not be liable to refund the same or any part thereof.” Only three of the annual payments were made, which in all did not amount to enough to pay the interest on the purchase money to the time of suit brought. If the plaintiff’s testimony was believed, the vendee left the premises in 1872 and they continued entirely unoccupied up to January, 1876, in such a condition as to justify an inference of abandonment. The vendee admitted on the witness stand that she left the place in 1872 and did not return till several months after her child was born, which she said was in December, 1875; so that the jury might have easily found that she did not enter upon the premises the second time until the summer of 1876. It does not appear that any information of this re-entry was given to the vendor. It was also proved that the vendor sold and conveyed the land to Emery, the present plaintiff, in September, 1876, and that the present action was brought on October 6, 1876. It is apparent therefore that the vendor exercised a clear contract right reserved to him under the articles when he sold to the plaintiff; and that the latter without any delay brought his action to recover the premises, the original vendee being then in possession. The vendor was not in position to bring an ejectment before the sale, unless possibly for an extremely short time, because the vendee was not in possession and the premises were entirely unoccupied, if the testimony of the plaintiff is believed. While he did not actually re-enter as for condition broken, he performed the full equivalent of a reentry by selling the land to another in accordance with the express provisions of the agreement of sale. In these circumstances it seems to us clear that the vendor did exercise his right of forfeiture with sufficient promptness, and that if the jury found the breaches of condition which authorized the vendor to re-enter or sell to another, the plaintiff’s title was <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>made out and lie should have had an absolute verdict without condition. In our opinion, the plaintiff’s second point should have been affirmed as the testimony stood upon the trial. We sustain the second and third assignments of error. We do not sustain the first because although the vendee was not sui juris her contract could have been enforced against the land without charging her personally.</p>
