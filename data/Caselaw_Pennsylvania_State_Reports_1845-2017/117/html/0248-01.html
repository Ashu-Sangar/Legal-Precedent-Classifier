He alleges, and has given testimony tending to show, that he had notified the plaintiff not to sell them to his wife ; notified him that he would not pay for them; notified ■ him that his wife had no authority to purchase. There is evidence of such <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>notice at perhaps three different times, and one or two of the notices at least, made at a date prior to the time when any of these goods were furnished. The written notice was dated the 2d of November, and was served on the 3d of November, as the witness testifies. That was after a good portion, perhaps — but that is for you to determine, whether 'the goods, more or less, had been delivered prior to that time. The other notices testified to were given, both of them, at an earlier date. One of them was said to be, and I think the plaintiff himself testified, that one of the conversations in regard to the wife not having authority to purchase, was at the time he was seeking to collect a prior bill, which I believe was at an earlier date, and at a date earlier than any of these purchases. [If you find that these notices were given, and that the goods were sold notwithstanding the notices, then the defendant would not be bound to pay for them unless he afterwards ratified the purchase. That means, unless he afterwards treated the goods as Ids own; accepted them, kept them, used them, treated them as his own.] 5</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[185,1372,1191,1077]],["BL_270.1",270,[218,386,1198,1854]]]'>There is testimony tending to show that he said to the plaintiff that he would return them, or that he would throw them out of the house. There is testimony, I believe, given by both sides that he ordered the plaintiff out of the house at one time when he came there to measure for some of the carpet. Did he return them ? Did he keep them subject to the order of the plaintiff ? For it would not be necessary that he should actually take them back himself. If the plaintiff sold the goods to the defendant’s wife after he had notified him that she had no authority to buy, the plaintiff would not be bound to go to the trouble and expense of taking those goods back; and if he notified the defendant to come and get them, that he held them subject to the defendant’s order, that would be all that he was bound to do. He could of course have taken them back and delivered them, and in that event he would not have been bound to pay for them. [You will have to determine what he did do; and if you find that he did not accept those goods; if he did not make them his own by treating them as his own; that he did not use them in his house and in his family; put them to the ordinary use that goods of that kind are for, or use them himself, or allow his family to <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>use them; if you find that he did not do that, then he would not be liable to pay for them. But if you find that he did do that — that he used the goods for his house — the carpet upon the floor and the curtains in the places where they were intended to be put, and kept them, and had them, and still keeps them, then it would not be fair or honest that he should not pay for them. He was not bound to use them when his wife bought them contrary to his order, and if he returned them to the defendant, he could not be required to keep them.. If he did keep and use them, then he purchased them as his. own.] 6 If one buys goods for me, claiming to be an agent for the purchase, and he is not my agent, I do not need to take, the goods, and I am not bound to pay for them. If I choose to take them after he has bought, although he had no right to buy, I have a right to keep them if I choose; but I am not. bound to do it. But if I do keep and make them my own,, and use them, then honesty requires me to pay for them. That is really the point in the cáse. You will have to determine that from all the evidence; and, I may say, in that point of view, the question whether these goods were or were not. necessaries is of no consequence. If the wife had bought a horse and brought it home, without having a right to do it, and if the seller had been notified that she had no right to do it, yet if the defendant, the husband of the wife, keeps the horse and uses it as his own, he is bound to pay for it; or any other articles, whether a horse or not. It is the question, then, of ratifying and accepting the purchase of the particular article, whatever it may be. And that is the point that we will leave •for you to determine. If you find that the defendant made these articles his own; either took them down or put them up as his own; used them as his own, or for himself and family, then he would be bound in law. to pay for the price of them. If he didn’t; if he held them subject to the order of the plaintiff; notified the plaintiff to come and take them; kept them set aside for the plaintiff; then he would not be liable. You must determine the case according as you find the facts.</p>

It was also admitted by the plaintiff and positively testified by the defendant that the defendant had orally notified the plaintiff, before any part of the present bill was sold, that he, the plaintiff, must not sell any more goods to defendant’s wife without the defendant’s authority, and if he did the defendant would not pay for them. On November 3,1885, a written notice by defendant to, plaintiff, dated November 2, 1885, was served .upon the plaintiff, in which the defendant most explicitly notified bim that he would not pay for any goods or articles which the plaintiff might sell to anybody without defendant’s written order. Some of the goods charged in the present bill were sold and delivered after this notice, and the plaintiff neither took away nor offered to take away any of those which had been previously delivered if any such there were. The legal sufficiency of these notices both oral and written was admitted by the learned court below to relieve the defendant from liability, but he left to the jury the question whether the defendant had not subsequently ratified the purchase by his wife and thereby become hable to pay.

But we do not understand that there is any duty to return the goods resting upon the defendant when they were sold after express notice not to sell them, nor to notify the plaintiff that he may remove them, in order to relieve the defendant from liability. After notice not to sell the plaintiff sold to the wife at his peril. He could not charge the husband as his debtor for goods sold to the wife simply because he delivered the goods to the wife. A silent acquiescence by the husband in such a delivery was no acquiescence in a delivery to himself. If the seller chose to take his chance of recovering from the husband by a delivery to the wife after notice not to deliver to her, he had a right to take such a chance, but he could not improve it into a right of action against the husband simply because the husband was an indifferent spectator. No duty whatever was imposed upon him by such a delivery. He was not bound to remain out of his house in order to prevent an implication of ratification arising from the user of the articles by the mere occupancy of his own home. Nor was he in any manner bound to abstain from the use of articles thus voluntarily placed in his house by the plaintiff against his own will. He was subject to no duty to the plaintiff in such circumstances, and hence cannot be held responsible as for the breach of a duty. We have examined the evidence most carefully and can find nothing in it showing or tending to show a subsequent ratification of the wife’s purchase, as his agent, by the husband; and therefore are clearly of opinion that the defendant’s points should all have been affirmed under the testimony and the jury directed to render a verdict for the defendant.</p>
