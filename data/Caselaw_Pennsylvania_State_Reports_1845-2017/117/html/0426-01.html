The deed of Mrs. Mason was duly recorded December 2, 1871. Subsequently Mrs. Mason went into possession of her lot, and some time in 1872 and 8, a house was built for her thereon in part by her father, Mr. Fellows, but mainly by her husband, F. W. Mason.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b448-7" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[223,1100,1190,918]]]'>Rock street was never opened. As projected, it extended between Mrs. Mason’s lot on the one side and Mr. Fellows’ homestead on the other. The fence line between the two properties ran along the middle of the street, Mrs. Mason taking into her inclosure some 82 feet of the street in front and 18 to 20 feet in the rear. Her rear fence also extended across and fenced in part of the projected 20 feet alley, which ran from the Hampton road to Fellows avenue. While thus .fenced in, the land covered by Rock street was used by the parties on either side as a yard and garden. Mrs. Mason had a coal shed upon it to which she obtained access through a gate and way across Mr. Fellows’ land, and then through bars in the division fence, or along Mr. Fellows’ side of the fence. On the other side, within the lines of the street, was a well from which water was drawn for use at Mr. Fellows’ barn. There was also a pig-sty on it, and it. was largely used as a barn-yard. At one time Mr. Fellows cultivated as a garden some portion of the street On Mrs. Mason’s side.</p>

Fellows in fee, the following described premises: “Beginning at a post and stones at the <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>westerly angle of the intersection of Main street south .... to line of lot of Elizabeth Mason, thence along the line of said Mason lot.....to an alley, thence along said alley north .....to Sixth avenue, thence along Sixth avenue south .....to the place of beginning.” The land thus described includes that portion of Rock street which adjoins Mrs. Mason’s lot.

Soon afterwards Mrs. Mason being prevented from using the gate and way by which she had had access to her coal shed, moved back her coal shed and fence to the southerly side of Rock street, and took down a portion of the fence in front along Main street and in the rear along the alley, for the purpose of opening Rock street. Mrs. Ferguson, then Mrs. Fellows, resisted this, and Mrs. Mason was compelled to desist. Subsequently the councils of the city of Scranton were petitioned by Mrs. Mason to open Rock street, but without success. In the meantime Mrs. Fellows had opened the alley in the rear of her premises and extended it across Rock street, which she fenced on either side, and across the rear of Mrs. Mason’s inclosure, and having-taken possession of the land covered by Rock street, she and her present husband began to erect a dwelling house directly upon it. The plaintiffs, Mrs. Mason and her husband, thereupon, on March 20, 1883, filed this bill.</p>

If she succeeds it is not certain whether she will receive a verdict for compensatory, or for merely nominal damages; nor is it certain whether the defendants at the end of the suit at law will be solvent. In case the plaintiff should establish her right, recover and collect the damages that a jury may find for her for being deprived of the use of the street up to the time that the suit may be commenced, it would not be an effectual and adequate remedy. Why? Because the dwelling house would be upon the land, a private nuisance obstructing the street, preventing the opening of it,■except at a great cost and requiring a considerable time. In the case of a public nuisance the judgment of the court includes the abatement of the nuisance, but in a private nuisance there is no judgment of • abatement. Rock street not being a public street, it never having been opened and •accepted by the public as such, an obstruction upon it is not a public nuisance. If the plaintiff, Mrs. Mason, has the right to it that she claims in her bill, she has an easement in the street, and a permanent obstruction upon it would be to her a private nuisance, over which a court of equity has jurisdiction, whether the injury is great or small. The only judicial forum for abating a private nuisance is a court of equity. Therefore equity has jurisdiction in this suit so far as to prevent the erection of the dwelling house upon the disputed land, and to enjoin its removal in case it should be erected, provided the plaintiff first establishes her right in a court of law.</p>

The case must not by reason of this be allowed to assume the semblance of an ejectment, and a supposititious conflict of titles, which does not and cannot under the evidence exist, thus beclouding the real issue, which is concerning the equities, if any, which arise in favor of the plaintiffs out of the undisputed facts.</p>

But whether the house was a gift or not does not enter into or affect the merits of the controversy. This is not like a parol gift followed by possession taken and valuable improvements made upon which specific performance will be decreed.

Its jurisdiction cannot be invoked for that purpose. Such rights must be determined at law. Where, however, the complainant has a prima facie right which may suffer irreparably by a threatened act of the defendant, or from other cause, a special equity is thus superinduced, which will justify a chancellor in retaining the bill until a determination of the rights in dispute can be obtained at law. Or, where the complainant’s rights are clear and undoubted, either by the admissions of the defendant or the undisputed facts in the ease, equity will enjoin the infringement of them, without remitting the party to the inadequate remedies which the law may afford. Upon this dividing line the cases upon examination will be found to readily and naturally fall.</p>

To take jurisdiction of such a case, a court of equity would be obliged to determine whether defendants had a legal right to the use of the lane, a question which was dependent upon conflicting evidence and disputed facts. The distinction to be observed in such cases is thus clearly stated by Mr. Justice Clark : “ Where rights which are legal are asserted on one side and denied on the other the remedies are at law. They cannot be settled under equity forms: this is undoubtedly the general rule. In actions respecting real property therefore if there be no equitable ground of relief involved, the rights of the parties must be determined at law; when thus determined, or when they are admitted in the pleadings, or otherwise clearly appear, an equity based upon that right, superinduced by the acts of the parties may be asserted, and a decree for equitable relief made; thus equity is made the means not of establishing the legal right, but of giving adequate protection in the enjoyment of it when thus established.” And again he says : “ The cases cited by the appellee are not in principle inconsistent with the cases here referred to. In none of them did the dispute involve the ascertainment and determination between the contesting parties of their rights at law; the right of the complainant in each of the cases was either admitted or otherwise clearly and incontestably established, and in all of them proper grounds were assigned for equitable relief.”</p>

As further illustrating. it reference may also well be made to a few of those in which jurisdiction has been actually taken. Thus in Scheetz’s <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>Appeal, <a href="/pa/35/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="35 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="990441" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0088-01">35 Pa. 88</a>, plaintiffs claimed the right by prescription to the uninterrupted flow of the waters of a certain creek for the use of their mills, and the further right for this purpose to enter upon the land of the defendants and clear the bed of the creek. It was held that equity would enjoin the disturbance of this right, the acts of the defendants being not only prejudicial to its enjoyment, subversive of its very existence, and damages at law for the repeated trespasses of the defendants in disturbance of it, being wholly inadequate. In view of these circumstances, the court went so far as to undertake the very determination of the right, as well as of its enforcement by injunction. This case was followed in Bitting’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="105 Pa. 517" data-case-ids="454221" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0517-01">105 Pa. 517</a>. The defendant there demurred to the bill which necessarily admitted the facts and thus confessed the rights of the complainants growing out of them. Says Mr. Justice Gobdon : “ There being thus no dispute over the facts of the case, or about the rights of the plaintiffs, we have for answer but the single question, whether a court of equity will interfere to prevent a wrong of this kind, or whether the remedy is to be found in a court of law ?

By a prior agreement between the parties, defendants were allowed to close up the alley during the term of a lease under which complainants then held their premises. Subsequently complainants renewed their lease, and notified defendants to remove their obstructions to the alley. It was held that the right of the defendants to the free use of the alley was clear and not doubtful and that equity would enjoin against obstructing it. Says Mr. Justice Tbtjnkey: “This right of way is founded upon contract, the grant being shown by the respective deeds under which Brown and Hacke hold <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>their lots. The owner has a right to its enjoyment in the mode and form stipulated for in the deeds. The mere fact that the appellants prevent such enjoyment is sufficient ground for interference of the court by injunction. It is not necessary that the owner should prove damages to entitle him to his property. Like rule applies as if the right existed by covenant directly between Brown and Haeke, and in such case when the covenant is of such a nature that it can consistently with the principles of equity be specifically enforced the court will not unless under very exceptional circumstances take into consideration the comparative injury to the parties from granting the injunction.”</p>

Such is the position, as we have seen, of this case. In this view, the admitted acts of the defendants in obstructing Rock street are the invasion of a clear right vested in the complainants.

Covenant would not lie, because there is no privity, either of contract or estate. A recovery might be had by the plaintiffs in ejectment, but only for one half of the street. This would not give them the benefit of the other half. Trespass or case would probably lie, but damages for each several trespass or obstruction would be no compensation to the plaintiffs for the constant invasion of their rights, nor for the denial of access, air, light, view, etc., which are the incidents of being bounded by a street. The right therefore being clear and the remedies at law inadequate, the jurisdiction of equity is perfect.</p>

The principle is undoubted that a voluntary contract will not be specifically enforced. BuPthis only applies so long as it remains executory. . When once it has become executed, then anything incident to the completed gift will be enforced against the donor, the same as if the transaction were based upon an original valuable consideration: Dennison v. Goehring, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Pa.%20178" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="7 Pa. 178">7 Pa. 178</a>, 179; Est. of Webb, <a href="/cal/49/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="49 Cal. 541" data-case-ids="2345774" data-case-paths="/cal/49/0541-01">49 Cal. 541</a>; Stone v.

To meet this, defendant’s counsel argues that the gift to Mrs. Mason was only completed so far as the conveyance and possession of her lot was concerned, and that as to the street, the gift was incomplete and imperfect, and Mrs. Mason having accepted the gift in such shape cannot now ask for its enlargement. On the other hand, counsel for plaintiffs have endeavored to show that valuable improvements have been made upon the strength of the gift to relieve it from its voluntary character, and in opposition to this again defendants have asserted that Mrs. Mason’s house was also a gift from her father. All this is entirely aside from the case. When the deed from Mr. Fellows to his daughter was delivered the gift was complete in all its extent. Nothing was then left to be executed so as to fully vest in her the title to that which was given. As I have already had occasion to remark, ejectment could immediately have been maintained by her if possession of the land had been denied, or covenant upon the implied duty to open the street. The right to all this at once upon delivery of the deed vested in her, as incident to and parcel of the grant, and whatever was necessary to put her in possession of the rights with which she thus became invested, both law and equity would do. There is therefore no ground for refusing to enforce this covenant <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>because tbe transaction out of which it grows was originally voluntary.</p>

    <p id="b468-7" data-blocks='[["BL_468.7",468,[216,1361,1188,1072]]]'>The principal question in this case is one of jurisdiction. The general rule is, that “ where rights which are legal are asserted on one side and denied on the other the remedies are at law. They cannot be settled under equity forms. In actions respecting real property, therefore, if there be no equitable ground of relief involved, the rights of the parties must be determined at law; when thus determined, or when they are admitted in the. pleadings, or otherwise clearly appear, an equity based upon that right, superinduced by the acts of the parties, may be asserted, and a decree for equitable relief made. Thus equity is made the means not of establishing the legal right, but of giving adequate protection in the enjoyment of it when thus established:” Washburn’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="105 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="454298" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0480-01">105 Pa. 480</a>. In that case the point decided was, that a court of equity had no jurisdiction to settle a disputed- legal title to land, or to a right of way, on a bill in equity filed by the party in possession, averring that a multiplicity of suits at law may result to redress threatened grievances. The facts were disputed, and no clear right to the subject in dispute established, and no irreparable injury shown. The relief prayed for was therefore properly denied.</p>

      <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>It is not so in this case. There are no material facts in dispute, and the plaintiff’s right is clear. It is not denied that Joseph T. Fellows, by a deed in fee simple, conveyed to his daughter, Sarah E. Mason, one of the plaintiffs, the lot at the corner of Main and Rock streets, and that by the terms of said conveyance the lot in question is bounded by Hock street aforesaid. It is a well settled principle of law, that where upon a sale of lots reference is made to a map or plot, upon which they are laid down, and which calls for certain streets and alleys, this constitutes a dedication of these ways to the use of purchasers as public ways, and the map or plan so referred to becomes a material and essential part of the conveyance, and is to have the same effect as though copied into the deed: Birmingham v. Anderson, <a href="/pa/48/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="48 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="422140" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0253-01">48 Pa. 253</a>; McCall v.

This conveyance, therefore, gave the plaintiff the right to the use of Rock street as a public highway as against her grantor, and his heirs and assigns. That Hock street was not opened is not material.</p>
    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[169,1465,1190,509]]]'>It is also undisputed that by the subsequent deed from Fellows to his wife (now Mrs. Ferguson, and one of the defendants) it bounded the lot conveyed to the latter by the line of the lot previously conveyed to Mrs. Mason, thus including the whole of Rock street. This he had no right to do and his deed passed no title to Mrs. Fellows to that portion of the street embraced therein. Mrs. Mason’s deed was on record, and the defendants had constructive notice thereof. There was nothing in the case to show that the plaintiff had either parted with her right to Rock street, or had lost said right in any way.</p>

This was a conveyance in consideration of one dollar from a father to his daughter, and was fully executed. Moreover, the plaintiffs had erected a house on the lot at an expenditure of several thousands of dollars. Under such circumstances it cannot be seriously questioned that a court of equity would enforce their rights.
