It is an inherent principle in the law of ejectment, that the plaintiff must always recover, if he recovers at all, upon the strength of his own title and not upon the weakness of Ms adversary. The contention of the plaintiffs is that they have established this. They allege that one John A. Reed was the owner of this land, and that by Ms deed dated the 9th day of December, 1834, he conveyed it to George F. Miller, as his assignee, for the benefit of creditors. TMs deed was given in evidence, and this then was followed up by the deed of George F. Miller, the assignee of Reed, dated May 11, 1835, by wMch hé conveyed the property in dispute to Ralph Ditty and John Ditty as tenants in common; that is to say, he conveyed the undivided half of the lot in dispute to each of these parties, <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>thus giving them the whole as the tenants in common. Then the plaintiff: followed this with evidence of a receipt dated March 8, 1838, drawn by Ralph Ditty and attested by Alexander Graham, in which he receipted to John Ditty for his share of the purchase money for a lot on South Second street. Thus the plaintiffs contend that the entire title to the property in dispute became vested in John Ditty by reason of his purchase of the share of Ralph. This then was followed by the will of John Ditty dated the 4th day of September, 1837, and probated on the 22d of January, 1880. The plaintiffs also gave evidence that they were the children of Martha Mason, who is one of the devisees mentioned in the will of John Ditty.</p>

There was evidence given that John Ditty entered into the possession of this land in the spring of 1838, by rolling a house over on to it from an adjacent lot, which he occupied. Thus, you see, he died seized of the property, because the evidence is undeniable that he died in July, 1838, after this house was erected and whilst he was in possession; so he died seized of the land, and this took the title out of the commonwealth and vested' it in John Ditty, and the title of the plaintiffs to the property in dispute turns upon the construction to be given to the will of John Ditty.</p>

It is admitted that, whilst child or children, will not, per se, be construed to be words of limitation, yet, when coupled with some other expression of testator, showing that they were used as a nomen collectivum, signifying “ heirs of the body,” the rule in Shelley’s case has been applied. In the present case, John Ditty devises to his sister Martha, “ and at her death to her child, children, or other lineal descendants,” showing that the testator used child or children in the sense of heirs of her body, for lineal descendants could be none other than the issue of her body, indicating indefinite issue, and the estate would, under the expression lineal descendants, have gone to grandchildren and great-grandchildren, thus defining the nature of the estate intended to be given to the successors of Martha, as one which he meant they should take by descent from her. In Allen v. Markle, <a href="/pa/36/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="36 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="992186" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0117-01">36 Pa. 117</a>, the testator gave to his son A. for life, and at his decease to descend to Ms legitimate offspring forever, but M case A.’s issue should become • extinct, then over to other devisees in fee: - held an estate tail, and that the word “ offspring,” even if not defined by the subsequent use of the word “ issue,” is a term of hmitation. It is diffictdt to see why the term “hneal descendant” is not still more decisive of the intention of the testator to create an inheritable estate M his sister Martha; and 'as Mr. Hayes says that the word “ children ” may be construed to mean heirs of the body, when there is an express warrant for tins change of its legitimate meaning, under the hand of the author of the gift, we have here the use by the testator of the very definition itself of “ heirs of the body,” to wit, “ hneal descendants,” and that too used in the same connection with child. No stronger case could exist, showing the use of cMld and cliildren in the sense of heirs of the body. Admitting the difficulty as well as the rarity of the cases where this construction has been given to child or children, yet if in any case the construction is admissible, it appears to us it is so in the present case, although tMs conclusion is reached with some hesitation. TMs conclusion is fortified and strengthened by the language of the will in <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>devising the Venango farm. The language of the will as to that farm is: “I hereby bequeath unto my sister Martha, during the term of her natural life, and at her death I bequeath it to the child or children of said Martha.” Then comes the devise which we have just been considering. After that the testator returns to the Venango' farm devised to Martha, and declares, “ there is to be no dispute with my sister’s child or children about my farm, for it is to be theirs at their mother’s death. I do not give said sister Martha any legal right to sell said farm, for it is the child’s or children’s at her death.” . This shows that the testator intended a different tenure of title in the Venango farm, and as to that Martha should have but a life éstate. He throws no such guard around the devise of the house and lot in dispute, showing no solicitude about the child or children getting it. [We charge you that Martha Mason’s estate in the lot in controversy is an estate tad, and not an estate for life with remainder over in fee to the plaintiffs, who are her children, as is contended for by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs.] 3</p>

But the proof is undeniable on the part of the defendants, if you believe it, that shortly after the making of this will, and after the death of John Ditty in 1838, Ralph Ditty went into the possession of this real estate by himself or by his tenants, claiming it adversely as his own. The assessments of the lot have been given in evidence to him for a long number of years; and William Ditty, a brother, testifies to an exchange or a partition of the land. You will remember his deposition. We excluded that for the purpose of showing title in Ralph Ditty by virtue of this alleged exchange of land, but admitted the evidence for the purpose of showing that Ralph Ditty was claiming this land adversely; and the evidence of William Ditty is, if you believe it, and it don’t appear to be contradicted by anybody, that Ralph Ditty held the uninterrupted possession of this land, claiming it as his own, by himself and his tenants down until his death, in 1865 or 1866. There is also the evidence of witnesses. You will remember them. George <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>Chappel, John Balliet, and others, testify to this adverse possession. ’ Mrs. Miller testified that ’way back in 1845, or along there, her husband leased this property of Ralph Ditty and paid the rent, but apart from all this there is no evidence in the case whatever, nor is it pretended, as I understand the contention of the plaintiffs, that Martha Mason or any of her heirs ever had any actual possession of this land, either by themselves or their tenants. It don’t appear that they ever exercised any act of ownership over it. Then it is in evidence that Martha Mason died in 1871. That is the time of her death as fixed by the testimony of Mr. Ziegler, a witness for the plaintiffs. This action of ejectment was not brought until 1885, a period of upwards of forty-six years after the estate passed out of John Ditty by his last will and testament, and it has been held adversely ever since. Now it is true that Martha Mason at that time was a married woman and was under disability to sue; yet it did not prevent the running of the statute of limitations, because our act of assembly of the <em>22cl </em>of April, 1856, followed by the decision of Hunt v. Wall, <a href="/pa/75/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="75 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1036701" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0413-01">75 Pa. 413</a>, expressly declares that if parties be under disability at the time when their title accrues to real estate, that they are forever barred, unless a suit be brought within thirty years from the time that the right of entry first became vested in them.</p>

    <p id="b156-7" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[245,891,1183,1475]]]'>None of the assignments of error in this case can be sustained except that which covers the answer to the defendant’s third point; which point and answer are as follows: “ That under the evidence in this case the plaintiffs cannot recover.” Answer, “ Affirmed.” Whether Ralph Ditty, and those claiming under him, had that kind of continuous, notorious and hostile possession of the premises in dispute as would give them title under the statute of limitations, was, under all the evidence, a question for the jury, and ought so to have been submitted. Originally John and Ralph Ditty were tenants in common of the lot in controversy, and the receipt of March 3, 1838, was not of itself sufficient, under the statute of frauds and perjuries, to divest Ralph’s interest; hence, prima facie, his subsequent possession would have to be regarded as a joint possession for himself and his brother. The receipt, however, taken in connection with the other parol evidence, does, undoubtedly, not only tend to rebut the prima facie presumption of Ralph’s occupancy as a tenant in common, but presents a strong case of adverse possession. Still, strong as the evidence is, it ought to have been submitted to the jury. As to the construction of the will: The learned president of the Common Pleas has so well disposed of that branch of the case, that we need only say, we entirely agree with him. The words “other lineal descendants,” so qualify the previous words “ child or children,” as to make them words of limitation, and not of purchase. Indeed, the whole case was so well tried, and the result reached so obviously just, that except to preserve intact a necessary and important legal rule, we would hesitate to send it back for re-trial.</p>
