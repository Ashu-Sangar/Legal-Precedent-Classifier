Welsh, at the valuation of $3,000. By an Orphans’ Court decree entered March 13,1878, a dower principal in favor of the plaintiff was charged upon the premises, the interest, $59.60, to be paid to her annually during her lifetime, on March 13th, each year, and the necessary recognizance to protect the widow and heirs was taken. On March 25, 1878, Zaccheus H. Welsh conveyed the premises to Augustus E. Fahs, subject expressly to said dower charge, but the deed was not recorded. On April 1, 1880, the town council enacted an ordinance laying out a street called South Pine street which occupied the entire lot. Under the act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 525, on petition to the Court of Quarter Sessions, viewers were appointed to make assessments for damages and contributions. The viewers reported on June 21,1883, and awarded to Augustus. E. Fahs, for damages over benefits the sum of $4,092.86. During the pendency of an appeal from this assessment the borough compromised with the land owner for $5,000 in full settlement of all damages, taking from Augustus E. Fahs and his wife a release for the ground taken, reserving the buildings and materials, releasing the premises J“ for the use of a public street so long as the same shall be used for said purpose and so long only.

Mrs. Welsh had an estate in the land of her husband before the partition, and the nature of that estate was "not changed by the proceedings in partition. It was an estate that could not be divested without her consent, or taken from her without at least notice of the proceedings, and an opportunity to assert her rights and secure their protection; no such notice was given her, or opportunity afforded. Her estate remains in the land in the hands of the borough. It matters not that by the terms of the release the borough has acquired but an easement, a right to the use of that land as a public highway, the fee and the reversion, if that use should be abandoned, remaining in Fahs.</p>

It has taken all that gave value to her estate in the land and has deprived her of all remedy to enforce her claims against the land, unless that remedy can be enforced in this action. Even the remedy of distress has been taken from her by the borough appropriation of the land and the removal of all that would make a distress effectual.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[175,751,1188,511]]]'>The constitution of the commonwealth provides that municipal corporations clothed with right of eminent domain shall make compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed, which shall be paid or secured before such taking, injury or destruction. It was the duty of the borough to ascertain all persons having estates of any sort in the land it proposed to take, and to name all such in its petition and to give to all notice, and an opportunity to assert their rights, and protect their property. Had this been done in this case, the plaintiff’s rights could have been adequately secured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-6" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[171,1269,1191,972]]]'>It is true that her estate is of a peculiar character not entitling her to the possession of the land. It may be true that it could not have been divested by proceedings under the borough’s right of eminent domain, and that she could not have been compensated by the award of damages in money. But if she had had notice of the proceedings she would have had an opportunity to assert her claim, and the borough could have protected her and itself by withholding from Fahs an amount equal to the capital of her dower during her widowhood. It was by the default of the defendant, however ignorant it was of her dower being charged on this land, that this suit has been necessitated. The plaintiff’s estate in this land not having been divested by the proceedings instituted by the borough for the opening of this street, the borough took the land subject to the charge upon it. The defendant is such an assign as is made by the act of the 29th of March, 1832, which I read to you, liable for the payment of this dower interest, and an action of debt is a proper and adequate remedy to enforce that liability.</p>

    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[225,591,1187,920]]]'>' It was undoubtedly the fault of the defendant that the estate of Mrs. Welsh in the land in question was not discovered, and provided for in the proceedings to assess the damages. Her title was fully spread upon the record of the Orphans’ Court in the proceedings in partition, and there was not the slightest reason for overlooking it and disregarding her interests in the assessment of damages. The culpability in this respect was increased by the consideration that the damages were finally adjusted by a private agreement and the execution of a release from the owner to the borough. The widow was in no default whatever. She was not made a party nor in any manner notified of the taking of the land by the borough. Of course she had no day in court and no opportunity to assert her rights or protect her interests. In such circumstances she could not possibly be divested of her estate in tlie land or of the least fragment of her interests, by proceedings which, as to her, were purely ex parte. This being so, there is no question in the case but one of remedy.</p>
    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.7",200,[223,1519,1185,924]],["BL_201.1",201,[220,375,1182,363]]]'>The borough has taken the whole of the land and occupied it for the purpose of a public highway. The right of distress cannot be exercised since there is nothing to distrain. The land cannot be sold since it has been devoted to public use by the lawful exercise of the right of eminent domain, and no private estate hi it can be granted. The borough has accepted a conveyance of the owner’s title by deed of release which in fact is the equivalent of a fee, since it is only determinable by the abandonment of the street as a public highway, a contingency which may, and probably will, never happen. Whether therefore the position of the borough with reference to the widow is that of a voluntary grantee of the owner, or the acquisitor of his estate by force of the proceedings to take the land and assess the damages, is a matter of no consequence in determining her rights. As to what they are there can be no controversy. She is plainly entitled to her interest upon the dower fund and by the words of the statute, act of 29th March, 1882, § 41, she has a right to have it from the original acceptor <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>or his assigns holding the same. The defendant is clearly an assign of the acceptor and as such liable to pay this dower interest. That interest may be recovered “by distress or otherwise, as rents in this commonwealth are recoverable;” and, as debt will lie to recover rent and the defendant has deprived the plaintiff of the remedy by distress, we see no possible reason why the present action cannot be maintained.</p>
