The defendants then introduced evidence to show that on June 2, 1883, the farm of John W. Hill was sold at sheriff’s sale and purchased by Simon Truby, and on July 16, 1883, the latter served a notice upon the former to surrender possession. Soon afterwards it was agreed that Mr. Hill should remain upon the. premises as the tenant of Mr. Truby until April 1, 1884. Differences arising, they were submitted to arbitrators who made an award on August 11, 1883, by which Mr. Hill was to pay to Mr. Truby $125 on or before April 1, 1884, to be secured by approved security; and was to deliver up full possession of all the fields except the house, barn and out-buildings, on or before August 15,1883, reserving the right of taking off the then existing crop, as to which Mr. Truby released all his interest. There was no provision with reference to taxes, either in the submission or in the award. The note in suit was given in compliance with this award.</p>

    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.6",342,[247,492,1194,1542]]]'>We think it was error to reject the offer to prove by Hill what occurred between Mm and the tax collector, on the ground of incompetency of the witness. We held in Ash v. Guie, <a href="/pa/97/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="444791" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0493-01">97 Pa. 493</a>, that the spirit of the act of 1878 embraced the survivor of two or more who jointly contracted, and therefore the plaintiff could testify as to matters occurring between Mmself and the survivmg defendants. But we did not mean to decide that he could not testify as to relevant matters wMch occurred between Mmself and strangers. There would be no propriety •■and no necessity for such a decision. Such matters were not •excluded by any interpretation of the act of 1869, except that which declared the general incompetency of the witness. 'That incompetency was removed by the act of 1878 in the ease of the survivor of joint obligors. It is true the act in terms qualified the witness to testify to matters having occurred between the surviving party and the adverse party on the record, but that was because it was that class of matters which were specially excluded by the construction wMch had been .-.given to the act of 1869, and that was the evil intended to be more particularly remedied by the act of 1878. But there ■could be no good reason for excluding other matters occurring between the witness and other persons who were not parties. Such exclusion had been, previously to the act of 1878, merely the result of a personal incompetency to testify at all; but when that general incompetency was removed, matters which were otherwise unobjectionable could not be excluded on that account. We are clearly of opinion, therefore, that other and Mdifferent matters between the witness and a stranger, might be proved as well by a surviving obligor or his adversary, providing only that they were relevant to the issue trying.</p>

The offer does not disclose facts enough to make the testimony admissible. Hill was the owner of the farm up to the time of the sheriff’s sale which was June 2, 1883. He remained on the farm by agreement with Truby made on August 11,1883. The offer was to prove payment <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>of taxes assessed upon the farm, upon the theory that they were taxes which Truby was legally bound to pay. But that very essential fact does not appear in the offer and we cannot infer it. It is not possible to infer that taxes had been assessed against the farm as Truby’s property after June and before August, 1883. Naturally, if the question must be determined by inference we would be obliged to infer that the taxes had been assessed against Hill as owner, and therefore that he and not Truby was legally liable for their payment. But it is not necessary to put the matter upon that ground. The offer must itself disclose all the facts which are necessary to establish its admissibility and this is not done by the offer in question.</p>
