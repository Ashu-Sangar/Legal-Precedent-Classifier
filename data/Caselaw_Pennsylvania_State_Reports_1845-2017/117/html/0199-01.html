This results from tbe thoroughly settled doc<a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>trine that firm creditors have no inherent paramount right to the firm property as means for the payment of their claims, except as the same is asserted and enforced through the equities or rights of the several parties, as between themselves, to have the firm property applied to the firm debts. When, therefore, the shares in any partnership property are united in the same purchaser by the joinder of all the partners in a sale, or by a separate sale made of his interest by each partner, or by sales upon executions against the interests of each, the rights of the partners to such property is extinguished, and “every semblance of partnership equity is at an end.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[222,944,1183,501]]]'>But in our opinion the equities of partners are not extinguished by levies of the interests of each partner on executions for the individual debt of each. After the constable’s levy on the interest of each partner, each had (the same as before) the right to insist that the partnership property should be applied to the payment of the partnership debts. While this right still existed in both Sargent and Holt, the Copeland fi. fa. came to the hands of the sheriff, and became a lien on the property in suit, and a lien that could only be made effective by a sale thereon, which was afterwards done.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[221,1457,1191,757]]]'>We say the lien of the Copeland fi. fa. could only be made effective by a sale thereon, because, in-our opinion, Copeland has no right to the proceeds of the sales on the constable’s executions. He was a stranger to the funds thus raised. Had the constable sold first on the execution of Covanovan v. Sargent, Covanovan would have been entitled to the proceeds. Had he afterwards sold on the execution of Henry against Holt, Henry would have been entitled to the proceeds. We are of the opinion that it makes no difference “ that instead of being consecutive these two sales were simultaneous,” and we conclude that Copeland’s recourse was “necessarily to the prop-’ erty in the hands of the purchasers,” and that the sheriff, the defendant, was not a trespasser in selling the property in suit on the fi. fa. in favor of Copeland against the firm of Sargent &amp; Holt.</p>

A partnership is a distinct entity, and the joint effects belong to it, and not to the several partners: Doner v. Stauf<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>fer, <a href="/pen-w/1/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="1 Pen. &amp; W. 198" data-case-ids="1826162" data-case-paths="/pen-w/1/0198-01">1 P. &amp; W. 198</a>. It follows, that the levies on the goods of the linn of Sargent &amp; Holt, for the several debts of the individual members of that firm, created no lien upon those goods, and were, in fact, as nugatory as though levied upon the property of a stranger. Admittedly, had the sale been on but one of the writs, the purchaser would have taken no right in the firm assets, but only the right to compel an account with the continuing partner, and such also is the purport of the first section of the act of the 8th of April, 1873. If, however, a levy on the interest of a single partner would have created no lien on the goods in controversy, we cannot see how a levy on the individual interests of both could alter the legal aspect of affairs, for in either case those interests were several, and the firm rights remained unaffected. The action of the constable did not deprive the partnership of the control of its own goods; the several partners still continued to be the agents of the firm, and it would not be proper to say that a sale by both or either of them, as such, would not have passed a good title to a purchaser of those goods regardless of the levies. But the sheriff’s levy, made by virtue of an execution issued on a judgment against the partnership, was a lien on the goods themselves, and his sale was not the disposition of a mere right in the firm, but of the property itself, and, therefore, vested in his vendee the absolute ownership thereof, leaving to the constable’s vendees the' right to have so much of the proceeds of the sale as remained after the satisfaction of the sheriff’s writ.</p>

Stauffer, supra. The equities of partnership creditors depend on the equities of the partners, and as long as a partner continues to have an interest in the partnership, so long do the equities of the firm creditors continue; but when the rights of all the partners have been disposed of, either by judicial or private sale, neither partnership nor partnership rights remain; and, consequently, they, the creditors, have no longer anything to which they can look for a satisfaction of their claims except individual responsibility. But as a <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>levy on tbe right of a partner neither divests that right, nor dissolves tbe partnership, clearly, tbe power of tbe firm to dispose of its own goods is not thereby affected, and, as a consequence, tbe equities of firm creditors remain. That the judgment was confessed by tbe firm subsequently to tbe levies by tbe constable, even though tbe debt for which it was given was contracted after those levies, is not of material consequence ; it was, nevertheless,' a debt of the firm for the payment of which the goods might have been assigned, or converted into cash; and as the levies by the constable created no lien, the property was entirely free for seizure on the execution against the partnership.</p>
