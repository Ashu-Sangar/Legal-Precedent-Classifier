On March 18,1881, he again insured the same property in the same company, for the same amount and period, the policy being issued for the use of the Savings and Loan Association in Ashland which then held a mortgage upon the property for $800. During the term of this policy, a second mortgage and two judgment liens were entered against the property insured. On December 30, 1882, the property was sold at a sheriff’s sale, upon one of the judgments, to C. G. Murphy, who received the sheriff’s deed therefor. On December 31, 1883, Elliott by a written contract purchased the property back from Murphy for $704.65, of which $204.65 was paid, the property remaining subject to the Savings and Loan Association’s mortgage, undivested by the sheriff’s sale.</p>

Both bore the same number, referred to the same application, and were upon the same property; one was given “instead” of the other, “extending the time ” to five years. It may be, therefore, that neither the policy nor any of the bylaws iequired a disclosure of the intervening incumbrances; but it is plain, that by the 16th condition of the policy, the-contract of insurance had, on December 30, 1882, ceased to exist. Under a proceeding at law, the property insured had been levied upon by the sheriff, and on that day the interest, of the assured was sold, and one Charles G. Murphy became the purchaser and owner thereof. After that, for almost a. year, Elliott had no title whatever in the property, and, of course, there could be no valid subsisting insurance, where-there was no insurable interest. There would be nothing, in such case, for the policy to operate upon.</p>

If the policy of March 18,1884, upon which this suit was brought, was issued as an extension of the previous policy of 1881, with notice of the change which had taken place in the title, it was certainly, in itself, an express waiver in writing of the forfeiture, which had previously occurred.</p>

But the agreement with Murphy was for a conveyance of the fee; Elliott thereby became the equitable owner of the property subject to the payment of the purchase money, which was a lien or incumbrance upon it, and this, as respects the contract of insurance, was equivalent to the fee: Penn.

After a contract for the sale of real estate, the purchaser is the equitable owner thereof and, being responsible for the purchase-money, is liable to the whole loss that may befall it, including the loss of the buildings by fire: Reed v. Lukens, <a href="/pa/44/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="44 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="484253" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0200-01">44 Pa. 200</a>. He is not guilty of misrepresentation if he state that the premises are Ms, although he has not paid the purchase money: Coursin v. Penn. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/46/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="46 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="420588" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0323-01">46 Pa. 323</a>. Upon this ground, it was held in Millville Mut. Co. v. Wilgus, <a href="/pa/88/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="88 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1061186" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0107-01">88 Pa. 107</a>, that, for the ' purpose of insurance, the holder of an equitable title, under articles of agreement, may be said to be vested with the entire unconditional and sole ownership. This question has been more fully considered by this court, in a very recent case in the Eastern District, Dunham for use, etc. v. Imperial Fire Ins. Co. of London, ante p. 460, and we think it is unnecessary to further discuss it here.</p>

It must be conceded that the evidence on this point was meagre, and to some extent unsatisfactory, but there was some evidence, enough we think to send the case to the jury. We do not desire to discuss the testimony; in so doing we might prejudice the next trial; but having stated the law applicable to the case, and suggested the questions of fact, which were proper for the jury, we send the case back for another trial.</p>
