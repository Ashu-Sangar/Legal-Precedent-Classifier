It is his duty to speak when he sees his neighbor expending his money under a mistake or misapprehension as to title. Legally he owes his neighbor no such duty if he sees his neighbor expending money upon another’s land. No matter what the mistaken belief may be, inducing the conduct of a neighbor, if it is on another’s land legally he owes him no duty. But if he sees him making valuable improvements upon his own land, it becomes his duty to speak; he must tell his neighbor of his mistake, if it is a mistake, and he is to profit by the mistake.

We went, I think it was in June, 1874, and found that it had been patented. When the officials in the land office told us it was patented, Tyler said, “ Gad, that’s funny,” and on our way back on the train coming home, I said to Tyler, “ What shall I do now ? ” meaning, to find the title to this piece of land, and Tyler says, “ I don’t know.” I think I said to him, “ I will go and see Mr. Wallace, and have him look it up.” There was no other conversation between us that I remember, on until I think it was in 1879 or 1880, I cannot fix the time.</p>

The larger piece lies on the north side of Bennett’s Branch of the Sinnemahoning, and the smaller piece on the south side of the same .stream.

Mr. Putnam got me to go to Harrisburg with him to see about it, and we found' that it was not vacant land. When I found it was not vacant land I considered that the land belonged to me, unless we found a better title for it, since I had bought it and paid for it. I did not know but a better title might be found for it, as I did not know how it was at that time; I didn’t know but that it had been sold with my other property at sheriff’s sale, ■and if Mr. Putnam could get a good title for it, I would sooner that he would have it than anybody else — that is, if he could get a better title than anybody else had. I had not at that time examined to see whether it had been mortgaged and sold or not. The mortgage of which I speak had been given to William A. Wallace. That mortgage was foreclosed and the mortgaged land sold by the sheriff; Mr. Putnam told me afterwards that he had gone to a great deal of trouble to find the Coxe heirs; the heirs of the man who had owned the land, and had consummated the purchase from them.

Tyler apparently did not know that the 36 acres, consequently the two lots in dispute, were not included in his mortgage to Wallace, which passed under the sheriff’s sale to Dill; he did not discover that it was not included in that mortgage until 1879 or 1880. He says himself, and it may here in the evidence be taken as an undisputed fact, that at the time Putnam was seeking to get title to the land, and during the time he (Putnam) was making improvements, Tyler did not know that he was the owner of the land.

Putnam had a right to assume that Tyler knew what land he owned, and if, relying upon the fact that Tyler did not claim to own it, he purchased another title and made improvements, the plaintiff could not recover.

They first went to Harrisburg, expecting to find the title still in the commonwealth', but discovered that it was patented, and then Putnam, instead of being misled by anything that Tyler said, or going to Dill, who was the purchaser pnder the mortgage, to inquire, declared his intention of consulting counsel to “ look the matter up.” And in pursuance of this determination he went, not to Dill, to whom the conversation and acts of Tyler would have led him to go, and who might be supposed by both Tyler and Putnam to be the owner of the title, but to the devisees of one Wm. Coxe, and secured from them an independent outstanding title, as he supposed, took possession and made these improvements, believing that he had secured a better title than ever Tyler had, and consequently a better title than Dill, who had got the title that Tyler had; intending to set it up, and hold the land against all the world.

For these taxes the tract was subsequently sold at treasurer’s sale, and purchased by Ebenezer Hewitt' to whom a deed was acknowledged and delivered under date of December 1, 1828. The owner failing to redeem, Ebenezer Hewitt, by his deed dated July 26, 1836, conveyed the same to Jones, Warner &amp; Andrews, who, on August 11, 1836, placed both of the deeds mentioned upon record. The tract contained about 1000 acres, whilst it was assessed as containing only 100 acres; but there is nothing to indicate that a portion only of the tract was intended to be covered by the assessor’s return. The return was of tract No. 4897, in the name of Wilhelm Willink, and the “ 100 acres,” is but matter of description. At the time of the assessment, Martin Nichols held a conveyance for 750 acres off the west end, and Jonathan Nichols for 300 acres off the east end, the residue of the tract; but the whole was unseated, and it does not appear that the owners had made known their separate ownership, as required by the act of 1806, in order that their respective portions might be taxed separately. The Willink survey of 1794, was located across the surveys of 1785; the earlier surveys having previously appropriated all the land covered by No. 4897, exceptizig about 126 acres at the northwest corner, and 144 acres at the southwest corner; and, as the division line was afterwards run between Martin and Jonathan Nichols, the 126 acres at the northwest corner, and about 36 acres of the piece izi the southeast corner fell to Martizi, and the residue, being 100 acres, more or less, to Jonathan. It does not appear that there was any indication, at the time of the assessmezit, that any portion of the tract was laid upon lands already appropriated, or that the owners of the tract 4897 reeogziized the superior right of any earlier warrant. The conveyazices from Alexander Boyd to Martin and Jonathan Nichols were of the whole tract, and nothing appeared <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>on the land or otherwise to show any relinquishment- on the-, part of the holders of the Wilhelm Willink warrant. On the other hand, as we have said, the assessment was of the whole tract by its proper number in the name of the warrantee. It-does not even appear that the lands covered by the warrants of 1784 were assessed, or that the taxes thereon were paid for the years 1826 and 1827, and if they were not, the tax deed of 1828 would, under all the cases, be effective to convey all the lands embraced within the lines of tract 4897.</p>

It is a general rule in ejectment, subject to well known exceptions, that the defendant may protect his own possession by showing an outstanding title in a third person; but it must be a subsisting title, such as would sustain an ejectment, and be available in favor of the party in whom it is alleged to exist. The effect of the tax sale after the lapse of two years, was to pass the-title of the real owner to Ebenezer Hewitt. The conveyance from Plewitt to Jones, Warner &amp; Andrews, was, therefore, of the absolute legal title to the land with all its incidents. It was not such a title as. might be abandoned by mere delay in instituting an action. A man may abandon an improvement or a right of pre-emption, Whitcomb v.

When there is neither estoppel nor limitation there can be no abandonment,, no matter how formal the act short of a conveyance, which can affect the rights of the holder of the legal title: Watson v. Gilday, 11 S. &amp; R. 337. In Hoffman v. Bell, <a href="/pa/61/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="61 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="428544" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0444-01">61 Pa. 444</a>, land warranted and surveyed in 1794 was sold to the county for the taxes of 1820; the treasurer made a deed in 1826, bufas it was made after he had gone out of office it was void; the purchaser from the county paid the taxes for forty-eight years, and during that time the warrantee neither made claim nor paid <em>taxes; </em>held, that this great lapse of time without claim or payment of taxes by the warrantee was not an abandonment. “The owner’s non-payment of taxes,” says Mr. Justice Shabswood in the case cited, “ cannot be considered as an abandonment of his title. The doctrine of abandonment does not apply to lands held by a perfect title, but only to imperfect titles by warrant and survey.” So in Bunting v. Young, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 188" data-case-ids="477882" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0188-01">5 W. &amp; S. 188</a>, where warrants were obtained from the commonwealth in 1793, the purchase money paid, surveys promptly made and accepted, it was held, that there could be no such thing as abandonment by which the title would be lost, and that it was error to submit that question to the jury. If this were an ejectment by Jones, Warner <em>&amp; </em>Andrews, we can discover no reason why the tax deed to Hewitt and the conveyance from Hewitt to them, would not be available in their favor; and, if this be so, they should have been available in this case to protect the defendants’ possession, for the plaintiff must recover on the strength of her own title.</p>

It will not do to say there never was any dispute as to the line of the Hutchinson survey; there is a dispute now, and the true location of the dividing line between the tracts was, under all the evidence, for the determination of the jury.</p>

The defendants allege that David Tyler, and Phoebe Tyler, who holds under him, are in equity estopped from asserting title to this land. The doctrine of equitable estoppel is well settled under our decisions, and, so far as it applies to this case, is stated substantially in the cases folio whig: Positive acts tending to mislead one ignorant of the truth, and which do mislead him to his injury are grounds of estoppel, though the party estopped were ignorant of his rights: Chapman v. Chapman, <a href="/pa/59/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="59 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="426925" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0214-01">59 Pa. 214</a>. But the acts of a party, done in ignorance of his rights, will not operate as an estoppel, unless others have acquired rights on the faith of them: Newman v. Edwards, <a href="/pa/34/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="34 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="418035" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0032-01">34 Pa. 32</a>; Duncan’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/43/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="43 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="483172" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0067-01">43 Pa. 67</a>. One who by a positive act induces another to purchase land of a third party, of which the former is the true owner, is estopped from setting up his title against the purchaser, though all parties acted in good faith, and in ignorance of the true state of the title: Miller’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/84/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="84 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1053586" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0391-01">84 Pa. 391</a>. When a person 'actually encourages or induces another to enter upon land and invest money or expend labor, he cannot afterward call in question such title, though he acted in ignorance of his own right: Woodward v. Tudor, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20382" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="81* Pa. 382">81* Pa. 382</a>.</p>

If the land should prove to be vacant, however, as it was then supposed to be, it would still be available for Putnam. It was to ascertain this fact that the parties went to Plarrisburg. Finding that the lands were patented, Putnam said to Tyler on his return home, “ What shall I do now.” Tyler replied, “ I don’t know.” Putnam said, “ I will go and see Mr. Wallace and have him look it up.” Putnam says, he did see Mr. Wallace, and- under <em>his advice </em>purchased the Coxe title. Subsequently improvements were made to the value of $10,000 or thereabouts. In 1879 or 1880, Tyler told Putnam he had found a deed to himself for this piece of land; it was the deed from Martin Nichols. An ex-<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>animation showed that the thirty-six acres had not been embraced in the Wallace mortgage. Now, if the acts and declarations of Tyler were snch as to induce Putnam to make the purchase, and as matter of fact, upon the faith thereof, the purchase was made, Tyler would be estopped from afterwards setting up the true title against Putnam, although he may have been ignorant of his own rights at the time. What the actual inducement is to a purchase of real estate often involves an operation of the mind, which cannot always be shown, and in some cases, perhaps, the existence of certain facts will raise a presumption of injury. But, in this case, there is no pretence that Tyler encouraged the purchase of the Coxe title, or indeed of any other title. Putnam himself testifies, that he purchased the Coxe title under the advice of his attorney, whom he had employed to look the matter up. A question of fact is thus distinctly raised, viz.: Whether Putnam purchased relying in whole or in part upon Tyler’s implied disclaimer, or upon the advice of hiscounsel. This question was, we think, one for the jury. The learned judge instructed the jury as follows: “ It is just as you find the weight of the evidence in these particulars that turns your verdict for the plaintiff or defendants. Did Tyler mislead Putnam or did Putnam buy the Coxe title, independent of what Tyler had said or done, intending to assert a superior or better title, as he believed, and hold the land ? If he did, then Tyler’s acts and silence did not hurt him. If, however, he acted on whatever Tyler said or did, then he was misled, and that by the man who ought to have had the knowledge and given him (Putnam) notice of it, and the plaintiff is estopped.” The verdict was for the plaintiff, and the inference is irresistible that the fact submitted was found for the plaintiff.</p>

The testimony upon this point is certainly very slight indeed. It is said, however, that he lived within half a mile, saw the improvements made, and gave no notice of his claim; but mere silence will not estop a party having title ; it will postpone only when silence is a fraud, which cannot be imputed to one who is ignorant of his rights: Folk v.

    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[235,543,1188,1436]]]'>It is further contended, however, that although the plaintiff may be entitled to recover the land, he can only do so upon payment to Putnam of the value of his improvements; that the defendant has an equitable lien for his improvements, and a right of possession till that lien is satisfied; that Putnam was a bona fide occupant under claim of title, and made useful and permanent improvements in betterment of the estate, believing himself to be the owner, and that he is entitled to-have the value thereof before he can be obliged to surrender the possession. We have no statute in Pennsylvania upon this subject, except as to the recovery of land sold for taxes: Act of April 3, 1804, 6 Sm. L. 301 [4 Sm. L. 201]; Act of April 12, 1842, P. L. 265. The principle of the common law is, that the rightful owner is under no obligation to pay for improvements which he never authorized: Gregg v. Patterson, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20209" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 209">9 W. &amp; S. 209</a>. It is now an established principle, however, to allow a bona fide occupant, under color of title, to-mitigate the claim for damages and mesne profits by introducing proof of the value of permanent and useful improvements.. This principle was engrafted upon the common law through the medium of equity: Sedg. &amp; Waite on Trial of Title, 691; Walker v. Humbert, <a href="/pa/55/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="55 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1470760" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0407-01">55 Pa. 407</a>; Morrison v.

The general policy of the law, where no statute intervenes, is to allow the value of improvements only by way of set-off against or in mitigation of damages for the detention of the land, and the value of betterments cannot, therefore, usually exceed the amount of the plaintiff’s damages and mesne profits: Sedg. &amp; Waite, 698.</p>
