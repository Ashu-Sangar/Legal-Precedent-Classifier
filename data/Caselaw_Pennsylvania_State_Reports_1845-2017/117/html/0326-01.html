The ground upon which the buildings stood belonged to Charles Duffy. The eastern end of the block was occupied by Bickel &amp; Biehl, liverymen, whose stable, it was alleged, was frequented by disorderly persons in the late hours of the night. On Sunday,. May 23, 1886, about 4 o’clock a. m., a fire broke out in the block which entirely destroyed the stables of Sarver, Mitchell, <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>and Flick and Kennedy, and left but the charred remains of the stable of Bickel &amp; Biehl. On the next morning, May _ 24, 1886, the burgess and town council met and passed a resolution that the ordinance of April 7,1886, be enforced to prevent the erection of frame buildings within certain limits embracing the location of the burned stables, and the same morning a copy of said resolution was served upon Charles Duffy, the owner of the ground and also upon each of his tenants, including Bickel &amp; Biehl. On the afternoon of the same day, however, disregarding said resolution and the notice thereof, Bickel &amp; Biehl gathered a number of men and proceeded to erect a wooden building to be used for the same purpose as the one destroyed. The town council then passed a resolution directing the high constable to' remove the erection. To avoid a breach of the peace the high constable and his posse were instructed to wait until the workmen left the building before proceeding to remove it. The officer and his men went to the premises after midnight and commenced to tear the building down, but. they were driven away. On the morning of May 27, 1886, the high constable, with a number of special policemen, duly appointed and sworn, proceeded to the ground, demolished the structure erected, together with the charred remains of the old building, and' piled the lumber upon the lot it had occupied. Thereupon Bickel &amp; Biehl brought this action against the high constable, his posse, and certain members of the town council.</p>

Ordinances may regulate, but not restrain trade. They must not contravene common right, unless the power to do so be plainly conferred by legislative grant; and in cases where they have such a right, authority to regulate conferred upon towns of limited powers has been held not necessarily to withhold the power to prohibit. I quote that as authority from a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ease.</p>

      <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>Again, an ordinance must be reasonable and lawful; not inconsistent with the charter of the corporation, nor with any statute of the state; nor with the general principles of the common law of the land, particularly those having relation to the liberty of the subject or the rights of private property. They must therefore be reasonable; consonant with the general powers and purpose of the corporation, and not inconsistent with the laws of the state. They must not be oppressive. The principle of law that ordinances passed under a general authority to enact all such as will be necessary, must be reasonable or they may be void, is well illustrated by the case of Commissioners v. Gas Co., <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%20818" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="12 Pa. 818">12 Pa. 818</a> : “ They must be impartial, fair and general, as it would be unreasonable and unjust to make, under the same circumstances, an act done by one person penal, and if done by another not penal.

To warrant the exercise of such an extraordinary authority by the local and limited jurisdiction, the rule is reasonably adopted that such authority must be expressly conferred by the legislature; and even if the power to declare a forfeiture is conferred, still no person can by ordinance be deprived of his property by forfeiture without notice or without legal adjudication —legal investigation or adjudication. An ordinance in violation of this principle is void, as contrary to the genius of our laws and institutions; and we say to you, gentlemen, that as there has been much stress paid in the argument of this case in regard to what was forfeiture or confiscation — I care not by what name it was called by the counsel — if property was either taken away and disposed of, or rendered useless by action of the parties, it is immaterial what you call it by, if the result is the same. Hence, in order to meet that legal point, we have instructed you in this way, and say to you that we believe this to be the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Power to fine does not include power to forfeit. Courts hold thereby. That municipal corporations cannot pass <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>by-laws ordaining a forfeiture, is strictly construed in many instances......</p>

It is claimed here that they were acting in pursuance of law — an ordinance or by-law passed in pursuance of the warrant of law thereto. Under the act of April 8, 1851, the chief burgess and other municipal officers of the corporation shall have power, first, to enforce all police ordinances, rules and regulations of the corporation; second, to exercise jurisdiction in all disputes between the corporation and individuals arising under the same. Very broad and very full authority; and it may be a subject of inquiry to you, gentlemen, .whether under this authority they might not, as there was a dispute between these plaintiffs and the agents, or representatives, if you please, of the town council, who were delegated as defendants, say to you, to go and tear down this building,. — under this authority we say to you it was broad enough to have entitled — nay, was it not the duty when that dispute arose to have at least adjudicated the matter with the plaintiffs, whose property they were there to take down, a day in court ?</p>

Under article XIV., section 1, of the constitution of the United States, we find this among other things : “ Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>

As we have already stated, this act which we have read in your hearing gives ample power to the authorities to pass an ordinance limiting within the borough of Butler the construction of frame buildings — wooden buildings. Have the council followed the directions ? From the phraseology of section 2 of this ordinance, it is only limited to a part of the borough of Butler. As <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>a matter of law we say to you that when they act under this law of the state authorizing them so to act, that they must make their laws general, operating upon all; and as they have limited it to only a part we say it is defective, and so instruct you. Under section 3, which provides the penal clause, we see no authority there which would warrant' the interpretation that is claimed by the defendants; for we do not find in the act of assembly supporting that ordinance, if supported at all, anything which authorized the tearing down; but they have power wide enough and broad enough to pass an ordinance with a penalty, and authority to pass the ordinance and enforce that penalty, and such a penalty as would protect in every respect the interests of the good people of the borough.</p>

If they were, then any person or persons specially aggrieved or injured thereby had a right to abate that nuisance. It is true that a wooden building, though erected contrary to law, is not per se, not of itself, a public nuisance; but it may become such by the manner in which it is used, or allowed to be used. It is not claimed that this building originally was constructed either in violation of law, or had been maintained as a nuisance when originally constructed; and we presume you will have no trouble in determining the fact that at the time the building was torn down it was unoccupied; it was then in process, as plaintiffs say, of repairing; as defendants say, reconstruction. In that condition can it be said to be a nuisance ? It is true that a private person not specially aggrieved cannot abate a public nuisance, and especially where the statute provides a remedy for all offences covered by it, that must be followed. But it is well settled that a private person if specially grieved by a public nuisance may abate such public nuisance. A nuisance, whether public or private, may be abated by the party aggrieved so that it is done peaceably and without riot — without a breach of the peace. The reason why the law allows this private and summary method of doing justice is because injuries which are produced by such nuisances require an immediate remedy, and only in cases where the process of law would be too slow to remedy the evil is it admissible; and hence the limitation to <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>doing so without a breach of the peace. As we have already-intimated it brings the main question for you to pass upon, upon which we think this matter turns; was or was not that a nuisance, public or private, such as to justify the defendants-in abating it ? The principal question which arises in this case is, was or was not this livery barn, thus torn down by the defendants, a nuisance? Was it such a common nuisance, and therefore a menace and peril to the welfare of the citizens of Butler -and to all living in that vicinity, and to all who might pass and repass, who had a perfect right to pass and repass in safety along the public streets and alleys abutting, or to which this property abutted and in that vicinity?</p>

On the morning, of May 23, 1886, the building was destroyed by fire. The next morning the town council met and passed the following resolution: “Resolved, That the ordinance passed the seventh day of April, 1886, be enforced to prevent the erection of frame buildings on the square bounded on the north by a ten-foot alley; "east, by a twenty-foot alley; south, by West Jefferson street, and west, by Washington street, and that the lessees and lessors of the ground included within the above boundaries be notified of • this action.”</p>

In the meantime, the town council assembled and passed a resolution directing the high constable to proceed at the earliest possible moment to remove the erection made by the plaintiffs. In pursuance of this direction, the high constable and the posse summoned by him for that purpose, proceeded to take down and remove the building so far as it had been rebuilt. It was for this action on the part of the borough authorities that this suit was brought. The court below held <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>that the ordinance was invalid, and permitted the plaintiffs to recover.</p>
    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[172,474,1185,768]]]'>No one at this day doubts the power of the legislature to prohibit the erection of wooden buildings within the limits of a city or borough. It is a police regulation demanded in many instances by the public safety. The danger of fire is much greater in the case of wooden buildings, than in those of brick or stone. Upon this ground, and upon this alone, can this kind of legislation be justified. The inconvenience of the individual citizen in such case must give way to the public convenience and safety. Nor can it be doubted that the legislature may confer the same power upon municipal corporations, such as cities and boroughs. They are but subdivisions of the state, created by the state, for the comfort and convenience of the citizens dwelling therein. The state confers upon them a portion of its sovereignty for the purpose of enabling them to control their local affairs.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[170,1251,1184,353]]]'>All this is plain enough. The court below, however, held that the ordinance of council was invalid, because it prohibited the erection of frame buildings in only a portion of the borough; that, under the provision of the constitution prohibiting special or local legislation, it was beyond the power of the council, as it was beyond the power of the legislature, to legislate for only a portion of the borough.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.7",355,[165,1611,1188,821]],["BL_356.1",356,[240,370,1181,303]]]'>Granted the constitutional prohibition, and that under it the legislature may not pass any law “ regulating the affairs of counties, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts,” it by no means follows that when the legislature by a general law confers upon a borough the power of regulating its local affairs, it may not do so by ordinances that are special in their character. The object of the constitutional provision was clearly to prevent the legislature from interfering in local affairs by means of special legislation; and, if the town councils of cities and boroughs cannot regulate them, they are in a bad way indeed. The principle contended for would prevent the town councils of a city or borough from passing an ordinance to pave one street, unless it also provided for the paving of all the* other streets within the limits of the municipality. In Baldwin v. The City of Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/99/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="99 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="446040" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0164-01">99 Pa. 164</a>, it was decided that an ordinance of the city was not a'“law” <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>■within the meaning of that clause of the constitution which declares that “ no law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments after his election or appointment.” The reasoning of that case applies equally to that section of the constitution prohibiting special legislation.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[237,678,1183,409]]]'>Nor is the ordinance in conflict with article XIV., section 1, of the constitution of the United States, which says: “Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” The ordinance confiscates no man’s property. It forfeits nothing. It merely prohibits the erection of buildings of a character acknowledged to be dangerous in closely built up towns.</p>
    <p id="b356-6" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[236,1093,1183,456]]]'>Moreover, if the ordinance had been general in its character, and had prohibited the erection of frame buildings in every part of the borough, it might have been open to the objection of being unreasonable and therefore void. The only reason, as before stated, why such prohibition can be sustained at all, is the danger from fire to surrounding buildings. Where such reason does not exist because of the rural character of a portion of the borough, it might be oppressive and unreasonable to apply such an ordinance.</p>

This brings us at once to the question, has the council the power to enforce its ordinance against persons who openly and defiantly violate it? We do not think the power of council in this respect is limited to enforcing the payment of the fine'imposed by the third section of the ordinance. That would not be an adequate remedy. A man may not construct an inflammable building in the heart of the borough and defy the authorities by merely paying a fine, otherwise he could preserve such building indefinitely, to the terror of the inhabitants. The third section contains the further provision that the person violating the ordinance shall be compelled to remove the structure, or pay the cost of removal by council. The plaintiffs were warned by council not tó put up this building. They saw proper to proceed in defiance of the ordinance and the notice, to commence to reconstruct it. The high con<a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>stable, in obedience to the order of council proceeded to tear it down. In this there was neither confiscation nor forfeiture. It was merely the enforcement of the law against those who defied the law. We are of opinion that the act of the defendants was lawful, and that no action lies against them for this cause.</p>

In that case the building had been erected in violation of a similar ordinance, and was demolished by the mayor. But there was no action by city councils. The mayor proceeded upon his own responsibility. He justified upon the ground that it was a public nuisance and in this he succeeded. The jury found that it was such nuisance. Every frame building erected in a closely built up portion of a town, in violation of a lawful ordinance prohibiting it, may be said to be a nuisance, owing to the danger from fire; but it is not such a nuisance per se as would justify a private person in abating it. But, when it comes to a question of the power of council to abate it and enforce its ordinance, we have an entirely different question before us.</p>
