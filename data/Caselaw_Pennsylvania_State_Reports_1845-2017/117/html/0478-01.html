    <p class="summary" id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[228,643,1188,662]]]'>On the 26th day of April, 1869, John W. Storey was arrested upon a warrant issued by alderman Beitler. That warrant was based upon an affidavit made by Mr. Zebley; and Mr. Storey had a hearing before the alderman, and was committed without bail, and remained in prison twenty-seven days. Now he comes here and brings a charge that that was a false and malicious arrest. He was discharged upon a writ of habeas corpus, after twenty-seven days’ imprisonment; and he brings this suit for a malicious prosecution. To sustain his suit he must convince you that the criminal proceding against him was without probable cause, and was with malice. Malice may be inferred from the want of probable cause, but you must find that both malice and want of probable cause are on his side.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[223,1314,1191,1125]],["BL_501.1",501,[192,381,1185,253]]]'>Now, the charge brought against him is, not of attempting to defraud his creditors, or of concealing his property, but that he purchased goods from this plaintiff upon false representations with intent to defraud; and it is for you to say whether, under all the evidence in this case, Mr. Zebley had reason to believe, from his own knowledge, or rather what was told him by Mr. Storey, for in this case, I presume that he bases his entire case upon the information derived from Mr. Storey with certain corroborating circumstances, that he was guilty of this offence. Now he upon one side has testified as to that. And upon the other side Mr. Storey has testified as to the conversation between them, upon which this action of Mr. Zebley was based. There were no other witnesses except those two. You have heard the testimony of both. I will not go over it. I will only read a sentence or two. Mr. Storey said: “ I then told him”- — you remember the conversation about the power of attorney — “ I then told him I had verbal authority. He and I had a conversation about my authority. He said I had no power; I contended I had. He said he could not collect his money from William Storey without a written power of attorney.” That is the testimony of John W. Storey. The testimony of Mr. Zebley is: “I asked him about how the stock <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>came to be transferred to him. He said he consulted an attorney and found the goods were liable to be attached. I remarked, ‘ How were they liable ? ’ He said, ‘ I have no power or authority from my brother to use his name.’ Nothing was said about written authority.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[192,640,1182,564]]]'>It is upon that, if I understand Mr. Zebley and if I understand Mr. Rhoads, that they base their belief that he acted without authority. You have the affidavit; and it is said, I think, in the concluding phrase of that affidavit: “falsely representing the goods to be for his brother,” or “falsely representing he had authority from his brother.” That is the direct testimony upon that ground. If he did say that his brother had given him no authority, or power, of any kind, why that would be probable cause for believing that he was guilty of a criminal course; that is, together with other circumstances, cause, if the debt was long unpaid.</p>

If you find that Mr. Storey’s story is true, that he told him he had no verbal authority, then all the case depending upon that falls to the ground. That is the principal point in the case for you to pass upon. Both sides contend that they are corroborated, or that there are facts in the case which corroborate their stories. Upon one side, the plaintiff contends that he, having made representation, and obtained goods upon that representation, it is improbable that he, himself, voluntarily and gratuitously, would state he had no such authority; and he also contends that the receipt and draft, or rather the order upon William Storey, is evidence that such a story was not told, and that, in the subsequent proceedings, a suit against William Storey was brought on the 7th of June, following, by Mr. Zebley suing Mr. Storey is also evidence of the same fact.</p>

If he had, then he had a right. Whatever would induce a prudent man to believe Mr. Storey had been guilty of an offence in obtaining the goods, gave him this right to arrest him.

It was twice tried in the district court by our late and lamented colleague Chief Justice Shabswood, then the president judge of that court. After the adoption of the present constitution, the cause was certified to the Common Pleas No. 3, where it was tried before the late Judge Yerkes. The first trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, which was set aside and a new trial granted. At the second trial there was a disagreement of the jury. The third resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff and a judgment upon the verdict. It is to this judgment this writ of error was taken.</p>

At the hearing before the alderman he was committed to the county prison in default of bail, where he was confined for twenty-seven days, when he was brought up on a writ of habeas corpus before Judge Brewster and discharged. Upon the trial below the plaintiff was allowed to testify, against the objection of the defendant, as to his treatment wliile there. He said: “When I went to prison I received two very narrow blankets and tin dishes — no knife or fork; I slept on the floor; I was there twenty-seven days...... Got nothing to eat from time I left boarding-house till next morning — room was filthy. Stool with no cover to it; the men made water in it at night and it ran over.” The witness had previously said that he had been sent down in the van with two other prisoners, “ one drunk and spewing.”</p>

He is responsible for the unlawful restraint of the plaintiff’s liberty, if he has so restrained it, but it would be unreasonable, as well as unjust, to hold him liable for the acts or conduct of public officials over whom he had no control.

The public prosecutor, for public reasons, and with leave of the proper ■court, may send a bill to the grand jury, even in a case where the prisoner has been discharged upon habeas corpus. This view of the act was evidently taken by the late Judge King, of Philadelphia, in the ease of Commonwealth v. Ridgway, 2 Ash. 247, where he said, in discharging the relator: “ I rejoice, however, that our judgment is not conclusive of the subject. The sole effect of this decision is, that, in the present state of the evidence, we see no sufficient cause to hold the defendant to bail. It is still competent for the proper public officer, particularly in a different state of the evidence, to submit the case to the grand jury. That respectable body are entirely independent of us; they can form their own views of the prosecutor’s case, and may, if their judgment so indicates, place the •defendant on his trial; we at present do not see adequate ■cause to induce us either to restrain him of his liberty, or compel him to give bail to answer. He is discharged.” It will be noticed that there is no indication from Judge King that a private prosecutor could procure the recommitment of a person so discharged. It must be done by the public prosecutor and manifestly for a public purpose.</p>

Abell, Brightly 131, where he held that a discharge on habeas corpus puts an end to a criminal prosecution, so as to enable the defendant therein to maintain an action for malicious prosecution. It was said by that learned judge: “ It must be acknowl<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>edged that the law on this subject has undergone many alterations in modern times. It seems to be now agreed, that if a grand jury ignore the bill, it is sufficient to maintain the action. But this rule has been still further modified, and it is settled that if a party is brought before an examining magistrate and discharged, though the proceeding might be again renewed, still, in point of law, that prosecution is ended, and the party may maintain the action for malicious prosecution. There is a precedent for a declaration in Chitty’s Pleadings, in an action brought under such circumstances. There is no difference in point of principle and practice between a discharge by a committing magistrate and a discharge by a judge who examines the case upon habeas corpus. It as effectually puts an end to the prosecution as if the defendant were discharged by a magistrate, although a new charge may be after-wards made.” The practice of commencing suits for a malicious prosecution, after a hearing and discharge by a committing magistrate, appears to have passed unchallenged in this state. There are many such cases in our reports. It is sufficient to refer to Orr v. Seiler, <a href="/pennyp/1/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Pennyp. 445" data-case-ids="216871" data-case-paths="/pennyp/1/0445-01">1 Penny. 445</a>; Bernar v. Dunlap, <a href="/pa/94/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="94 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="486578" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0329-01">94 Pa. 329</a>. It would be unreasonable to give greater effect to the discharge of a prisoner by a committing magistrate, who is ordinarily a layman, than to a discharge upon habeas corpus by a judge- of a court of record.</p>

It lacks every element of public importance. Such prosecutions are seldom resorted to, except to collect a debt, and one can hardly imagine an instance in which a public prosecutor would ever interfere in such a case where the offender had been discharged upon habeas corpus. And as the private prosecutor may not re-arrest the party, such discharge,- for all practical purposes, is an end of the case. If, therefore, a suit for malicious prosecution may not be brought after a discharge upon .habeas corpus, it can never b.e brought, no matter how gross may have been the abuse of legal process. Speaking for .myself, I would do nothing to impair the right to bring such actions. The fear of the rebound has saved many an unfortunate debtor from unjust prosecution. We are of opinion that the learned judge below committed no error in refusing the defendant’s point. It follows that it was not. <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>error to permit the record of the habeas corpus to go to the jury.

The matter referred to was irrelevant, and was brought out upon the cross-examination of plaintiff by defendant’s counsel; as it had nothing to do with the case he was bound by the answer, and was not entitled to call a witness to contradict it. Whatever Mr. Ruddiman may have said on the occasion referred to, his client was not responsible for it.</p>

McFarland was examined as a witness for the plaintiff. He was subsequently called by the defendant and was asked whether he had not testified in a particular way upon some prior occasion. The object was to show that the witness told a different story upon another occasion. While not important, I think the -witness should have been allowed to answer the question.</p>

Cummings, a deceased witness, who had been examined at a former trial, was offered in evidence in accordance -with some agreement of counsel or order of court.

The only <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>ground claimed for the exclusion of the omitted portion is that it was immaterial. This, if true, would be sufficient. But the deposition tends at least to show that the plaintiff was passing himself off for William Storey. This is not very important, but it was competent, and we think should have been admitted.</p>
