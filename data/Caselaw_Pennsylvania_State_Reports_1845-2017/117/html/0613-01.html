All these inconveniences have been detailed to you by the witnesses. I must say to you that for such consequential injuries, a common law action will now lie, being occasioned by the construction, operation and works of a railroad. The question however, gentlemen of the jury, in this case, is not whether or not the Northern Central Railway Company, in the exercise of its rights, in the use of the street, occasioned the annoyances complained of by the construction of their double track; the question of • liability in this case arises from peculiar circumstances. It is not the use of the street alone, but of a portion <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>of a lot of ground, fronting upon that street, which is the foundation of the claim of this plaintiff.</p>

What were the rights then of the railroad company? If Mr. Holland negligently bought with another owner in front of hiiq, the railroad company were equally negligent, in the assertion of their rights, in the opinion of the court. It is said that because the railroad company had a switch on that ground they had also an easement or right of way. To that extent they had; but where was that switch; how many feet from Mr. Holland’s house ? I don’t know that the exact distance of that switch has been proven, but you can remember from the testimony, what was said in regard to it. This they were entitled to; and they would also be i; entitled to a track replacing that switch, but what other rights had they ?</p>

Did that give them the right to use it as though it were a street of the borough, by reason of any title they had had to it ? I think not. The only right remaining to them, was the right to construct a double track if they so determined. And as the space used by them, that is the space created by setting back the front of these houses, was open, and not covered by buildings, and had been occupied already by a switch, and as Mr. Holland had a deed only for the line of his house, if the construction of a double track required the use of that ground, I think they could take it for that purpose. But in doing so, although it was the construction of a double track, if it could be done only by injuring private property, they are liable for that injury, because they had allowed the title to pass from them, and it was therefore the same as an original taking.

It is unnecessary to review the evidence on that subject, for the reason that it is. fully presented in the general charge. For the same reason, it is unnecessary to notice specially the evidence showing location of the property, means of ingress and egress to and from Water street, facilities for light, air, etc., before and after the enlargement, and the effect of the change on the market value of the property. The evidence on all these subjects was rightly received and properly submitted to the jury. It tended to show, among other things, that in August, 1883, the railway company, without the consent of the borough authorities, or any authority whatever, entered upon the triangular piece of ground between the roadway and plaintiff’s dwelling house, cut away and removed part of the porch in front thereof, and there laid down a new railroad track, about seven feet nearer the house than the old track, was located; that the approach to the house was thereby rendered difficult and dangerous, and, at times, impassable; that south-bound trains afterwards passed within a foot of the warehouse adjoining plaintiff’s property, and within a few inches of the porch and gate-way; that in consequence of the closer proximity of passing trains to the house, the walls thereof were shaken, the house itself filled with smoke, cinders, and offensive smells, necessitating the closing of the front .windows and door.</p>

The consolidation act of May 3, 1854, P. L. 537, to which it owes its corporate existence, subjects it to the power of the general assembly. That act, consolidating the York and Maryland Line Railroad Company, the York and Cumberland Railroad Company, and the Susquehanna Railroad Company, so as to form and constitute one company or corporation, to be known as the Northern Central Railway Company, provides, in the 4th article of the 1st section thereof, that the consolidated company shall be subject to all the provisions of the act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 79. The 20th section of the latter act declares: “That if any company, incorporated as aforesaid, shall at any time misuse or abuse any of the privileges granted by this act of incorporation, the legislature may revoke all and singular the privileges so granted to such company. And the legislature hereby reserves the power to resume, alter, or amend any charter granted under this act, and take for public use any road constructed in pursuance of such charter.” This clause, which is virtually ‘ part of the charter of the Northern Central Railway Company, is comprehensive and not of doubtful import. It contains a clear and explicit reservation of power “ to resume, alter, or amend ” any charter granted under it or accepted subject to its provisions. The power thus reserved may of course be exercised by the people in their sovereign capacity. This was done when they adopted the present constitution, the 8th section of the 16th article of which ordains that “ municipal and other corporations and individuals, invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use, shall make just compensation for property, taken, injured, or destroyed by the <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>construction or enlargement of their works, highways, or improvements, which compensation shall be paid or secured before such taking, injury, or destruction.”</p>
