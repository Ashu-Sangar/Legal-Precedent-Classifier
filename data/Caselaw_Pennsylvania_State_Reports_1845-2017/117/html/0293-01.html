    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[168,943,1184,611]]]'>1. A principle of construction is that a general act is not to be construed to repeal a previous particular act unless there is some express reference to the previous legislation on the subject, or unless there is a necessary inconsistency in the two acts standing together: Thorpe v. Adams, L. R. 6 C. P. 125; Queen v. Champneys, Idem, 394; Bounty Accounts, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20Pa.%2096" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="70 Pa. 96">70 Pa. 96</a>. To repeal a preceding statute by implication there must be a positive repugnancy: Mayor v.

If two statutes can stand together the latter does not abrogate the former. The whole course of legislation is to be so construed that every part and every word shall have its effect if it consistently can: Erie v. Bootz, <a href="/pa/72/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="72 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="434610" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0196-01">72 Pa. 196</a>.</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[167,1562,1183,410]]]'>2. The act of 1875 and that of 1887 are affirmative in their character and the substance such that both may stand together. This being true both shall have a concurrent efficacy: 1 Bl. Com. 89; Bank v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pa.%20448" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="10 Pa. 448">10 Pa. 448</a>. The act of 1887 was undoubtedly intended to be retrospective as to both the act of April 14, 1855, and the act of April 12, 1875, or a revision of the subject matter of the two acts, thus providing a general system to operate throughout the state.</p>
    <p id="b315-7" data-blocks='[["BL_315.8",315,[166,1977,1185,398]]]'>3. The act of 1887 did not go into effect on its approval by the governor. The act of 1855, P. L. 227, contains in substance in its § 14, the same provision as to the date, July 1, 1855, from which licenses shall be granted under it, as is contained in the proviso of § 3 of the act of 1887. It is held that that act did not go into effect until July 1, 1855. Hence we hold that the act of 1887 did not go into effect until June 30, 1887.</p>

It would be a curious legal anomaly to hold that the liquor vender might have his license under the former act, and yet be exempt from the conditions to which by the same act it was made subject.
