    <p class="summary" id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[232,900,1184,716]]]'>The auditor having made distribution accordingly and given notice thereof, the report was then excepted to on the ground that Arndt was not entitled to participate at all, for the reason that his entire claim was barred by the statute. In passing upon these exceptions the auditor stated that Yorks’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, (s. c., 1 Cent.

The objection to Arndt’s book account before that decision was made would of course differ in extent from the objection taken afterwards, and the auditor had full power to decide which was correct. Under our rules of court his report was not complete until he had passed upon such exceptions as might be filed thereto, and while it was thus within his control the parties might enlarge the scope of their objections or vary the grounds upon which they were urged. There was a special reason here for allowing such action, because the decisions in Yorks’ Appeal were not published in time to influence the first argument before the auditor. We have therefore read <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>the testimony concerning tins claim to see if that case is decisive, and are of opinion that it is directly in point and requires us to exclude John Arndt’s account in full. It was not “seated upon the trust ” in 1874 by including it in the schedule of debts attached to the petition for an order of sale. That did not “ establish ” it in any sense, but simply described it as a claim, or apparently a debt, leaving it of course open to such future attack as other persons in interest might see fit to make.</p>

The statute of limitations to be available must be pleaded, and this appellant had a right to conclude his case without anything to meet a subsequent plea of the statute, and was entitled to a decree in his favor: Heath v.

The jurisdiction of the court in such case is an appellate jurisdiction, not a trial de novo; and the case is analogous to setting up the statute in the Common Pleas for the first time on a motion for a new trial after a verdict by a jury.</p>

In the opinion of this court upon the application for the re-argument of that case, it is said: “ The relation which subsists between a creditor and the estate of his deceased debtor is that of debtor and creditor, with a trust superadded, by means of which and the machinery of the Orphans’ Court, he can demand his proportion of the trust fund after his claim has been established. When so established, it may be said to be seated on the trust, and there is some room for the application of the principle of McClintock’s Appeal. But in attempting to establish it the creditor is pursuing the <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>estate of the decedent as his debtor. No other relation exists but that of debtor and creditor, and the statute of limitations may be set up in any forum which has jurisdiction of the case.”</p>
    <p id="b142-4" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[248,599,1182,705]]]'>If the claim of John Arndt had been brought to the notice of the administratrix for the first time on the audit of the account, he would have no standing as against the plea of the statute. But the debt was to all proper intent and purposes established at that time. It cannot be argued that a debtor must under all circumstances sue in the Common Pleas to prevent limitation from taking place. Yorks’ Appeal does not so decide, and if this court had so intended it would have so said. There is no reason why the presentation of a petition to the Orphans’ Court by an administrator for leave to sell real estate to pay a debt of the decedent recognized as subsisting and valid, should not suspend the running of the statute, as would be the result if a writ were issued out of -the Common Pleas.</p>

Under our rule of court, herewith shown, and as the court below said, the auditor’s report was not complete until he had passed upon such exceptions as might be filed thereto, and while it was thus within his control the parties might enlarge the scope of their objections or vary the grounds upon which they were urged. And when the auditor had passed upon our exceptions, and his report with the exceptions and his answer, came before the court below, it became the duty of the court which had appointed the auditor to review his report and the exceptions filed, and to set it aside or modify it for errors of fact or law1 specially excepted to in proper time: Mengas’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Pa.%20222" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="19 Pa. 222">19 Pa. 222</a>. Besides, the court would have been justified in allowing exceptions to be filed after report was made in court, nunc pro tunc: Diller’s Est., 9 L. Bar. 2.

It cannot be seriously contended that the presentation of a claim to the administrator is the equivalent of judicial proceedings, so as of itself to bar the statute. The effect of so holding would be to take the life out of the case cited, and leave the law in a worse condition than it was previous to that decision. To establish a claim and seat it upon a trust, surely as much will be required in the Orphans’ Court as is required to establish a claim in the Common Pleas.</p>

    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[238,429,1181,703]]]'>In May, 1872, John Shaud died intestate seized of several parcels of real estate, and letters of administration were duly granted to his widow, Sarah Shaud. At the time of his decease, Shaud was indebted to appellant in a considerable sum on account of mutual dealings theretofore had between them. Appellant’s claim was duly presented to the administratrix, but she had no personal assets of the estate with which to pay it. In May, 1874, the Orphans’ Court, on her petition, ordered the sale of several portions of the real estate for the payment of debts, including that of appellant. Pursuant to the order of sale two of the pieces were sold, and on report thereof made to the court, the sales were confirmed in November of that year. The fund now in court for distribution is the proceeds of those sales.</p>
    <p id="b144-6" data-blocks='[["BL_144.6",144,[234,1150,1184,1179]]]'>It is a fact found by the auditor, and not controverted, that decedent, at the time of his death, was indebted to appellant in the sum of $1,566.77, which debt then became a lien on the real estate, and so continued until the confirmation of sale by the Orphans’ Court in November, 1874. Prior to that date the claim had neither lost its lien nor was it'barred by the statute of limitations. The effect of the sale and confirmation by the Orphans’ Court was to divest the lien of the debt as to the land so sold, and also to stop interest on so much of the debt as the land realized and applicable thereto, was sufficient to pay: Ramsey’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%2071" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 W. 71">4 W. 71</a>. As was said by Mr. Justice Rodgers, in that case, “ A sale under an order of the Orphans’ Court for payment of debts is a judicial sale, and has been assimilated in several cases to a sale made by the sheriff under process of a court of law. It cannot be doubted tliat interest ceases from the time of the return and confirmation of a sheriff ’s sale; and I see no reason, as a general principle, to make a distinction between a sale by the sheriff and a sale by an administrator under order of court. The land is taken from the heirs to pay debts; and it is but reasonable when the money is made by sale of the property and in the hands of the officers of the law, that the debt should be considered as paid to the extent of the money raised by the sale.”</p>

If there is any question as to the lien of a debt, or whether it is barred by the statute of limitations, the status of the claim at the time the sale was confirmed must determine it. Whether it be a debt of record or not, if it was then a hen on the land sold and was not then barred by the statute of limitations, it is entitled to participate in the distribution of the fund, provided it is not all exhausted by prior hens.</p>

Appellant’s claim was not barred by the statute, nor had it lost its hen when part of the land incumbered by it was sold by order of court for the very purpose of paying it and other debts of intestate. By the act of the court in confirming the sales, the rights of appellant and others, as they then stood, were fixed; and so far as the question of limitation is concerned, they were unaffected by the subsequent delay in distributing the fund.
