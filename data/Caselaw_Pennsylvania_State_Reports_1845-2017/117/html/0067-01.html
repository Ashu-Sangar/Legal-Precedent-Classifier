The plaintiff having shown this contract, and proved that he has complied with the .terms of it, and has completed his obligations under it, and ftu’ther, that he has demanded from the defendant payment, according to its terms, and that said payment has not been made, now asks from you a verdict for the amount due, with interest.

It is alleged by the defendant that part of this agreement was that these houses were to be finished with what may be called a wainscoting or ceiling, in lieu of plastering, similar to certain houses owned by Mr. George Parrish, and located near what are known as the Empire mines. It was further understood and agreed that the plaintiff was to put this, agreement in writing and send it up to the defendant to be executed, and further, that security was to be given to the defendant for the faithful performance by Sylvius of his duties under the contract. On the following day, Roushey came to the plaintiff’s store or near there, bringing the contracts with him and another paper, known in the case as the guarantee. They repaired to a saloon to transact the business. The defendant says he asked Roushey to read the contract to him as he was not sufficiently familiar with English writing to read it himself; that Roushey did read it, and that he, Kosek, then and there signed it, took it home and put it in his safe. The plaintiff proceeded with the work, and about the time the first of these houses was finished, Kosek discovered that the walls were not being ceiled or wainscoted as he supposed the contract provided for. He then ordered the plaintiff to stop work on the ground that it was not being done correctly, and offered to pay for what had already been done. Plaintiff, however, did not stop work, but went on and completed all of the houses, as he alleged, according to the contract, in a similar manner to the first one. Kosek further claims that it cost him some $1,050 after-wards to have these houses wainscoted or ceiled, as he intended to have them originally. Mr. Boyle is called also for the defendant, and he corroborates the testimony of Kosek to some extent, more especially in regard to a conversation between Kosek and Sylvius prior to the making of the contract, this conversation having reference, among other things, to the lining or ceiling of the houses, which ceiling was to be, according to this witness’s testimony, similar to that of Mr. Parrish’s houses. He further states that Sylvius said he would build them in this way if he, Kosek, wished it.</p>

It is further our duty to say to you that as a general rule it is not admissible to contradict or vary the terms of a written contract or agreement by parol or verbal testimony. This is the general rule. It has certain exceptions, however. In cases of fraud, accident or mistake, the rule is different. Wherever equity would set aside or reform an instrument on either of these grounds, then parol evidence is admissible to contradict ■or vary the terms of the agreement as it is written. But we say further, in the same connection, that the evidence of fraud, where fraud is alleged, should be clear, precise, distinct and indisputable; that fraud is not to be presumed, but must be proven like any other fact in the case, by the evidence and the weight of the evidence. Therefore we say to you in the present case, that if you believe this contract in evidence was prepared according to agreement, and John Kosek signed it, and the work was done agreeably to its terms, then Kosek having accepted and taken possession of these houses upon their completion, should pay for them the contract price, and your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the full amount of the contract price, with interest, a statement of which will no doubt be furnished you by the counsel. But on the other hand we say to you, that [if you believe from the evidence that the terms of the agreement between Sylvius and Kosek were that these houses were to be wainscoted or ceiled in the manner described; that Sylvius was to put this agreement in writing; that he did not write that provision in the agreement <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>in regard to the ceiling or wainscoting of the houses, and sent the papers by Roushey, together with the guarantee paper, to be signed; that Kosek, being unable to read English, asked Roushey to read the contract to him; that Roushey read it to him, not as it was written, but as if it contained a clause in regard to the ceiling, and that Kosek was thereby deceived, and signed the paper under a mistake as to its contents, and was thus the victim of a fraud; then it was not his contract, and from the verdict which the plaintiff would otherwise be entitled to, should be deducted what it has fairly cost to put in this ceiling or wainscoting as shown by the evidence.]6 As we understand it, the law is this: Where certain facts are misstated to a person to induce him to sign a paper, the contents of which paper he knows, he may, under certain circumstances, be held responsible and liable. But that is a different case from one which rests on a misrepresentation of the contents of a paper made to an illiterate person, or a person who cannot read the language.</p>

In order to bind the plaintiff’ by the alleged representations made by Roushey at the time of the execution of the written contract, it must be shown affirmatively that Roushey had authority from the plaintiff to make such representations, and the burden of proof in this case is on the defendant, who seeks to take advantage of those representations. The simple testimony that Roushey was authorized to take this contract to Kosek to be signed, is not sufficient evidence to establish that authority. There being no other evidence in this case tending to establish or prove such authority, the jury must <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>find as matter of fact that none existed, and the plaintiff Sylvius is not bound by the representations alleged to have been made by Roushey.</p>

He testified in substance that plaintiff having verbally agreed to build the houses for a fixed sum, including wainscoting in lieu of plastering, undertook to prepare and send him for execution duplicate copies of their agreement, embodying that and all other provisions thereof; that, instead of doing so, he wrote and sent by the hand of Roushey duplicates from which the provision in question was omitted; that inasmuch as he was not sufficiently familiar with English to read the contract, he asked Roushey to read it, and he read it as though it contained the provision in regard to wainscoting, and thereupon he executed the contract in duplicate, believing it embodied all the provisions of their verbal agreement. '</p>
    <p id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[176,1213,1189,978]]]'>In view of the foregoing testimony and the uncontradicted evidence as to Roushey’s authority in the premises, plaintiff in his third point requested the court to charge as follows: “ In order to bind the plaintiff by the alleged representations made by Roushey at the time of the execution of the written contract, it must be shown affirmatively that Roushey had authority from plaintiff to make such representations, and that the burden of proof is on defendant who seeks to take advantage of those representations. The simple testimony that Roushey was authorized to take the contract to Kosek, to be signed, is not sufficient evidence to establish that authority. There being no other evidence in this case tending to establish or prove such authority, the jury must find as matter of fact that none existed and plaintiff is not bound by representations alleged to have been made by Roushey.” The court declined to affirm this point as a whole, saying: “We cannot say, gentlemen, in the language of the point, that there is no other evidence in the case than that alluded to. In its length and breadth we cannot affirm this point; it is, therefore, disaffirmed.”</p>
    <p id="b93-6" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[176,2198,1185,252]],["BL_94.1",94,[202,383,1225,147]]]'>In plaintiff’s fourth point the court was further requested to charge: “ It being the uncontradicted evidence that Roushey’s authority was to deliver the contract to Kosek, and that if read at all, such reading was at the request and by direction of Kosek, this constitutes and makes Roushey the agent of <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>1 Kosek, and nothing that may have been said or done by Roushey, so acting, can in any way bind the plaintiff.” This point was also refused.</p>
    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[237,539,1188,559]]]'>Each of these points was fully warranted by the evidence before us; and, as correct legal propositions, based upon the undisputed facts of the case, they should have been severally affirmed. Roushey was entrusted with the papers, merely for the purpose of delivering them to defendant. The evidence proves this and nothing more. If he read them to Kosek at his request, he did so as the agent of the latter and not of the plaintiff. If Kosek chose to make him his own agent for that purpose and the contract was incorrectly read, it was neither the fault nor the act of the plaintiff. The ninth and tenth assignments of error are sustained.</p>
    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[215,1105,1204,1283]]]'>It is conceded by the learned counsel for defendant that the defence is in the nature of a bill brought to reform the written contract on the ground of fraud. The rules of evidence applicable to -such cases are too well established to admit of any doubt. The evidence requisite to reform a written instrument on the ground of fraud, accident dr mistake must be clear, precise and indubitable: Murray v. The New York, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/103/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="103 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="449091" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0037-01">103 Pa. 37</a>. If the evidence when admitted is not such as would move a chancellor to reform the contract or deed, the case should not be submitted to the jury without binding instructions as to its insufficiency: Phillips v. Meily, <a href="/pa/106/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="106 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="455579" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0536-01">106 Pa. 536</a>. Again, the answer of a plaint- . iff to such a defence as is set up in this case is conclusive, unless contradicted by two witnesses or one witness and corroborating circumstances equivalent to a second witness; and, now that parties are competent witnesses and each may oppose his oath to that of the other, when written contracts or obligations are sought to be impeached by defences purely equitable, the reason is stronger than ever for enforcing the rules of equity applicable to such cases: Phillips v. Meily, <a href="/pa/106/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="106 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="455579" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0536-01">supra;</a> Juniata Building Association v.

Tested by these and other rules of evidence applicable to such defences as the one under consideration, we think the evidence was insufficient to justify the submission of the alleged fraud to the jury.</p>
