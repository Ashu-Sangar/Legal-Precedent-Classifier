All common law remedies are therefore open against the violators of this law; the failure to reconstruct concerns the public, it is therefore an injury to the ■commonwealth, to which belongs the franchise of every highway, as the trustee for the public: O’Connor v.

It is admitted that the company appropriated a considerable portion of the road, not by crossing it, or by passing along it at grade, but by constructing upon it a retaining wall of stone, and a high embankment, upon which the railroad bed is built. It was such an appropriation as was wholly inconsistent with the use of the same ground for a public road. It was the duty of the company, therefore, at then’ own proper expense, forthwith to change the site and to reconstruct the road, on the most favorable location, in as perfect a manner as the original road for the public use. No new road has ever been constructed, and it is alleged that the public has ever since been obliged to pass at great inconvenience, and with much danger upon a narrow shelf, between the wall and the river.</p>

Having taken the benefits, it cannot repudiate the burdens; it cannot be tolerated that the corporation may claim to enjoy everything beneficial to itself, and wholly omit to perform an act in which the public is so largely interested. The rights granted are in consideration of- duties assumed, among which is the duty of reconstructing the public highway, from which it has excluded the public. Having accepted all the provisions of the act, this duty arises not only from the imperative command thereof, but also from an implied agreement and by tenure.”</p>

It is from the exercise of these public privileges and franchises granted by tlie charter that the public duty arises. Moreover, the commonwealth not only granted <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>tlie charter to the Philadelphia and Erie Company; it also authorized the transfer by the lease of the powers and privileges it secured to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and the latter company, in accepting the same and in the exercise thereof under the charter of the Philadelphia and Erie Company, must be taken to have assumed all the correspondent duties and obligations resting upon the lessors.</p>

The state confers upon railway companies some of its most essential powers of sovereignty, and in return stipulates for the faithful performance of such duties by the corporation as are deemed an equivalent or consideration, and neither the terms of their contract, as contained in the charter, nor any sound principle of public polic3r, will permit another railroad corporation, by a lease or transfer, to enjoy these high privileges and immunities, except on the terms imposed. The -Pennsylvania Railroad Company, as the lessee, must accept the subject matter of the lease cum onere. As the duty to reconstruct this public road was a public duty, the disregard and violation of it is a public wrong; and, as we said in Pittsburgh etc. R. R. Co. v.
