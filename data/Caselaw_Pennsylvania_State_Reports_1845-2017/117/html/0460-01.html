It would certainly be in conflict with the plainest provisions of the law, as well as with the general usage and practice of insurance, to hold that the parties being sui juris might not by consent, in conformity with the provisions of the contract itself, renew and continue its obligation, although, according to its terms, without that consent it was null and void.</p>

Corporations, of necessity, act through the agency of persons authorized to act for them, and the act of the agent is in all respects to be regarded as the act of the corporation itself. David A. Clarke was at the time admittedly the agent of the company; his commission was in writing; he was the “duly constituted agent” of the company, “ with full power to receive- proposals for insurance against loss and damage by fire in Orcutt Creek and vicinity, to receive moneys, and to countersign, issue, renew and consent to the transfer of policies of insurance, subject to the rules and regulations of said company and such instructions as may from time to time be given,” etc. Now there was no rule or regulation of the company, nor were there any instructions to Clarke exhibited in evidence, restricting his authority to the approval of transfers made before or at the time of the conveyance of the property. The authority is conferred in <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>the most general terms. Clarke, as the agent of the company, in the absence of such restriction, possessed the full power of the company in the several matters committed to his charge; he represented the company, and what he did within the scope of his appointment the company did. It was not required of the plaintiff to prove acts of ratification; the company was bound to know that what it directed to be done might or would be done, and without proof of ratification it must be treated as having itself done, what was done under its express authority. Where the property covered by the policy is transferred, and the policy is assigned to the vendee before the consent of the insurer is obtained thereto, although the policy may thereby be rendered void, yet by subsequently assenting to such transfer the policy is revived and becomes an operative instrument in the hands of the vendee : 1 Wood on Ins., § 116. The consent of the company’s agent to the transfer revived the policy: Shearman v. Niagara Fire Ins.

How can Clarke be said to have waived any condition of the contract in doing just what the contract provided for, what he was .appointed to do, and what, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion for the interest of the company, it was his duty to do. Clarke knew, when he gave his approval to the transfer, that the title had changed; this fact was found by the jury, and the knowledge of Clarke was notice to the company. Moreover, by the report of Clarke to the company’s office, the company had notice that the policy had become forfeited, for that report expressly stated that the title had heen transferred on April 14, 1883, and that the agent’s consent had not been given until the 17th of the same month. These dates were not strictly accurate, perhaps, the transfer having been effected on the 29th March preceding, but the forfeiture of the policy was as absolute after the lapse of three days as after the lapse of three months. Yet the company silently acquiesced in the act of the agent; no objection was made that the agent had exceeded his powers; in fact, no objection of any kind or char<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>acter was made until after the property had been destroyed by fire.

On April 21, 1880, O. A. Seeley, by agreement in writing, purchased the lands in question from T. Smull’s Sons; the consideration of his purchase was $5,129.50, payable in three equal annual payments, the first instalment becoming due December 1, 1880. On November 11, 1881, T. Smull’s Sons conveyed the legal title and assigned the Seeley contract to F. T. Page, the effect of which was merely to put Page in the place of T. Smull’s Sons as to Seeley. On February 8, 1883, the policy in suit was issued to Seeley. There is no evidence that Seeley paid any part of the purchase-money; he erected a sawmill, however, and made other improvements, and it is claimed that his interest in the land was greatly enhanced thereby at the time the insurance was effected. On March 29, 1883, Seeley, by contract in writing, assigned his interest under the contract with T. Smull’s Sons to Page, who thereupon at the same time sold by articles to Henry Dunham. The consideration of the last mentioned sale was $10,000; Page to receive $5,759.18, being the balance, with interest unpaid, on the contract between T. Smull’s Sons and Seeley; the residue, being $4,240.82, to be paid to and received by Seeley. There, was a reservation of the title to certain timber and bark until the purchase-money was paid, an arrangement to apply part of the proceeds thereof to the purchase-money, and a provision that in the event of Dunham’s failure to fulfill his contract, Seeley would resume his former relation to Page under the Smull contract. But we find nothing in the details of the several contracts of March 29, 1883, to vary the question already stated, viz.: whether or not Seeley’s interest in the property insured was such as was required by his contract with the company. Where the title to property passes, and the policy is assigned to the vendee with the insurer’s consent, the policy has sometimes been treated as a new contract with the vendee: Wood on Ins., § 110. But, under the decisions of this court, the assignee has always been held to take subject to all the stipula<a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>tions contained in the policy, and in an actionjby the assignee, the question of interest to be referable to the time of the issuing of the policy: State Mut.

    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[186,567,1185,1492]]]'>At the time the insurance was effected, Seeley, as we have said, had become the purchaser in fee of the property, under articles of agreement with T. Smull’s Sons ; he had the equitable title only, but he was to all intents and purposes the “ owner ” of the property; he was the equitable owner in fee, and, in respect to the insurance, we think he may be said to have been the entire, unconditional, and sole owner. This provision of the policy does not necessarily distinguish between the legal and the equitable estate. If the title is conditional or contingent, if it is for years only, or for life, or in common, it is not the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership; but the interest is the same, as it affects the contract of insurance, whether the title of the assured be legal or equitable. The purpose of this provision is, to prevent a party who holds an undivided or contingent but insurable interest in property, from appropriating to his own use the proceeds of a policy, taken upon the valuation of the entire and unconditional title, as if he were the sole owner, and to remove from him the temptation to perpetrate fraud and crime. For without this, a person might thus be enabled to exceed the measure of an actual indemnity. But where the entire loss, if the property is destroyed by fire, must fall upon the party insured, the reason and purpose of this provision does not seem to exist; and in the absence of any particular inquiry as to the specific nature of the title, or of any express stipulation in the policy that the insured held the legal or equitable title, either being available to secure an entire unconditional and sole ownership, the provision referred to can, we think, have no force to defeat the plaintiff’s recovery in this case.</p>

Wilgus had purchased the premises insured at an Orphans’ Court sale, the terms of which were one half in hand, balance in one year. He made the first payment, the vendor retaining the legal title, and before the year expired the loss occurred. The condition of the policies upon which the company relied was, “ that if the interest of the assured in the property be any other than the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership of the property, for the use and benefit of the assured,” it must be so represented and expressed. Mr. Justice Shakswood, delivering the opinion of this court, says: “ The plaintiff’s title was an equitable one, but it nevertheless vested in him the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership, subject to the payment of the balance of the purchase-money. This balance was practically an incumbrance. It is true the legal title was in the hands of the vendors, but they could use it only to enforce the payment of the price agreed upon. In this respect it is exactly the case of a mortgage which vests the legal title in the mortgagee for the same purpose. Had the property been swallowed up by an earthquake the entire loss would have fallen on the plaintiff.” The case of Reynolds v. State Mut.
