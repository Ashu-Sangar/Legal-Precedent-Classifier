We assume also that she made a deed at that time in which her husband did not join. That deed was void. Her grantee in that deed was a Mr. W agner, through whom the defendant in this suit now claims the title. Since 1853, however, as far as the evidence goes, the defendant and those under whom he claimed have had uninterrupted and continuous, and so far as appears, we say to you, adverse possession of the property in dispute. The plaintiff concedes that that would be the effect of all the evidence in the case if it were not for the record, which he offered and which the court admitted in evidence, of another suit brought in 1872 by John Updegrove against the present defendant and some others. In that case there was a defence by Mr. Blum and <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>the others upon the ground that John Updegrove had no right to recover, because he had received the purchase money of the property at the time his wife made the deed, in 1853; that is to say, of course, that although he had not actually joined in the deed, he had got the fruits of the transaction, all the benefit, and therefore he should not have possession of the land and the money too. Now, the evidence in that case, raising that issue and deciding that issue, does not seem to me to be inconsistent with the adverse character of the defendant’s possession ; and as that is, in my judgment, clearly the point of this case, as that is the present attitude of my mind on this subject, we instruct you- that the defendant’s possession is sufficient, under all the evidence in the case, and that the plaintiffs cannot recover; and you will render your verdict in that way.—</p>

It is very certain they did not. If they had so claimed they would inevitably have been ousted. They well lmew this, and so did not attempt it. They gave in* evidence the deed from Elizabeth Updegrove in connection with the other fact, to wit, that at the time of this void sale John Updegrove had received the purchase money, to show that they were entitled to the possession for the term of his life, in subordination to, and not adversely to the legal title.

The right of entry under which the plaintiffs claim and must recover, if at all, commenced to run in April, 1853, immediately after the deed of Elizabeth Updegrove and possession of the premises were delivered to William Wagner. As the deed was void an action could have been brought to recover possession the next day, in the name and on behalf of Elizabeth Updegrove. But no action was brought and no entry was made or claimed for or by her up to the time of her death in 1857. The action brought by her husband, John Updegrove, in 1872 was upon his own title as tenant by the curtesy and did not conclude any of the heirs. It was <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>defeated for a reason which, was personal to himself and it involved his own right only, and therefore cannot be held to toll the statute as against the heirs. The statute had commenced to run in April, 1858, and continued to run notwithstanding the husband’s action in 1872, so far as those are concerned who claim under the right against which it was running. The title which is now set up is in no sense whatever the title of John Updegrove. It is the same right of entry and title which Elizabeth Updegrove held in April, 1853, and the statute having commenced to run at that time against that right it did not stop because of her death.</p>

We have no disposition to overrule them or depart from them in any particular.

The opinions of this court in the above named cases contain so full an expression of the reasons which support them that it is unnecessary to repeat those reasons here. The facts in Hogg v.
