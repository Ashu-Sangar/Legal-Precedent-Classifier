But the defendants allege that, though the wheat claimed to have been delivered by the plaintiffs was delivered, it was, with their knowledge and consent, mingled by putting it into a common receptacle; and that the plaintiffs did not and could not expect to get back the same wheat which they had put there, or the product of the same wheat, but only its equivalent.

We say to you that under the law as we lay it down to you the only question relating to the source of the flour and bran is, was it the product of wheat ground from the commingled mass ? The •evidence seems to indicate that it was: You must determine, however; because if it was ground from other wheat that never went into that common receiving bin or pit, then the conclusion is plain that the plaintiffs cannot recover.</p>

It may be possible that •some grains of the plaintiffs’ wheat entered into this flour. Of that you are as well able to judge as the court.

To illustrate, where John Jones takes a bag of wheat to the mill to be ground into flour, the transaction is a bailment. He expects to get the flour from that bag of wheat, and he continues to be the owner of the wheat- or its product. If it be destroyed by the burning of the mill, it is his loss and not the miller’s; or if the sheriff come with an execution and levy upon it as the property of the miller, he cannot sell it. But where there is no obligation to return the specific article, but the receiver is at liberty to return another thing, he contracting at the time to make the return, the transaction is a sale and not a bailment; as when John Jones delivers twenty bushels of wheat to a miller and agrees to take from him, at some other time, twenty bushels of other wheat in return, or the flour and bran of twenty bushels of other wheat. This transaction is not a bailment, but a sale, and the property passes to the miller; and, in case the mill should burn, the loss would be his, and an execution creditor could levy upon it as the miller’s property. You will notice the distinction: In one case the title remains in John Jones because he put his wheat there to be ground, with the expectation that the product of the particular wheat would be returned to him. In the other case the wheat passed to the miller because Jones delivered the twenty bushels to him with the expectation and understanding <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>that he would get back some other wheat, or the flour of some other wheat; and this latter transaction is a sale.</p>

You will see that this case does not turn simply on the question whether the wheat was mingled or not; [but where one takes wheat to a mill and, with his consent, it is put into a common mass with the wheat of other customers, with the understanding that he shall not get the same wheat back, but other wheat from the commingled mass, or flour or other product from the same mass, this, too, would be a bailment, not a sale; and this would be so even with the knowledge of the depositor that some of the miller’s wheat was also mingled with his and that of the other customers. In such case the property remains in the depositors and the transaction is a bailment.]18 But we go further; if the wheat of the customers was all thrown into the same sink or bin along with wheat belonging to Newman, with the understanding that the customers could not demand and receive back the identical wheat, nor wheat from the identical mass that they commingled there, nor the flour or product of, the identical wheat, nor the product of the identical mass, but that they could get an equal quantity of wheat, or the product of an equal quantity of wheat in return; and that the miller, from time to time at pleasure, could sell the depositors’ flour, the product of the wheat, for his own use, this would be an irregular deposit and would pass the property in the wheat and its product to Newman, the miller, as effectually as a sale; and the plaintiffs, in such case, could not recover. The difference between the two sets of cases is that in one the wheat is deposited with knowledge on the part of the depositors that it is being commingled and the manner of the commingling, and that is all. In the other it is likewise deposited with knowledge on the part of the depositors that it is being commingled and 1 dw it is being; commingled; but, in addition to this, dominion has been given to the miller to dispose of it at pleasure, in the expectation on the part of the depositors that they can, in the future, get other wheat in return, or the product of other wheat. The <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>difference is that in one case dominion over the deposit has been given to dispose of it at pleasure and return other wheat or the product of other wheat; and this constitutes a sale. In the other case no dominion was given, but the miller was to return the wheat or its product from the commingled mass, which would be a bailment. By keeping these distinctions in view, you will be able to get along in the case.</p>

Where parties put wheat in a common receptacle along with wheat belonging to the miller, they become tenants in common of the mass and it belongs to them all jointly; but even in such a case, Newman as miller, would still be a bailee, and would acquire no greater interest in the wheat than if they had deposited the same separately for the use of the depositors. A miller must use due diligence and care, as we have already said, in holding wheat deposited in his mill, and return it or its product on demand; and should he sell or dispose of it whether stored with his own or not, though he would become a co-tenant in one sense, yet, if you should find that part of the transaction was that the miller had absolute dominion over the wheat and could grind or sell it at pleasure, with an understanding that the depositors could only get from him in return an equal quantity of wheat or the flour and bran of an equal quantity of wheat, in such a case the miller would not be a bailee.</p>

If the jury find that in ease the plaintiffs after commingling, had sold, and that the miller was bound to deliver to the buyer wheat from the same commingled mass, or that orders given by them for flour had to be filled from flour made of the same commingled mass, or that any flour they would order, or were to have in exchange for the wheat, was to have been made from wheat taken from the same mass; in such case there could be a recovery. But, if the jury find the facts to be, that in case the plaintiffs after their wheat was mingled, could sell and that the miller was at liberty to and could at his pleasure comply with the sale, by delivering any other wheat of equal quality and not from the commingled mass; or, that any orders they might give for flour, or any flour they could get or were to have in exchange, could by the miller, at his own pleasure, be made from any other wheat he had and not necessarily from the comingled mass; such a transaction would not be a bailment, but an irregular deposit, partaking of the nature of a sale and there could be no recovery.8</p>

Instead of affirming the plaintiffs’ first point, with the qualification made, the jury should have been instructed first to ascertain whether the facts therein assumed were warranted by the testimony, and attention should have been called to the manner in which the wheat was deposited in the mill.

The unqualified affirmance of the plaintiffs’ third point, which was but a partial statement of facts, without reference to the evidence in the cause, showing the manner in which the grain was deposited, would readily mislead the jury. In the plaintiffs’ fourth point, it was broadly assumed that the grain was put on a pile, “ for storage, as in this case ” ; and the answer erred in submitting the point to the jury with these assumptions of fact in it.</p>

It is only when the bailor retains the right from the beginmng to elect whether he will demand the re-delivery of his property, or other of like quality and grade,, that the contract will be considered one of bailment. If he surrender to the other theright of election, it will be considered a sale, with an option on the part of the purchaser to pay either in money or property, as stipulated. The distmction is : Can the depositor, by his contract, compel a delivery of wheat, whether the dealer is willing or not ? If he can, the transaction is a bailment. If the dealer has the option to pay for it in money or other wheat, it is a sale.” This distinction is drawn of course, with reference to cases where grain is deposited in a mass, as in grain elevators, etc.</p>

Undoubtedly he had a right to sell of the grain or flour to the extent of his own share; that is to say, what he contributed to the common stock and the tolls to which he was entitled. But the jury has found that he had no authority whatever to sell or to abstract from the common stock beyond the amount to which he was himself ■entitled. In the general charge, and also in the answers to the points submitted, the learned court instructed the jurors in the clearest manner, that if they should find from the evidence that Newman, by the nature of his dealings with the several plaintiffs, had acquired such dominion over their wheat, as authorized him, at his pleasure, not only to grind it into flour, but also to sell the same for his own use, the transaction must necessarily be treated as a sale, and that, in that event, the plaintiffs could not recover. This instruction was repeated with marked emphasis several times during the progress of the charge, and it seems quite impossible that the jury could have labored under any misapprehension as to the nature of the inquiry they were to make. The verdict of the jury was for the plaintiffs, and we must assume the facts which it is plain the jury, in arriving at such a verdict, must have found, viz., that Newman had no authority to sell the grain delivered into his mill under the arrangement with the plaintiffs; that is to say, their share of the common stock, nor the flour, which was the product thereof. It was the plain duty of Newman, however, to see to it that at all times the mill contained wheat or flour sufficient in amount to answer all demands under the bailment; failing in this, he was derelict in duty, and liable, under the law, for the appropriation and conversion unto his own use of property which did not belong to Mm.</p>

These points according to the general practice, were based upon an assumption of facts, the truth or falsity of which was for the jury, and the law was stated as upon a finding of these facts by the jury. They were <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>relevant to the issue ; they disclosed clearly the specific facts assumed, which were fairly and reasofiably consistent with the plaintiffs’ theory of the case upon the evidence, and the opinion of the court thereon could not have had any weight with the jurors in their deliberations, unless the facts assumed were, in their judgment established by the proofs. The points certainly were not such as could be disregarded by the court, and we cannot see how the answers thereto could be supposed to have misled the jury.</p>
    <p id="b624-6" data-blocks='[["BL_624.4",624,[226,844,1190,549]]]'>The learned court defined a bailment and a sale, marking the distinguishing features of each, and as the nature of the transaction depended not wholly upon the written receipt, but in part on verbal evidence as to the method of conducting the business, the question was undoubtedly one proper to be submitted to the jury. The court instructed the jury, that if certain facts existed the transaction was a sale, otherwise it was but a bailment, and the question was proper for the jury, whether or not, under the instruction of the court, according to the facts as the jury might find them, the transaction was a bailment or a sale.</p>
