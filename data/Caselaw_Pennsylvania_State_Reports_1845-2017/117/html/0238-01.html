Never breathe one word of this to any one. Now, dear sister, in the first place always treat Willie kindly, no matter what faults you may see in him, and no matter who may be against him treat him kindly on my account, for you know how devoted I was always to Mm, and if he gets married again do not blame him for it, because he is young. Now with regards to the place, he knows how it is situated as well as you or I, so do not let him find you out in a lie'. He knew I belonged to the building society, and he knew I had the bonds, but he does not know I have the money you will find enclosed in this letter. Now what I want you to do is to take the eighteen hundred dollars you will find and deposit it in the following banks : six hundred in the old Saving Fund, six in the Beneficial Fund, Twelfth and Chestnut, and six in the Western Saving Fund, Tenth and Walnut street, and the book you will find in the. tin box take to Mr. Campbell and give it to him. Now as to what I want done with the money, for God’s sake do the following: In case my child lives save the principal for it and use the interest as you please; see that the cMld gets a proper education, and do not let it want for anytMng you can give it. In case it dies you will have the money and no one will know anything about it. I need not tell you to have masses said, for I know you will not forget that.

To this decree exceptions were filed by Mary Magoohan, that the court erred in not awarding to her the whole of the balance after payment of costs and expenses; and by Wm. Fitzpatrick, that the court erred, (1) in treating the letter of March 21, 1882, as a codicil to the will; (2) in awarding the $1,800 to Mary Magoohan instead of to the exceptant, with the savings bank fund. On argument of these exceptions, the court in banc, opinion by C. B. Peneose, J., ruled as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-4" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[225,989,1182,716]]]'>It may be conceded that, standing by itself, a bequest of a trunk, of a chest, or a desk, would carry only the article mentioned and not anything which it may be found to contain; but it would be going very far to say that the same rule applies where the gift, as in the case now under consideration, is of the “ contents,” no less specifically than of the trunk itself. Nor can it affect the question that these contents consist, in whole or in part, of money, jewelry, notes, bonds, etc., etc. The testator having used the trunk as a receptacle or safe for her valuables, and having in express terms and without qualification given the contents, no principle of interpretation will permit an exception to be implied simply by reason of their nature. It is to be presumed that the intention was precisely what the words import.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[226,1713,1182,710]],["BL_261.1",261,[167,384,1189,925]]]'>If therefore the question rested merely upon what appears on the face of the codicil by which this testatrix gave to her sister Mary her “ large trunk and its contents,” there can be little doubt that all the money and evidences of indebtedness found in the trunk would pass to the legatee absolutely. But part of these contents was a letter, addressed by the testatrix to the legatee, setting forth the terms upon which the gift was made; and while this letter lacked the formalities of execution required by the statute relating to wills of married women, and could not, therefore, be proved as an independent codicil, it cannot, we think, be disregarded in determining the disposition of the estate. Had the testatrix in the codicil given the trunk and its contents “upon the terms set forth in a paper there to be found,” it would be no undue extension of the <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>principle illustrated by Baker’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/107/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="107 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="8857855" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0381-01">107 Pa. 381</a>, to hold that the paper thus referred to was to be treated as incorporated in the codicil, under the maxim, verba illata inesse videntur. But the manner of reference is immaterial; it may be either by express language or by implication. The question is one of intention only, and when among the contents given is found a carefully expressed paper defining precisely how far the legatee is to hold beneficially, no one can doubt the existence of the intention. Should the paper referred to be found, as in the present case, to be of later date than the codicil of which it. was intended to be part, the effect would be simply to defeat the operation of the codicil at all, by showing that it was an incomplete, imperfect instrument. Or, if the legatee is permitted to take under the codicil, the acceptance must be of the gift as an entirety; the letter was an integral part of it, and good conscience forbids that its terms should be repudiated by the legatee, who in equity will be treated as a trustee for those intended to participate in the benefit.</p>

The letter, which was found in the trunk inclosed in the same envelope with the money and deposit book of the testatrix, was as follows: [Here quoted.]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[162,1731,1187,654]]]'>The obvious meaning of this paper is that the money should be held for the child of the testatrix during its minority and the income applied, at the discretion of the sister, for its education and benefit. The principal was to be “saved” for it.

This was a fraud as against the husband; and such a codicil should not be suffered to confer any rights upon the legatee, who is a mere volunteer.

By the codicil of the 2d of February, 1882, the trunk and its contents were bequeathed to Mary Magoohan, and that that bequest, without more, did vest in her a good title, not only to the trunk, but also to its contents, is not a matter of doubt or question. What then is there in this case to defeat her right ? The paper which she, Mary Magoohan, after the testator’s death found in the trunk? — but certainly that paper was neither a will in itself nor a codicil to the original will, for it was not executed in such a manner as to make it either. The learned judge, however, who delivered the opinion of the court below, endeavors to support his conclusion by the following process of reasoning : “ Had the testatrix in the codicil given the trunk and its contents upon the terms set forth in a paper there to be found, it would be no undue extension of the principle illustrated by Baker’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="107 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="8857855" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0381-01">107 Pa. 381</a>, to hold that the paper thus referred to was to be treated as incorporated in the codicil, under the maxim, verba illata inesse videntur. But the manner of reference is immaterial; it may be eitjier by express language or by implication. The question is one of intention only, and when among the contents given'is found a carefully expressed paper defining precisely how far the legatee is to hold beneficially, no one can doubt the existence of the intention.” Two errors are obvious in the above stated argument. The first is, that <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>any analogy -whatever, applicable to the case in hand, can be found in the case cited, for there the reference was in the will itself to the next page: “See next page;” so that nothing was left for inference. Hence, the maxim, verba illata inesse videntur, was properly invoked, but it is impossible to apply any such maxim to the case under consideration, for neither was the paper referred to in the will, nor, as we have said, was it written at the time of the execution of that instrument. The second error is, that the intention of the testatrix, as such, can possibly be found in a paper which was not written for more than a month after the execution of the codicil. The effect which the court below sought to give to that paper was that of an executory trust which operated to defeat the original bequest, but without a proper execution under the statute. Such a thing as this cannot be done, in this state, by a married woman. And that this instrument was conveyed to the donee through the trunk rather than by the hand of the testatrix, or that of some one else, can make no difference. The fact remains that it was but a precatory paper, written after the will, and which cannot be made to operate as a testamentary revocation of the original bequest.</p>
