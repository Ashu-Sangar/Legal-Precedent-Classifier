When the deed had been acknowledged, the grantors having homes at different localities, but, with Hoffman, then temporarily at Bradford, Pa., it was placed in the hands of Darius Mead, together with the two notes, to be delivered to Hoffman, upon his execution of the notes. Mead delivered the deed to Hoffman and received from him the notes, duly signed, late in the afternoon of October 16,1879. In the forenoon of October 17th, Mead gave the notes to W. W. Dalrymple, who transmitted them by mail to the prothonotary at Erie, and telegraphed attorneys at that place to see that judgments were entered on them. The notes reached the prothonotary between 4 and 5 o’clock, p. M., on October 18th, and the judgments were at once entered :</p>

That day Hoffman made a deed to Lowe for the Dalrymple property, and Lowe was subsequently to make a deed for the property he was to give in exchange, to Hoffman’s wife or to some person whom Hoffman was to name. The boot-money was deposited by Lowe, and the deed by Hoffman, in the hands of Mr. C. G. Olmstead, an attorney at law, who was sent to Erie to see if any liens were entered against Hoffman. Mr. Olmstead arrived at Erie the evening of October 17th, and on the next day, October 18th, searched the record. Finding no liens he left Erie and reached Corry in the afternoon or evening, when he delivered Hoffman’s deed to Lowe, who lived about eleven miles in the country but was waiting to receive it. The deed from Lowe for his house and lot, in exchange for that, conveyed by Hoffman, was made on October 21, 1879, not to Hoffman, but to one Murray Raymond:</p>

That Hoffman himself was engaged in' the perpetration of a. gross and glaring fraud upon the Dalrymples is clear; indeed, that seems to be conceded. There was, however, a most manifest haste exhibited by both parties in the delivery of the deed by Hoffman to Lowe. The deed was put into Lowe’s hands in Mr. Olmstead’s office at the time of its execution; Olmstead says the agreement was that it should take effect immediately. Olmstead was to examine the title and search for <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>liens. If the examination was satisfactory, the title was to be considered as having passed at the time of the original delivery, and the deed and the money were to be given over to the parties entitled respectively. Notwithstanding this, however, Lowe retained his grasp upon the money; it was in the hands of his own attorney; he retained the title to the Corry property also pending the investigation of the record, and exhibited some anxiety, nevertheless, by meeting Olmstead at the depot to receive the conveyance back into his own hands. Hoffman, on the contrary, exercised no such precautions. The consideration of the conveyance was $1,000, yet he delivered the deed on the receipt of $300, taking no security whatever for the balance of the purchase money. The Corry property was put into the transaction at $700; the consideration expressed in the conveyance to Raymond was only $350, and the actual consideration only $200. There was no examination of the title, no search for liens, and the deed was not made until the 21st of October; and when it was made, it was made in such way as to cover up and wholly conceal the interest of Hoffman therein. Mr. Olmstead, Lowe’s attorney, prepared this deed on the 21st October, according to the description received from Sanders; and, although a telegram had been placed in his hands from the prothonotary of Erie county on the 18th, giving notice of the entry of the Dalrymple judgments, yet nothing whatever seems to have been said as to this on the 21st. Mr. Lowe says that he thinks he knew nothing about the entry of the Dalrymple judgments until after the 21st.</p>

Mr. Johnston says he asked Lowe why Hoffman didn’t want a deed made, and that Lowe replied, “significantly” and “ evasively,” he didn’t know that he knew; but Hoffman had bis own reasons for that.
