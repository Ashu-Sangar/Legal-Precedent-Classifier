The third section of the same act provided for a change of the limits of an incorporated borough in the following words; “ The same proceedings shall be had on an application to change the limits of any borough incorporated under this act, and the courts aforesaid shall have full power to decree such alteration as may be needful.” This is all that act says upon the subject of change of limits, or which could be applied to the annexation of territory to boroughs already incorporated under that act.</p>

It also provided, in section 30, for another new and independent method of ■ annexing adjacent territory to boroughs, by investing the burgess and town council of the borough with absolute authority to annex by ordinance adjacent territory upon the petition of twenty freeholders, owners of land residing within the section proposed for annexation. From this mode of annexation no appeal was provided until the act of June 2, 1871, section 4, provided in such case for an appeal to the Court of Quarter Sessions. Then came the act of June 11, 1879, P.

It cannot be said, therefore, that the act of 1879 is in conflict with either of the preceding acts •upon the same subject, or that it in any way alters either, although it adds some directions in regard to notice.</p>

Were the ruling otherwise, Justice Paxson, in the case just cited, remarks that about fourteen hundred acts then recognized as laws upon the statute books of our state would be invalidated. All that is required in such a case is that the supplement should be germane to the subject of the original act. That the legislation of 1879 is germane to the subject of the original act scarcely admits of a doubt. The original bill provided a mode for the annexation of territory to boroughs by ordinance of the borough council; the act of 1879 provided for a proceeding for the same object initiated by an application to the court, leaving the mode provided by the original act untouched.</p>

It provides for their incorporation, for the extension of their limits, and for the election of corporate officers ; it defines the corporate powers, designates the duties of the corporate officers, and sets forth in the most comprehensive manner the rules and restrictions which shall govern in the affairs of the municipality. The title, it must be conceded, completely covers the subject and •design of the statute; it is “An act for the regulation of boroughs.” Under this act the incorporation of boroughs by the Court of Quarter Sessions is authorized, without regard to population, and the burgess and town council were therein authorized upon the petition of any number not less than twenty of the freehold owners of lots or out-lots, or other tracts of land, in any section lying adjacent to said borough, to declare by ordinance the admission of the section on which •such petitioners and others reside.”</p>

When the change •of limits involves a contraction of lines, the proceeding is <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>under the third section of the act of April 1, 1834: Darby v.

    <p id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[223,459,1196,1486]]]'>The act of 1879 provides that jurisdiction shall be exercised in the change of borough limits by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the proper county, and not by the burgess and town council, as prescribed by the act of 1851; that the application shall be in writing, “ signed by a majority of the freeholders residing within the limits to be annexed;” that the court shall cause it to be laid before the grand jury when hi session, etc., etc. Thus ■ it will be seen that the supplement is not foreign, but cognate, not only to the title, but also to the subject of the original statute. The title to the act of 1851, although expressed in general terms as “ An act for the regulation of boroughs,” as we have already said, completely covers the subject of the enactment, and, this being so, an act entitled a supplement thereto has a sufficient title to cover any matter within the purview of the original, and which might properly have been embraced therein. The third section of the third article of the constitution requires that the subject of a statute shall be clearly expressed in the title. “ The title must not only embrace the subject of the proposed legislation, but must express the same so clearly and fully as to give notice of the legislative purpose to those who may be especially interested therein: ” Phoenixville Road, <a href="/pa/109/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="109 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="542296" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0044-01">109 Pa. 44</a>. But in the case of a supplement, where ^the subject of the original act is sufficiently expressed in its title, and where the provisions of the supplement are germane to the subject of the original, the true rule is, that the subject of the supplement is covered by a title which contains a specific reference to the original by its title, and declares it to be a supplement thereto: State Line &amp; Juniata R.

It must be conceded that it does not apply to all boroughs by its express terms. It has application to such only of them as were originally incorporated under the act of 1851. It is contended, however, on the part of the appellees, that the several boroughs incorporated under the act of 1851 constitute a well-defined class of boroughs, as distinguished from another class incorporated either by special charter or under previous general laws, and that under the doctrine declared in Wheeler v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/77/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="77 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="436265" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0338-01">77 Pa. 338</a>, a statute which relates to persons or things as a class is a general law, whilst a statute which relates to particular persons or things of a class is special, and comes within the constitutional prohibition. We are happily relieved, however, from the decision of this question. The act of June 11,1879, was afterwards amended by an act approved May 17, 1883, P. L. 36. The amendatory act is in the words and form following: Be it enacted, etc. That the first section of an act of assembly, approved the eleventh day of June, anno domini, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, entitled “A supplement to an act for the regulation of boroughs, approved the third day of April, anno domini, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one,” and which is as follows : “ That the several Courts of Quarter Sessions within this commonwealth, by and with the concurrence of the grand jury of the county, shall have power to change the limits of any borough incorporated under the act to which this is a supplement, and to decree such alterations as may be necessary and expedient,” be so amended as to read, “ That the several Courts of Quarter Sessions within this commonwealth, by and with the concurrence of the grand jury of the county, shall have power to change the limits of any incorporated borough within this commonwealth.” This act of May 17,1883, has not been subject to any constitutional criticism; it is a literal <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>re-enactment in terms of the first section of the act of 1879, giving the provisions of that section general application throughout the state to all the boroughs thereof.</p>
