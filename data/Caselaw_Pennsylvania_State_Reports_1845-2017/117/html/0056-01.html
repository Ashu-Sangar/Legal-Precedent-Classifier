From Centre street to the railroad, Magnolia avenue has been partially graded, so that the railroad embankment is about ten feet high, and thus crosses the lines of said avenue, completely obstructing its úse as a public highway and preventing safe and convenient passage; while between the railroad and Chelton avenue the breast and waters of Kelly’s dam occupy the full width of Magnolia avenue for a distance of about two hundred and twenty-five feet eastwardly from said embankment. Yet very many people are daily compelled to use Magnolia avenue for the purpose of passing from Centre street to Chelton avenue, to the church of St. Vincent de Paul, and to the markets and other places of resort; because there is no crossing other than this between Hancock street, a long distance below, and Chew street, a greater distance above said Magnolia avenue. There also appears to have. been a dedication of the property within the lines of Magnolia avenue, by George Jagger and others, on March 26, 1858, which dedication is recognized in the deed under which Joseph Scatchard’s sons claim, Jagger having granted and conveyed to Scatchard in 1865 by deed in which Wilson street (the former name of Magnolia avenue), is named as a landmark. Moreover, the firm of Joseph Scatchard’s Sons have themselves admitted the dedication in erecting buildings to conform to the lines of the street, and also conceded the right of way by making and maintaining a bridge for people to cross the waters at the breast of Kelly’s dam to the pathways over the railroad embankment. This right of way has existed for more than twenty-one years, during which period it has been in constant daily use by large numbers of people. George Scatchard (one of the firm), testified that people had been crossing by their mill and over the railroad since they bought their land, in 1865, while it was otherwise shown that the way had been in general use long before that date.</p>

Before the jury there appears to have been an effort made to establish a dedication <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>of the land within the lines of the street, which, it is now proposed, shall be taken and appropriated to public. use. The testimony of Mr. Dye, registrar of the survey department, as reported to us in the argument, is, that a Mr. Jagger and others, who owned the land in 1853, dedicated the same to the public as a highway, and that it has since been known as a dedicated street.</p>

In such ease there are no damages to be paid, for after dedication of a street by one who is the owner of the land, especially when such dedication has been recognized by actual use and accepted by the public authorities, the question would seem rather to be, Shall the city at this time be required to put the street in a condition that will render travel over it safe and convenient ? If the street is á dedicated and accepted street, the right of the public to enter upon and enjoy its use would seem to be beyond question. But it does not seem to us that this question properly arises now, under the petition to open Magnolia avenue as a located street. The fact to he ascertained first is, Does the public convenience require that it shall be thrown open to common use at this time ? Putting aside, therefore, the question of dedication, which may possibly come up hereafter, we take up the case on the main point raised by the exceptions: Were the jury right in reporting alone on the question, whether Magnolia avenue shall now be opened for public use, or were they bound to go further and endeavor to obtain releases of claims for damages' from the owners of the land to be taken, and if such releases could not be obtained, then to assess damages’?</p>

'After a most careful examination of the act of 1874, the construction placed on it was, that it was wholly inapplicable to the case of a street already located and established by due process of law; that when a street was marked out or laid down on a confirmed plan it was to be regarded as established or located; that it was the power to locate a road or bridge that authorized the jury to perform the subsequent duty of assessing damages, ■ and that when they were appointed to report on the necessity for opening an established or located road or street, they could only report on that question and were without power to assess damages; that when a highway was laid down or marked out on a confirmed plan, and thus located on the land, there was no further, act of location to be performed; that which was already done could not be done over again. We thought then, and think now, after the most careful examination of the whole subject, that in the case of a road already located the jury have nothing to do, except to follow the direction of the law applicable to such a case, and report on the necessity of opening. That is what the jury have done in this case, and we think they have conformed strictly to their duty, and that they would have departed from it if they had gone further and reported an assessment of damages. That a jury have specific duties to perform, when appointed as a jury of view merely upon the question of opening a located street or road, ought now be regarded as a settled question.</p>

This report was not questioned on the ground that the jury did not go on and obtain releases of claims or assessed damages. The thought does not seem to have been entertained by any one that the jury had not performed their entire duty when they reported on the expediency of opening the street.

It could not mean plotting or laying out a street by lines or boundaries, because that had already been done on the plan of the city. After so reporting, they proceeded as stated in a second or supplemental report, in accordance with the act of 1874 as they understood it, in discharge of the duties required by said act, to endeavor to procure releases from all claims for damages which might arise by the opening of the street, and failing to secure such releases, they took up the question of an assessment of damages, and reported that no damages would be sustained by any of the parties over whose ground the street was located. This, it will be seen, was a direct attempt to apply the act of 1874 to an already plotted or located street.</p>

It has manifestly established a uniform method throughout the commonwealth for adjusting damages at the time when and by the viewers by whom a road or bridge shall ■ be located.

In the opinion of court No. 2, in the matter of the opening of Pearl street, the authority of Jackson street is sought to be set aside by the statement that the decision of the Supreme Court In re Twenty-eighth street overrules Jackson street, which is therefore no longer to be regarded as a controlling authority upon this question. An examination of In re Twenty-eighth street will show that no such point was before the court below, nor was it raised in the Supreme Court. The contention on the part of the city was, that the Court of Quarter Sessions had no power to appoint a jury to report on the necessity for opening Twenty-eighth street, on the ground that the jurisdiction of the municipal legislature was exclusive, under the act of the 21st of April, 1855, a point that had been expressly ruled the other way by the affirmance by the Supreme Court of Large v. The City, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Phila.%20382" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Phila. 382">3 Phila. 382</a>, and also <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>in Jackson street. The question of the power of a jury, appointed to report on the necessity for opening a street previously located, to assess damages for such opening, in no way, directly or collaterally, came up in that case. And yet it is claimed that it overruled the decision in Jackson street, which decided that the act of 1874 did not apply to located streets. Nor was the denial of power in a jury of view appointed to open a street, to go on and assess damages, at all complicated by the question of the retroactive operation of the act of 1874, in the consideration of either Fifty-second street or in Jackson street, as the court in deciding Pearl street seemed to think. The point was raised by counsel representing the city in both cases.» In the former case, in the last paragraph of the opinion, after denying the power of the jury to assess damages because the act of 1874 was inapplicable, the remark is added: For this reason the questions discussed on the argument of the exceptions do not arise, and are therefore dismissed from further consideration. In Jackson street, the concluding language of the Supreme Court is: “ As the proceeding was wholly unauthorized, it is unnecessary to enter into the question of the retroactive operation of the law, or into an examination of the alleged defects of the record.” The opinion in Pearl street seems to rest very largely on the expediency of applying what are called sound business principles to the action of a jury inquiring as- to the expediency or necessity for opening a street. This, it seems to us, is a question for the legislature, and not for the courts, unless the application of such a rule of action is found in the law as it now exists. The primary duty to locate a street, which must of necessity be an original or new street, is put aside as an unimportant consideration, with the remark: If, as in the case of a plotted street, the location is already fixed, they are relieved from the consideration of that part of a jury’s general duty; they are free to proceed at once to the rest. And this is said, notwithstanding the ruling in Jackson street, that the act of 1874 made no provision for streets already located, and that it was intended for the case of an original view only — that is, where no street had been previously located or established. We are wholly unable to agree with the reasoning or the conclusion of the court In re Pearl street, and as Pearl street con<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>flicts with the previous decision of the Quarter Sessions, and with that of the Supreme Court also, as we read it, we cannot accept the decision in that case as an authority which should influence, much less control, our judgment.

This argument was held to be unsound. It was decided that juries to “lay out” were juries “to open,” and that, whether the streets were plotted or not. The logic of Twenty-eighth street applies with equal force to the enactments now under consideration. The road law is in force in this county, even where, as in the case of plotted streets, some of the surveying duties of the viewers have been transferred from the juries and courts to the department of surveys.</p>

This would beget endless confusion and work a repeal of the act of June 6, 1871, P.

That was the one leading and, indeed, only question in the case. It was fairly stated and fully and elaborately considered by our late brother Woodwabjd, who gave ample and satisfactory reasons for his conclusion. That decision has never been either directly or indirectly overruled or indeed questioned by this court, in any case to which we have been referred or of which we have knowledge. The question involved was not before <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>tins court, either in the case of Twenty-eighth street, <a href="/pa/102/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="102 Pa. 140" data-case-ids="502717" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0140-01">102 Pa. 140</a>, or Pearl street, <a href="/pa/111/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="111 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="545437" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0565-01">111 Pa. 565</a>. We did not assume the consideration or the decision of the question in those cases, and hence have given no cause for an inference that we intended even to qualify, much less to overrule, the case of Jackson street. Nor have we any disposition to do so. We are satisfied it was correctly decided. The learned judge of the court below has written so clear, forcible and exhaustive an opinion upon the merits of the contention in the present case, that we find it impossible to add anything to it. We affirm the order of confirmation for the reasons stated in that opinion. We have examined and considered the several assignments of error other than those which raise the question of jurisdiction and find them to be without merit.</p>
