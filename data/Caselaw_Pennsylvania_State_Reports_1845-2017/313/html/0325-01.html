He obtained a rule to show cause why the suit should not be nonprossed on the ground that the statement of claim disclosed that the cause of action arose in 1919 and was therefore barred by the statute of limitations. After an amended answer to the petition for the rule was filed, the court heard argument and made the rule absolute.</p>

The Practice Act of 1915, P. L. 483, provides the method of pleading the bar of the statute of limitations. Section 3 is as follows: “Pleas in abatement, pleas of the general issue, payment, payment with leave, set-off, the bar of the statute of limitations, and all other pleas are abolished. Defenses heretofore raised by these pleas shall be made in the affidavit of defense.” In making the rule absolute, the court below relied on Prettyman v. Irwin, <a href="/pa/273/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="273 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1070820" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0522-01">273 Pa. 522</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.%20195" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="117 A. 195">117 A. 195</a>. In the <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>briefs nothing is said on the subject. Prettyman v. Irwin does not support the order. In that case suit for death was brought in time but the writ was returned nihil habet. No appearance was entered and no further writ was issued until more than two years later when an alias writ was issued and served. Defendant then filed a statutory demurrer, under section 20 of the Practice Act, to interpose the defense of plaintiff’s laches, not the bar of the statute of limitations. On these facts, the court below entered judgment for the defendant. We reversed on the ground that the point could not be determined in that way. <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>need not now consider how the statute of limitations may be raised in actions of trespass: cf.
