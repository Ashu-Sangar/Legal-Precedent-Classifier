L., page 67, there is laid down this principle-: “The vital test in determining whether a person employed to do certain work is an independent contractor or a mere servant is the control over the work which is reserved by the employer. Stated as a general proposition, if the contractor is under the control of the employer, he is a servant; if not under such control, he is an independent contractor.” In the case of Simonton v. Morton, <a href="/pa/275/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="275 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1075675" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0562-01">275 Pa. 562</a>, 569, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.%20732" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="119 A. 732">119 A. 732</a>, this court quoted approvingly the following from 14 R. C. L., pages 68, 69: “ ‘As a practical proposition, every contract for work to be done reserves to the employer a certain degree of control — at least to enable him to see that the contract is performed according to the specifications. The employer may exercise a limited control over the work without rendering the employee a mere servant, for the relation of master and servant is not inferable from the reservation of powers which do not deprive the contractor of his right to do the work according to his own initiative so long as he does it in accordance with the contract. The control of the work reserved in the employer which makes the employee a mere servant is a control, not only of the result of the work, but also of the means and manner of the performance thereof.7 A reservation of the right to supervise and inspect the work during performance does not make the contractor a mere servant, where the mode and means of performance are within his control.” This court further said in that case: “In the case in hand, it is conceded that the contractor employed, paid and had full power to control the workmen. This is one of the most important considerations in construing the contract to determine the relation of the parties...... ‘The fact that the contractor <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>employs, pays, and has full power to control the workmen is practically decisive of his independence’: 14 R. C. L. 71.”</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[275,512,1152,637]]]'>The mere fact that the Boldt Construction Company was except in one instance referred to in the contract as “constructor” is not determinative of the question before us. “Neither the form of a contract nor the name given it by the parties controls its interpretation. In determining the real character of a contract courts will always look to its purpose, rather than to the name given it by the parties....... The proper construction of a contract is not dependent upon any name given it by the parties, or upon any one provision, but upon the entire body of the contract and its legal effect as a whole”: 6 R. C. L., page 836, section 226.</p>
    <p id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[273,1159,1154,1237]],["BL_287.1",287,[160,355,1152,477]]]'>It is clear that the Hospital Association reserved to itself a certain degree of control over the work to be done by the construction company but this control did not take away the latter’s independence; it merely removed that independence a few degrees further away from absoluteness than it otherwise would have been. In actuality all independence is more or less relative. Only when the independence of a contractor is so completely taken away as to make his selection of the means and methods of carrying out his work subject to his employer’s will does he become a mere employee or agent. Here the contractor furnished the materials and supplies, though it is true that the purchases had to be made “as the owner requested,” but whether the owner did make any such requests and how frequently does not appear. Since under the contract the cost of the materials was an important factor in determining the ultimate cost of the structures the provision as to the owner’s “request” protected the owner against the purchase by the contractor of materials unnecessarily expensive. Except as to any request the owner did in fact make, the contractor had entire freedom of action in its purchases. An owner of a house being erected might reserve the right to deter<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>mine even after the work of construction had started whether the flooring should be oak or pine, whether the paneling should be mahogany or walnut. This would interfere somewhat with the contractor’s complete independence in erecting the home, but it would not affect his status of “independent contractor.” When a contractor builds any structure <em>according to plans and specifications </em>his independence is pro tanto affected but his status as an “independent contractor” is not.</p>
    <p id="b287-3" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[153,844,1158,1562]],["BL_288.1",288,[268,347,1150,791]]]'>Appellant stresses the provision in article 20 that “in placing orders for materials and awarding of subcontracts, the wishes of the Owner is to be respected, and in the employment of mechanics or help, Owner is to have a voice.” This is an invasion but not a denial of the contractor’s freedom of action. It means that when the contractor places- orders for materials and awards subcontracts its acts are subject to the owner’s wishes, if the owner have any, and if these wishes are expressed they must be “respected.” This provision is far from meaning that the contractor could not place any orders for materials or award any subcontracts, and that all this had to be done by the owner or by the contractor acting merely as the agent for the owner. Likewise the provision that the owner was “to have a voice” in the employment of mechanics was not a taking away of the contractor’s right “to hire and fire” employees. The only definition that would be applicable here of the word “voice” is that found in Webster’s New International Dictionary: “Wish, choice, or opinion more or less formally expressed; as, ‘his voice was for war.’ ” A “voice” one may have in any matter is not necessarily the voice of <em>authority. </em>It is quite likely to be only the voice of advice or counsel. Having a voice in the selection of help did not mean that this owner could select the help but it meant that he had the right to express an opinion or wish as to the help selected. There is nothing in the contract which gives the owner any authority to direct the help in the actual performance of their work. The <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>control and direction of the workmen during the actual manual labor was in the hands of the construction company, and as we said in Simonton v. Morton, supra, quoting from 14 R. C. L. 71: this “is an extremely important element in determining whether the employee is an independent contractor.” Nor in the contract is there any right reserved to the owner to discharge the help; nor does the fact that the contract provides that the owner can terminate the contract under certain conditions make the construction company any less an independent contractor. This provision is not inconsistent with the “independence” of a contractor up to the time of the contract’s termination. All contractors (except matrimonial) can incorporate such a provision in their contracts.</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[265,1160,1151,581]]]'>The contract in at least three instances refers to “subcontracts” or “subcontractors.” These latter could only be “subs” to the contractor or constructor. For example, in article 14 appears the phrase, “the actual cost to the Constructor of Subcontracted work, materials and supplies.” The principal would not characterize as “subcontractors” those who dealt with his mere agents. The construction company’s acceptance of the word “contracts” or “subcontracts” in the articles of agreement is a recognition by it that it was a contractor and not merely an agent.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[262,1753,1152,639]],["BL_289.1",289,[160,348,1155,1396]]]'>Appellant strongly urges upon us the reasoning in Harvey v. Corbett, 77 Oregon 51, <a href="/or/77/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="150 P. 263" data-case-ids="4537643" data-case-paths="/or/77/0051-01">150 Pac. 263</a>, and refers to the contract in the Oregon case as “such a contract” as the “type” before us. We find many differences in these two contracts. In the Oregon contract the owner described himself as the “principal” and the construction company was described as the “agent.” The contract provided, inter alia, that “the agent shall have the right to enter into contracts for and on behalf of the principal and in its name for the purchase of all necessary material and the hiring of necessary labor.” All contracts except as to minor matters were to be sub<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>mitted to the principal for approval. The court said in that case: “The authority of the owners, acting through their chosen supervisor, was paramount to that of Hurley-Mason Company [the constructors]. This authority the owners exercised when their servant ordered the fastening of the scaffolding taken away from the building.” In the case before us while the owner designated W. F. Walker as its representative to act for it, Walker’s authority appears to have been only to approve all original invoices and to check them with material delivery tickets daily or as the materials were delivered at the site, and if the constructor furnished any material from its own stock to determine the prices therefor and to terminate the contract in certain contingencies. There appears nowhere in the contract any authority in the representative to direct the employees as to how to perform their duties, or, as in the Oregon case, to order the fastening of the scaffolding taken away from the building, or to do anything else of a constructive or of a destructive character. It is manifest that the Boldt Construction Company was a contractor, as that term is defined in the Mechanics’ Lien Act of 1901, supra, and that the B. T. Withers Sons Company was a subcontractor. This would make The Smith-Faris Company a <em>sub-subcontractor </em>and therefore beyond the protection of the Mechanics’ Lien Law.</p>
    <p id="b289-3" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[159,1764,1154,640]],["BL_290.1",290,[266,355,1152,371]]]'>The other question raised is whether or not the claimant was entitled to compensation amounting to ¡§391.22 for the pipe coverings and fittings and labor not included in the plans and specifications and which it pleaded and proved it furnished to the Hospital Association upon the written order of W. F. Walker, agent, and J. H. Blair, superintendent, addressed to R. T. Withers Sons Co. In furnishing this material and labor the claimant was a subcontractor and was therefore within the protection of the Mechanics’ Lien Law. While the question of compensation for this extra material and labor was not mentioned in the stipulation filed in this case as a question <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>
      <em>to </em>be argued, its exclusion was apparently an inadvertence for the evidence relating to this question was printed in the record and both appellant and appellee printed this question in varying forms in their respective statements of questions involved. If the stipulation was meant to exclude this question, this exclusion was thus apparently later waived by the appellee.</p>
    <p id="b290-4" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[265,737,1151,96]]]'>The judgment is reversed and is herein entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $391.22 with interest.</p>
