The important question is, has a fiduciary relation between private banker and depositors been shown? The plaintiff, who is appellant, is trustee in <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>bankruptcy of Muller and Company, a partnership, engaged in business as private bankers. The defendants, Cassatt and Company are stockbrokers. Appellant’s general position is that Muller &amp; Company, in the conduct of their business, were quasi-trustees for depositors; that in the purchase and sale, through defendant brokers, of stocks and bonds, — some outright and others on margin, — they acted unlawfully; that defendant brokers knew the source of the money used by the bankers and must therefore be held to have participated in the unlawful transactions and to be accountable, etc.</p>

January 22, 1926, Frost, then the proprietor of the bank, began trading with Cassatt and Company, defendants. It is stated that from January, 1926, until his retirement from business in July, 1927,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> his purchases through his account aggregated $402,388.87 and his sales $302,-952.49. About a year later, he opened a margin account. In 1924, Frost’s nephew, Harry Muhlschegel, also a defendant, became his partner; Muhlschlegel had been employed in the bank since 1907, and from 1920 had been assistant manager. When Frost retired in July, 1927, Muhlschlegel and Reichert, a defendant, became partners, continuing the business under the same firm name. After Frost’s retirement, the succeeding partners continued trading in the margin account. In addition, in August, 1927, Muhlschlegel opened a margin account in his own name with the understanding that it would be operated on behalf of the firm. Both accounts were used and considered as partnership transactions. January 23, 1931, Muhlschlegel and Frost, individually, and as partners, were declared bankrupts.</p>

Credit was given in the depositor’s passbook, but the deposits were not subject to check. To withdraw, it was necessary to produce the passbook for charge; up to $100 could be withdrawn in any week without notice, but two weeks’ notice was required to withdraw sums in excess of $100. Interest was credited once a year.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> There is nothing in <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>that arrangement materially changing the debtor and creditor relation implied at common law; nothing to support a finding of agency or of bailment, either of which would, of course, give rise to a fiduciary relation, though not strictly that of trustee and cestui qui trust. The money deposited became the banker’s; he could mingle it with his own moneys; there was no agreement that he should keep it separate. Appellant does not contend that the depositors were entitled to all the income or profits realized by Muller- on money deposited.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We, of course, all agree with the condemnation by the learned counsel for appellant of the conduct of Muller &amp; Company described in the record, but relief cannot be had in this suit. We are not now called upon to define the precise measure of care assumed by the private banker who invites deposits in savings accounts on the terms stated above, nor to pass on claims of separate depositors. While the general relationship is described as debtor -and creditor, some terms have been added by the agreement of the parties and some are implied by holding out to receive deposits in savings accounts. If, as contended, the banker held himself out as possessing special skill and knowledge in the care of money deposited in savings accounts, and, by himself, or in conspiracy with others, failed to exercise the degree of care <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>required in the circumstances, the wrong, like any other, may he redressed in an action at law brought by any injured party against the party or parties causing the wrong, but equity cannot afford relief merely because the injured depositors are numerous.

To this position Cassatt replies that, if Muller was guilty of such fraud, Cassatt “never had sufficient knowledge of the facts to charge it with responsibility therefor.” In his consideration of the evidence, the learned chancellor stated that Muhlschlegel’s testimony about the assets of Muller was not sufficient to support a finding that Cassatt was advised <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>of the assets of Muller &amp; Company, and of the resources of the partners, or of the liabilities to depositors, or generally. He referred to the evidence that Muller also dealt with other brokers; an exhibit, as of June 6, 1930, in appellee’s brief, shows a list of Muller’s securities not held by Cassatt, aggregating $255,614. The chancellor also found that “it is practically impossible to determine from the evidence the date on which Muller &amp; Company become insolvent”; that “Cassatt &amp; Company did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the insolvency of Henry Muller &amp; Company until the said Muller &amp; Company were adjudicated bankrupt on January 23, 1931,” and that no securities were received by Cassatt from Muller after December, 1929. Nor is there any basis for the contention that Muller’s contracts with Cassatt were mere gambling transactions; the chancellor found the contrary. All these findings are sustained by evidence and must be accepted here.</p>

As the court below negatived the point, we must assume the jury would have found the facts as stated therein. The plaintiffs cannot treat Gill in the dual character of trustee and debtor. Undoubtedly the receipt by him of the money for invest<a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>ment, -without more, would have made him a trustee. The money would have been trust money, and if misapplied, could have been followed until it reached the hands of an innocent holder for value. But the agreement to pay interest necessarily implied the right to use the money. Interest is the price or consideration for the use of money. It follows that Gill became the mere banker or debtor of the plaintiffs, subject to the duty of investing the money in a mortgage when a suitable opportunity should occur. In the meantime he had the right to use it in any way his convenience or necessities required.” See, also, Bair v.
