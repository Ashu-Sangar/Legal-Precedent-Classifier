L. Clyman for a period of fourteen years and four months, begin<a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>ning December 1, 1926, and ending April 30, 1941, the premises to be used for an automobile service station. Defendant company, a manufacturer of gasoline and oils, leased to lessee and installed on the leased premises, equipment necessary for a service station, and further contracted to sell him for resale necessary station supplies; consequently having an “interest in the subject-matter of said lease,” defendant entered into an agreement, to which lessor and lessee also were parties, guaranteeing payment of rental by lessee for a period of three years and four months from December 1, 1926, “in the amounts and at the times in the manner set forth in said agreement.” In event of default in payment of any installment of rent during the period of the three years and four months named, defendant agreed to pay such unpaid sums, and upon payment of any defaulted installment it thereupon became substituted for lessee in the lease agreement, with all the rights and liabilities of lessee. As security for defendant’s undertaking lessee assigned to it all property, equipment, etc., on the premises, the same to become the absolute property of defendant upon any default of lessee. Following the clauses stating the above provisions, it is expressly set forth that, “the obligation of third party [surety] under this agreement shall end when second party shall have paid to first parties said rental for said period, viz., for three (3) years and four (4) months from December 1, 1926.”</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[268,1800,1152,475]]]'>As regards the equipment on the premises, the lease provided that “whenever rent......is unpaid, the lessor may seize or distrain said property......and sell the same......” and that “removal......of any goods or chattels from said premises by the tenant while any portion of the rent for the full term shall be unpaid, shall be deemed a fraudulent and clandestine removal, and the whole rent for the entire term shall fall due and be collectible,” etc.</p>

    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.6",179,[181,1645,1153,585]]]'>Defendant having paid all rent due during the period of two years and four months, denies further liability and asserts the intention of the parties under the agreement as a whole clearly indicates that defendant company should guarantee the rent to plaintiff for three years and four months, later reduced to a term of two years and four months, and thereupon its liability should end, and also avers the provision to take over the property as tenant was for the protection of guarantor’s interests in case it became obligated by lessee’s default for payment of the rent during that period.</p>

We are of opinion such construction is, in the words of the lower court, “entirely unwarranted and not in accord with the intention of the parties as revealed when the ' agreement is read as a whole. When the paragraphs [in question] are read with their context it clearly appears that the right of substitution was given to defendant solely for its protection and to lessen its loss in case of default by the tenant.” See Alcorn Combustion Co. v.

    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.6",180,[257,1578,1150,314]]]'>The court below correctly concluded “that defendant was obligated to pay the rental only for the period of its guaranty, and having done so, it is discharged from any further obligation under the agreement,” and also that it was invested with authority to remove its own property at the end of its liability under the contract.</p>
