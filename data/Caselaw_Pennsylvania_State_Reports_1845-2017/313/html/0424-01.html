Scanlon opened an account in her own name at the Farmers Deposit Savings Bank of Pittsburgh with a deposit of $10. Further sums were deposited by her, including the proceeds of insurance policies on the lives of her parents, until in November, 1926, the account amounted to $5,024.20. On November 23, 1926, she closed this account and opened another one for the like amount in her name and that of her husband, Charles F. Scanlon. On the card creating this account appear the two signatures of the depositors and various notations in the handwriting of a third person, presumably that of the bank official with whom they dealt. Printed in ink above the signatures are the words “both signatures required to draw.” Between them is the word “and” and after them the words “or survivor” and “wife.”</p>

There is no evidence that the husband deposited anything in the account. He became ill and on July 7, 1927, this account was closed by a check signed by both and a new account was opened in the name of Minnie A. Scanlon “in trust for” Charles F. Scanlon. Only two deposits were made in this account, in addition to the initial one for $5,675, one of $100 and one of $52.50. There was one withdrawal of $100. The pass book remained in the possession of Mrs. Scanlon. The husband became insane and payments under a disability insurance contract in his favor were made to the wife as beneficiary in the policy. The payments amounted to $52.50 a month. On March 18, 1929, Mrs. Scanlon died. That day she made <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>a will in which she recited that she had, among other assets, about $6,000 at the Farmers Bank and provided for its distribution in the main among her relatives. Five days after her death, on March 23, 1929, the husband died.</p>

Undeniably it was deposited to her sole credit until November 23, 1926. There is no suggestion that any of the money belonged to her husband prior to the first change in the account.

It also appears that the notation on the card “both signatures required to draw” was in the handwriting of some one other than Mrs. Scanlon.

    <p id="ANG" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[166,900,1153,532]]]'>As further evidence of her control over the fund, Mrs. Scanlon, in 1927, changed the nature of the deposit once more. She and Mr. Scanlon withdrew the entire fund which she then redeposited in her name as trustee for him. When it was so redeposited, a new status was created. She became a trustee with the right to revoke the trust. This conclusion is in accord with the doctrine of tentative trusts which has been developed in New York, where litigation of trust bank accounts has been much greater than with us.</p>

E. 748</a>, decided in 1904, the theory of a tentative trust was enunciated in an effort to retain for the depositor the complete control of the fund during his life and yet secure to the beneficiary any balance standing in the account at the death of the depositor. The court says at page 125: “After much reflection upon the subject, guided by the principles established by our former decisions, we announce the following as our conclusion: A deposit by one person of his own money, in his own name as trustee for another, standing alone, does not establish an irrevocable trust during the lifetime of the depositor. It is a tentative trust merely, recovable at will, until the depositor dies or completes the gift in his lifetime by some unequivocal act or declaration such as delivery of the pass book or notice to the beneficiary. In case the depositor dies before the beneficiary without revocation, or some decisive act or declaration of disaffirmance, the <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>presumption arises that an absolute trust was created as to the balance on hand at the death of the depositor.” See 3 R. C. L. 716, 717; 43 Harvard Law Rev. 539. As in that case, so here, there is no evidence of an intention to create an irrevocable trust at the timé of deposit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Neither is there evidence here of any further acts by Mrs. Scanlon which show an intention to make the trust irrevocable. If it had been made manifest that the husband had an interest in the redeposited fund, the situation might be different, but nothing of this kind appears. The mere fact that there was deposited in the fund the sum of |52.50, which corresponds to the monthly payments made to Mrs. Scanlon under the disability policy, of itself, proves nothing. Moreover, the wife was the beneficiary in the policy and her husband was insane. It would, therefore, seem natural that the payments should be made to her.</p>

Evidence may be admitted to show which was his intention. In the absence-<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>of evidence of a different intention of the depositor, the mere fact that a deposit was made in a savings bank in the name of a depositor ‘as trustee’ for another person is sufficient to show an intention to create a revocable trust. To such a trust the principle stated in this section is applicable. The depositor may at any time withdraw any part of the deposit during his lifetime, or otherwise revoke the trust in whole or in part at any time during his lifetime, or by will, but on his death the beneficiary is entitled to the amount remaining on deposit if the depositor has not revoked the trust.”</p>
