These defendánts were fortunate, since the jury, under the testimony, could very properly have fixed the death penalty for what the court below aptly described as a cruel, outrageous and inhuman crime. Defendants do not complain in their appeal to this court that there was not sufficient evidence to find a felonious homicide, but rather that the trial errors were so gross and flagrant as <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>to deprive them of an impartial trial by jury. It is our duty to review all the evidence to ascertain whether the elements of first degree murder are present; this we have done, but because of the scope of the Commonwealth’s case and appellants’ objections it will be necessary to set forth the essential outlines of the testimony.</p>

This evidence was objected to as introducing distinct crimes in connection with the specific crime on trial. This forms the chief ground of appellants’ complaint. If there was a scheme to insure and murder by the wholesale, technicalities should not prevent the State from showing it; but the conduct of this trial may be justified under the strictest rule.</p>

Where it appears that the other offenses, though distinct crimes, are in fact merely part of a larger field of operation, previously conceived and in part executed, the whole inquiry must be pursued to obtain a proper setting for the particular crime on trial. Such evidence must show some logical connection between the offenses, linking them together for a common purpose to be accomplished. There should be elements in common which logically and reasonably tend to establish a scheme or purpose not wholly covered or explained by evidence of the crime on trial. Then the circumstances in connection with the various killings may be so interwoven as to establish the common purpose and to show intent and motive also. This connection becomes clearer when it appears that it was necessary to kill the deceased whose death is the subject of inquiry in order to complete the common and continuous purpose of killing others. Where it appears that the common purpose could not be accomplished except by such killing, such killing, viewed in the light of related facts raising but one inference and <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>followed by evidence that this deduction is a fact, makes the entire scheme apparent and obvious, and the evidence is admissible.

The inquiry was no doubt precipitated by the insurance companies when Steve Allas’ brother, Andrew, died, heavily insured. As a result of the investigation defendants were charged with the murder of Steve Allas. The defendants, Czecho-Slovakians, were intimate friends for years. Anna Allas had been previously married to Joe Mantyo and shortly after his death had married George Allas who had been previously married. Two of the latter’s <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>children had been living with him; his other children were married and lived in their own homes. Steve, one of his children, continued to live with his father and stepmother after their marriage. He was twelve years of age, and a week or two before his death was a sturdy, active, athletic boy of ordinary intelligence. He was insured for $1,544: in the John Hancock Company, November 11,1931, for $980, and later in the Colonial Company for $564; his stepmother, Anna Allas, being named as beneficiary in both policies. Steve died December 2, 1931. The doctor certified that he died from concussion of the brain, but the autopsy, held pursuant to the investigation, showed a normal brain without injury. It also revealed the fact that Steve had been poisoned by what was described at the trial as soluble salts of tin in stannous condition, a rank poison which works insidiously by irritating the intestinal tract, causing cramps and convulsions, followed by a “terrible death,” as described' by one witness. This poison is not easily detected. One of the defendants; speaking of the difficulty of discovering the cause of death, said “If they take him out of the ground twenty times the American doctors cannot discover the poison.” Both defendants admitted they had poisoned Steve. Mary Chalía, who had unsuccessfully attempted to secure poison from a doctor, admitted that a white powder from a bottle labeled “Poison” had been used successfully in poisoning him. Mrs. Allas said the deadly mixture had been administered to Steve in tea and milk. Mrs. Chalía, while in the hospital, sent her daughter to her home with instructions to destroy this small bottle and hide some of the insurance policies. This was when the investigation was being conducted.</p>

A doctor had been called, but later Dr. Huff, the physician who treated all of the destroyed children mentioned in the evidence, took charge of this case. Not even he was present when the boy died. <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>Mrs. Chalfa seemed to be in charge. When the doctor left after his last visit to Steve, Mrs. Chalfa accompanied him to the door and on returning, reported to Mrs. Allas with a smile that Steve was going to die that night. The boy did die that night in great agony, turned blue and was crumpled up by convulsions. Mrs. Chalfa called the undertaker.</p>
    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[194,737,1155,742]]]'>Some circumstances transpiring after the death of Steve may be noted here. Defendants went to a man who made wooden crosses as head markers for graves; they bought four; the record shows the names of three persons for whom the markers were to be used. One was not named. Before defendants’ legal difficulties became active or suspicion had fastened on them, Mrs. Chalfa went to Philadelphia to consult her cousin, an attorney; she also called on Dr. Zeck concerning an article in a newspaper referring to her wanting to get medicine to poison her husband. They tried to get George Allas, a brother, to stop fussing about Andrew’s death. We will mention other circumstances as the evidence is further detailed.</p>

The premiums were paid by her, though the insurance agents were directed to send many of the premium notices to Mrs. Chalfa at her home since Mrs. Allas did not want her husband to learn of the situation. The fair inference from all the evidence is that the proceeds of the insurance on Steve’s life were necessary to purchase insurance on Andy’s life. The testimony of Mrs. Allas, one of the defendants, is conclusive on that question. She testified that she paid Andy’s insurance with the insurance money she received on Steve’s life: “Q. You received $1,544 from the insurance company after Steve Allas died, didn’t you? A. Yes. Q. And with that money you paid the premiums on the insurance on Andy Allas, didn’t you? A. Why, sure.

It establishes the common element and the need to secure that money so that the other members of the family might be insured.

In connection with Andy’s death, we have the same means employed, either causing or contributing to it, as in the case of Steve. He died in April, 1932, about <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>a month after he came to live at his father’s home, or about two months after his first policy was written. He was in good health the week before he died. He had never complained of his health. The autopsy and chemical analysis of portions of his body, revealed .the presence of soluble salts of tin in stannous condition. The physician testified that it was a contributing cause of his death. During his illness, as in Steve’s case, both defendants took charge of him though Mrs. Chalía took a more forward part. His brothers and sisters were not permitted to remain in the room during his illness nor were they permitted to get another physician. In fact they were ordered out of the room, and Mrs. Chalía at the time “got up in the air.” One of Steve’s brothers said: “I asked who the doctor was this time, and they said ‘Huff’; and I wanted to get a specialist for him, and Mary Chalía and my stepmother wouldn’t consent. I wanted him sent to the hospital.” “When I wanted a specialist Mary Chalía got up in the air and said, ‘Oh, no; you can’t change to another doctor. If you do, our doctor won’t sign.’ ” (Evidently referring to the death certificate for burial.) The same doctor who attended Steve attended Andy. The latter complained about the medicine and its effects, and the defendants admitted they had poisoned him, using the same kind of medicine that was used on Steve. His father knew little or nothing about the illness, as appears from a rather pathetic incident. His sister, in testifying, describing Andy’s dying moments, said: “......my brother was practically like dead, we saw no hope; and then they called for my dad......he came up and looked at him......and he started crying......I said, ‘Dad, why didn’t you let me know this boy was sick?’ I said ‘He could have died and I wouldn’t have known anything about it, only a strange woman let me know about it.’ And he said, ‘Oh, one brother left us (Steve), and I think the other brother is going to leave us too.’ ” The witness then fainted and <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>was taken away by her bnsband. Andy died as Steve died, in convulsions, turning blue, crumpled up.</p>

He was left by his young mother with Mary Chalfa on an agreement to pay $20 to $30 a month for his maintenance. This sum had been paid. Insurance of $150 was applied for by Stella Chalfa, whom Mrs. Chalfa had pose as the child’s mother, Mabel Bruner; Stella called herself Mabel Duyava. When the child died in March, 1932, Stella, still posing as mother, received the insurance check and turned it over to Mary Chalfa. After Steve’s death, in January and February, further insurance was taken out by Mary Chalfa, Stella again posing as the mother of the infant. When some of this insurance was taken out Mrs. Allas was present. Mary Chalfa admitted paying the premiums. She had the undertaker cash at least one, if not more, of the checks received from Richard’s death. The same undertaker issued two certificates, one for burial in the name of Duyava, and one for insurance purposes in the name of Chalfa. During the baby’s illness both defendants were in attendance administering the medicine and rubbing the child with some concoction which caused great pain. The same doctor attended Richard Duyava who had attended the other boys and the same undertaker buried all of them. The same kind of poison that was found in Andy’s body and Steve’s body was found in the body of this infant, and it was testified that the same kind of medicine that was given to Steve was given to this baby. In fact it was in this house that the bottle containing the poison was discovered and later destroyed.
