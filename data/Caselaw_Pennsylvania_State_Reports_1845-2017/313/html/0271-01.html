On August 21, 1922, Landis assigned the mortgage to <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>the Security Savings &amp; Trust Company of Erie, delivering the mortgage to it. Robacker, on March 9, 1923, reconveyed the land covered by the mortgage to Landis, who agreed to satisfy the mortgage; the deed, however, contained a clause by which Landis agreed to pay the mortgage debt of $3,500 as part of the consideration for the reconveyance. On March 15, 1924, Landis conveyed this land by general warranty deed to the Murphys. Before this conveyance was made Landis informed the Murphys that the property was clear and free of liens and furnished an abstract of title to show this. Murphys had to borrow to make the initial payment. Landis, before the conveyance, informed the attorney who examined the title that he Avould take the mortgage off:, that is, satisfy it. The money was advanced to Murphys on their mortgage. The Murphys paid to Landis the total purchase price of $5,400. The trust company held the assignment of the mortgage from August, 1922, to February, 1929, and then recorded it. A letter written to Murphy, notifying him of that fact, was the first notice that Murphy or Robacker had that the mortgage had been assigned and was not paid.</p>

To have attempted to do so would necessarily have been a fraud on the assignee: Roberts v. Halstead, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Pa.%2034" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Pa. 34">9 Pa. 34</a>, 35.

In order to complete the assignee’s right with respect to such an assignment, the law requires actual notice be given to the mortgagor of the assignment. The recording act imposes no duty on the mortgagor to search the record for the purpose of ascertaining whether the mortgagee has assigned the mortgage. To do so would impose too great a burden on the mortgagor.”</p>

It is always competent to show payment no matter who owns the mortgage, and this was done by Robacker. The jury found as a fact that the mortgage was paid. This would dispose of the case, but as appellant urges that the deed through which Robacker claims payment contains language that could be interpreted otherwise and the verdict of the jury was ineffective, we will further consider the questions involved.</p>

Nor has the question been decided as to the liability of such purchasers to pay the debt when they have bought from a mortgagee who is also the owner of the fee, without notice of the assignment of the mortgage. Had there been no assignment of the mortgage, there is no question but what there would have been a merger in fact, for where one who holds a mortgage, either as mortgagee or assignee, becomes the purchaser of the land covered by the mortgage, the latter is merged in the title.

Appellant says the provisions in the deed to Landis show that no payment could have been intended; that the deed was made subject to the mortgage which Landis was to pay, and that Murphy should have ascertained whether the mortgage was paid or not. Suppose this to be true, of whom would Murphy inquire to ascertain if the mortgage was paid? There were two persons on the record from whom this information might be procured: Robacker, the mortgagor, and Landis, the mortgagee. Robacker, who had a personal interest in its being paid, says that notwithstanding the deed the agreement was to the effect that the mortgage was part of the consideration for his reconveyance to Landis and was to be con<a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>sidered as paid. Landis, the mortgagee, and, from the record, the person vitally interested, tells his grantee that the mortgage was paid, the land free of encumbrances and everything clear. As stated by the court below, Landis said the debt was satisfied. Murphy, in examining the title, or Evans, the attorney who examined the title, found nothing but the mortgage standing in the name of Landis, the mortgagee, and the then owner of the property. The record undoubtedly shows an open mortgage unpaid. It also shows that Landis, the mortgagee, was the owner of the mortgage, and he stated it was paid. The purchaser had no means whatever of knowing whether he was lying, or that any other person had any interest in the mortgage. There was no other source from which the purchaser could secure his information. It is urged that Murphy should have demanded production of the mortgage. True he might have done so but we need not decide this interesting question, for there are other circumstances, later discussed, which bear heavily in exculpating him in connection with this failure to require production of the mortgage.</p>

The assignment in possession of the assignee, while evidencing a valid interest between the parties directly affected, was, as to Murphy, an innocent purchaser, a secret lien or interest. As stated in Brown v. Simpson, <a href="/watts/2/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Watts 233" data-case-ids="1840168" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0233-01">supra,</a> at page 245. “Secret liens or trusts are not to be encouraged upon any species of property whatever; but in no case can such a thing prevail as to real estate against an innocent purchaser of it for a full and valuable consideration without notice, unless our recording acts are to be overturned and set aside.” This statement is reiterated in Frank v. Guarantee Trust Co., supra, at page 52, where the court quotes from Logan v. Eva, <a href="/pa/144/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="144 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="823802" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0312-01">144 Pa. 312</a>: “it is well settled that a purchaser of land is unaffected by a secret trust or equity unknown to him, and that he may <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>pass title thereto, untranameled by the trust, to a person who has notice of it.” The instant case bears some analogy to Brown v. Simpson, <a href="/watts/2/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Watts 233" data-case-ids="1840168" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0233-01">supra.</a> In that case, in 1817 S. mortgaged property to BA. to secure the payment of several bonds. BA. assigned one of the bonds to F., who later assigned it to X. In July, 1819, X. obtained a judgment against S. on the bond. Prior to that time, however, or in June, 1819, a bank secured a judgment against S., and the property of S. covered by the mortgage, was sold to BA., the mortgagee named in the mortgage of 1817. The sheriff’s deed to BA., however, recited that it was subject to that mortgage. Later the title became vested in Dr. Simpson, and on his death, in his son, William. X. pursued his judgment by scire facias, and the lands in the possession of William Simpson were levied on for sale. Simpson had this judgment opened and the question arose as to whether or not there was a merger when the property covered by the mortgage was conveyed by sheriff’s sale under another judgment to the mortgagee. The court held there was a merger and the mortgage was extinguished, though the sale under which William Simpson claimed was made to BA. subject to the mortgage.</p>

Landis perpetrated a fraud on both appellant and appellee, but who made it possible for such fraud to be perpetrated? Which of the parties by a very simple act could have or should have prevented it by placing the assignment on record? Appellant bought the mortgage in good faith and appel<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>lee did likewise as to the real estate. Did appellant unwittingly do anything to facilitate the perpetration of this fraud by Landis? As stated above, Landis had been dealing in real estate, borrowing money and pledging mortgages by assignment; evidently he conducted some considerable business. He took to the bank assignments of mortgages and, according to the testimony of the bank, he was permitted to treat these mortgages very much as he pleased; he was allowed to “deal with the mortgages largely according to his convenience.’7 No doubt because of this authorization, the bank did not follow the usual practice of recording assignments. Landis did deal with the mortgages as suited his convenience. It suited him to deal with the mortgage by making the representation of payment to Murphy. The bank thus unwittingly permitted Landis to overreach his vendee. Murphy relied on his representation. When Landis represented to Murphy that these debts were paid, he was dealing with the mortgage. He was procuring a benefit. At that time he may have expected to make good, but, if he did not, the bank should not be heard to complain against an innocent purchaser who has been misled by its act.</p>

Y. 159</a>, did not involve the very important feature present in the instant case of the purchaser and the attorney inquiring of the grantor-mortgagee as to whether or not a mortgage still existed and the debt unpaid. In both cases the purchaser had no actual knowledge of the existence of the mortgage. In such a situation it may well be that the purchaser is held strictly to the recorded title and that any outstanding mortgage would bind the land even in his hands.</p>

D. obtained judgment against L. which was assigned to S. S. sold the land on this judgment and at the sheriff’s sale S. bought the property subject to the above mentioned ground rents. S. in 1880 borrowed from Frank, giving a mortgage on the land to secure the debt, the mortgage covering the same property as the ground rents and the mortgage of L. covered.

The first written evidence of Mary [Penrose’s]......interest in the rents is the agreement of June 1, 1881, a year after Stover had mortgaged the land to Frank. There is no allegation that Frank had any knowledge of the ownership of the rents other than what the record disclosed, which was that the title was in Stover. When Frank took the mortgage on the land from Stover in 1880, with full covenants and without excepting therefrom the ground rents, the record owner of both the land and the rents was Stover. This under all the authorities was an extinguishment of the rents, or a merger of them in the title to the land held by Stover......
