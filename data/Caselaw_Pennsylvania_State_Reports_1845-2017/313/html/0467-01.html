For some years before October, 1929, and while president of the bank, he had been “engaged,” as the chancellor found, “in the business of and transactions in buying and selling securities for profit and continued to conduct the said business transactions until his death.” Not only was much of this business highly speculative, but part of it was unlawful, and the fact must be accepted, that this experienced bank president knew that his conduct was unlawful. The chancellor made a finding, showing details, that the bank, beginning July 30, 1929, and continuing for more than a year, under the donor’s direction, was engaged in buying shares of its own stock and carrying the purchases as “cash items”; this was done, in the words of the finding, “for the purpose of supporting the market for said stock.” Those transactions were unlawful (12 U. S. C. A., section 83) and ground for prosecution (Morse v. U. S., <a href="/f/174/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="174 F. 539" data-case-ids="6750068" data-case-paths="/f/174/0539-01">174 Fed. 539</a>, 544 et seq.). What was his purpose in “supporting <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>the market for said stock”? The answer stands out clearly in the light of the fact that, in October, all his shares of the bank’s stock (and indeed all his other securities except shares in a club) were pledged for his loans payable on demand. Not only was he interested in keeping up the market price of the bank shares for purposes of collateral, but the evidence discloses another reason which must have given him serious concern: he was vitally interested in preventing public discovery that his bank stock had little or no intrinsic value; and for a while he succeeded. It is not difficult to understand what would have happened to his loans, and, doubtless, to his bank, if its true condition had not been concealed. Early in October, 1929, before the conveyance of these three policies, national bank examiners made an examination and (as stated in the finding) “assets of the bank were criticized in aggregate approximate amounts as follows: Slow $5,300,000. Doubtful $702,000. Estimated losses $302,000. At the time of these examiners’ report the capital stock of the bank consisted of 60,000 shares of the par value of $50 each or $3,000,000. The surplus was $3,000,000 and the undivided profits and the reserves were approximately $2,300,000.” There is another finding that in May, 1928, the report of the bank examiners “showed assets then under criticism in the approximate amount of $2,800,000. This was in excess of all undivided profits and reserves which aggregated approximately $2,035,000.” At this time, too, there was dissension among the bank directors.</p>

In view of the conclusion we have reached, we merely note at this point that there was error in finding the “fair salable value” instead of the “present fair <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>salable value” as provided in tbe statute.

As the 'subject of inquiry was the donor’s knowledge, motive and conduct in the circumstances, his knowledge of the actual value was of significant importance. The chancellor said: “Testimony as to the actual value of the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association stock was excluded and the evidence was confined to the testimony as to the public and private market and opinion evidence. In the light of future events which cannot be considered in determining this question it may be doubted whether the Bank of Pittsburgh National Association stock had any actual value during the periods under consideration, but that it had a market value we have no doubt......”</p>

Some of them were highly speculative and others salable only in restricted markets. On October 8th, his indebtedness on demand paper was over $1,460,000; by October 26th, it exceeded $1,500,000. Between September 16th and October 2, 1929, he borrowed over $270,000, of which more than $120,000 came from his own bank.

One of the findings is that from June 1, 1929, to August 28, 1929, “the market......was to a considerable degree what has been called a rigged market owing to the opera<a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>tions of a pool which had been formed to deal in said stock of which pool [Nesbit’s bank] represented by Nesbit, was a member.

By the operations and manipulations of this pool the price of the common stock...... was inflated on the market until it reached $84 per share on or about August 28, 1929, and in this way practically all of the holders of the said issue of preferred stock were induced to exchange their shares for common stock.”</p>

For some time the merger of that company with others had been under consideration. The chancellor said: “There is also testimony that Nesbit was a bull on the Weirton Steel stock in September, 1929, holding it for $1,000 per share when it was selling for $500 to $600 per share.” The terms of the merger were disappointing to the donor. The chancellor found that on October 8, 1929, the “fair salable value” of the stock was $375 per share.</p>

S. 348</a>, 354), and the record shows the hopeless struggle to keep afloat. Less than three weeks after conveying the third policy, he borrowed 1,000 shares of Copper-weld Steel Company stock, had them transferred to his own name and assigned them to a bank as collateral for a loan. He was never able to return that stock. On January 8,1930, he borrowed 2,000 more shares of the stock, <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>pledged it for Ms debts, and was never able to return it. In July, 1930, he borrowed 1,000 shares of Pittsburgh Screw, etc., Company stock, and, in October, 1930, 400 shares of Columbia Cas &amp; Electric Company stock; both blocks of stock were pledged for loans and were never returned. In the case of each of those borrowings, the chancellor finds that the donor was “pressed for additional collateral.” In April, both in 1930 and in 1931, he borrowed from the insurers on the three insurance policies issued in 1929 (taken down from the trust agreement under his reserved powers) more than $21,000, all that the insurance companies would lend; and it is to be noted that these were advances on the proceeds ultimately payable, and that he could not be required to repay them. On other insurance policies, between March, 1930, and July, 1931, he likewise obtained over $56,000. Though all these transactions followed the conveyances, the short interval, large amounts, continuous transactions and the constant decline indicate a disturbing unsoundness of condition in October of which he must have been conscious. On November 12, 1930, he borrowed $200,000 from his bank on a demand note signed by his wife but guaranteed by him. When she was sued on the note, she successfully defended on the ground that she signed for her husband’s accommodation. It may be noted at this point, as reflecting the donor’s condition during the period from October onward, that the chancellor finds that on June 5, 1930, the donor’s assets, át valuations made by the chancellor, exceeded his liabilities by only $45,904 and that on that date “the property in the hands of Nesbit was an unreasonably small capital for the conduct of his business of, and transactions in, buying and selling securities for profit......” But, when the amount at which the Bank of Pittsburgh stock was taken for the purposes of that balance sheet, $262,-400, is deducted, as it should be, and the liabilities are also increased by the shareholder’s assessment, it will be seen how hopelessly insolvent the donor then was; the <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>subject is now referred to, merely to show the chancellor’s view of the change of the donor’s condition between October, 1929, and the following June.</p>

Each policy was a chose in action, an obligation to pay the insured’s legal representatives on his death, if he complied with the conditions of the policy.

It dealt with the general subject of insolvency and, specifically, with various elements of that subject, some within the scope of the Bankrupt Act, and some without. The title gives notice of this. It is “An act relating to insolvency; embracing, among other matters, voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors, and adverse proceedings in insolvency by creditors; forbidding, also, certain preferences; providing for the distribution of the insolvent’s estate, and in certain contingencies relieving him, and others liable with him, from further liability for his or their debts.” The right, solvent or insolvent, to make a voluntary assignment for creditors is not dependent on statute, but is an incident of ownership. Assignment for the benefit of others creates a trust which would be administered on equitable principles in the absence of statute. Legislative provision for the administration of such assignment is therefore not necessarily an encroachment on thé federal field; whether it is or not depends on the text of the statutes; that is also true of the administration of preferences. Provisions for the discharge of an insolvent from liability for his debts are in a different category (Hanover Nat. Bank v. Moyses, <a href="/us/186/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="186 U.S. 181" data-case-ids="3623104" data-case-paths="/us/186/0181-01">186 U.

There is no obstacle to the separation of one class of provisions in the act from the other.</p>

A comparison of the voluntary assignment provisions of the Act of 1901 with prior acts, repealed by section 42, shows that provisions of the Act of 1901 were intended to be in substitution and revision of the earlier acts specifically repealed, and indicates legislative intention that the repeal of legislation, not within the purview of the Bankrupt Act, should become effective at once. The Act of 1843 was not a bankrupt act; the repeal is therefore effective. Section 3 of the Act of 1901 provides that a preferential assignment shall act as an assignment of all the debtor’s estate; such an assignment is also contrary to the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.</p>

One of the conditions of the donor’s gift was that, by the exercise of power expressly reserved, he might destroy altogether the expectancy of his wife and children. By the Ohio bank agreement, he diminished the contingent beneficial interest theretofore conferred on his family, and subordinated that interest in the insurance proceeds to the extent of the loan and interest.</p>
    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[172,1591,1160,804]],["BL_514.1",514,[267,333,1155,908]]]'>The situation, presented by the Ohio bank agreement, was this: in the collateral, the donor had an equity, the value of which depended on whether he paid the note, or, if the collateral was foreclosed, whether it realized more than the debt. As the bank held the collateral at the time of the donor’s death, that equity then passed to his personal representatives. The collateral was afterward sold by the bank for less than the debt, the equity had no value to the estate and ceased to be an element in the problem with which we are now dealing. While the statute exempts insurance payable to the family, it does not exempt proceeds payable to a creditor or creditors and the family; the creditor’s interest is not exempt. The Ohio bank agreement was a conveyance, to the bank, of an interest in the proceeds expected to come into the <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>hands of the trustees; the value of the right was the face of the note with interest. Though it turned out that the bank did not realize on the conveyance, the failure to obtain the value which the donor had carved out of what was once an expectancy provided for his family alone, did not revest that interest in the family. It remained where it was, an asset of the donor, which on his death passed to his personal representatives in such amount as the bank might have claimed. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to that interest in the proceeds. There was error in awarding to the plaintiff merely the difference between the note, with interest, and the stipulated value of the collateral; for the reasons stated, the entire amount must be awarded to the plaintiff. This amount is $200,000 with interest from the date to which it has been paid, to October 21, 1931, the date of the donor’s death, but no longer, as the estate is insolvent.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[263,1252,1157,1129]],["BL_515.1",515,[186,330,1156,1186]]]'>The next situation to be considered grows out of action by the donor in April, and in July, 1931, when he was insolvent. Exercising the reserved power to modify or revoke the insurance trust agreement, on April 22,1931, he requested a change of beneficiary of a certain policy in the sum of $10,000 from the trustees to his estate. The change was made and endorsed on the policy April 25, 1931. Thereafter, perhaps on the same date, the beneficiary was again changed from his estate to the trustees. On or about July 24, 1931, he requested another insurer to change the beneficiary in a policy in the sum of $25,000 from the trustees to his estate; the change was made and endorsed on the policy on or about that date. Subsequently on July 30,1931, he caused the beneficiary under this policy to be changed from his estate to the trustees. It is said that these changes were made to enable him to borrow money, though there is evidence that he could have done that without making the changes. The reason or motive for the change does not appear; we can deal only with the fact that it was made. After his death, the trustees received $4,132.37 as the net proceeds of the first <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>policy, and $19,189.41 as the net proceeds of the second policy, in each case, the face of the policy, less loans or advances to the donor. The question now is whether the proceeds of these policies, which, for the short period indicated, had been payable to his estate, and which, while insolvent, he appointed to the trustees, should go to the plaintiff for creditors, or whether, having once become an expectancy, liable for debts, the rights of creditors may be defeated by the conveyance to the trustees. The learned court below said, “The estate of Harrison Nesbit was not decreased by these changes of beneficiary.” It is certain, if the donor had not made the last change of beneficiary, that the proceeds would have gone to plaintiff as the personal representative of the decedent. There was no consideration for diverting the course of the proceeds from his estate. Once an expectancy in the estate, they remain so for all purposes (subject only to the conditions of the policies), unless properly conveyed for fair consideration. As the donor was insolvent, the conveyance is within the statute (Mc-Kown’s Est., supra; Huff’s Est., supra) and the trustees are not entitled to receive the proceeds.</p>
    <p id="b515-3" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[183,1526,1156,860]],["BL_516.1",516,[254,334,1156,1346]]]'>Finally, plaintiff claims the entire proceeds on the ground that the insurance trusts were testamentary because of the large powers reserved to the donor and an alleged desire to have the proceeds applied for the benefit of his general estate. It is said that the agreements “vested no present interest in anyone but Harrison Nesbit and only appointed [pointed out] what was to be done after his death.” But as the beneficiary-trustee had an expectancy in the insurance proceeds which would become the res of the trust, this objection must be rejected: Johnson v. Scott, 76 N. Y. Misc. 641, <a href="/nys/137/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="137 N.Y.S. 243" data-case-ids="7656195" data-case-paths="/nys/137/0243-01">137 N. Y. Supp. 243</a>; cf. Beirne v. Continental-Equitable Trust Co., <a href="/pa/307/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="307 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1138144" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0570-01">307 Pa. 570</a>, 576, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%20721" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="161 A. 721">161 A. 721</a>. When the donor executed the agreements, he also executed wills, said to contain trust provisions, for his estate, similar in character to those declared in the agreement for the insurance, and ap<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>pointed the same parties as executors and trustees. The insurance trustees were empowered to “purchase stocks, bonds or other property, real or personal, from the executors or other representatives of the donor’s estate, or ......make such loans to them, which loans may be secured or unsecured” without personal liability for loss. Even if this indicated, as appellant contends, an effort to facilitate, or otherwise benefit, the administration of his estate, it does not make the agreement testamentary, or deprive the proceeds of their exempt character: Cf. Blumberg v. Coxe, 8 Fed. (2d) 735. The record shows that the donor did not intend to deprive his family of the benefit of the insurance except as to the interest granted to the Ohio bank; leave to invest in nonlegal securities is consistent with the donor’s wish to aid his family and not to unite the proceeds with his estate. In determining whether an instrument is testamentary, intention is important (Beirne v. Continental-Equitable Trust Co., <a href="/pa/307/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="307 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1138144" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0570-01">307 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%20721" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="161 A. 721">161 A. 721</a>; Kimmel’s Est., <a href="/pa/278/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="278 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1080500" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0435-01">278 Pa. 435</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20405" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="123 A. 405">123 A. 405</a>; Davis’s Est., <a href="/pa/275/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="275 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="1075682" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0126-01">275 Pa. 126</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.%20645" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="118 A. 645">118 A. 645</a>; Windolph v.
