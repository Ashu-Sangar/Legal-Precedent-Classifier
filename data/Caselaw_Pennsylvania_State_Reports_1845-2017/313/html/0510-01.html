The sheriff returned nihil habet as to defendant, that he had attached the real estate described in the praecipe, and had served Prank J. Coll and Joseph Lekiela, tenants in possession. No affidavit of cause of action was filed. With their praecipe for the writ, plaintiffs also filed a statement of claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

April 4, 1933, defendant, by petition, obtained a rule to show cause why the writ “should not abate and the lien of attachment on the property of the defendant in the hands of the garnishees should not cease and the proceedings be dissolved and ended.” The petition alleges that the writ issued without an affidavit of cause of action; <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>that the statement of claim, filed with the praecipe for the writ, cannot be treated as the required affidavit, because it contains no averment that defendant is nonresident, or absent from the county and seized of property here (Morinelli v. Garin Co., <a href="/pa-super/100/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="100 Pa. Super. 510" data-case-ids="691247" data-case-paths="/pa-super/100/0510-01">100 Pa. Superior Ct. 510</a>, 514). The petition also avers that no copy of the statement of claim was served on defendant or her attorney, and that, for want of prosecution within the terms of the Act of May 12, 1897, P. L. 62, 12 P. S., section 2961, defendant is entitled to the relief prayed for. In disposing of the petition and rule, the court made the following order: “Rule absolute to dissolve attachment and abate lien.” The plaintiffs have appealed. We understand that the order was intended to abate the lien on the real estate and to annul the garnishment of the tenants, but, from what is said in the opinion filed below, that the court did not intend to prevent further prosecution of the suit in personam.</p>

(See Act of March 5,1925, P. L. 23, section 1, 12 P. S., section 672.) The Act of May 12, 1897, P. L. 62, section 1, 12 P. S., section 2961, requires a plaintiff “within one year after the issuance of the writ [to] file a statement of his or their cause of action,” which means a formal statement of claim. See Pottash v.

    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[151,1203,1159,688]]]'>The purpose of seizing property by writ of foreign attachment is to compel appearance: Rankin v.

That object was accomplished when defendant entered a general appearance; the statute contemplated this and provided the effect it should have. Section 64 of the Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 568, 12 P. S., section 2966, authorizes defendant “to cause an appearance to be entered for him, and to take defense to the action, in which case the action shall proceed as if commenced by a summons, but the attachment shall nevertheless continue to bind the estate or effects attached, as in other cases, unless judgment be entered for the defendant in such attachment.”</p>

She might have dissolved the writ of attachment by entering security, in which case the action would have proceeded, the bail taking the place of the attached property; or, desiring not to enter security and substitute a bond for the property, she could enter a general appearance, and, as the statute provided, “take defense to the action,” which then would “proceed as if commenced by a summons.” <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>On the choice of this course, however, the legislature imposed a condition in the following words: “but the attachment shall nevertheless continue to bind the estate or the effects attached as in other cases unless......,” supra. This defendant, instead of substituting security for the attached property and proceeding in personam, chose another course, at the price, however, of submitting to the attachment pendente lite. A third course had also been open to her election: before deciding to give bail and dissolve the attachment, or to permit the attachment to stand and enter a general appearance, she might, if in doubt about the jurisdiction, have proceeded by rule to show cause to require plaintiffs to file the necessary affidavit. As this affidavit of cause of action goes to the propriety of issuing the writ, its requirement may be waived by electing either of the other statutory courses referred to. Defendant’s choice of procedure continued the attachment, leaving no occasion to require plaintiffs to show cause of action, because the statute has rendered it unnecessary. See Pottash v.
