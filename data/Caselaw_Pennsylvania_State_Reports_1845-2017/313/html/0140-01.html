Reese was elected a director of the poor of Schuylkill County for a term of four years commencing January, 1932 (Com. ex rel. v. Reese et al., <a href="/pa/293/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="293 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="1111153" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0398-01">293 Pa. 398</a>). He died in office, April 11, 1933. On April 13, 1933, the county commissioners, acting under the provisions of section 11 of the Act of April 4, 1831, P. L. 422, appointed relator Edward P. White to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Reese; White thereupon entered upon the duties of the office. On April 20, 1933, the court of common pleas appointed respondent Charles F. Miller to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term of Reese, this appointment being made under section 1 of the Act of June 12, 1907, P. L. 529. Both acts above referred to are special legislation and apply only to Schuylkill <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>County. White contends the Act of 1907 (under which Miller was appointed) is unconstitutional, and that he (White) is the lawful appointee to the vacancy under section 11 of the Act of 1831, supra.</p>
    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[270,556,1150,358]]]'>The court below held the Act of 1907 is constitutional, and that it repealed the inconsistent provisions of the Act of 1831, consequently the county commissioners were without power to appoint relator a director of the poor and the power of appointment to the vacancy rested in the court of common pleas. Judgment, accordingly, was entered for defendant.</p>
    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.6",168,[318,935,458,34]]]'>The Act of 1907 reads:</p>

Any vacancy occurring in the office of director of the poor shall be filled by the court of common pleas of the County of Schuylkill, by the appointment of an elector of the said county who shall have voted for the director of the poor whose place is to be filled.”</blockquote>

Appellant asserts the title of the Act of 1907 is an index to its contents, and is misleading in that it does not express or embrace all of the subjects of the legislation embodied in the act.</p>

If the title fairly gives notice of the subject of the act, so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into the body of the same, it is all that is necessary: Graeff v.

This is the rule established by all our cases. It is an application of the maxim expressio unius exclusio alterius. The express enumeration of the specific subjects must be affirmatively misleading as to the intent to exclude others, or the title will not be made invalid by it”: Sugar Notch Boro., <a href="/pa/192/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="192 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="908988" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0349-01">192 Pa. 349</a>, 353. Quoting these words, the court below states that, “Tested by these principles, the title to the Act of 1907 is not affirmatively misleading because there is nothing in it to indicate that the subject of filling vacancies is excluded...... This is incidental to the general subject and it is not necessary to recite it in the title: Sloan v. Longcope [<a href="/pa/288/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="288 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1100769" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0196-01">288 Pa. 196</a>], page 202.”</p>

Miller, <a href="/pa/237/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="237 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="988993" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0297-01">237 Pa. 297</a>, 302; Bridgeford v.

    <p id="b171-3" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[165,670,1154,524]]]'>We concur in the judgment of the court below, holding constitutional the Act of June 12, 1907, P.

Respondent was properly appointed by the court of common pleas to fill the existing vacancy and is lawfully a director of the poor of Schuylkill County for the unexpired term of Frank A. Reese, deceased.</p>
