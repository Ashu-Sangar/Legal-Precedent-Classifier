If this was a misstatement of fact that might be considered prejudicial, counsel should have called the attention of the court to it for correction before the jury retired. But it is not clear that it was a mistake; the murderers broke their black jack on the head of the woman and then descended to the cellar and “found an iron down there,” and, returning to the woman’s room (in the words of the statement to the officers, put in evidence) “we socked the girl with the iron.” At this point in the narrative, Tetrosky interrupted with, “You did not hit her with the iron,” and appellant added, “I did not hit her with the iron.” The jury was, however, specifically instructed that it must be governed by its own recollection of the evidence and not by that of the judge.

You are not bound by any opinion the court may have expressed.” An expression of opinion, so qualified, is not improper: Com. v. Nafus, <a href="/pa/303/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="303 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1130031" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0418-01">303 Pa. 418</a>, 420, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20485" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="154 A. 485">154 A. 485</a>.</p>

The only witness who testified for defendant was a physician. The court did not minimize the effect of this physician’s testimony. He was called as an expert and testified concerning his examination of appellant, gave his sources of information, etc., and the opinion formed by him. He testified that appellant “began — he is beginning to show a split personality, and I felt he was beginning to show evidences of an incipient schizophrenia, with the psychopathic tendency, and therefore I combined the two words, a schizophrenic-psychopath.” He also said that disease is “not an insanity.” The commission of the crime was not denied and it was not claimed that appellant was insane when the crime was committed or when arraigned and tried. The jury was instructed that the doctor testified “that this defendant could distinguish between light and wrong, but the defendant was only partially responsible.” Two points for charge, presented on behalf of appellant, were affirmed, as follows:</p>

L. 759, 18 PS 2222. This complaint is presented in the sixth assignment of error: “We offer to prove by this witness [appellant’s mother] facts in the history and behavior of the defendant, on the basis of which facts, together with other facts which will be testified to by other witnesses, and together with an examination of the defendant, and an observation of his conduct in court, and after hearing all of the evidence presented here in court today, Dr. Winkelman will state that in his opinion the defendant, at the time of the alleged occurrence for which the defendant is now on trial, and for some time prior thereto, was and now is a schizophrenic-psychopath, and therefore irresponsible for his actions.” The offer was so defective in substance as to justify the court in sustaining the Commonwealth’s objection. What were the facts which it was proposed to prove? Instead of offering merely to prove facts “on the basis of which together with other facts which will be testified to by other witnesses......,” there should have been a brief statement of the facts proposed to be proved so that the court could determine whether they were relevant, for, unless relevant, they could not be received. And it is to be noted, so far as the offer referred to Dr. Winkel<a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>man’s “observation of [appellant’s] conduct in court,’’ that the appellant had the benefit of it, because the doctor testified that his opinion was in part based on his observation of the defendant in court. The doctor also stated that he had considered the history of the appellant as received from his parents. It was not an offer of evidence, in part relevant and in part irrelevant, which, in a prosecution for homicide, might require the judge to separate the good from the bad (cf. Com. v. Colandro, <a href="/pa/231/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="231 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="973928" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0343-01">231 Pa. 343</a>, 348, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.%20571" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="80 A. 571">80 A. 571</a>) but an offer that gave no indication of relevance. The record appears to show that the judge thought that counsel proposed to submit lay evidence of insanity, although the defense of insanity was not made, and suggested that the lay witness be called after the doctor had testified. The doctor testified that appellant was suffering from the mental disease described but was not insane within the rule applied in criminal prosecutions in this State. Counsel for appellant said: “We do not rely upon the testimony of Dr. Winkelman to excuse the crime, but we do rely upon it — we do think it ought to be submitted to the jury for the purpose of measuring the punishment that might be imposed upon — they might in fact impose upon the defendant, in fairness and mercy. The court: Then the sole purpose of Dr. Winkelman’s testimony is for mitigation of penalty? Mr. Walsh: Yes. The court: And for no other purpose. Mr. Walsh: No.”</p>

As it is our firm opinion that such an independent inquiry is not permissible under the Act of 1925, we did not allow the Commonwealth to offer rebuttal evidence on the defendant’s mental condition, thereby joining issue other than the one framed by the indictment and the plea of the defendant. True, our courts have admitted evidence of prior convictions, but to permit, under the Act of 1925, an issue of mere mental weakness may result in opening a large domain wherein maudlin sympathy will reign and justice perish......”</p>

But we must take this opportunity of saying that we differ from the view of the learned trial judge that appellant was not entitled to have the doctor’s evidence go to the jury, as it did, in possible mitigation of penalty. The Act of 1925<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> imposes on the jury a specific duty, — the duty of fixing the penalty by its verdict. As the penalty may be death or life imprisonment, a serious responsibility devolves on the jury; to perform its duty, the jury is entitled to be informed. Since the passage of the statute, this court has affirmed convictions with the death penalty in which not only prior convictions of other crimes were put in evidence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> but in which alleged confessions of other offenses were received.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This procedure is necessary, as was said in Com. v.
