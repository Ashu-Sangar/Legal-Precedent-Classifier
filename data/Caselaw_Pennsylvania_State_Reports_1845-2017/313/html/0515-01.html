    <p id="b542-10" data-blocks='[["BL_542.16",542,[279,1322,1154,475]]]'>After appellees, husband and wife, obtained judgment against Madonti for damages resulting from his negligent automobile driving, they brought in the appellant as garnishee by attachment sur judgment. The trial on the issues then made by plaintiffs’ interrogatories and appellant’s answers, resulted in judgments against appellant, from which it now appeals. The single question is, did appellant have notice of the suit against Madonti as conditioned by the contract?</p>
    <p id="b542-11" data-blocks='[["BL_542.17",542,[281,1809,1152,207]],["BL_543.1",543,[162,347,1153,207]]]'>Appellant had issued its policy to one Nelson, indemnifying against liability (West v. MacMillan, <a href="/pa/301/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="301 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1126404" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0344-01">301 Pa. 344</a>) on certain conditions. Paragraph 8, entitled “Omnibus Coverage,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> extended the insurance to anyone <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>“legally operating” the automobile “with the permission of” Nelson. He loaned the car to Madonti, who thus became an insured. The judgment against Madonti established his negligence and plaintiffs’ damage.</p>
    <p id="b543-3" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[158,567,1158,1512]],["BL_544.1",544,[270,342,1152,477]]]'>We then inquire whether appellant had proper notice. Condition B required the assured (a term including Madonti, see omnibus clause, supra) to “give immediate written notice of any accident, and like notice of any claim or suit resulting therefrom, together with every summons or other process, [to appellant] or to its authorized representative.” The accident happened January 19, 1930. January 20, 1930, notice was given to and received by appellant, which promptly made an investigation of the occurrence. Plaintiffs brought suit against Nelson to June Term, 1930; appellant was duly notified, and caused its attorney to enter an appearance for Nelson, as required by the policy. That case has not been tried. April 28, 1931, the present suit was brought against Madonti. Plaintiffs’ attorneys, by letter dated June 23, 1931, notified appellant of the suit, with a reference to the court record, advising that the suit was for the injury sustained January 19,1930, referring to plaintiffs’ other suit against Nelson as continued for the purpose of the appointment of a guardian ad litem for Nelson, and stating that liability was claimed under the “omnibus coverage” quoted above. Appellant contends that it was not required to pay any attention to notice from plaintiffs’ attorneys; that notice must come from the assured. Madonti’s negligence brought plaintiffs within the class of beneficiary contemplated by, and with a conditional right in, the policy. As one of the conditions required notice to be given and as plaintiffs had be<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>come entitled to performance by appellant, they must be treated as authorized to comply with the condition and to give any notice required, or, indeed, to perform any other condition, breach of which by the assured, would destroy plaintiffs’ right to performance by the insurer.

The statement of claim was not filed until August-19, 1931, when it was also served on Madonti, a date nearly two months after appellant had already been notified of the suit. On January 27, 1932, an effort was made to bring the appellant on the record as party defendant; appellant then appeared and denied plaintiffs’ right to make it a party, as proposed. Plaintiffs’ suit against Madonti was not tried until October 3, 1932, more than ten months after appellant received the copy of the statement of claim, more than a year after it received notice of the suit, and nearly two years after it received notice of the accident and made its investigation.</p>
