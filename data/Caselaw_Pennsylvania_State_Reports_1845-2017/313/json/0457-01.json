        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nRiggs, appellant, was the confederate of Skawinski, in whose appeal an opinion was filed today [see page 453]. After he aimed his revolver at the manager of the store, demanding that the manager \u201cstick \u2019em up,\u201d he observed Skawinski and Roberts struggling, and went to Skawinski\u2019s aid, struck Roberts on the head with his revolver once or twice, breaking the revolver, and then made his escape. He signed a confession, and on the stand also admitted participation in the attempted robbery and in the other \u201choldups\u201d referred to in the opinion in Skawinski\u2019s appeal. He was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death.\nAppellant complains that a change of venue was refused. His petition was considered at the same time and as part of the motion made by Skawinski. As there was no abuse of discretion, we must dismiss the assignment on the authority of the cases cited in Skawinski\u2019s appeal ; and, in this record, as in that, it is to be noted that there is no suggestion of prejudice of the character anticipated in the conduct of the trial. In addition to the reasons cited on behalf of Skawinski, an additional reason is presented by this appellant. Skawinski\u2019s trial began May 22d; the verdict was rendered May 24th. Appellant\u2019s trial began May 29th. Appellant now contends that, as his trial followed Skawinski\u2019s, and as the panel was exhausted in obtaining the jury which tried him, he is within section 1, paragraph 4, of the Act of March 18, 1875, P. L. 30,19 P. S., section 551, providing: \u201cThat in criminal prosecutions the venue may be changed on application of the defendant or defendants in the following cases:...... Fourth. When upon a second trial of any felonious homicide the evidence on the former trial thereof shall have been published within the county in which the same is being tried and the regular panel of jurors shall be exhausted without obtaining a jury.\u201d The \u201csecond trial\u201d referred to is a retrial of a defendant on an indictment on which he has been tried before, not a trial of another defendant for the same homicide. Compare Com. v. Cleary, 148 Pa. 26, 23 A. 1110.\nObjections are also made to the charge. Appellant contends that the learned trial judge gave probative value to the arguments of the district attorney in reviewing the testimony, by expressions such as: \u201cthe Commonwealth calls your attention to......\u201d; \u201cthe district attorney calls yonr attention to the testimony......\u201d; and \u201cthe district attorney answers......\u201d This contention is without merit, as the conrt reviewed defendant\u2019s testimony in the same way, saying: \u201cIn this case as in every other case that comes to trial there are two sides\u201d; \u201cthe defendant here denies his guilt......\u201d; \u201che says that he is not guilty......\u201d; \u201cthe defendant\u2019s counsel on the other hand argues......\u201d If more reference was made to the Commonwealth\u2019s case, it was because more evidence was offered on that side. See Com. v. Mika, 171 Pa. 273, 33 A. 65; Com. v. Razmus, 210 Pa. 609, 612, 60 A. 264; Com. v. Russogulo, 263 Pa. 93, 101, 106 A. 180. We must also reject the contention that there was over-emphasis on defendant\u2019s participation in the crime.\nAnother assignment complains that the judge said that defendant made a \u201cdetailed statement admitting the crime with which he was charged in the indictment.\u201d But the charge clearly shows that the judge did not mean that defendant admitted that he was guilty of murder in the first degree: Cf. Com. v. Exler, 243 Pa. 155, 157, 89 A. 968; Com. v. Berkenbush, 267 Pa. 455, 110 A. 263. The jury could only understand the statement to mean that the defendant admitted his participation in the occurrence in the manner described by himself and other witnesses and charged in the indictment. Taken with the whole charge, the statement was not prejudicial: Com. v. Johnson, 279 Pa. 40, 123 A. 638. Appellant says that the court failed to define robbery. If defendant had suggested, in defense, that he and Skawinski were not engaged in attempting to rob, there might be merit in the objection; but he frankly testified that they went into the store for the express purpose of committing a robbery. We do not say that, in homicide resulting in the perpetration of felonies, as described in the statute, the court need never define the felony; as the case was presented by both sides, there was not, and could not be, any dispute about defendant\u2019s purpose: Com. v. Manfredi, 162 Pa. 144, 148, 29 A. 404. Indeed, this was so clear that no point was made of it in the court below: no additional instructions were requested, and the alleged omission was not made the subject of particular exception. See Com. v. Caraffa, 222 Pa. 297, 71 A. 17; Com. v. Pacito, 229 Pa. 328, 78 A. 828; Com. v. Varano, 258 Pa. 442, 102 A. 131.\nJudgment affirmed and record remitted for purposes of execution.\nIn his confession he said he struck Roberts twice; in his testimony from the witness stand, he said he struck him once. The coroner\u2019s physician testified that Roberts \u201chad a laceration or cut on his forehead [about two inches in length] and a contusion, a swelling, on the back of his head.\u201d\nRiggs was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio, within a week after the murder and was brought back to Scranton.\nSection 2 of the act is as follows: \u201cAll applications for changes of venue shall be made to the court in which the indictment shall be pending, in such manner as the said court shall direct and before the jury shall be sworn therein; and if the said court shall be satisfied of the propriety of such change of venue, and that the causes assigned therefor are true and are within the provisions of the first section of this act, it shall be ordered, that the venue thereof shall be changed to some adjoining or convenient county where the causes alleged for a change do not exist.\u201d",
