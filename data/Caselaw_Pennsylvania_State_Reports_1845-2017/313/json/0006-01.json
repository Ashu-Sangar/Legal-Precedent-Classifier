        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nThe Fidelity Title and Trust Company of the City of Pittsburgh, a corporation of this Commonwealth, whose place of business is in that city, is the trustee of a fund of $600,000, deeded by appellee to it. Admittedly, \u201csettlement of accounts of trustees of trusts inter vivos,\u201d is subject to the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court by the Act of June 26, 1931, P. L. 1384, 1385. Hence, settlement of the accounts in this trust estate is within the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County.\nAsserting, for the reasons set forth in his petition in that court, that he had a substantial interest in the accrued and accruing income of the trust estate, and that the trustee, despite written notice not to do so, indicated an intention to pay the whole of the income to one Sara Y. Frazer, he asked that court to enjoin the trustee from so doing, preliminarily until hearing and perpetually thereafter, and to award an appropriate citation to the trustee and to the said Sara Y. Frazer. The court below made the order prayed for, whereupon Sara T. Frazer appeared de bene esse, and asked that the petition be dismissed for want of jurisdiction and that the restraining order be vacated and set aside. This the court below refused, and later dismissed her exceptions to its action, whereupon, without proceeding further in that tribunal, she prosecuted the present appeal, claiming the right so to do, despite the interlocutory character of the orders appealed from, because of the provisions of the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, and has favored us with an elaborate argument on the merits of the controversy between her and appellee; a point we could not now consider, even if we were of opinion that the present proceeding was within the purview of that statute.\nIt is clear, however, that the Act of 1925 does not apply to this class of proceedings. The first section says \u201cThat wherever in any proceeding at law or in equity the question of jurisdiction over the defendant or of the cause of action for which suit is brought is raised in the court of first instance, it shall be preliminarily determined,\u201d etc. A proceeding in the orphans\u2019 court, which this is, is not a \u201cproceeding at law or in equity.\u201d True, that court, within the scope of its jurisdiction, proceeds according to equitable principles, but that does not make this a \u201cproceeding......in equity.\u201d We have so recently considered the status of that court on this point, in Douglas\u2019s Est., 303 Pa. 227, 231, that nothing further need be said on the subject.\nMoreover, by the order made, notice is to be given to appellant in a specified way to appear and show cause why appellee\u2019s claim should not be allowed. How this notice should be given was a matter exclusively within the discretion of the court below. By section 17 (d) of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, 374, it is provided that if the respondent in such a proceeding \u201cresides outside the Commonwealth, and his place of residence is known, and the proceeding concerns property situate within the Commonwealth, the court may, in its discretion, authorize service to be made on such party personally wherever found, or by registered mail, or may direct notice to be given by publication in such manner as shall appear to the court to be reasonable and proper, according to general rules adopted by the court, or special orders made by the court in particular cases.\u201d\nIn the instant case, where appellant \u201cresides outside the Commonwealth......and the proceeding concerns property situate within the Commonwealth,\u201d the court below ordered that \u201cservice of said citation, together with a copy of the foregoing petition and of this decree shall be made upon [appellant] by registered mail, in accordance with the provisions of section 17 subparagraph (d) of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1917, at her residence 121 South Rossmore Avenue, Los Angeles, California, or such other place as she may be found.\u201d\nThis order was in strict accord with the statute, and, since the funds in the hands of the trustee are within this Commonwealth, gave the court below jurisdiction to determine whether or not those funds are payable to her or to appellee: Pennington v. Fourth Nat. Bank of Cincinnati, 243 U. S. 269. We know now that appellant has had actual knowledge of the proceedings, but even if she had not, as she had the constructive statutory notice prescribed by the court which had jurisdiction over the fund, she will not hereafter be heard to complain that she did not have such actual notice or knowledge: App v. Dreisbach, 2 Rawle 287; Lorch\u2019s Est., 284 Pa. 500; Holben\u2019s Est., 300 Pa. 169, 173, and cases cited therein. Indeed, at any time in the future the court below, without continuing the present proceedings, may enter an order upon the trustee to file an account, on the audit of which, after due advertisement, the existing controversy between appellant and appellee, so far as concerns distribution of the fund, will be heard and conclusively determined, without regard to anything that has theretofore been done in the present proceedings, and whether appellant has or has not had notice of the audit. See cases last cited.\nWhat has been said above conclusively determines that this appeal can have no basis in the Act of 1925, and that is all we are now called upon to determine. It may not be amiss to say, however, that the restraining order of which complaint is made is also within the jurisdiction of the court below. This is statutorily declared in section 7 of the Act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 206, 207, now embodied in section 16 of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, 373, which states that the orphans\u2019 courts \u201cshall have power to prevent, by orders in the nature of writs of injunction, acts contrary to law or equity, prejudicial to property over which they shall have jurisdiction.\u201d Moreover, if there was no statute expressly conferring such right, we would have no difficulty in deciding that, quoad matters within its jurisdiction, the power of the orphans\u2019 court \u201cis only limited by the necessities of the cas\u00e9, and by its duty to administer equity in accordance with established rules\u201d: Odd Fellows Savings Bank\u2019s App., 123 Pa. 356, 365; Carney v. Merchants\u2019 Union Trust Co., 252 Pa. 381, 385-6.\nThe appeal is quashed at the cost of appellant.",
