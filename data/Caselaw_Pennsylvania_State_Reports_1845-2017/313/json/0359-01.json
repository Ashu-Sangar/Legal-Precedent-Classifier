        "text": "Pee Cueiam,\nHarry C. Magraw [McGraw] has appealed from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County dismissing his exceptions to the decree of distribution entered on the final account of a testamentary trustee under the will of Eveline Murray. The following are the most salient of the facts submitted to the court below under an agreed statement.\nTestatrix died September 8, 1883. By her will she established a separate use trust of real estate owned by her, directing that the income should be paid to her daughter Louisa Magraw for life. She further provided that, at the death of her daughter, the trust should continue in equal shares for the benefit of Bartram and Harry Magraw, sons of Louisa. The instrument directed that the one-half interest of Harry be conveyed to him when he became of full age, but continued the trust as to Bartram during his lifetime. The will then provided: \u201cand should the said Bartram die during the lifetime of said Harry his brother then to grant said Bar-tram\u2019s moiety to him said Harry. And in trust further if said Bartram and Harry die without children surviving them then to the heirs of their mother Louisa her heirs......\u201d It is the interpretation of the clauses just quoted which gives rise to the present controversy.\nLouisa died September 18,1890. Harry Magraw, who is still living, reached his majority many years ago and at that time received a conveyance of his half of his grandmother\u2019s estate. Bartram died January 12, 1933, and the contest over his share, held in trust during his lifetime, is between his children and Harry. The court below decided the issue in favor of the children of Bar-tram and we see no reason to disturb the decree so entered.\nAppellant contends that Bartram\u2019s interest was but a life estate which, by the terms of the will, was to pass to Harry on his brother\u2019s death, and further asserts that the intention of testatrix is so clear and unequivocal that no doubt may be cast upon the gift over to Harry by subsequent ambiguous terms in the will. To reach appellant\u2019s conclusion we must necessarily disregard the phraseology of the latter of the two portions of the will quoted above, for the obvious implication of the clause which reads, \u201cAnd in trust further if said Bartram and Harry die without children surviving them then to the heirs of their mother Louisa, her heirs,\u201d is that Harry is to take Bartram\u2019s share only if the latter dies without children. Appellant attempts to escape from this construction by arguing that the clause just mentioned was inserted to cover the contingency that Harry might die in the lifetime of Bartram and to provide for the ultimate distribution of both shares. But there again, if testatrix intended Bartram\u2019s interest to terminate at his death, in providing for the possible death of Harry before Bartram, the gift over to the heirs of Louisa would not be predicated upon the death of Bartram without children surviving him. Plainly, by the language of the will, Bartram\u2019s share would pass to his children if Harry predeceased him. We cannot presume that, testatrix desired to disinherit Bartram\u2019s children if Harry outlived Bartram, and not otherwise. The will was written many years ago when the two brothers were but children. The grandmother could not have had any prejudice against their then unborn offspring. The natural and equitable interpretation of this testamentary paper indicates that Harry was to receive Bartram\u2019s share if the latter died before his brother without children surviving him. Testatrix also contemplated that if Harry died before Bar-tram, the share of the latter was to revert to the heirs of Louisa, their mother, in default of surviving issue of either brother.\nNo other construction will give effect to every part of the instrument and it is well established that a will must be construed as a whole and so that all its provisions may take effect. In addition, the construction not only must avoid inconsistencies, if possible, but also must not disinherit an heir, except where required by plain words or necessary implication: Moore\u2019s Est., 241 Pa. 253. See also Patton\u2019s Est., 268 Pa. 367, and cases there cited. \u201cIn arriving at the intent of the [testatrix] we must seek to give effect to every part of the will and give harmony to the whole instrument\u201d: McDevitt\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 103, 107.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.",
