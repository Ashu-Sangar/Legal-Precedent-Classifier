        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nAppellant, Kenneth Clark, seeks a new trial on the grounds that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged reference to Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County found trial counsel not to be ineffective. The Superior Court affirmed 395 Pa.Super. 650, 570 A.2d 586. We are now called upon to review the Superior Court\u2019s Order.\nThe issue before this Court is whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s impermissible use of Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence. Since Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim rests solely on the post-arrest silence issue, we find it necessary to first evaluate the lower court\u2019s conclusion on the post-arrest silence issue in light of our decision in Commonwealth v. Turner, 499 Pa. 579, 454 A.2d 537 (1982).\nThis case arose out of the following factual setting. Appellant was convicted of first-degree homicide and was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for the killing of David Carroll. Appellant appealed the judgment to the Superior Court, which affirmed. Commonwealth v. Clark, 304 Pa.Super. 586, 450 A.2d 1033 (1982). This Court denied allocatur on June 1,1983. Thereafter, Appellant filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act (P.C.H.A) petition alleging ineffectiveness on the part of trial counsel for failing to object when the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination compelled Appellant to admit that he had made no assertion of a self-defense claim prior to trial. The trial court denied the P.C.H.A. petition. However, a panel of the Superior Court reversed and remanded to the trial court with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of considering evidence of trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness for not raising the post-arrest silence issue.\nOn remand, the Court of Common Pleas found that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination had not referred to any remarks Appellant had or had not made subsequent to his arrest, but rather, related only to Appellant\u2019s silence prior to the arrest. Thus, the trial court concluded that the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination did not violate the post-arrest silence standards established in Commonwealth v. Turner, 499 Pa. 579, 454 A.2d 587 (1982). A divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed the denial of the P.C.H.A. petition. We granted allocatur and this appeal followed.\nThe issue before this Court is whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when Appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was allegedly violated by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence. To prove ineffectiveness of counsel, Appellant must show that his assertion is one of arguable merit, that the. attorney had no reasonable basis for his action or inaction, and that the attorney\u2019s action or inaction was prejudicial to the client. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 158-59, 527 A.2d 973, 975 (1987). All three conditions are met in this case. Therefore, we find that the Appellant has established his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\nHerein, Appellant alleges that the prosecution made two distinct impermissible references to his post-arrest silence, one of which occurred during the direct-examination of a Commonwealth witness who allegedly observed the shooting. The challenged post-arrest silence violation we will address arose during the following exchange:\nQ. Mr. Clark, you started running back down 19th Street, didn\u2019t you?\nA. Yes I did.\nQ. Started stuffing the gun back into your pants didn\u2019t you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Where were you going?\nA. I was going home.\nQ. Did you ever think of telling the police what happened? A. No.\nQ. I withdraw that. Don\u2019t answer that. Withdraw that. I withdraw that question, Judge. Mr. Clark, let me ask you this: After you fired the shot, the first shot, what happened?\n(N.T. 2. 165) (emphasis added).\nAppellant avers that the \u201cbroadest possible coverage\u201d is employed by use of the word \u201cever\u201d and a reasonable juror could have interpreted the prosecutor\u2019s question to have referred to silence following Appellant\u2019s arrest. Appellant contends that in order to rectify that impermissible reference to his post-arrest silence, he is entitled to a new trial. Appellee argues that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s line of questioning referred only to Appellant\u2019s pre-arrest silence and not his post-arrest silence. Notwithstanding the intention of the questioner, the question was ambiguous regarding the specific time frame to which it was directed. The prosecutor\u2019s question was, \u201cDid you ever think of telling the police what happened?\u201d N.T. p. 2.165 (emphasis added). Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cever\u201d as \u201cthrough all time or at anytime.\u201d Thus it is reasonable to assume that the jury would have interpreted the prosecutor\u2019s question as embracing Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence. The Commonwealth contends that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was directed to the time between the shooting and Appellant\u2019s subsequent apprehension by the police officers. First, we consider whether there is merit to the Appellant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor made an impermissible reference to his post-arrest silence.\nThis Court has firmly exhibited its intention to insure that the post-arrest silence of the accused is not used to his detriment in legal proceedings. Turner, 499 Pa. 579, 454 A.2d 537. In Turner, we held that any reference to the post-arrest silence of the accused is potentially prejudicial to the accused. 499 Pa. at 585, 454 A.2d at 540. Such a reference may impermissibly contribute to the verdict and consequently warrants the granting of a new trial for the accused. Id. Turner reflects this Court\u2019s concern that lay jurors may mistakenly interpret the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate oneself as an implicit admission of guilt.\nIn this instance, the post-arrest silence issue arose from the question \u201cDid you ever think of telling the police what happened?\u201d (emphasis added). In Turner, where the accused was charged in the shooting death of the victim and argued self-defense, the accused was asked by the prosecutor, \u201cDid you ever tell the police that somebody was shooting at you?\u201d 499 Pa. at 581, 454 A.2d at 538. In Turner, as in the instant matter, the accused waited until trial before offering his exculpatory version of the incident. In Turner, this Court vacated and remanded for a new trial because we could not determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the accused\u2019s post-arrest silence contributed to the verdict; the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the reference did influence the jury\u2019s verdict required the granting of a new trial. Id. at 584, 538 A.2d at 540.\nAppellee argues that Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence claim is meritless. Appellee reads Turner narrowly, contending that the prosecutor\u2019s reference in the instant matter went solely to the time Appellant was going home prior to Appellant\u2019s arrest. We disagree. In Turner, this Court held that a nearly identical reference made by the prosecution was an impermissible reference to post-arrest silence of defendant. Accordingly, since the prosecutorial reference made in the instant case is the type prohibited by Turner, we are constrained to find Appellant has asserted a claim of arguable merit.\nThe second question is whether reasonable grounds existed to support Appellant\u2019s failure to object when the prosecutor referred to Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence. Since our test requires that we examine the approach pursued by trial counsel in light of the available alternatives, a finding of ineffectiveness is appropriate if we conclude that the alternatives not chosen offered a potential for success substantially greater than the tactics utilized. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 159, 527 A.2d 973, 976 (1987). The alternatives must be examined only as a means of determining whether the course chosen had a reasonable basis. Id. at 160, 527 A.2d at 976.\nIn this case, the course chosen by the attorney was to remain silent in the face of an impermissible reference to his client\u2019s post-arrest silence. We acknowledge that the prosecutor withdrew his question, thereby attempting to nullify the error he committed. However, his withdrawal occurred after the Appellant admitted that he said nothing to the police regarding what occurred. Under these circumstances, the prosecutor\u2019s withdrawal of his question did not completely erase its effect on the jury, and trial counsel\u2019s inaction deprived his client of cautionary instructions from the court, at the very least.\nMoreover, considering the state of the law in this Commonwealth at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial, we find that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to object. In 1972, this Court held that a prosecutor\u2019s reference to the fact that the defendant had failed to tell the police that he acted in self-defense constituted prejudicial error and warranted a new trial. Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 449 Pa. 45, 295 A.2d 328 (1972). In Dulaney, the defendant was convicted of second degree murder. Testifying in his own defense at trial, the defendant argued that he stabbed the victim only after the victim threatened him and reached for his gun. Id. at 47, 295 A.2d at 330. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant, if he \u201cacted out of fear or, if you want to call it self-defense,\u201d why he failed to advise the officers of that fact. Id. Instantly, since Appellant\u2019s trial counsel is deemed to be aware of our holdings in Dulaney and numerous other cases which had been decided at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial, we are constrained to find no reasonable basis for trial counsel\u2019s failure to object.\nFinally, we require that the defendant demonstrate how the alleged ineffectiveness prejudiced him. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 156, 527 A.2d 973, 975 (1987); Common wealth v. Clemmons, 505 Pa. 356, 362, 479 A.2d 955, 958 (1984); Commonwealth v. Vogel, 501 Pa. 314, 329, 461 A.2d 604, 612 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1104, 104 S.Ct. 1603, 80 L.Ed.2d 133 (1984); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 490 Pa. 312, 318, 416 A.2d 485, 488 (1980). We have established that an impermissible reference to an accused\u2019s post-arrest silence constitutes reversible error unless shown to be harmless. Commonwealth v. Turner, 499 Pa. 579, 454 A.2d 537 (1982). See also Commonwealth v. Easley, 483 Pa. 337, 396 A.2d 1198 (1979); In Re Edward L. Silverberg, et al, 459 Pa. 107, 327 A.2d 106 (1974); Commonwealth v. Haideman, 449 Pa. 367, 296 A.2d 765 (1972). Restated, we have concluded that because of its nature, an impermissible reference to the accused\u2019s post-arrest silence is innately prejudicial. In Commonwealth v. Humphrey, 473 Pa. 533, 375 A.2d 717 (1979), we found trial counsel to be ineffective where he failed to object to three references to the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence. In Humphrey we based our finding of prejudice on federal court decisions which had held that a reference to an accused\u2019s post-arrest silence is prejudicial. Id. at 540, 375 A.2d at 720. Consequently, in the instant matter we find Appellant has satisfied the third prong of our ineffectiveness test.\nAccordingly, since we find that trial counsel was ineffective, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court and grant a new trial.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\nMcDERMOTT, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. Because we find Appellant\u2019s trial counsel ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s impermissible reference during his cross-examination of Appellant, we need not discuss this allegation.\n. Appellee also argues that Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence issue can not be reached since Appellant\u2019s original P.C.H.A. counsel failed to raise that issue. We disagree. The trial court denied his P.C.H.A. petition and thereafter Appellant retained new counsel. Appellant\u2019s new counsel filed an appeal in the Superior Court claiming that both trial counsel and original P.C.H.A. counsel had been ineffective for failing to raise the post-arrest silence issue. The Superior Court remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for the purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing on the issue of post-arrest silence. Prior to the commencement of the evidentiary hearing the court and both parties agreed that there would be no issue of a waiver by the original P.C.H.A. counsel. If trial counsel was found ineffective, then the original P.C.H.A. counsel necessarily had to be ineffective by failing to assert that claim. (Commonwealth v. Clark, Nos. 1600-1603, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, P.C.H.A. Evidentiary Hearing, April 20, 1988, N.T. at 5.) Accordingly, we find Appellee\u2019s position not persuasive.\n. Although I dissented in Turner, because I did not believe that the alleged reference reached the level of an impermissible use of the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, I am now constrained to follow the reasoning of the majority in Turner in deciding this case.\n. The difference is that the word \u201cthink\u201d was used by the prosecutor in the instant matter where it was not in Turner. We do not see where the word \"think\u201d separates the question asked in Turner from that asked in the instant case.\n. Trial counsel gave no explanation as to why he failed to object and, upon scrutiny of the record, we are unable to find a reasonable basis for trial counsel's inaction.\n. Commonwealth v. Easley, 483 Pa. 337, 396 A.2d 1198 (1979); Commonwealth v. Humphrey, 473 Pa. 533, 375 A.2d 717 (1977); Commonwealth v. Haideman, 449 Pa. 367, 296 A.2d 765 (1972).\n. In order to determine whether an error was prejudicial or harmless, we generally perform a three-part analysis. See Commonwealth v. Eisenhart, 531 Pa. 103, 111, 611 A.2d 681, 685 (1992). However, in this case, there is no question that the impermissible reference to a criminal defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence is prejudicial.",
