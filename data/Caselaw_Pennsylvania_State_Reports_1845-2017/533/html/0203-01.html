The complaint also demanded attorneys fees and costs. The defendants, who include the Commissioners of Jefferson County and the members of its Salary Board, denied the allegations and further' argued that the action could not be entertained because the Plaintiff failed to assert his rights in a timely fashion, a charge which he later denied. The Plaintiff then petitioned this Court to exercise plenary jurisdiction over the case. We granted the petition and appointed Judge Silvestri Silvestri of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County as Master.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Following a hearing, Judge Silvestri filed a report in which he recommended that we dismiss the complaint.

Any budget for the Jefferson County court system is first filed with the County Commissioners, who are given an opportunity to review it. The County Commissioners determine whether to adopt the non-salary portion of the budget, while the salary portion is formally implemented by the Salary Board. The Salary Board includes the three County Commissioners, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Jefferson County, and the County Treasurer. The 1989 fiscal year budget that the Plaintiff submitted contained a 5% increase for all salaries of court employees. The Salary Board denied this request and instead fixed salaries for all county employees, including court personnel, at 1988 levels. This complaint was filed in order to compel payment of the amount that was refused.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Developed by the Pennsylvania Economy League, the schedule consisted of ranges of salaries for thirty job classifications. Within each range, there were seven steps, each of which represented an increase of approximately 5% over the preceding step. During the first year the schedule went into effect, each employee was assigned to a classification level based on job responsibilities and a step corresponding to his/her experience. In the two subsequent years, the Plaintiff requested salaries corresponding to the next step in the range to which an individual was assigned.

While those conclusions are persuasive, they are not dispositive in this case. This is primarily because in order to arrive at figures it claims to reflect competitive salaries, the Pennsylvania Economy League relied on data collected from employers with whom the Jefferson County Court of Common PÍeas does not appear to compete. Specifically, of the nine employers responding to the 1986 survey, four are located outside Jefferson County and its adjacent counties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Of the eleven employers responding to the 1988 survey, five are located outside Jefferson County and <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>its adjacent counties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Two respondents to both surveys (Bradford and Carbon counties) are over 150 miles away.</p>

Indeed, each case would involve its own unique set of boundaries, if any exist. However, in this instance we have serious doubts as to whether the surveyed employers actually compete in the same labor market from which the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas draws its workers. Furthermore, the Plaintiff offers no argument or- evidence that removes those doubts from our minds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Under these circumstances, we cannot say that he has offered an adequate basis upon which we can determine whether his court’s salary requests are reasonably necessary. Therefore, we conclude that he has not met his burden of proving reasonable necessity. Since that precondition for exercising this Court’s inherent power to compel funding has not been satisfied, we must deny relief.</p>

This argument is substantively identical to the one advanced by the plaintiff court in <em>Lavelle v. Koch, </em><a href="/pa/532/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="532 Pa. 631" data-case-ids="1835953" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0631-01">532 Pa. 631</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="532 Pa. 631" data-case-ids="1835953" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0631-01">617 A.2d 319</a> (1992). In that case the plaintiff argued that the judiciary's inherent powers to compel funding are meaningless unless the legislative branch is obligated to cover the costs associated with bringing an action in mandamus. We dismissed that argument on the basis that it “ignores the fact that any member of this Commonwealth’s judiciary can turn to the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts for 'legal services and, when appropriate, representation by legal counsel.' ” <em><a href="/pa/532/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="532 Pa. 631" data-case-ids="1835953" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0631-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/532/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="532 Pa. 631" data-case-ids="1835953" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0631-01">at 638</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="532 Pa. 631" data-case-ids="1835953" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0631-01">617 A.2d at 323</a> (quoting Pa.R.J.A. No. 505 (15)). In other words, by funding the AOPC, the legislature has already made provisions for the judiciary to assert any constitutional or statutory rights it may enjoy. Therefore, by denying attorneys fees, we are not undermining the judiciary's power to respond to any separation of powers violation by the legislature. Of course, the AOPC is under no obligation to represent every court in every funding dispute that may arise. Nor is it under any obligation to pay someone else to do so. As the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration make clear, the AOPC has discretion to determine whether, in its judgment, a matter is “appropriate” for it to handle or to which it should devote its resources.</p>
