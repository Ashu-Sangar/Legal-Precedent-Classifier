On September 14, 1989, he was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of ten to twenty years.

Ms. Doswell lived at 314 Collins Street in Pittsburgh, which was also the residence of Doswell’s girlfriend. Ms. Doswell testified that in August of 1987, two months after the first rape, her father entered her room, threw her on the bed and attempted to penetrate her. As Doswell was attempting to rape his daughter, his girlfriend’s son, one Poindexter, entered the house and called Doswell’s name, whereupon Doswell jumped up and zipped up his pants. Doswell instructed the victim to quit crying and be quiet. Poindexter then came to the victim’s room, where Ms. Doswell sat with her back to the two men, and Poindexter left after two or three minutes. She testified that she did not seek Poindexter’s help because the assault was over.</p>

With respect to impeachment based on a criminal charge, however, we have no difficulty concluding that it was error to utilize a criminal charge to impeach.

However, counsel did not verify the conviction or the charge, and once he knew through cross examination that sentencing had not occurred, he did not object at closing when the prosecutor referred to the fact that Poindexter “had a receiving stolen goods charge.” There was no reasonable basis for these failures to object. To be effective, counsel must verify the accuracy of the criminal record at issue by checking with counsel who was involved with the trial or by checking court records.

Mr. Justice Cappy writes that “it was entirely reasonable for counsel to have relied upon Poindexter’s own statement that he had been convicted, particularly when, as here, that statement was confirmed by Poindexter’s mother.” Infra at 108 (Cappy, J., concurring). With this statement, I vehemently disagree. Defense counsel had a duty to be aware of any possible impediment that might be raised to challenge his witness. It was improper for the defense counsel to rely upon the opinion of two lay people (i.e., Poindexter and his mother) for determining whether Poindexter was impeachable for the crime of receiving stolen goods. Once he was alerted that Poindexter had been arrested, defense counsel should have undertaken his own independent investigation of Poindexter’s record. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth v.

The defendant here is entitled to a new trial with effective assistance of counsel. That does not mean that defense counsel should have the advantage of presenting unimpeachable testimony by a witness who has been convicted of the crime of receiving stolen goods. The fault in this case lies with the defense counsel and not the prosecutor. This case does not present the type of evidence of 117prosecutorial misconduct that warrants sanctions. Therefore, because the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel which prejudiced his case, he is entitled to a new trial. It is true that Poindexter is now impeachable regarding his conviction for receiving stolen goods. The fact that the fortuitous circumstances may have made it more difficult to proceed in a retrial cannot be assigned to the Commonwealth.

I believe it was entirely reasonable for counsel to have relied upon Poindexter’s own statement that he had been convicted, particularly when, as here, that statement was confirmed by Poindexter’s mother.</p>

At that point, counsel should have objected on the basis of our rationale in <em>Commonwealth v.
