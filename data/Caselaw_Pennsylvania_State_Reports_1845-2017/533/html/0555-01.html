We granted allocatur to consider whether the Superior Court erred in its application and analysis of harmless error review in determining that the prosecutor’s comments during closing argument regarding appellant’s failure to testify constituted harmless error. We find that the Superior Court did err, and that appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b805-7" data-blocks='[["BL_805.7",805,[204,989,1157,302]]]'>Appellant’s convictions of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse arose out of his assault upon J.S. J.S. is mildly retarded, legally blind and suffers from cerebral palsy. She lives in a community living situation with one other mentally handicapped woman, Lisa Hughes, and a counselor, Victoria Mason.</p>
    <p id="b805-8" data-blocks='[["BL_805.8",805,[202,1324,1156,526]]]'>On June 18,1986, Mason decided to take J.S. and Hughes to the grocery store. J.S. complained that she was too tired, and decided to stay home instead. Mason and Hughes picked up another counselor, Gloria Breedlove, and her two clients. Instead of going to the store, the two counselors made a stop to buy some marijuana, and then went to a local bar. At the bar, Mason and Breedlove entered into a conversation with appellant and two of his friends. Thereafter, they all left together, and, after a trip to the grocery store, went to Breedlove’s apartment.</p>
    <p id="b805-9" data-blocks='[["BL_805.9",805,[199,1875,1158,474]],["BL_806.1",806,[229,294,1160,251]]]'>At the apartment the group ingested alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. Mason invited appellant back to her apartment. She left Hughes behind in Breedlove’s apartment, and went to her apartment with appellant. After making sure that J.S. was asleep in her room, Mason took appellant into her own room wherein the couple engaged in oral sex. Approximately an hour later, Mason went into the bathroom. When she came out ten minutes later, appellant was no longer in her room. According to Mason, she then went to J.S.’s room where she <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>found appellant, nude, sitting on J.S.’s bed. J.S. was also nude, and had her nightgown in her hand. She told Mason that appellant had tried to talk her into having oral sex. Appellant denied that he did anything wrong, and the two of them left J.S.’s room.</p>
    <p id="b806-5" data-blocks='[["BL_806.5",806,[225,580,1159,638]]]'>Several days later, J.S. reported the incident to another counselor, and subsequently, to the police. Her version of the incident differed somewhat from that of Mason’s. For instance, J.S. described the incident as lasting much longer than Mason’s version would allow for. She described her assailant as the complete opposite of appellant. J.S. stated that he was tall, skinny, dark skinned, and with a moustache.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Additionally, J.S. denied that Mason entered the room when her attacker was present. Finally, she testified that the third roommate was present in the apartment when she was attacked. A physical examination revealed that J.S. had contracted two venereal diseases: chlamydia and gardenella.</p>
    <p id="b806-6" data-blocks='[["BL_806.6",806,[222,1245,1160,844]]]'>On September 12, 1986, appellant was arrested for the rape of J.S. Thereafter, he was tried by a jury before the Honorable Levy Anderson in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Appellant chose not to testify at trial. Instead, he hoped that he would be acquitted on the basis of the contradictions in the Commonwealth’s case and because of what the defense believed to be a lack of credibility on the part of the Commonwealth’s witnesses. On August 1, 1990, however, the jury found appellant guilty of both rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. The trial court denied post-verdict motions and sentenced appellant to a prison term of five to ten years for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and a consecutive prison term of three to six years for rape. Appellant appealed and on September 27, 1991, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. This appeal follows.</p>

It is impossible to determine that there is a possibility that the error contributed to the verdict, and at the same time determine that the error was harmless.

Furthermore, the prosecutor did not make only one passing remark regarding appellant’s failure to testify, but rather he hammered the point into the minds of the jurors over and over again. Furthermore, although there was a great deal of circumstantial evidence against appellant, there were also a substantial number of internal contradictions in the Commonwealth’s case in chief. As appellant points out, J.S. described her assailant as tall and skinny, whereas appellant is short and stocky. J.S. testified that her assailant was in her room for about forty five minutes, whereas Mason testified she had only left appellant alone when she went to the bathroom for about ten minutes. J.S. testified that Mason never entered the room when her assailant was present, whereas Mason said that she entered the room and found appellant, naked, on J.S.’s bed. Mason testified that she asked both appellant and J.S. what had happened when she walked into the room, whereas J.S. denied that Mason ever came in the room. J.S. testified that her assailant got dressed before he left her room, whereas Mason testified that appellant was naked when he left J.S.’s room. Finally, J.S. testified that she had heard her other roommate, Lisa Hughes, in the house when she was being assaulted. She testified that immediately prior to the time when her assailant entered her room, she heard Hughes and Mason talking and putting the groceries away. Mason, contrarily, testified that Hughes was still at Gloria Breedlove’s apartment when the attack occurred, and that the groceries <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>were not put away until afterward. Mason was the only person who could positively identify appellant as having been the person who raped J.S. Defense counsel, during argument, contended that Mason should not be believed, and noted that she had some motivation to implicate appellant in the assault. He also pointed out the inconsistencies in the testimony of Mason and J.S., and attempted to persuade the jurors that perhaps another man had entered the apartment that night and raped J.S., when Mason and Hughes were unpacking the groceries. Given the fact that appellant did not testify, the jury could have believed that not only was appellant’s counsel’s version of the events untrue, but also that appellant was admitting his guilt by not testifying. In light of the nature of the prosecutor’s comments, it is reasonably possible that the jury concluded that appellant’s failure to testify was an admission of his guilt. Comparing the evidence to the error in this case leads us to conclude that the error could not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; especially in light of the fact that the error was one of a significant magnitude.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Accordingly, the judgment of sentence is reversed, and a new trial is ordered.</p>
