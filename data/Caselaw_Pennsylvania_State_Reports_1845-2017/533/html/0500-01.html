      <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>Over a period of thirty-five (35) years, Appellant was exposed to lead laden dust and loud noise on a daily basis in his employment as a maintenance man at a lead refining and smelting plant in Philadelphia, most recently known as Metallurgical Resources. From April 25, 1979 to May 29, 1979, Appellant did no work because of a disability due to lead absorption. During this period of no work, Appellant received compensation benefits. In August of 1979, Appellant resigned because, as he informed the employer’s plant physician, Dr. McGraw, he could no longer work because of physical ailments caused by his working conditions, specifically his exposure to lead. However, it is clear from the record that Appellant told Dr. McGraw that he could continue to work as long as it was not within the lead plant, and that Dr. McGraw told him to apply for unemployment compensation, not disability compensation, until he could find other work. Dr. McGraw indicated that he would make out a notice that Appellant was able to work any place except in the lead plant or any place with any kind of lead dust. Appellant thereafter applied for, and received, about two months of unemployment compensation upon a finding that he was unemployed through no fault of his own and that he was able and available for full time work. The record, therefore, supports the conclusion that Appellant was not totally disabled for work at this time.</p>
    <p id="b751-5" data-blocks='[["BL_751.5",751,[217,1580,1159,580]]]'>In March of 1983, Dr. Peter Gann examined Appellant and diagnosed him as suffering from lead encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, noise induced hearing loss, lead nephropathy, and severe chronic obstructive lung disease, and concluded that Appellant was totally disabled as a result thereof. Within thirty days of this diagnosis by Dr. Gann, Appellant filed a petition for compensation under the occupational disease provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. §§ 411 and 27.1. Although the referee accepted Dr. Gann’s testimony, he concluded that Appellant suffered from the symptoms of these diseases during or before 1979.</p>

    <p id="b752-5" data-blocks='[["BL_752.5",752,[235,518,1162,801]]]'>In his appeal, Appellant has acknowledged that he was aware when he resigned from his job in 1979 that he was suffering from a partial disability due to lead absorption, but that he was not suffering from a total disability. It was not until Dr. Gann diagnosed him as suffering a total disability due to lead absorption that he became aware of such, and that since he filed a petition within thirty (30) days of this diagnosis, his action was well within the time limitations. Appellant argues that the referee erred in applying the three year statute of limitations commencing from the time Appellant knew or was aware that he was suffering a work-related partial disability. He also claims that a claimant for occupational disease benefits should not be deemed to know that he is totally disabled because of the occupational disease without a competent medical diagnosis of such. We agree.</p>

The instant claim for occupational disease benefits under the Workmen’s Compensation Act began to run only after the medical diagnosis of the disability was made known to appellant in 1983 and Appellant’s claim was, therefore, timely filed. Although evidence of record supports the referee’s findings that Appellant attributed his physical ailments to lead exposure at the plant when he resigned on August 31, 1979, and that Appellant’s <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>symptoms were present during or before 1979, it does not establish as a matter of law that he knew, or should have known, that he was <em>totally </em>disabled from his cumulative lead exposure. In fact, the uncontradicted facts, including findings of the referee, establish that Claimant’s lead poisoning disability had terminated as of May 29, 1979, as certified by a final receipt signed May 30,1979. At about this time, also, employer did a creatinine test which was then normal, but “definitely elevated” at the time of Dr. Gann’s study in March of 1983.
