After being apprehended, he was arraigned in the court of common pleas on January 12, 1989, and waived his right to a jury trial on the escape charge.

Instead, the Superior Court relied on its precedent in <em>Felton, </em>which held that after a trial begins, the unauthorized departure of a defendant does not preclude the completion of trial in his absence, but if he fails to appear for the commencement of trial, trial may not begin in his absence. The distinction was based on the following rationale of the Superior Court:</p>
    <blockquote id="b350-7" data-blocks='[["BL_350.7",350,[277,1818,1117,258]],["BL_351.1",351,[258,284,1115,738]]]'>This case [where the appellant was never present in the courtroom during his trial] is distinguishable from a proceeding where the defendant voluntarily absents himself from the courtroom subsequent to the initiation of the proceeding. If a mistrial were declared whenever a defen<a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>dant voluntarily absents himself from the courtroom during trial, the courts would encourage defendants to refuse to appear whenever they expect the judge or jury to render a verdict of guilty. Such an absence would guarantee the defendant another opportunity to be acquitted. These circumstances do not attach to a case where the defendant does not appear on the date scheduled for trial. While the appellant’s absence delayed the administration of justice, the appellant would not have received a second chance at acquittal if the trial had been postponed until his apprehension. If the waiver rule were extended to include actions taken by an accused prior to trial, fugitives who are unaware of the charges against them could be tried in absentia.</blockquote>

In <em>Felton, </em>as in this case, the Superior Court did not address the applicability of Rule 1117(a). The court’s conclusion, supra, that “fugitives who are unaware of the charges against them could be tried in absentia,” is absurd; Rule 1117(a) does not authorize trial in absentia unless a defendant is absent “without cause,” and a defendant who is unaware of the charges against him or who does not know of the establishment of a trial date is not absent “without cause.” The court’s fanciful speculation about fugitives who are unaware of the charges against them was unwarranted, for the defendant in <em>Felton </em>was aware of the charges against him and his trial date just as appellee in this case was aware of the charges against him and his trial date.</p>

It is equally apparent that applying a different rule when a defendant fails to appear <em>at all, </em>thus permitting him to halt his trial by absconding before the trial commences, has precisely the same effect: it encourages a defendant to ignore his summons to trial if he thinks a guilty verdict is likely, secure in the knowledge that he cannot be convicted until he is apprehended. In the words of the late Mr. Justice McDermott: <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>“No society on earth offers more than we do to preserve and protect the rights of those held for trial.

For double jeopardy purposes, a trial begins when the jury is impanelled and sworn. <em>Commonwealth v.

To distinguish the <em>Jones </em>case from this one by saying that Jones’ trial began with him in attendance whereas appellee never appeared for trial is to rely on an almost meaningless distinction; for double jeopardy purposes, at least, Jones was not present when his trial began and most of the protections afforded by the right to be present at one’s trial were forfeited by Jones when he departed before the jury was impanelled. Appellee in this case personally, in open court, waived his right to trial by jury then left before evidence was presented in his bench trial.

If a defendant or his counsel fails to appear, sanctions are now imposed. He effectively loses the greatest of all rights, that being the rights which are afforded him by the Pennsylvania State Constitution. However, if a prosecutor fails to appear, we require a showing of prejudice. It has always been said that although we strive to achieve a perfect trial, the most that we can hopefully obtain is a fair trial. If the process is not fair, however, then the exercise has been futile. If prejudice is a material issue when the prosecutor fails to appear, then the same standard should be applied to a defendant.</p>

The majority holds that a trial in absentia may be conducted where a defendant is aware of his trial date and willfully absents himself from trial without cause or justification. The majority further holds that the record in the case <em>sub j'udice </em>establishes beyond any doubt that appellee had <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>notice of his trial date “due to his admission at sentencing that he knew of his February 27, 1989 trial date ...” I disagree.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[252,426,1159,205]]]'>Notice of his trial is absolutely necessary to support a finding that appellee willfully absented himself from trial without cause or justification.

    <blockquote id="Aah" data-blocks='[["BL_356.6",356,[293,645,1117,531]]]'>The defendant admitted that the reason for his absence from trial was fear of a guilty verdict. The record indicates that the defendant’s attorney at the time gave the defendant written notice of the trial date. This Court also notes that the defendant was incarcerated from at least January 12, 1989 (the date he signed the Waiver of Jury Trial) to February 13, 1989. The trial date was set and defense counsel was notified of that date on January 12, 1989. The defendant also knew he would be scheduled for trial soon but made no inquiry to ascertain his trial date.</blockquote>

    <p id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.8",356,[249,1258,1159,476]]]'>Based upon these reasons, I believe that there was no way the trial court could have known whether appellee had notice of the trial date when it ordered trial in absentia. Nevertheless, the majority concludes that the insufficiency of this evidence is irrelevant, because appellee admitted at sentencing that he knew of his trial date. However, such evidence cannot cure the insufficiency of the evidence before the trial court at the time it found appellee had notice of his trial date, and had willfully absented himself.</p>
    <p id="b356-8" data-blocks='[["BL_356.9",356,[249,1757,1156,368]]]'>Clearly, the mere representations of appellee’s counsel that he had mailed notice of the trial date to appellee, without knowledge of whether appellee had, in fact, received such notice, cannot serve to support a finding of the requisite notice. The majority's need to resort to reliance upon appellee’s admission at sentencing further supports the insufficiency of the evidence when the trial court issued its order.</p>
    <p id="b356-9" data-blocks='[["BL_356.10",356,[249,2148,1155,198]]]'>Therefore, I would hold that in the absence of uncontrovertible proof that appellee had notice of the trial date, the trial court was precluded from finding that appellee willfully absented himself from trial without cause.</p>
