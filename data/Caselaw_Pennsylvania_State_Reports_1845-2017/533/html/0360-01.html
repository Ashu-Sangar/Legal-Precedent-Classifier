    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.6",618,[225,1038,1159,709]]]'>Boyle’s defense to the criminal charges was that he and Scott had developed a practice during the audit of Boyle submitting tax returns and supporting documents for a certain number of the months under review; Scott would accept and review the returns, and give Boyle an extension of time to prepare additional tax returns. By this practice, Boyle prepared overdue tax returns dating back to March of 1980 which were audited by Scott. Boyle contended<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> at trial that he delayed filing the tax returns for the March-September 1983 period believing he would have the opportunity to prepare and file the returns during the course of the audit. Boyle claimed that he was not aware that the audit period ended with the tax return due for the month of February, 1983.</p>

The Superior Court distinguished <em>Perlman </em>from <em>Sacco </em>on the basis that the evidence established that appellant’s conduct resulted not from mere tardiness, but from a willful refusal to file the returns and taxes. The Superior Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction under Section 268(b), stating that "... although appellant's ‘compliance’ occurred before the <em>formal </em>institution of charges against him, it <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>occurred only <em>after </em>he was notified that a criminal investigation was proceeding.
