    <p id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[223,709,1158,521]]]'>Next, Appellant claims that trial counsel was ineffective when he did not object to the prosecutor asking Helen Emmil whether she had a criminal record. Appellant’s defense was based on the theory that Ms. Emmil committed the murder and, on cross-examination, trial counsel attempted to show that Ms. Emmil had a violent disposition by asking her whether: (1) she ever told the Appellant that if he fooled around with another woman or brought her into her house, she would kill her, and (2) whether she ever kept a knife because of her fear of the victim.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[220,1279,1158,1062]]]'>This line of questioning prompted the prosecutor to ask the witness on re-direct examination whether she had a prior criminal record in an attempt to demonstrate that she had no prior history of violence. Such a line of questioning falls within the recognized rule that re-direct examination is limited to answering only such matters as were drawn out in the immediately preceding examination. <em>Catina v. Maree, </em><a href="/pa/498/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="498 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="1776133" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0443-01">498 Pa. 443</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="498 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="1776133" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0443-01">447 A.2d 228</a> (1982). Moreover, when a party raises an issue on cross-examination, it will be no abuse of discretion for the court to permit re-direct on that issue in order to dispel any unfair inferences. <em>Commonwealth v. Dreibelbis, </em><a href="/pa/493/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="493 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="8733082" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0466-01">493 Pa. 466</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="493 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="8733082" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0466-01">426 A.2d 1111</a> (1981); <em>Commonwealth v.

Since the defense raised a question concerning the witness’s violent nature, the prosecution had a right to dispel any unfair inferences arising from this issue by allowing the witness to answer the charge by showing that she did not have a criminal record. There would have been no merit in objecting to this line of questioning and counsel cannot be found to be ineffective for not pursuing such a tactic.</p>

      <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>Appellant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to question four prospective jurors concerning their attitude on the death penalty. Appellant claims that these four jurors were only asked whether they objected to the death penalty, not whether they could follow the law regarding the imposition of such a penalty, and Appellant raises the possibility that these four prospective jurors might have been so prone to impose the death penalty that an unfair and biased jury was impaneled. Aside from the speculative nature of such a claim, Appellant has misread the record and the law concerning the purpose of voir dire questioning.</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[242,934,1160,904]]]'>We have made clear, that the purpose of voir dire questioning is to empanel a fair and impartial jury which will apply the law in accordance with the instructions of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v.

Contrary to Appellant’s allegation, the PCRA court found that in addition to being asked the general question of whether they objected to the death penalty, each of these prospective jurors indicated on the record that they were willing to follow the court’s instructions and impose a penalty of death in the appropriate case. These veniremen satisfied the purpose of voir dire questioning and qualified themselves as fair and impartial jurors. <em>Commonwealth v. Rolan, </em><a href="/pa/520/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="520 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1815598" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0001-01">520 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="520 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1815598" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0001-01">549 A.2d 553</a> (1988). Under such circumstances, trial counsel’s tactical decision not to ask further questions was not a dereliction of duty but must be viewed as having a reasonable basis and, therefore, Appellant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim must fail.</p>

N.T., Volume III, p. 80. Under such circumstances, it would not be error to permit cross-examination on this subject since this covered a subject testified to on direct examination. <em>Commonwealth v.

The right of cross-examination has always extended to matters testified to on direct examination and, if Appellant has a complaint that the jury heard that Ms. Emmil took and passed a lie detector test, it cannot be with trial counsel for he has only himself to blame for his revelation of this fact to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[213,1318,1158,855]]]'>As to the other alleged instance of ineffectiveness, Appellant claims that trial counsel should have objected when the prosecutor told the jury that he and trial counsel agreed that whoever killed the victim was guilty of murder of the first degree. The actual statement made by the prosecutor was “... between Mr. Flinchbaugh and myself, there is not much to debate. Whoever killed Jimmie Lee Taylor is guilty of murder in the first degree.” N.T. Volume IV, p. 20. Appellant argues that this statement can be read to indicate that the prosecutor was telling the jury that trial counsel was conceding that the stabbing was a first degree murder. It appears that trial counsel approached the bench at the conclusion of the closing and objected at sidebar to the statement that he had any agreement that the death of the victim was a first degree murder, but trial counsel never made this a formal objection and herein lies Appellant’s complaint.</p>

In fact, in our direct review of this case, we already reviewed this closing statement and commented that the closing was a fair commentary on the evidence. “Given the evidence that was presented to the jury which proved that only one of two people could have stabbed the victim (appellant or his girlfriend, Ms. Emmil) the prosecutor’s comments were neither unfair nor <em>unduly </em>prejudicial, and merely highlighted what the jury knew already — that one of these two was the murderer and one of these two lied.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Such an argument simply has nothing to do with any agreements with opposing counsel and it is a misreading of the closing to suggest that one existed or that the purpose of the statement was to put such an idea in the mind of the jury.

Apparently, Appellant is complaining that trial counsel did not provide witnesses to substantiate his good prison and work record. Unfortunately, Appellant never gave counsel the names of any people who could testify as to his character, nor does he explain how these witnesses would have been beneficial to him.
