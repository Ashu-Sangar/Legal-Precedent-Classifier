The appellant, Elizabeth M., is the natural mother of two boys, Louis C. and Erick C., ages seven and nine respectively at the time of the hearing in this case, to wit, in 1989. Appellant’s parental rights were terminated involuntarily because appellant was <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>unable to provide adequate care for her children. The parental rights of the father of the children, Mr. C., were terminated with his consent.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[239,452,1161,735]]]'>Appellant suffers from mental retardation. Her education consists of a high school diploma from a school for exceptional children. Appellant’s children are similarly afflicted. Erick suffers from both physical and mental retardation. He has an impairment in his ability to walk, speak, etc. Louis is learning-disabled and has an attention deficit. The children first came to the attention of the Allegheny County Children and Youth Services (CYS) in 1982. At that time appellant was a victim of Mr. C’s domestic violence and was having difficulty with rent payments and food purchases. Mr. C had expensive drug and alcohol habits. By March of 1983 the situation had worsened to such an extent that the family was evicted from its residence and was forced to seek shelter at a Salvation Army facility. .</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[237,1210,1159,521]]]'>CYS observed major deficiencies in appellant’s capacity as a parent. Appellant failed to feed her children properly and failed to maintain clean and sanitary conditions in the living space that was provided for her. She fed her children from dirty bottles of spoiled and diluted milk, left dirty diapers in their living space for days at a time, and was lax about providing medical care. In December of 1983, the children were adjudicated dependent and placed with a foster family. The foster family has cared for the children since that time and now seeks to adopt them.</p>

Although she earnestly participated in the programs, she failed to make any substantial progress in improving her skills and competence to meet the needs of her children. Appellant, impaired by her own mental retardation, was simply not able to care for her children, who, likewise, had special needs as a result of their own disabilities. CYS determined that nothing short of 24-hour supervision by an assistant skilled in the care of special needs children would be sufficient <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>to permit appellant to resume caring for her children. The children were unruly, oppositional, and very difficult to manage. Whenever appellant engaged in supervised visits with them, she was unable to control them. Despite this, appellant maintained an interest in the children and continued to visit them on a frequent and regular basis. She continued to hope that someday the children would be returned to her. Inasmuch as the programs designed to improve appellant’s parenting skills had proved fruitless, however, CYS determined sometime in 1985 or 1986 that reunification of the family was impossible and that the best interests of the children would be served by a plan of adoption.</p>
    <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[223,943,1157,361]]]'>In 1987, appellant, who was no longer residing with Mr. C, moved into a clean apartment with her paramour. The paramour expressed a willingness to assist in caring for appellant’s children, but admitted that the children have special needs that make it difficult to care for them, and státed that he and appellant would need help if they were to attempt to provide care.</p>
    <p id="b367-6" data-blocks='[["BL_367.6",367,[221,1343,1158,468]]]'>In 1989, to facilitate an adoption by the children’s foster parents, CYS filed a petition seeking termination of appellant’s parental rights on the ground that appellant was unable to provide for the needs and welfare of her children. The court of common pleas, after a hearing, denied the petition. Exceptions were filed, and, upon reconsideration, the court reversed its decision, thereby granting the petition. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court, and the termination decree was affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b367-7" data-blocks='[["BL_367.7",367,[219,1850,1158,468]]]'>At issue is whether the decree terminating appellant’s parental rights was adequately supported by the evidence and was based upon a proper consideration of the needs and welfare of the children.

Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings to determine whether termination is warranted.</p>
