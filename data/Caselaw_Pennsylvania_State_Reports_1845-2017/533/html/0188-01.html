    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[248,584,1160,962]]]'>The issue presented is whether Patrick’s application to construct a sign in an industrially zoned area of a second class township, to wit, Ohio Township, falls within the foregoing exception allowing signs to be erected in an “incorporated municipality.” The Commonwealth Court held that the exception was applicable on the basis that every square inch of property within the Commonwealth is located within incorporated municipalities. Holding that all such lands are located within incorporated municipalities is, however, to render meaningless much of the language in the statutory exception set forth in 36 P.S. § 2718.104(v), supra. Since all lands in commercially or industrially zoned areas can then qualify as locations for outdoor advertising signs, no restrictive effect is thereby accorded the proviso that lands be “within the boundaries of any incorporated municipality as such boundaries existed on September 21, 1959.... ” The Commonwealth Court expressly held this proviso to be merely “harmless surplusage.” We do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.7",438,[245,1574,1158,585]]]'>The Statutory Construction Act of 1972 provides that, “Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to <em>all </em>its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a) (emphasis added). The provision that land to be used for the placement of advertising signs must be located within the bounds of an incorporated municipality is to no extent surplus language. Indeed, it could only be deemed surplusage if, as the Commonwealth Court held, all lands within the Commonwealth are regarded as being within incorporated municipalities. Unfortunately, the OAC Act contains no definition of the term, “incorporated municipality.”</p>

Hence, reference can be made to the definition of “municipal corporation” set forth in paragraph (1), supra, pertaining to statutes enacted before December 31, 1974.

The fact that the statute was amended in 1975 does not cause paragraph (2), supra, of the definition of “municipal corporation” to become operative. Paragraph (2), unlike paragraph (1), defines municipal corporations as including townships. The Statutory Construction Act of 1972 provides that, when a statute has been amended, the unaltered portions of the original statute are to be construed as effective from the date of their original enactment:</p>
    <blockquote id="Afg" data-blocks='[["BL_439.11",439,[244,1795,1116,251]]]'>[PJortions of the statute which were not altered by the amendment shall be construed as effective from the time of their original enactment, and the new provisions shall be construed as effective only from the date when the amendment became effective.</blockquote>

Thus, PennDOT asserts that, in construing the OAC Act provision in question, reference should be made to the statutory definition of municipal corporation applicable to statutes enacted before December 31, 1974. Under that definition, townships are not municipal corporations. Penn-<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>DOT argues that they should therefore not be regarded as incorporated municipalities.</p>
    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[266,410,1158,693]]]'>Notwithstanding PennDOT’s argument and the fact that Patrick has not offered any counter-argument as to the interchangeability of the terms “municipal corporation” and “incorporated municipality,” it is, perhaps, not self-evident that the terms in question are identical in meaning. Nevertheless, it has long been recognized that townships exercise powers that are quasi-corporate in character. See <em>Trevorton Water Supply Co. v. Zerbe Township, </em><a href="/pa/259/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="259 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1038317" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0031-01">259 Pa. 31</a>, 35, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.%20328" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="102 A. 328">102 A. 328</a>, 329 (1917). The Commonwealth Court, in holding that townships are incorporated municipalities, focused upon townships’ powers to impose taxes, enact ordinances, file suits, convey property, enter contracts, etc. as evidence of their “corporate” existence.</p>

Inasmuch as the OAC Act was enacted prior to December 31, 1974, the definition set forth in paragraph (1) is operative. Since townships are not to be regarded as municipalities, it follows that, despite their exercise of certain powers that are quasi-corporate in nature, townships are not incorporated municipalities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Hence, the statutory <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>provision allowing advertising signs to be erected in incorporated municipalities is not applicable to townships.</p>

See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a) (“The object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.”). The OAC Act was a legislative response to the Federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (Federal Act), <a href="/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20131" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="23 U.S.C. § 131">23 U.S.C. § 131</a> et seq. The Federal Act was intended to protect the public investment in the interstate and primary highway system, to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel, and to preserve our nation’s natural beauty. <a href="/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20131" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="23 U.S.C. § 131">23 U.S.C. § 131</a>(a). It provided the Secretary of Transportation with authority to reduce by ten percent the amount of federal-aid highway funds being allocated to states that have not limited the construction of advertising signs within six hundred sixty feet of the rights-of-way of interstate and primary highways. <a href="/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20131" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="23 U.S.C. § 131">23 U.S.C. § 131</a>(b). The OAC Act was intended by our legislature to protect the Commonwealth’s interest in receiving federal-aid funds, and, at the same time, to further the national policy of highway beautification. Its goal was to limit the proliferation of advertising signs alongside our highways. See 36 P.S. § 2718.102 (purposes of the Act). The decision of the Commonwealth Court, which so broadly construed the exception allowing the construction of signs in incorporated municipalities, and, further, which erroneously deemed a major portion of the restrictive language in the exception to be mere surplusage, clearly undermined the legislative intent. The order of the Commonwealth Court must, therefore, be reversed.</p>
