The Board’s decision revoked an occupancy permit issued to the appellant, Thomas W. Limley. The permit would have enabled appellant to open a public restaurant and bar in a building that previously housed a non-profit private club. The factual background of the case is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[242,555,1156,585]]]'>In May of 1988, a building inspector in the Borough of Port Vue issued an occupancy permit allowing property formerly known as the Blue Rock Social Club (Blue Rock Club) to be converted into a public restaurant and bar. The property is located in an area which, under the applicable zoning ordinance, is classified as residential. In July of 1988, Edward J. Opatrny, appellee herein, filed an objection alleging that the permit was improperly issued. Opatrny asserted that the proposed use was a commercial one that was not permitted in an'area zoned as residential. The Board conducted a hearing, and, in August of 1988, revoked the occupancy permit.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.6",590,[240,1166,1156,258]]]'>The Board found that the Blue Rock Club was a nonconforming use because the club was not encompassed by a provision in the zoning ordinance listing “clubs” as permitted uses in residential areas.

On the basis that a chief activity of the Blue Rock Club was the sale of food and alcoholic beverages to its members and guests, such being an activity usually conducted as a business, the Board determined that the club was not a permitted use. Nevertheless, inasmuch as the club conducted its activities before the enactment of the ordinance, the Board concluded that the club constituted a legal noncon<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>forming use. The proposed use of the premises as a public restaurant and bar was not, however, viewed by the Board as a continuation of the existing use. Rather, it was deemed to be a new use which was prohibited by the zoning ordinance. Accordingly, the occupancy permit was revoked.</p>
