The cases of the twenty-nine appellees were consolidated<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in the interest of judicial economy and assigned to Judge Carolyn Engel Temin of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Trial Division, for disposition. Judge Temin found for appellees. Each appellee who had any portion of his case handled by Cunningham was granted new proceedings, <em>i.e., </em>adjudicatory proceedings, preliminary and <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>certification hearings, municipal court trials, and hearings on motions to quash.</p>
    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[199,420,1160,1184]]]'>The issue before this Court is whether it was a denial of the appellees’ right to a fair and impartial tribunal for a judge to preside over their cases without revealing circumstances that raise questions as to her impartiality. Specifically, Cunningham became an undercover agent for federal law enforcement authorities in exchange for a promise that those authorities would make her cooperation known to any agency that chose to prosecute her for accepting a gift from a potential litigant. In this instance, Cunningham’s potential prosecutors were the very individuals that appeared before her to prosecute the appellees. Restated, the question is whether the air of impropriety arising from such a setting is a sufficient basis for vitiating the proceedings without a demonstration of actual proof of prejudice. We hold herein that the impartiality of the court, which is a fundamental prerequisite of a fair trial, must be deemed compromised by appearance alone, thus eliminating the need for establishing actual prejudice. Therefore, for the reasons that follow, we affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming Judge Temin’s grant of new proceedings to all appellees whose cases were argued before Cunningham during the time she cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“F.B.I.”).</p>

Cunningham was recorded accepting a $300.00 gift from Steven Traitz, Jr., an official of the Roofers Union. Upon learning that the conversation had been recorded, and being confronted by federal authorities, Cunningham agreed to cooperate with the F.B.I. in an ongoing investigation involving cash gifts from the Roofers Union to various judges of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. One portion of the agreement stipulated that Cunningham would record conversations as requested by the F.B.I. This agreement clearly stated that no immunity from the prosecution or other disciplinary proceedings would be afforded. However, the agreement explicitly promised that federal authorities would make known to any <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>court or other investigating or prosecuting body the full extent of Cunningham’s cooperation.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[266,408,1157,690]]]'>Cunningham’s cooperation with the F.B.I. extended from February 12, 1986 through November 13, 1986. Cunningham wore a hidden recording device and secretly recorded conversations with two other judges, both of whom were subsequently indicted on federal charges arising out of cash gifts received from the Roofers Union. While working for the F.B.I., Cunningham continued to preside over criminal and juvenile matters. Her involvement was publicly disclosed on November 17, 1986. Prior to that date, Cunningham’s agreement was known only to her and her husband, certain officials of the F.B.I., and the office of the U.S. Attorney. Following the public disclosure of her involvement, this Court suspended Cunningham pending further investigation.</p>

Anthony McFall was one of the appellees represented by the Defender Association. Cunningham’s actions were challenged as violative of the Pennsylvania Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine, the federal constitutional guarantee of due process of law, and Pennsylvania case law requiring the recusal of a judge where even the appearance of impropriety surfaced.</p>

Accordingly, when the trial judge is discovered to have had some basis for rendering a biased judgment, his actual motivations are hidden from review, and we must presume that the process was impaired.” <em><a href="/us/474/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="474 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="6203718" data-case-paths="/us/474/0254-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/474/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="474 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="6203718" data-case-paths="/us/474/0254-01">at 263</a>, <a href="/us/474/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="474 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="6203718" data-case-paths="/us/474/0254-01">106 S.Ct. at 623</a>, <a href="/us/474/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="474 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="6203718" data-case-paths="/us/474/0254-01">88 L.Ed.2d at 609</a>.</p>

The public is not aware of the conduct at the time of its commission, therefore, there cannot be an “appearance” of anything. Rather, I view the conduct of Cunningham as abhorrent and a complete denial of a fair trial to those brought before her while she sat as a judge in the criminal court. I view this as actual misconduct at the time of its commission and not as an appearance of impropriety long after the commission of the misconduct.</p>

Under such circumstances, every judge must know that recusal is in order. Cunningham’s refusal to recuse and ask for assignment to another division of the court amounts to misconduct in my view. The possibility that such a reassignment <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>may have brought to light her clandestine operations must be weighed lightly in comparison with the heavy adherence to which we ascribe the principles of a fair and impartial judge presiding over the fate of those brought before the bar of the criminal courts. Their rights cannot be sacrificed for the sake of possibly bringing to justice other miscreants.</p>
