One way of summing up all the qualities described in this definition of a valid exercise of discretionary power is to say that the decision had merit. Conversely, if the reason for performing a discretionary act had no merit, then the trial court abused its discretion. Thus, when viewed in terms of the degree of scrutiny that should be applied, an inquiry into an abuse of discretion is operationally equivalent as one into the merit of the trial court’s decision.</p>

Like many of our cases, <em>Penneys </em>and <em>Keefer </em>use the term “abuse of discretion” to connote a relatively broad scope of review. Under this procedure, if the trial court leaves open the possibility that it would have ordered a new trial for reasons other than those specifically mentioned, then an appellate court must affirm the decision if any reason appears in the record for doing so. In other words, the reasons cited need not be sufficient to justify a new trial as long as the record discloses that another reason, which is sufficient, exists. Such was the case in <em>Guida v.

This is the only way an appellate court can perform its reviewing functions in such a case without invading an area of decision making that is properly committed to the trial court. However, the risk of improperly interfering with the trial court’s discretionary power is not present when the trial court leaves open the possibility that it would have ordered a new trial for reasons other than those specified.

Furthermore, it is clear that the court’s decision to grant that motion was prejudicial to Coker. Since the error at issue is not <em>per se </em>prejudicial, we <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>must review the record to determine whether there is a factual basis to support the trial court’s conclusion that Coker was denied the opportunity to prove his case, which is equivalent to saying that he was prejudiced. We are convinced that there is.</p>
    <p id="b703-4" data-blocks='[["BL_703.5",703,[202,562,1158,511]]]'>Our review of the record confirms the trial court’s observations that Coker had to rely on his own testimony to establish the pain he was suffering, that Flickinger attacked the credibility of this testimony, and that Coker was unable to respond to this attack by offering evidence relating to the force and impact of the collision. These facts in turn support the trial court’s conclusion that its evidentiary ruling prevented Coker from introducing evidence that was fundamental to the proof of his case. Having prejudiced Coker in this way, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered a new trial.</p>

Part of the Superior Court’s difficulties can be attributed to the way in which <em>Westinghouse </em>characterized the rules of appellate review. As the following discussion will illustrate, the terms that were used fail to accurately and completely identify crucial considerations that should guide an appellate court’s review. To that extent, <em>Westinghouse </em>should be disregarded.</p>
