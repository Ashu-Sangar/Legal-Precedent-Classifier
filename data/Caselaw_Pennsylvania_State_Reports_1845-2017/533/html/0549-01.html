On December 6, 1989, Tarnopolski, in accordance with Pa.R.Crim.P. 62, 63, pled not guilty to the charge, and returned the citation to the district justice. The district justice set a hearing for February 6, 1990. According to the testimony of Tarnopolski, on January 4, 1990 her father <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>requested an earlier hearing date since the February 6 hearing date conflicted with her school schedule. After the district justice found that an earlier date could not be arranged, her father paid the fine for underage drinking. The district justice found that the father’s payment of the fine was an admission of guilt by Tarnopolski. On January 4, 1990, the district justice certified Tarnopolski’s conviction for underage drinking to DOT. 18 Pa.C.S. § 6310.4.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The fact that the magistrate committed a patent legal error by entering the plea upon Tarnopolski’s father’s payment of a fine does not permit Tarnopolski to challenge her criminal conviction in a collateral civil proceeding. Rather, DOT argues that Tarnopolski must correct the magistrate’s error by appealing the judgment of sentence of the underlying criminal conviction for underage drinking. DOT then reasons that the magistrate’s subsequent dismissal of the criminal charge should not be given evidentiary weight <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>at the license revocation proceedings because any action taken after the initial conviction was a nullity. <em>See </em>Pa.Crim.R.P. 86(g);<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Tarnopolski responds that evidence of the March 20, 1990 dismissal of the underage drinking charge rebutted DOT’s evidence of conviction.</p>
    <p id="b801-4" data-blocks='[["BL_801.5",801,[177,781,1161,473]]]'>The Commonwealth Court held that the exclusive method for challenging a summary conviction is through an appeal of that conviction to the trial court. Therefore, once the conviction was not appealed, District Justice Balliet did not have jurisdiction to alter any determination of guilt. The court further held that since Tarnopolski cannot collaterally attack the validity of the underlying criminal conviction during a civil license suspension proceeding, the Commonwealth has met its burden of proof that the licensee was in fact convicted.</p>
    <p id="b801-5" data-blocks='[["BL_801.6",801,[177,1278,1158,781]]]'>In essence, the Commonwealth Court held that Tarnopolski is not entitled to relief because of her failure to challenge, by direct appeal, the underlying summary conviction. However, the Commonwealth Court’s analysis is flawed because the unauthorized guilty plea was withdrawn. Tarnopolski requested and received reinstatement of her prior not guilty plea. This reinstatement, by necessity, would require the magistrate to permit a withdrawal of the January 4, 1990 guilty plea. Once the guilty plea is withdrawn, and the charge for underage drinking dismissed, there was no longer a conviction to appeal. Further, the Commonwealth did not object to reinstatement of the not guilty plea during the underlying criminal proceedings and cannot now challenge whether the district justice committed legal error in permitting the withdrawal.</p>

In <em>Liptak, </em>the Superior Court interpreted Rule 86(g) to preclude a party from withdrawing a guilty plea to a summary conviction subsequent to sentencing. We do not find <em>Liptak </em>to be an accurate interpretation of Rule 86(g), and to the extent that it stands for the proposition that a defendant cannot withdraw a guilty plea subsequent to sentencing in a summary proceeding, it is expressly overruled. Rule 86(g) discusses the method of appealing a summary offense, and does not foreclose a post-sentence petition to withdraw a plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Therefore, the district justice did have jurisdiction to permit a withdrawal of the guilty plea, and the subsequent dismissal of the underage drinking charge was not a nullity.</p>
