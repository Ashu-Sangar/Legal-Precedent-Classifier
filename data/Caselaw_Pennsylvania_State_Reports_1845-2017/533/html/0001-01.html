According to J.K’s testimony, the Appellant offered her cocaine and she accepted because she was curious. She testified that she agreed to let Appellant lick cocaine from her breasts and that Appellant subsequently performed oral sex on her. It was J.K.’s testimony that this conduct occurred repeatedly during June and July of 1983.

He testified that after he and his wife had separated in April, 1984, J.K. returned to help him renovate the house that had been the family’s residence. Appellant testified that during this period of time, when they were alone in the house one evening, J.K. came down to the den wearing only a tee shirt and underpants. He requested that she “put something on”, but instead she initiated a conversation about sex. It was also Appellant’s testimony that they ultimately engaged in both oral and vaginal intercourse. Appellant further testified that drugs were never involved. The Appellant concluded his testimony by describing two subsequent opportunities for sexual contact which did not culminate in intercourse.</p>

Evidence had been introduced at trial that the <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>complainant had told her boyfriend on January 27, 1984, that she had experienced oral intercourse with <em>an </em>older man. This admission is reasonably construed to mean that the complainant had experienced oral intercourse with only <em>one </em>older man and that the reference was to Appellant. In this context, evidence that the complainant had previously testified that an older man, not her stepfather, had induced her to have oral intercourse by offering her cocaine while she was under the age of sixteen, would have supported a reasonable inference that the Appellant was not <em>the </em>older man the complainant referred to when she admitted an incident of oral intercourse to Hils. Given the fact that the complainant did not immediately identify the Appellant to Hils as the older man, but only did so in the Spring of 1986, some two years later, and after the Appellant had, concededly, engaged in intercourse with her, the excluded evidence might have played a significant role in the jury’s determination of whether the claim against the Appellant actually occurred prior to January 27, 1984. The possibility that the excluded evidence might have had a significant impact on the jury’s determination is enhanced by the fact that the complainant’s testimony was inconsistent and confused and did not correlate with her initial statements to the police.</p>

First, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the night the complainant exchanged confidences with Hils was so momentous an event that Hils had inked “A night to remember, K.H. + J.K., 1-27-84,” on the ceiling of the dressing room. The Commonwealth introduced a photograph of the graffiti.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
