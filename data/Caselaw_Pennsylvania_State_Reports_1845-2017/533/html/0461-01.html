He received workmen’s compensation benefits from February 25, 1985 to June 13, <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>1986. He had arthroscopic surgery on March 5, 1985, and then developed pain and swelling in his left leg, attributable to a blood clot. He continued to have pain and swelling, which his treating physician attributed to deep venous insufficiency. Appellant returned to work for a few days, but could not continue. Eventually, Appellee assigned him to a light-duty job, and Appellant received partial disability benefits. Then, on June 26, 1986, Appellee laid off Appellant and other employees.</p>

    <blockquote id="b711-6" data-blocks='[["BL_711.6",711,[251,1015,1118,957]]]'>2. Based upon the competent and credible testimony offered by the deposition of Dr. Stanley E. Falor, it is found as a matter of fact that the claimant’s work-related knee injury had resolved itself to the extent that the Claimant was capable of returning to his prior employment. The Claimant presented the deposition testimony of Dr. Charles Andrew Heiskell. The Defendant presented the deposition testimony of Dr. Falor. Both physicians testified regarding the Claimant’s physical condition as a result of the work-related injury. Claimant had arthroscopic knee surgery performed by Dr. David Stoll on March 4, 1985. The Claimant’s physician, Dr. Heiskell, began treating Claimant for a deep venous thrombosis in March of 1985. The thrombosis or blood clot caused scarring in the calves of the veins<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in the Claimant’s left leg which caused the Claimant’s occasional complaints of pain and swelling. This is the underlying and fundamental reason why the Claimant is unable to perform his pre-injury employment.</blockquote>

The testimony of Dr. Heiskell and Dr. Falor regarding the Claimant’s current condition is highly equivocal as far as it relates to the work injury.

      <em>2. </em>The causal connection between the physical condition of the Claimant as a result of the deep venous thrombosis or blood clot and the injuries sustained by the Claimant on February 24, 1985, is not obvious. Therefore, the burden of proof if upon the Claimant to establish that relationship by unequivocal medical testimony. The testimony of Dr. Heiskell and Dr. Stanley E.

The divided panel of the Commonwealth Court noted that the referee had erroneously placed the burden on Appellant to prove the causal relationship between his injury and his remaining disability. However, it found the error to be harmless, because substantial evidence supported the referee’s finding that the Appellant had recovered from his work-related injury. <em>Gumro v. W.C.A.B.

This Court held that once a Notice of Compensation Payable was filed, the burden is on the employer to prove that the disability has changed to justify a termination. <em><a href="/pa/502/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="502 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="1784510" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0178-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/502/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="502 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="1784510" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0178-01">at 182</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="502 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="1784510" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0178-01">465 A.2d at 971</a>.

The evidence ruled upon by the referee, and later the Commonwealth Court, does not fulfill the employer’s burden to prove that the causal relationship no longer exists, nor does it prove that an independent cause arose after the injury.
