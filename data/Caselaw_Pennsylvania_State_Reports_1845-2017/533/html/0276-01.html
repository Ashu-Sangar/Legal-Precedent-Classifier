    <p id="b525-12" data-blocks='[["BL_525.13",525,[214,1570,1159,529]]]'>This case raises the question of the scope of a defendant’s right to cross-examine a prosecution witness with respect to the witness’s pending criminal charges in order to establish a possible evil motive for the witness to testify adversely to the defendant. At appellant’s trial, the court prohibited appellant from questioning the witness about his pending charges of kidnapping and attempted rape, as they were not <em>crimen falsi </em>offenses, permitting reference to them only as “serious felony charges.” The Superior Court held that this was harmless error, <a href="/citations/?q=413%20Pa.%20Super.%20655" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="413 Pa. Super. 655">413 Pa.Super. 655</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=596%20A.2d%20252" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="596 A.2d 252">596 A.2d 252</a>.</p>

One of the prosecution witnesses, George Thomas, who testi<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>fíed that appellant had confessed to the murder, was himself, at the time of appellant’s trial, faced with prosecution on charges of robbery, theft, kidnapping, and attempted rape. Appellant’s counsel, on cross-examination, attempted to interrogate him about the charges to explore a possible motivation for the witness to testify falsely against appellant in order to gain favorable treatment in the separate prosecution he was facing. The trial court permitted reference to the charges of robbery and theft, but prohibited reference to the charges of kidnapping and attempted rape, allowing defense counsel to refer to the latter charges as “other felonies of a serious nature.” The reason for the limitation was that attempted rape and kidnapping are not <em>crimen falsi </em>offenses and thus carry no implication of mendacity; if the witness were convicted of these offenses, the convictions could not be used to impeach his credibility.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[240,1144,1158,682]]]'>The trial court improperly intermingled the concepts of impeachment by prior <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions and impeachment for bias stemming from outstanding criminal charges in the same jurisdiction. Impeachment on the latter basis does not depend on the nature of the offense as one evidencing dishonesty, but on the severity of the penalties attending possible conviction of any type of offense, potentially creating a bias due to a motive to aid in the prosecution in order to obtain concessions in the witness’s pending prosecution. Thus, as the Superior Court recognized, distinguishing between the <em>crimen falsi </em>charges and the other charges was erroneous. We must decide whether the Superior Court was correct in holding the error to be harmless.</p>

T'he scope of cross-examination is within the discretion of the trial judge. In lengthy in camera discussions prior to the testimony of the witness in question, the trial judge concluded that reference to outstanding charges of robbery, theft, and “other felonies of a serious nature” would give the jury adequate information on which to assess the bias and credibility of the witness. On cross-examination, the witness volunteered that he had been charged with kidnapping, though defense counsel had not mentioned that offense. Thus, the jury was informed that the witness was facing open charges of robbery, theft, kidnapping, and other serious felony -charges. The addition of the specific offense of attempted rape would have had merely the effect of smearing the witness much more than clarifying the witness’s possible bias in aid of the prosecution.</p>

It clearly made no difference to the defense that the court had restricted cross-examination to omit reference to the attempted rape charge, for counsel did not emphasize the other felony charges referred to on cross-examination — theft and kidnapping — nor did he refer to “other felonies of a serious nature,” but limited his argument to an “open robbery case.”</p>

It is quite <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>clear that the court in this case permitted sufficient latitude on cross-examination to inform the jury that the witness, faced with multiple outstanding felony charges in the same jurisdiction, might be biased against appellant in order to obtain favorable treatment in his own prosecution.
