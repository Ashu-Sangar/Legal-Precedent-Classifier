    <p id="b721-8" data-blocks='[["BL_721.8",721,[216,1258,1158,1071]]]'>In <em>Ruzzi, </em>we considered an indemnity clause in a construction contract entered into between the owners of a gasoline service station and a petroleum company. The contract covered the petroleum company’s reconstruction of the service station for the owners and provided that the property owners would indemnify the petroleum company “from any and all liability for claims for loss, damage, injury or other casualty to persons or property, ... caused or occasioned by any leakage, fire, explosion or other casualty occurring through any imperfection in, injury or damage to, or by reason of the installation, use, operation and/or repair of the said equipment or of the premises.” We ruled that, in interpreting the validity and enforceability of indemnity clauses the law would not recognize as effective an agreement concerning negligent acts unless an express stipulation concerning the indemnitee’s negligence was included in the document. Our authority for this rule of interpretation was found in <em>Perry v. Payne, </em><a href="/pa/217/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="217 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="953727" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0252-01">217 Pa. 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. 553</a> (1907), which we held to be a well established rule of contract interpretation in such circumstances and reaffirmed its continuing viability.</p>

In contracts of indemnity, this principle is applied with a force that requires the parties to state in express terms that the active negligence of the indemnitee will be assumed by the indemnitor.</p>
    <p id="b722-4" data-blocks='[["BL_722.5",722,[234,774,1164,961]]]'>As we stated in <em>Perry, </em>“The liability on such indemnity is so hazardous, and the character of the indemnity so unusual and extraordinary, that there can be no presumption that the indemnitor intended to assume the responsibility unless the contract puts it beyond doubt by express stipulation.

' Cannon </em>also stands for the same proposition of contract interpretation, i.e., that the provisions and terms of a lease must clearly and unequivocally spell out the intent to grant immunity and relief from liability, and is illustrative of how the general rule is applied when the interpretation of a lease is before the court.</p>

Although I am cognizant of the several differences between exculpatory clauses and indemnity clauses, the nature of these clauses is so similar that the rules of law applicable to one should be applicable to the other. In fact, the rules of construction, as outlined above, applied to determine the validity and enforceability of exculpatory and indemnity clauses are identical. That is, both clauses must be construed strictly against the drafter, must spell out the intention of the parties with great particularity without the use of words of general import, and the burden to prove immunity is placed upon the party seeking to avoid liability.

If the words “any and all liability”, examined under identical standards, are words of general import in <em>Ruzzi, </em>then they are words of general import in this case as well. I simply cannot understand why the same words, interpreted under the same standards, can be sufficiently precise in one case, yet be words of general import in another. The law on exculpatory clauses has not been static since <em>Cannon. </em>There has been a trend in <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>the cases which disfavors the liberal interpretation of these clauses given in <em>Cannon. </em>The <em>Ruzzi </em>decision is more consistent with the general rule of contract interpretation which requires contracts to be construed strictly against the drafter, and which disfavors contracts providing for immunity of parties from their own negligent acts. To protect itself from liability, all a lessor needs to do is to expressly stipulate in a contract of its own making that it will be relieved of responsibility for damages “caused by or resulting from the negligence of the lessor.” <em>Jacob Siegel Co. v.
