The Lehigh County District Attorney’s office sent appellee a letter on September 22, 1988 directing him to appear in court on October 6, 1988 for the purpose of having his case diverted from a criminal prosecution into the pretrial probationary program known as ARD. The letter explained that only those individuals who were first time offenders (having no DUI conviction or ARD participation relating to DUI within the last seven years) were eligible for admission to the program.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The letter also informed appellee that to be admitted to the ARD program, it would be necessary for him to complete a Court Reporting Network (CRN) evaluation. Appellee appeared in court on October 6, 1988 and upon motion of the district attorney was admitted into the ARD program.</p>

It is not the duty of the Commonwealth to go on a hunting expedition on these matters. There is an equal or greater responsibility on the defendant, who is in a position to know, to come forward and make known his prior offenses.

The defendant in <em>McSorley </em>was not found to have withheld information of his prior convictions, and his admission into the ARD program was the result of what Superior Court characterized as the district attorney’s office acting inadvertently.
