Appellant was 16 years old at the time of the offenses, and the court ordered him to remain as committed to the Sleighton School, a juvenile commitment facility. Appellant filed post-verdict motions, which the court denied, and then filed a timely notice of appeal in the Superior Court. While his appeal was pending in the Superior Court, appellant escaped from the Sleighton School on June 22, 1990. The trial court then issued a bench warrant for appellant’s arrest. Approximately four months after appellant’s escape, the Commonwealth filed in the Superior Court an application to quash appellant’s appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1972(e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

These serious considerations do not turn on whether or not the defendant is a juvenile. Flight by juveniles, like their adult counterparts, imperils the ability of the Commonwealth to retry their cases, should that be necessary, because of the failing memories of witnesses, the unavailability or death of witnesses and the loss or deterioration of evidence. Additionally, flight by juvenile defendants is no less disruptive of the appellate process than flight by adult defendants. A fugitive juvenile is equally unresponsive to the appellate courts. Moreover, many juveniles are far from being docile offenders. They are increasingly sophisticated and responsible for a substantial number of violent crimes.
