We are also asked to determine whether the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose so extend. For the following reasons, we hold that the express warranty does explicitly extend to future performance of the goods but that the implied warranties do not.

Upon reargument, however, the court granted the motion on the basis that the action was barred by the four-year statute of limitations at 13 Pa.C.S. § 2725: Although the action had been filed within four years of the date the car allegedly malfunctioned or displayed a defect, it had not been filed within four years of the date of tender of delivery. The trial court deemed the cause of action to have accrued upon tender of delivery because the court specifically found that the express, 12 month/12,000 mile warranty did not “explicitly extend to future performance of the goods” and therefore that the “discovery rule” exception of § 2725 did not apply.

      <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>We cannot accept Appellee’s position for a number of reasons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> First, we do not read the words “explicitly extends to future performance of the vehicle” to require that the warranty make an explicit promise regarding how the goods will perform in the future. We believe that the focus of § 2725 is not on <em>what </em>is promised, but on the duration of the promise— <em>ie., </em>the period to which the promise extends. <em>Cf. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Certainteed Corp., </em><a href="/sw2d/710/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="710 S.W.2d 544" data-case-ids="9977224" data-case-paths="/sw2d/710/0544-01">710 S.W.2d 544</a>, 549 (Tex. a986) (Robertson, J., concurring) (pointing out that “explicitly” modifies the words “extends,” and not the word “warranty”; therefore, it is the extension that must be explicit). Therefore, we agree with Appellant that the phrase “explicitly <em>extends to </em>future performance” can be interpreted to include a promise that, by its terms, comes into play upon, or is contingent upon, the future performance of the goods. There can be little doubt that an explicit extension has been given where the warranty itself plainly states that it “is for 12 months or 12,000 miles” and that “[t]he warranty periods <em>begins on </em>the date the car is first delivered or put in use.” (R 25 (emphasis added).) Logically, a promise to repair or adjust defective parts within the first 12 months or 12,000 miles after delivery cannot be breached until the vehicle <em>requires </em>repair <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>or adjustment, and “discovery of the breach must await the time of [future] performance.” 13 Pa.C.S. § 2725(b).</p>
    <p id="b680-4" data-blocks='[["BL_680.5",680,[223,430,1160,1418]]]'>Second, the essence of Appellee’s position is that the document here is not a warranty, but a promise to repair or replace defective parts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> To be sure, the agreement here is not a model of clear draftsmanship. It could plausibly be interpreted any one of three ways: as creating a warranty that extends for 12 months or 12,000 miles, with a limited remedy of repair or adjustment for breach of the warranty; as creating not a warranty, but a repair agreement that extends 12 months or 12,000 miles; or as creating an “un-extended” warranty with a limited remedy of repair or adjustment if a breach is reported within 12 months or 12,000 miles. However, any difficulty interpreting the agreement must be resolved in favor of the non-drafting party. <em>See, e.g., Rusiski v. Pribonic, </em><a href="/pa/511/0383-02" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="511 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1798715,1798732" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0383-02,/pa/511/0383-01">511 Pa. 383</a>, 390, <a href="/pa/511/0383-02" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="511 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1798715,1798732" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0383-02,/pa/511/0383-01">515 A.2d 507</a>, 510 (1986); <em>Central Transportation, Inc. v.

It was the Appellee who drafted the document here, labeled it a “warranty,” and included statements such as: “Chevrolet Motor Division, General Motors Corporation, <em>warrants </em>each new 1982 car” and “This <em>warranty </em>is for 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first.” (R 25 (emphasis added).) If the drafter did not intend the document to operate as a warranty — and, more importantly for our purposes, if it did not intend the warranty to “[be] for 12 months or 12,000 miles,” (R 25) — then it should have stated so more clearly.</p>

On the one hand, Appellee’s position depends upon calling the document a warranty, because only then can it argue that the cause of action accrued upon tender of delivery. <em>See </em>13 Pa.C.S. § 2725(b). On the other hand, Appellee argues that the “warranty” promises nothing about the condition or performance of the car, but is simply a promise to repair or replace defective parts.

However, even if “repair or replace” warranties are viewed as remedies rather than as warranties, they do not fit strictly into the conceptual framework established by the provisions of the UCC, and a conceptually satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved. <em>See generally </em>Klinger, <em>A Tangled Web, </em>89 Dick.L.Rev. at 943-950 (pointing out difficulty in distinguishing between limited warranty and limited remedy and in applying warranty and remedy provisions of UCC to “repair or replace” warranties). We also note that, although “repair or replace” warranties are not traditional warranties, they do fit within the modern concept of warranty. For example, the federal MagnusonMoss Warranty Act includes in its definition of “warranty” any undertaking in writing in connection with the sale by a supplier of a consumer product to refund, repair, replace, or take other remedial action with respect to such product in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking ...</p>

If Appellee’s position were to prevail, the protection afforded the buyer during the latter part of a warranty approaching four years would be largely illusory, as the buyer would have a very short period of time in which to bring a cause of action for breach.

In addition, nothing in our analysis would prevent the parties from reducing the period of limitation in accordance with § 2725(a), which provides that “[b]y the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it,” provided, of course, that the period is reduced in a. way that is not unconscionable. <em>See generally </em>13 Pa.C.S. § 2302.</p>

It does not follow, however, that because a certain time period is specified a warranty necessarily applies to future <em>performance of the goods. </em>The scope of the <em>warranty </em>— what is promised — may be something other than a representation about how the goods will perform and yet still contain a specified time period.</p>

It is true that the adverb “explicitly” modifies the verb “extends” and not the noun “warranty,” and thus it is the extension that must be explicit. In this context, however, the verb “extend” does not merely describe temporal duration, as the majority suggests. Rather, it describes scope or application. The conceptual difficulty with this case is that the Appellant characterized the warranty as a representation “that said vehicle would be free from defects in material and workmanship, for at least 12 months or 12,000 miles,” Complaint ¶ 8, in order to bring this action within the exception of 13 Pa.C.S. § 2725(b), when in fact the warranty was not so worded.</p>

It is thus entirely sensible that in setting out when a cause of action accrues, the Code states that “[a] breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.” 13 Pa.C.S. § 2725(b). Since a warranty as defined by the Code is a promise as to qualities of the goods, if the goods, when tendered, possess the qualities promised, the warranty has been satisfied; if the goods, when tendered, do not possess the promised qualities, the warranty has been breached. In the limited case where the promise is that the goods will have certain qualities, or will perform in a certain way, at a time beyond when the goods are delivered, it cannot be determined at the time of delivery whether the goods possess the promised qualities. Because the promise endures over a period of time, whether a breach has occurred can only be determined when the specified time has passed.</p>

The only promise was that any repairs and adjustments to correct <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>defects in materials or workmanship would be made free of charge during the specified period. This promise related to the seller’s obligations under the contract, not to the quality of the goods. Although this document is a warranty in the general sense in that it guarantees or promises something, it is not a warranty as to the quality of the car or as to its performance.</p>
    <p id="b687-4" data-blocks='[["BL_687.5",687,[213,663,1162,792]]]'>Indeed, as the majority notes, “although ‘repair and replace’ warranties are not traditional warranties, they do fit within the modern concept of warranty,” and a document such as the one involved here fits within the definition of “warranty” under the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202301" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2301">15 U.S.C. § 2301</a>(6)(b). Opinion at 432-33. This, I believe, is the ultimate source of the difficulty in this case. General Motors, selling its product in a national market, produces a standard document that includes a promise to repair or adjust defective parts. Under federal law, such a promise is properly captioned a warranty. Unfortunately, it does not “fit[ ] neatly within the UCC view of warranties.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202301" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2301">Id.</a> </em>When an action is later brought under the UCC, GM suffers the consequence of having the “difficulty interpreting the agreement,” <em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202301" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2301">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202301" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2301">at 432</a>, be resolved against it, the drafter.</p>
    <p id="b687-5" data-blocks='[["BL_687.6",687,[212,1478,1160,628]]]'>I think it entirely unjust to apply this rule of construction in these circumstances. As noted above, the Appellant miseharacterized the nature of the warranty in order to bring it within the exception to the limitations period under § 2725(b) of the UCC. To my mind, the Appellant is as much responsible for the “difficulty interpreting the agreement” as the Appellee. Had the action been brought under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2310">15 U.S.C. § 2310</a>(d)(1)(A), the “difficulty” would not have arisen. The warranty could then have been analyzed as a promise as to the Appellee’s conduct and a determination made whether the failure, or practical inability, to repair the vehicle constituted a breach of that promise.</p>
    <p id="b687-6" data-blocks='[["BL_687.7",687,[212,2129,1157,205]],["BL_688.1",688,[240,270,1159,640]]]'>This analysis also avoids the “problem” identified by the majority with respect to warranties of duration longer than four years. <em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2310">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2310">at 431, n. 8</a>; <em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2310">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 2310">at 433-35</a>. Because such warranties set forth promises as to the seller’s conduct during <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>a specified period of time, any breach of such promise will occur, and therefore any cause of action for breach of such promise will accrue, only after the lapse of time. Thus, for example, under a seven year/seventy thousand mile “repair and adjust” warranty, if a defect appeared in the fifth year, there would no longer be an action for breach of warranty to claim that the car was not of the quality bargained for, but the seller would still be obligated by the terms of the contract to make the necessary repairs or adjustments. Refusal to do so would be actionable as a breach, the cause of action accruing at the time of the breach and the limitation period extending four years from that point.</p>
    <p id="b688-4" data-blocks='[["BL_688.5",688,[239,936,1157,638]]]'>In the case presently before the Court, if the defect was such that the car delivered was not in fact possessed of a quality that had been bargained for, a breach of warranty action pursuant to the UCC could have been maintained. Such claim, however, would have to have been brought within four years of the date of delivery. Because this action was not commenced within four years of delivery, the Appellant could no longer make such a claim. Instead, the Appellant attempted to make the seller’s promise into something that it plainly is not — a guarantee of the future performance of the car — in order to bring the action within the exception of the statutory limitation period.</p>
    <p id="b688-5" data-blocks='[["BL_688.6",688,[236,1601,1157,422]]]'>Had the Appellant alleged that the seller breached the promise that it had made, the action would have been timely and the grant of summary judgment would have been improper. The Appellant made no such allegation. It was not alleged that the seller refused to make repairs or needed adjustments to correct defects in material or workmanship; nor was it alleged that any such refusal was the cause of the Appellant’s damages.</p>

The majority also errs in perceiving an internal inconsistency in the appellee’s argument based on its erroneous characterization of the argument. The appellee argues that if the warranty is construed as a promise about the quality or condition of the car, it does not "explicitly extend to future performance,” therefore an action under that theory had to be commenced within four years of the date of delivery. If, however, the warranty is construed as a promise to repair, I believe the Appellee would concede that the four year limitation would not have commenced until this promise had been breached, <em>if the complaint had alleged this as the basis for the action.</em>
