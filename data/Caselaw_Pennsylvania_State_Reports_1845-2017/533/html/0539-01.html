On Mai'ch 27, 1990, the trial court, in response to appellant’s petition, issued an order pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b) certifying that its March 21 order involved controlling questions of law and that an appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter. It did not find that the double jeopardy claims raised by appellant were frivolous.</p>

Pursuant to the then-effective Arizona capital sentencing statute, the trial judge, sitting as finder of fact, found the aggravating circumstance of "crime committed in especially heinous manner” was present and that the aggravating circumstance of "pecuniary gain” was not present. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the conviction. It held that the evidence was insufficient to support the "especially heinous" circumstance and the trial court erred in finding that the circumstance of "pecuniary gain” was not present, suggesting that it could be found in the future.</p>
      <p id="b792-7" data-blocks='[["BL_792.8",792,[282,1586,1125,508]]]'>Following the conviction of defendants at the second trial, the prosecution argued the circumstances of "especially heinous” and of "pecuniary gain.” It also presented a circumstance not argued at the first trial, i.e., "previous conviction of a felony involving the threat or use of violence to another person.” The trial judge found all three present and again sentenced the defendants to death. The Arizona Supreme Court rejected the defendants’ argument that the court’s previous determination that the evidence failed to support the "especially heinous” aggravating circumstance barred reimposition of the death penalty since its holding was not tantamount to a death penalty acquittal. The court then again found the evidence insufficient to support "especially heinous” but sufficient to support "pecuniary gain” for both brothers and found the "prior conviction” ground for one brother.</p>
      <p id="b792-8" data-blocks='[["BL_792.9",792,[282,2100,1121,225]]]'>The United States Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that the reimposition of the death penalty did not violate the double jeopardy clause because the Arizona Supreme Court did not "acquit” the brothers of the death penalty by finding the evidence insufficient to support the sole aggravating circumstances found by the sentencer, i.e., "especially heinous manner.”</p>
