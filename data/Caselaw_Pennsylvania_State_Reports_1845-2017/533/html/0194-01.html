    <p id="b446-7" data-blocks='[["BL_446.8",446,[232,1362,1156,366]]]'>Jermyn’s first claim is that it was error for trial counsel to fail to ask questions of defendant at trial in such a manner as to allow him to testify in his own defense and deny the charges against him. The record indicates that Jermyn confessed to trial and pre-trial counsel his culpability in the crime charged and that trial counsel was aware of both confessions. At the PCRA hearing, Jermyn testified as follows:</p>

      <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>Counsel’s treatment of the problem was reasonable, for while he was obligated to defer to his client’s insistence on testifying, he was also obligated not to participate in the lie that he believed his client would state. The impact of counsel’s conduct, thus, was to impede Jermyn’s ability to he to the jury. But Jermyn’s ability to lie to the jury is not, of course, protected, and counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to promote it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This claim is without merit because counsel acted reasonably within the constraints of ethical requirements.</p>

Moreover, Jermyn has not cited conflicting decisions from other states or from the federal circuits. We conclude, therefore, that counsel’s failure to file a writ of certiorari was reasonable and that Jermyn’s assertion of ineffectiveness is without merit.</p>

In addition, those venirepersons thought to be unfavorably disposed to the positions of the respective parties may be removed through the exercise of peremptory challenges.

      <blockquote id="b447-14" data-blocks='[["BL_447.14",447,[266,899,1092,343]]]'>Whether an advocate for a criminally accused has the same duty of disclosure has been intensely debated. While it is agreed that the lawyer should seek to persuade the client to refrain from perjurious testimony, there has been dispute concerning the lawyer’s duty when that persuasion fails. If the confrontation with the client occurs before trial, the lawyer ordinarily can withdraw. Withdrawal before trial may not be possible, however, either because trial is imminent, or because the confrontation with the client does not take place until the trial itself, or because no other counsel is available.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b447-15" data-blocks='[["BL_447.15",447,[266,1247,1091,303]]]'>The most difficult situation, therefore, arises in a criminal case where the accused insists on testifying when the lawyer knows that the testimony is perjurious. The lawyer’s effort to rectify the situation can increase the likelihood of the client’s being convicted as well as opening the possibility of a prosecution for perjury. On the other hand, if the lawyer does not exercise control over the proof, the lawyer participates, although in a merely passive way, in deception of the court.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b447-16" data-blocks='[["BL_447.16",447,[265,1559,1091,347]]]'>Three resolutions of this dilemma have been proposed. One is to permit the accused to testify by a narrative without guidance through the lawyer’s questioning. This compromises both contending principles; it exempts the lawyer from the duty to disclose false evidence but subjects the client to an implicit disclosure of information imparted to counsel. Another suggested resolution, of relatively recent origin, is that the advocate be entirely excused from the duty to reveal peijuiy if the peijury is that of the client. This is a coherent solution but makes the advocate a knowing instrument of perjury.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b447-17" data-blocks='[["BL_447.17",447,[265,1910,1091,347]]]'>The other resolution of the dilemma is that the lawyer must reveal the client’s perjury if necessary to rectify the situation. A criminal accused has a right to the assistance of an advocate, a right to testify and a right of confidential communication with counsel. However, an accused should not have a right to assistance of counsel in committing peijury. Furthermore, an advocate has an obligation, not only in professional ethics but under the law as well, to avoid implication in the commission of perjury or other falsification of evidence. See Rule 1.2(d).</blockquote>
