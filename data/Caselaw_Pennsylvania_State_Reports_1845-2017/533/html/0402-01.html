On December 3, 1982, Nicholas Marianov won $3,460,973.04 in the Pennsylvania LOTTO Jackpot drawing. The prize was payable in 21 annual installments of $164,808.24, less taxes.

Brady wherein Palitz and Brady purchased Marianov’s remaining rights to the prize (“Agreement”).

    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[227,568,1156,259]]]'>On August 22, 1990, Marianov filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County a “Petition to Approve Assignment of Lottery Prize,” asserting that section 8 of the State Lottery Law, 72 P.S. § 3761-8, provided the court with the authority to approve such a transaction. This section provides:</p>

The Court of Common Pleas determined that the phrase “pursuant to an appropriate judicial order” made it appropriate for a court to exercise its discretion in determining whether “a purported assignment is reasonable or in the best interests of the parties involved, including both the Commonwealth and the prize winner.” (T.C.O. 7). The trial court then analyzed the totality of the circumstances of the assignment and determined that there is no reason in law or logic that the assignment should not be approved.</p>

The court held that, although not termed as such, this was an action in mandamus seeking to compel the Department to recognize the assignment. The court reasoned that since no tribunal other than Commonwealth Court was vested with the <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>authority to entertain such a cause of action brought against the Commonwealth, the Court of Common Pleas for Allegheny County lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 761(a) (vesting the Commonwealth Court with original jurisdiction of any action by or against the Commonwealth government unless original jurisdiction is expressly vested in another tribunal).

    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[237,511,1161,1107]]]'>As to the merits of this case, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that section 8 of the Lottery Law proscribes voluntary assignments of prize winnings, and that an order approving such a voluntary sale would not be an “appropriate judicial order” under the statute. The plain language of section 8 that “[n]o right of any person to a prize shall be assignable” provides a general prohibition against assignments. Marianov’s proposed construction would transform the phrase “appropriate judicial order” to mean with leave of the court. This interpretation would effectively rewrite § 3761-8 to have the exception swallow the general prohibition. Permitting such a result would be contrary to the General Assembly’s direction, “[t]hat the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be effective and certain.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(2). Further, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that despite the fact that there may be persuasive reasons for permitting voluntary assignments with leave of the court, “[i]t is not our stead to engraft upon legislation provisions which the General Assembly did not consider or did not see fit to enact.” <em>In re J.S., </em><a href="/pa/526/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="526 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1825967" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0418-01">526 Pa. 418</a>, 426, <a href="/pa/526/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="526 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1825967" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0418-01">586 A.2d 909</a>, 913 (1991).</p>

The absence of a standard is an indication that the construction of the statute permitting a right of assignment with leave of the court is not what the General Assembly intended. Indeed, in the present case it is unclear what standard the trial court used. The trial court stated that it believed a judge could properly “exercise his discretion in determining whether a purported assignment is reasonable or in the best interests of the parties involved.” (T.C.O. at 7). It is unclear from this statement whether a proposed assignment has to be in the parties’ best interest, or merely reasonable, or <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>both. We decline to rewrite this section to create a standard-less exception that undermines the general prohibition against assignments of lottery winnings.</p>
    <p id="b655-4" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[235,463,1158,582]]]'>Rather, we agree with the Commonwealth Court’s analysis that the language “appropriate judicial order” contained in the statute refers to an order in a separate proceeding where disposition of a lottery prize is an appropriate remedy. For example, an order directing payment of lottery winnings to a spouse as part of equitable distribution or spousal support may be an “appropriate judicial order” for purposes of section 8. <em>See Nuhfer v.
