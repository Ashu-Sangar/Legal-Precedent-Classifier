When the victim arrived at the house, Appellant answered the door. Although Appellant and the victim had never met, he invited her into the home and told her that his wife was upstairs. As the unsuspecting victim went up the stairs to meet the wife, she heard the door lock behind her. Subsequently, Appellant followed the victim and told her that his wife was not at home. Appellant then became physically abusive and refused to allow the victim to leave the house. To prevent her departure, he grabbed her by the neck and pulled her up the stairs. During the violence which ensued, Appellant forced the victim down on the stair landing and threatened to slit her throat if she did not keep quiet.</p>

Because the victim resisted unceasingly, Appellant’s attempts at intercourse were unsuccessful. Rather, Appellant rubbed his penis on the victim’s stomach until he ejaculated. The victim then used a blanket on the bed to clean herself of Appellant’s ejaculate. Eventually, the victim escaped through the back door when Appellant was distracted by the cries of an infant.</p>

    <p id="b746-7" data-blocks='[["BL_746.5",746,[231,739,1159,585]]]'>With these principles in mind, we recall that in trial counsel’s opening statement to the jury, it is unchallenged that Appellant’s attorney referred to the nonexistence of corroborating evidence to support the Commonwealth’s only witness to the crime, by stating that the chemist failed to find seminal stains on the blanket. It is argued that the discovery of such stains a few hours after Appellant’s advocate made this statement to the jury and its eventual admission into evidence, made trial counsel look less than credible in the eyes of the jury, an event which damaged Appellant’s defense, thereby, prejudicing him.</p>
    <p id="b746-8" data-blocks='[["BL_746.6",746,[226,1373,1160,959]]]'>The purpose of an opening statement is to apprise the jury how the case will develop, its background and what will be attempted to be proved; but it is not evidence.

Our rule of Criminal Procedure 1116(a) indicates that the presentation of opening remarks by defense counsel is directory and is not mandatory. Much like summation, the right to make the statement is a matter of trial strategy and may be waived. <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/469/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="469 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1722170" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0319-01">469 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="469 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1722170" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0319-01">365 A.2d 847</a> (1976). In any event, the statement, its substance and presentation by counsel are the first opportunity that the jury has to hear from the defendant through his advocate and it appears to us that as a practical matter the opening statement can often times be the most critical stage of the trial, because here the jury forms its first and often lasting impression of the case. See Crawford, <em>Opening Statement for the Defense in Criminal Cases. </em>8 Litigation 26-29 (Spring 1982). 75 AmJur 2d § 513.</p>

The jury’s estimation of the reliability of defense counsel may well affect the jury’s ability to be persuaded by counsel or to believe the defendant and his defense. Therefore, any event outside of the control of defense counsel or the defendant which jeopardizes counsel’s truthfulness and integrity may well affect the defendant’s defense and credibility.</p>

Here, the introduction into evidence of the results of the second test to the same jury that initially was told that no such positive results existed compromised trial counsel’s credibility and advocacy on behalf of his client in at least two respects. First, counsel’s initial statement to the jury was shown to be inaccurate. He was shown to be a liar and, therefore, his ability to be persuasive on his client’s behalf was definitely threatened. Second, his statement on the lack of corroborating evidence indicated that his defense strategy would be to discredit the victim and the subsequent discovery of evidence put him in the impossible position of not being able to change his defense to mistaken identity, or consent without seeming more disingenuous to the jury.</p>
