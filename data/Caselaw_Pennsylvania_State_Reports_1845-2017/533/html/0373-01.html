The referee concluded that: 1) appellant’s “continued negligence in operating his employer’s vehicle indicates an intentional disregard of the employer’s interests and a disregard of [appellant’s] duties and obligations to the employer,” 2) appellant’s conduct rose to the level of willful misconduct contemplated by § 402(e) and 3) appellant was ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits.
