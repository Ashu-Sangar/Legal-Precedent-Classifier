Appellant has raised six issues on appeal, three of which relate to the crucial introduction of the prior recorded testimony of one Patrick O’Brien, a witness who testified during co-defendant Fareri’s preliminary hearing but who was not available to testify at the joint trial of Appellant and Fareri.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>claims that Mr. O’Brien’s testimony exculpates the co-defendant and implicates the Appellant; that the probative value of the testimony is outweighed by the unfair prejudice that resulted from its admission; and, that the trial judge’s cautionary instruction was not an effective substitute for the Appellant’s right of cross-examination in the face of this adverse and prejudicial result. We are hence called upon to address the following issue: whether the Appellant was deprived of his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, when the trial judge permitted the prosecutor to introduce the prior recorded testimony of Patrick O’Brien against the co-defendant, Joseph Fareri, after he instructed the jury that the evidence “... must be considered only against Mr. Fareri and not against Mr. LaRosa.”</p>

On August 13, 1987, the victim, James Damiano, was shot in the left side of his chest with a .38 caliber handgun during a confrontation with Appellant and the co-defendant. A police officer, who was patrolling the area in question, stopped his police cruiser after he heard a voice yell, “Officer, Officer ... I’ve been shot.” (T.T., p. 91). The policeman entered the parking lot and found two white males standing in the parking lot and the victim bending over at his waist and grabbing his side. He helped the victim into his police car, but he did not <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>stop to identify either of the males, nor could he later identify them as the Appellant or the co-defendant.</p>

(T.T., p. 359, 364-65). DeBona remained on the other side of the street, where he listened to their argument until he entered a pizza shop to purchase a Coke. (T.T., p. 365, 368). A very short time later, he walked out of the pizza shop and he heard a loud “crack.” (T.T., p. <em>368). </em>DeBona immediately ran to the parking lot and watched as Appellant helped a policeman carry the victim to the police car.

Mr. O’Brien failed to identify the co-defendant as the passenger or the shooter and this created the biggest controversy because the co-defendant admitted that he was the passenger of the vehicle and that the gun fired (accidentally) while it was in <em>his, </em>the co-defendant’s hand. (T.T., p. 1058 and 1063-64). Mr. O’Brien’s testimony, at best, was inherently confusing. Witness DeBona’s testimony identified the co-defendant as the passenger in the truck and this was consistent with the co-defendant’s own testimony, as noted, that he himself was the passenger as well as the shooter (although an accidental shooter). The victim’s dying declaration also points to the co-defendant as the shooter. The O’Brien testimony casts doubt on all of this because O’Brien did not see, in court, the “passenger” (allegedly, the co-defendant) at the co-defendant’s own preliminary hearing. It may have been from inferences drawn from the O’Brien transcript and rejection of the co-defendant’s testimony that the jury concluded that Appellant was guilty of third degree murder while the co-defendant was only guilty of voluntary manslaughter. They would have to have rejected the theory that the co-defendant was the shooter and this would only have been justified had they disbelieved the co-defendant and at the same time used O’Brien’s testimony against Appellant in spite of the trial court’s instruction not to do so. Indeed, the centrality of the O’Brien transcript can be gathered from the fact that after the jury had deliberated for some time, they requested to hear the O’Brien testimony again. The trial judge complied with this request, but refused Appellant’s request that he again instruct the jury that the O’Brien testimony could only be considered against Fareri, and not <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>against Appellant. The trial court then had the O’Brien testimony read back to the deliberating jury, absent the requested limiting or cautionary instruction that this previously recorded testimony could only be considered against the co-defendant and not against Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b735-5" data-blocks='[["BL_735.5",735,[188,579,1160,414]]]'>The only other possible theory available that explains the jury’s conclusion that Appellant was guilty of murder and that the co-defendant was only guilty of manslaughter is that they concluded that Appellant master-minded these tragic events. If that was the case, the O’Brien transcript was not just confusing, it directly contradicted Appellant’s defensive strategy. Either way, its admission was not, therefore, harmless error.</p>
