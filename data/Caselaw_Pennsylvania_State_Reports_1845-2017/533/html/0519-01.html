    <p id="b772-4" data-blocks='[["BL_772.5",772,[246,582,1160,578]]]'>We find <em>Gulnac </em>to be distinguishable. As the emphasized language above indicates, a decision on the merits was improper because it had been advanced by those who, in that court’s judgment, had no standing. The ruling on standing was never appealed and became the law of the case. In this case, the Commonwealth Court considered the standing question and determined that the parents’ interest was sufficiently adverse to the teachers’ to create a controversy so as to entitle them to standing under the Declaratory Judgments Act. Thus the ^constitutional question was advanced by a party who, under the law of the case, had standing to raise it.</p>
    <p id="b772-5" data-blocks='[["BL_772.6",772,[246,1193,1159,846]]]'>It is a separate question whether mootness precluded further review once the court had granted the school district’s request for an injunction. Commonwealth Court, in deciding to address the standing question, determined that the mootness doctrine should not bar the action because it involves “a question of significant dimension that is capable of repetition yet evading review.” <a href="/pa-commw/113/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="113 Pa.

Given the time involved in the hearing and deciding of cases, it is virtually certain that any teachers’ strike would either be resolved through negotiation or be enjoined on a finding of clear and present danger before full appellate review of the constitutional question could be had. We have previously decided that mootness does not prevent the court from resolving such questions. <em>Colonial Gardens Nursing Home v.

The appellees suggest that because Article III, Section 14 states that “[t]he General Assembly shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the Commonwealth,” public education is a “fundamental right” under the state constitution, requiring that the statute be subject to “strict scrutiny.” Under this analysis, the statute must be narrowly drawn to serve a compelling state interest. The appellants maintain that public education is not a “fundamental right” under either the federal or state constitution and thus the statute should be reviewed under the “rational basis” test. According to this standard, legislation is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. This is the standard the common pleas court found applicable and purported to apply.</p>

The people have directed that the cause of public education cannot be fettered, but must evolute [sic] or retrograde with succeeding generations as the times prescribe.

And such future action can, for the same reason, be taken without producing an impairment of the obligations of the contracts for which the new Act provides because the Constitution only permits such contracts to be made subject to the right of change or regulation by future legislatures.

We cannot overlook the preceding acknowledgment that “courts will not inquire into the reason, wisdom or expediency of the legislative policy with regard to education,” or the subsequent pronouncement that the inquiry should consider “whether the fruits or effects of such legislation impinge the Article by circumscribing it or abridging its exercise by future legislatures .... ” The inquiry, then, must focus on (a) whether the legislation relates to the purpose of the constitutional provision — providing a system of public education is a basic duty of government that the legislature cannot ignore — without regard to the way the legislature has chosen to fulfill achieve this purpose, and (b) whether the legislation purports to limit the further exercise of legislative power with respect to the subject of public education.</p>

The court below acknowledged at the outset of its analysis that, “[t]he scale is weighted on both sides with legitimate interests.” Opinion at 16. This recognition should have ended the inquiry. The General Assembly has weighed those considerations and deemed it appropriate to allow most public employees, including teachers, a right to strike. The adversarial judicial system is not an appropriate forum for analyzing whether this legislation works well or poorly, as intended or in ways unforeseen. If a statute does not work as expected, the legislature is the appropriate body to make the judgment and enact corrective legislation.

For the same reason, we are persuaded that the passage of Act 88 of 1992 during the pendency of this appeal has not rendered the appeal moot. Act 88 effectively removed public educators from the scope of PERA by amending the School Code, adding provisions regarding collective bargaining, 24 P.S. § 11-1101-A et seq. (Purdon's Legislative Service 1992). Act 88 provides for mandatory arbitration where a work stoppage would prevent the school district from scheduling 180 <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>days of instruction. Section 1125-A(b). The arbitration, however, is not binding, since either the school district or the union may reject it within ten days. See Section 1125-A(k). Thus the strike is not so much ended as suspended during the period of arbitration.</p>

Accordingly, we have considered it necessary to resolve the fundamental question whether the legislature may, consistent with Article III, Section 14 of the state constitution, permit teachers to strike at all.</p>
