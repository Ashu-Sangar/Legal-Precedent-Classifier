The Court further ,held that, because Nacrelli had no notice that he would be subject to forfeiture of his pension at the time he committed the criminal acts constituting unfaithful public service, he could not be subject' to the terms of Act 140; no deterrent effect would be accomplished by imposing a newly created punishment after the improper acts had already been committed.</p>

Unlike Nacrelli, appellant Shiomos assumed a second term of office in 1982, subsequent to the effective date of Act 140. This pivotal fact mandates a different outcome than the conclusion reached by this Court in the <em>Zimmerman </em>cases.</p>
    <p id="b843-4" data-blocks='[["BL_843.5",843,[206,959,1162,1209]]]'>Admittedly the terms and conditions of Shiomos’ pension contract were set in 1972 when he first assumed judicial office. Had Shiomos retired in 1982 without assuming any additional public service his pension contract would not be subject to the forfeiture provisions of Act 140, even though the Act was enacted before his right to receive his pension had vested. <em>See Zimmerman I &amp; II. </em>However, when appellant Shiomos assumed his second term in office in 1982 he did so fully aware of the existence of Act 140 and its applicability to public employees in his position. Section 3 of Act 140 declares: “Each time a public officer or public employee is elected, appointed, promoted, or otherwise changes a job classification, there is a termination and renewal of the contract for purposes of this act.” 43 P.S. § 1313(c). By assuming his second term in office subsequent to the enactment of Act 140 appellant became subject to Act 140 and the terms and conditions of Act 140 were incorporated into his renewed pension contract. Furthermore, each time appellant was assigned to an additional term as a senior judge his subjacency to the provisions of Act 140 was reaffirmed. Thus, appellant’s argument that the forfeiture of his pension violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clause in Article I, Section 17 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is unpersuasive.</p>
    <p id="b843-5" data-blocks='[["BL_843.6",843,[207,2209,1156,151]]]'>Further, appellant’s argument that only his pension benefits accumulated after 1982 should be subject to forfeiture is rejected in accordance with section 3 of Act 140:</p>

With each appointment there is a renewal of the agreement to perform the term of public service without violating Act 140; an agreement which encompasses all that has gone before. Thus, whether or not a public employee’s right to receive retirement benefits has vested, or he or she is in actual receipt of benefits, all previous accumulated rights to receive such benefits are subject to forfeiture by and through the “renewed” agreement which is formed each time a person chooses to become a “public official” as defined by § 1312.</p>
