Stevens and Richard W. Masten, prospective candidates for council seats in the Borough of Braddock Hills, Allegheny County, were challenged via a petition to set aside by a qualified elector, Ross Cioppa, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. The reason advanced for this challenge centered on the candidates’ alleged failure to timely file their financial interests statements as required by Section 4(b) of the Ethics Act. The Ethics Act requires these statements be filed with the local governing authority on or before the last day for filing a petition to appear on the ballot for election. 65 P.S. § 404(b)(2). The last day for filing nomination petitions in this primary election was March 12, 1991.</p>

Councilman Cunic accepted the statements and assured Mr. Zentner that he would deliver the statements to the Borough Secretary that evening during a Borough meeting. Unfortunately, Councilman Cunic’s memory failed him and he neglected to deliver the statements. It was not until shortly after the filing deadline that the statements were delivered to the Borough Secretary. These financial statements were, however, timely and properly filed with the Allegheny County Department of Elections.</p>
    <p id="b815-5" data-blocks='[["BL_815.5",815,[208,875,1158,631]]]'>The trial court, following a hearing held on the petition, dismissed the challenge and determined that under the particular circumstances, the spirit of the Ethics Act had been observed.

As was the case in the first appeal, the essence of the challenge to strike the nomination petitions was the alleged failure to file with the governing authority of Millvale the financial interests statements on or before the March 12, 1991, deadline, as required by the Ethics Act.</p>

Our General Assembly, however, in apparent response to our <em>Baldwin </em>decision, amended and reenacted the Ethics Act in 1989 to include the following language: “Failure to file the [financial interests] statement in accordance with the provisions of this act shall.... be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on the ballot.” 65 P.S. § 404(b)(3). This language is clear and unambiguous. Our Statutory Construction Act of 1972<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> explicitly provides that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). Hence, the General Assembly foreclosed the possibility for curing by amendment the untimely filing of a financial interests statement with the local governing authorities, and by the same token foreclosed our inquiry into the individual circumstances which may have contributed to the untimely filings.</p>

Without more, I cannot make that assumption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> I believe that the mayor and council are the <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>governing authority and the proper delivery to any of those members constitutes delivery to the local governing authority as required by the Act. Of course, I will concede that the borough secretary is authorized to accept documents on behalf of the local governing authority. But I do not concede that the borough secretary is the local governing authority.</p>
    <p id="b820-5" data-blocks='[["BL_820.6",820,[235,626,1161,690]]]'>In many small municipalities, the office of Borough Secretary is handled by one person. Would the majority come to the same conclusion if the borough secretary were unavailable and the police chief unofficially filled in during the absence of the borough secretary? Or is the majority saying, again <em>sub silentio, </em>that delivery of the financial statement must be made to the <em>office </em>of the borough secretary, no matter what Borough official or employee may be manning the desk? If so, they should say so. Because I find that the delivery of the financial statements of Zentner, Stevens and Masten were made to the local governing authority by handing same to a member of the governing body, I believe that the mandate of the Ethics Act was met. I, therefore, concur in the result.</p>

I note that the Ethics Commission has directed applicants for council positions to file their statements with the borough secretary. This appears in the instruction section which is part of the Financial Disclosure Statement. I know not from whence this authority arises for the Commission to expand on the Act of the Legislature which merely compels filing with the local government authority. I, there<a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>fore, would consider this instruction by the Commission to be directive and not mandatory.</p>
