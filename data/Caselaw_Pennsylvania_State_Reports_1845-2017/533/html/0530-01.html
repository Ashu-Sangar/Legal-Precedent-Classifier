Immediately following the verdict, a sentencing hearing was held pursuant to the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711, and the jury unanimously sentenced appellant to death for the murder of the first degree conviction; whereupon the trial judge formally imposed the death sentence. On August 24, 1992, post-trial motions were heard and denied by the trial judge, and on September 18, 1992, appellant was also sentenced to an aggregate, consecutive term of imprisonment of twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) years on the remaining five felony charges.

While there she was seen in the company of appellant and James Bellman, both of whom she had met for the first time. During the early morning hours of December 21, 1990, Ms. Harbison left the bar to warm up her car while Ms. Fritz said goodbye to some friends. A few minutes later Ms. Fritz found Ms. Harbison’s car in the parking lot with the engine running, the driver door locked, the passenger door unlocked, the heater running, the radio on high volume and Ms. Harbison’s purse on the seat. Ms. Harbison was <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>nowhere to be found. Bellman was seen in his car, parked next to Ms. Harbison’s car, before Ms. Fritz came outside.</p>
    <p id="b782-5" data-blocks='[["BL_782.5",782,[231,409,1159,692]]]'>A neighbor of appellant’s in Pike County testified that at around 2:30 a.m. on December 21, 1990, she heard a car come down the road and then heard appellant’s voice. Bellman’s voice and also heard a female voice “holler” something. (N.T. 9/16/91, p. 193-194). A friend of appellant’s testified that she went to see appellant at his trailer home at 3:30 a.m. on December 21, 1990 but got no response when she banged on both the door and the window. She stated that appellant’s car was at the trailer but Bellman’s car was not there. (N.T. 9/18/91, p. 182). The following day, this friend was visited by appellant and Bellman. They tried to convince her that she was mistaken and must have seen Bellman’s car there. She would not change her story and they left.</p>

The cause of death was multiple stab wounds. She had been stabbed twelve times. Four of the wounds were lethal. There was evidence that Ms. Harbison had been bound at both at the wrists and ankles by handcuffs and that the acts were committed by more than one individual.</p>

Soil samples taken from Ms. Harbison’s shoe were similar to soil samples taken from behind appellant’s trailer and not similar to soil samples taken from the scene where her dead body was found. Divers recovered a knife and handcuffs from under the Ledgedale Bridge, eight-tenths of a mile from appellant’s trailer. Another set of handcuffs and Ms. Harbison’s eyeglasses were found across the road from appellant’s residence.

Appellant forced Ms. Harbison to engage in oral sex after directing Bellman to handcuff Ms. Harbison. Appellant then indicated to Bellman that he wanted to kill Ms. Harbison. The victim was then placed in Bellman’s car and driven to an isolated dirt road in Wayne County where she was pulled from the car by appellant and Bellman. Appellant then repeatedly stabbed Ms. Harbison with a knife he had obtained from his trailer before they had left.</p>

Mull, </em><a href="/pa/316/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="316 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="1159014" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0424-01">316 Pa. 424</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.%20418" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="175 A. 418">175 A. 418</a> (1934). We believe that the applicable statute here is 19 P.S. § 525, commonly referred to as the “Journey Act.” The obvious intent of the “Journey Act” is to “obviate the difficulties of proof as to offenses committed during journeys from place to place----” 19 P.S. § 525. In the present case, there was evidence that several crimes were committed during a journey by automobile from Wayne County to Pike County and back to Wayne County. The victim’s dead body was found in Wayne County and since the victim is not alive to testify to where the several crimes occurred there are obvious difficulties of proof. Although, there was some evidence that the crime of rape occurred in Pike County, the difficulty of proof as to exactly where the crimes occurred still exists. We believe that the “Journey Act” was intended to encompass <em>all </em>cases involving crimes committed while on a journey, whether the crime or crimes occurred in a moving vehicle or during a temporary stop in a longer journey. Therefore, with respect to the crime of rape, the fact that the crime was not committed in a moving vehicle is not fatal since we find that it was committed during a temporary stop in a longer journey. With respect to the crime of conspiracy to commit rape the difficulties of proof are obvious in that there is no evidence to prove exactly where the conspiracy was formed. This is precisely the type of proof problem that the “Journey Act” was meant to obviate. Venue in Wayne County over <em>all </em>of the crimes that were part of this single criminal <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>episode attached once it was learned that the body of the victim was found in Wayne County and that several crimes occurred during a journey through more than one jurisdiction. Once venue had attached it could not be vitiated by a subsequent finding that one or some of the crimes occurred in a different county. <em>Commonwealth v.

While there they met Ms. Harbison. Appellant left the bar and went to his trailer home in Pike County where he met Bellman and Ms. Harbison. Appellant and Bellman carried out their previously arranged plan to rape Ms. Harbison and then drove her back to Wayne County where they killed her. Her dead body was found in Wayne County. We have no difficulty concluding that this is a crime to which the “Journey Act” is intended to apply. The fact that appellant was not in the same car as the victim is not fatal since appellant was involved in a conspiracy to kidnap, rape and murder the victim. The journey, to which the “Journey Act” applies, in this case, began in Wayne County where a conspiracy was formed between appellant and Bellman to kidnap, rape, and murder Ms. Harbison. Appellant was as much a part of the journey as Bellman and Ms. Harbison. Therefore, it was proper to give jurisdiction for all of the crimes arising out of this one criminal episode to the Wayne County trial court.
