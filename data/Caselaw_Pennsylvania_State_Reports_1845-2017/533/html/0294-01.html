    <p id="b544-10" data-blocks='[["BL_544.10",544,[230,1008,1159,522]]]'>This case requires the interpretation of two provisions of the Sentencing Code — mandatory minimum sentencing for repeat offenders and computation of prior record score under the sentencing guidelines. The sentencing court held that enhanced sentencing provisions applied at appellee’s second sentencing even though he had committed the second offense prior to his conviction for the first. The Superior Court reversed, holding that the enhanced sentencing provisions could not be imposed unless the second offense was committed after conviction for the first offense.</p>

In addition, appellee’s prior record score in the sentencing guideline form reflected his prior rape conviction. On April 10, 1989, appellee was sentenced for the crimes relating to the second rape to a term of ten to twenty years incarceration, consecutive to the sentence for the first rape. Following additional hearings regarding appellee’s motions to modify sentence, the trial court reduced the sentence on the second offense to a prison term of seven and one-half years, again to be served consecutively to the first sentence.</p>

In cases of recidivism, we expect the following sequence of events: first offense, first conviction, first sentencing, second offense, second conviction, second sentencing. In such a situation, the legislature provided that the mandatory minimum sentence would be imposed at the second sentencing if the first conviction occurred within seven years prior to the commission of the second offense. If the first conviction occurred more than seven years before the second offense, the legislature did not consider the criminal sufficiently blameworthy to merit the enhanced minimum sentence. The sequence of events in this case, however, was: first offense, second offense, first conviction, first sentencing, second conviction, second sentencing.

    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[222,1126,1157,475]]]'>Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court vacating the sentence and remanding to the trial court to permit counsel to explain his actions at appellee’s sentencing. If he fails to offer a satisfactory explanation, appellee is entitled to be resentenced in accordance with this opinion, and the sentencing court will be free to impose a sentence of equal or lesser severity. If trial counsel provides reasons for his actions which had a reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interest, appellee’s sentence shall be reinstated.</p>

In effect, by construing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(b)(2) to mean “within seven years <em>prior to </em>the date of the commission of the instant offense,” the majority has usurped the power of the legislature and rewritten the statute, ignoring the purpose of the statute which is to protect society from repeat violent offenders (in this case, a multiple rapist).</p>
    <p id="b551-6" data-blocks='[["BL_551.7",551,[234,1303,1160,476]]]'>Consequently, the undeniable result of the majority’s interpretation is that defendants, such as appellee, are free to engage in the commission of multiple violent crimes without fear of the mandatory minimum sentencing statute — so long as the defendant commits these various offenses within the, oftentimes, lengthy amount of time it takes to be apprehended, convicted and sentenced on the initial offense. This is clearly not the result the legislature intended and certainly not what the law abiding public deserves.</p>
