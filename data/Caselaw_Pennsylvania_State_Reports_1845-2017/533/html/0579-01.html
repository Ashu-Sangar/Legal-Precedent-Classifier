The trial court denied the P.C.H.A. petition. However, a panel of the Superior Court reversed and remanded to the trial court with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of considering evidence of trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness for not raising the post-arrest silence issue.</p>

Thus, the trial court concluded that the prosecution’s cross-examination did not violate the post-arrest silence standards established in <em>Commonwealth v.

To prove ineffectiveness of counsel, Appellant must show that his assertion is one of arguable merit, that the. attorney had no reasonable basis for his action or inaction, and that the attorney’s action or inaction was prejudicial to the client. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant contends that in order to rectify that impermissible reference to his post-arrest silence, he is entitled to a new trial. Appellee argues that the prosecuting attorney’s line of questioning referred only to Appellant’s pre-arrest silence and not his post-arrest silence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Notwithstanding the intention of the <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>questioner, the question was ambiguous regarding the specific time frame to which it was directed. The prosecutor’s question was, “Did you <em>ever </em>think of telling the police what happened?” N.T. p. 2.165 (emphasis added). Webster’s Dictionary defines “ever” as “through all time or at anytime.” Thus it is reasonable to assume that the jury would have interpreted the prosecutor’s question as embracing Appellant’s post-arrest silence. The Commonwealth contends that the prosecutor’s cross-examination was directed to the time between the shooting and Appellant’s subsequent apprehension by the police officers. First, we consider whether there is merit to the Appellant’s claim that the prosecutor made an impermissible reference to his post-arrest silence.</p>

Appellee also argues that Appellant’s post-arrest silence issue can not be reached since Appellant’s original P.C.H.A. counsel failed to raise that issue. We disagree. The trial court denied his P.C.H.A. petition and thereafter Appellant retained new counsel. Appellant’s new counsel filed an appeal in the Superior Court claiming that both trial counsel and original P.C.H.A. counsel had been ineffective for failing to raise the post-arrest silence issue. The Superior Court remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for the purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing on the issue of post-arrest silence. Prior to the commencement <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>of the evidentiary hearing the court and both parties agreed that there would be no issue of a waiver by the original P.C.H.A. counsel. If trial counsel was found ineffective, then the original P.C.H.A. counsel necessarily had to be ineffective by failing to assert that claim. (Commonwealth v. Clark, Nos. 1600-1603, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, P.C.H.A. Evidentiary Hearing, April 20, 1988, N.T. at 5.) Accordingly, we find Appellee’s position not persuasive.</p>
