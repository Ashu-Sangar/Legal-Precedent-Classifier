    <p class="author" id="b520-7" data-blocks='[["BL_520.8",520,[258,754,410,40]]]'>FLAHERTY, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b520-8" data-blocks='[["BL_520.9",520,[215,821,1156,206]]]'>The substantive issue raised by this case is whether a township may impose impact fees upon the developers of real estate to pay for improvements in roads which will be required because of the development.</p>
    <p id="b520-9" data-blocks='[["BL_520.10",520,[212,1053,1156,583]]]'>On March 2, 1989, Cranberry Township enacted Ordinance 189, “The Cranberry Township Transportation Improvement Program Amendment,” requiring, inter alia, that new developers pay an impact fee to finance improvements to municipal and state owned highways. On April 7, 1989, the Builders Association of Metropolitan Pittsburgh, North Suburban Builders Association, Enterprise Development, Inc., Empire Properties, Inc. and Kress Brothers Builders, Inc. (hereinafter, “the builders”), filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of the ordinance and the impact fees provided for in the ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b520-10" data-blocks='[["BL_520.11",520,[209,1662,1157,693]],["BL_521.1",521,[241,281,1156,313]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas of Butler County decided the case on motion for summary judgment, holding that the ordinance is illegal and unenforceable insofar as it requires the payment of impact fees. The township argued that it was authorized to enact its ordinance pursuant to the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101, et seq. (the MPC), its power to enact zoning ordinances, and its police power. The trial court held, however, that the MPC does not authorize the imposition of an impact fee; that the various powers of the Second Class Township Code 53 P.S. § 65101 et seq., do not specifically authorize municipalities to impose impact fees; and that the township’s police powers do not include the power to impose an impact fee. Further, the court held that the <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>impact fee was, in fact, a tax which was unauthorized and invalid pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6901, et seq. Finally, the court declined to rule on the question of whether the Transportation Partnership Act, 53 P.S. § 1621 et seq., preempts the township from imposing impact fees for roads.</p>
    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[242,616,1155,257]]]'>The township appealed to Commonwealth Court. After argument was held, but before an opinion was filed, the General Assembly enacted the Act of December 19, 1990, P.L. 1343, Act 209, which amended the Municipalities Planning Code to allow the imposition of impact fees as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[282,887,1115,628]]]'>A municipality which has enacted an impact fee ordinance on or before June 1, 1990, may, for a period not to exceed one year from the effective date of this article, adopt an impact fee ordinance to conform with the standards and procedures set forth in this article. Where a fee previously imposed pursuant to an ordinance in effect on June 1, 1990, for transportation improvements authorized by this article, is greater than the recalculated fee due under the newly adopted ordinance, the individual who paid the fee is entitled to a refund of the difference. If the recalculated fee is greater than the previously paid fee, there shall be no additional refund.</blockquote>

Because the township’s ordinance was adopted on March 2, 1989, the impact fees were saved by the amendment to the MPC, pending the township’s adoption of a new impact fee ordinance in conformity with the MPC. On February 6, 1991, Commonwealth Court, relying on this amendment to the MPC and citing <em>In re Gross, </em><a href="/pa/476/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="476 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1736936" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0203-01">476 Pa. 203</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="476 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1736936" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0203-01">382 A.2d 116</a> (1978), held that the case was moot, dismissed the appeal, and vacated the order of the trial court. 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 510, <a href="/pa-commw/137/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="587 A.2d 32" data-case-ids="1410867" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/137/0510-01">587 A.2d 32</a> (1991).

On March 26, 1991, Commonwealth Court denied reargument. On February 20, 1991 this court granted the builders’ petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[233,463,1158,585]]]'>We agree with Commonwealth Court that our decision in <em>In re Gross, </em><a href="/pa/476/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="476 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1736936" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0203-01">476 Pa. 203</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="476 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1736936" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0203-01">382 A.2d 116</a> (1978), held that a court may decline to decide a matter where the case has been rendered moot by a change in the facts of the case or the applicable law. In this case, however, one of the parties claims that the case is not moot because the amendment to the MPC which authorizes impact fees may not be applied retroactively, and in any event, is invalid. It was error not to have allowed reargument and supplemental briefing in the face of such claims, for the parties have never had an opportunity to address the matters upon which the court based its decision.</p>
