The trial court had sentenced Appellant to 90 days imprisonment after having found him in contempt of court for failing to testify at the murder and conspiracy trial of Curtis Brandon. We granted the Appellant’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal to review under what circumstances a witness may invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination once he has testified at his own trial, has been convicted and sentenced for a related underlying crime, and has expressed his intention to timely file a Notice of Appeal.</p>
    <p id="b638-6" data-blocks='[["BL_638.7",638,[234,1083,1159,949]]]'>Appellant was charged and convicted on May 3,1989, for his participation in the August 20,1988, killing of Jonathan Bailey. At the same time, he was also acquitted on conspiracy charges. After the denial of his post trial motions, Appellant was sentenced to a period of incarceration of not less than 10 years nor more than 20 years. Thereafter, Appellant was subpoenaed by defense counsel for Curtis Brandon to testify on Brandon’s behalf at his trial on May 26, 1989. The Commonwealth alleged that Brandon was a participant in the killing of Bailey. Brandon’s counsel asserted that Appellant’s testimony in his own trial exonerated Brandon. In response to the subpoena, Appellant advised the trial judge that the appeal of his conviction would be filed by June 1, 1989, and hence, he would assert his privilege against self-incrimination if compelled to take the witness stand. Based upon this information, the trial court conducted a hearing outside of the presence of the jury to evaluate the Appellant’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b639-7" data-blocks='[["BL_639.7",639,[205,897,1158,630]]]'>Evaluating these arguments, the trial court concluded that the assertion of the privilege was illusory and therefore denied Appellant’s right to rely on the privilege. The trial court then directed Brandon’s defense counsel to examine Appellant. After the Appellant refused to respond to Brandon’s defense counsel’s questions for the third time, and after warning the Appellant on each occasion of the unavailability of the self-incrimination privilege, the trial court found the Appellant in contempt of court. After conducting a separate hearing on the contempt charges, the Appellant was sentenced to 90 days in jail to run after completion of his sentence for the murder conviction.</p>

After receiving this phone call, he woke up his daughter, told her that Stephanie had been raped, telephoned his wife Judy Long at the V.A. Hospital where she worked as a registered nurse, told her what happened, and then proceeded with his daughter to his <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>mother-in-law’s house.

She also told Appellant that Bailey had threatened her that he didn’t care who she had told because if she told anyone and they said anything to him he would “f_them up and he would f_her up too, and that if she put him in jail, that he was going to kill her when he got out.”</blockquote>

At around 4:00 p.m., Appellant picked up his wife at work and drove to his mother-in-law’s house to get his mother-in-law and Stephanie so Stephanie could report the rape to the Monroeville police. After taking Appellant home at 5:00 p.m., Judy Long, her mother and Stephanie proceeded to the Monroeville police station where Stephanie made her report.</blockquote>

When Appellant arrived at the field around 6:00 p.m., he shot basketball for a while and made some inquiries about Bailey. A short time later, Appellant saw his brothers, Dusty and Michael at the field. Since Appellant had no idea that his brothers would be there, he asked them, “What are you guys doing here?” They said they had “run into a friend” of Appellant’s who told them he would be at the Homewood Field. His brothers asked him what was going on, to which the Appellant replied, “I came up here to see this guy about Stephanie.” Michael asked if he was all right, and Appellant said, “Yes, I’m all right, you guys don’t have to stick around.” They said they would wait around anyway.</blockquote>

Appellant said, “Stephanie, the girl you raped.” Bailey retorted, “F_you and Stephanie, I don’t want to hear that sh_”. At that point, Baile[y] walked across the street and started conversing with a Mr. Eackles. Appellant pursued Bailey to let him know that Stephanie had gone to the police to press charges against him and that if Bailey harmed her, he would have to answer to him. As Appellant approached Bailey and Eackles, Bailey got into Eackles’ car with Mrs. Eackles. Appellant then told Bailey, “Now are you going to get out man, are you going to get out of the mother f__ car and talk to me like a man, or do you just like to take pussy?” Angered by Appellant’s words, Bailey kicked at Appellant and then grabbed a pipe and hit Appellant on the arm as Appellant reached for Bailey’s legs. Appellant backed up several feet from the car and Bailey came out, exclaiming: “You want to see me, mother f__, you want to see me.” Appellant pulled out the pistol and fired two shots into the ground in an attempt to stop Bailey. Simultaneously, Dusty Long had come from across the street and hit Bailey in the back with a piece of wood as he grabbed <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>Bailey by the shirt. Bailey then broke loose from Dusty, tearing his shirt, and started running away. Appellant chased him. Bailey ran over the wall and through the courtyard. Appellant yelled, “Stop, man, if this is what you want, stop, mother f__” As Bailey ran onto the field, Appellant fired his gun from about 124 feet away and hit Bailey in the back, causing him to fall to the ground. Appellant immediately ran up to Bailey. He felt scared for doing something he had not intended to do. Realizing that Bailey was hurt, Appellant turned and ran off the field. Appellant did not see what happened to Bailey after his departure.</blockquote>

In rebuttal, the Commonwealth subpoenaed Otis Ferguson, one of the alleged participants in the crime. On the stand, Ferguson initially testified that he was convicted of murdering the same victim defendant stood accused of murdering, and was serving a lifetime term of imprisonment. Furthermore, he testified that his conviction was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and review was denied by the United States Supreme Court. He then refused to answer any further questions relying upon the privilege against self-incrimination and the fact that he was seeking collateral review of his conviction. Over the Commonwealth’s objection, the trial court sustained Ferguson’s assertion of the privilege. The Commonwealth was then permitted, over defendant’s objection, to read into evidence Ferguson’s testimony from defendant’s preliminary hearing.

McGrogan, </em>supra, we addressed the issue as to whether a witness may invoke the privilege against self-incrimination when the substance of his testimony is known. In <em>McGrogan, </em>Roland Steele was incarcerated in the Allegheny County jail at the same time as the defendant. It was alleged that the defendant approached Steele to solicit him to kill the witnesses responsible for the defendant’s arrest. Instead of carrying out this task, Steele took this information to the police. The defendant was then arrested for criminal solicitation. At McGrogan’s trial, the Commonwealth attempted to introduce the preliminary hearing testimony of Steele since Steele invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. Over defense counsel’s objections, the trial court declared Steele unavailable, as a result of the privilege, and admitted his preliminary hearing testimony.

      <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>It is quite clear that a witness cannot use the privilege as a protection against what that witness is about to say. Rather, the privilege is used to prevent current statements from serving as a basis to establish prior criminal conduct. In other words, the current testimony would not serve as the basis of the perjury but rather a confession that the prior sworn testimony was false. (See for example <em>Commonwealth v. Nelson, </em><a href="/pa-super/393/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="393 Pa.

The previous sworn testimony would be the perjured statements with the latter testimony constituting the truth. Under this analysis, a defendant might be justifiably concerned that his current testimony could provide an essential link to a wholly different criminal episode, i.e., perjury, than one for which he had previously been convicted, i.e., murder. It is conceivable that the appellant could testify during cross examination that the statements made in the pre-sentence report were accurate which then could make his testimony at his own trial perjurious.
