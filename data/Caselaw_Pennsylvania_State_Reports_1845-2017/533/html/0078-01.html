Holston (Respondent) should not be disbarred from the practice of law in this Commonwealth. Briefs were filed in this matter by the Respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and the parties were afforded the opportunity to argue orally before this Court. Our review of the entire record submitted to us by the Board, and the briefs submitted and considering the arguments made in open court, we conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that the Rule to Show Cause be made absolute and that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law in this Commonwealth.</p>

The petition alleged that Respondent had violated various Rules of Professional Conduct in the course of handling a divorce matter. The Board referred the petition to a Hearing Committee, which held hearings and on June 13, 1990, filed its Report finding that Respondent had, in fact, violated the Rules of Professional Conduct and recommended that Respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months.</p>

He was retained by Richard Wofford of Philadelphia to represent him in a divorce and, on November 5,1987, Respondent filed a Complaint in Divorce on Mr. Wofford’s behalf in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Family Division. Respondent’s initial attempt to serve the Complaint on Mrs. Wofford through the Sheriffs Office, resulted in a return of “Not Found”.</p>
