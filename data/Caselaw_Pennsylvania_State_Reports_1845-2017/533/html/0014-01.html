Thus, all of the incurred costs stemmed from the charges. Furthermore, as we stressed at the time of imposition, it was important for the defendant to understand that the proper forum for challenging the PA custody order was the PA courts and that absconding with the children was an extremely costly, serious, and inappropriate action.

    <p id="b266-8" data-blocks='[["BL_266.8",266,[217,1867,1156,463]]]'>Unfortunately, the trial court does not state whether it was ordering the restitution as a way to rehabilitate Appellant or as a punishment and, therefore, it is not clear whether the restitution order is a part of the sentence. The order is also lacking in that no time frame for repayment is mentioned nor has there been any consideration as to Appellant’s ability to repay. Finally, there is no discussion whether 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106 is applicable when a defendant is convicted of the type of crime involved here.</p>

      <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>Appellant argues that the award of restitution for incidental expenses incurred by a father in searching for his children is not appropriate under this statute because she was not convicted for a crime which holds her responsible for these losses and furthermore, she argues that restitution is only awardable under this section in cases where property has been stolen or where the victim has sustained direct loss or physical injury as part of the criminal transaction of interfering with the custody of the children. Property is defined as “any real or personal property, including currency and negotiable instruments, of the victim” (18 Pa.C.S. § 1106). Since her children are persons and not property, Appellant argues that no “loss” was sustained and the restitution provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106 have no applicability.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[228,1059,1159,531]]]'>The Superior Court rejected this interpretation of the statute and determined that in applying the provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106 a direct physical loss could be established where, but for the actions of the actor, the assets or property in question would not have been depleted. As applied to Mr. Harner, the Superior Court noted that he would not have been put in the position of spending $14,000.00 but for the actions of Appellant and, accordingly, concluded that the sentencing court could properly impose restitution for his losses under this statute. We disagree.</p>

No such crime has been committed here by Appellant. Unless the incidental costs Mr. Harner expended to locate his children have been made part of a criminal proceeding for which Appellant was convicted, it seems dubious to us that due process would permit a court to determine that these are losses that can be passed on to Appellant, as a sentence, under a theory that they flowed as a direct result of the crime for which Appellant was convicted.</p>

We believe that this is a strained reading of an otherwise straightforward statute which is directed at giving the trial court the ability to sentence a defendant for the damage caused by him in the commission of a crime. Thus, where one steals an automobile valued at $15,000 and during a high speed chase is involved in a wreck which damages the auto, reducing its value to $5,000, it would be appropriate, in addition to incarceration, upon conviction for theft, to require the defendant to pay the victim $10,000 for the loss of value to the auto. It is impossible to separate the actions of the theft from the damage done to the car and in this sense the decrease in value to the car is a direct result of the crime. Here, it is possible to separate Appellant’s criminal conduct from the acts Mr. Harner engaged in to recover his children and it would seem to us that for that reason alone, Section 1106 would not be available to a sentencing court in deciding whether restitution is an appropriate alternative to incarceration.</p>

The Commonwealth has also argued that attorney’s fees are recoverable under 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(a) on the theory that the legal fees incurred by the victims’ father were directly caused by the illegal action of the mother and cannot be separated from the other expenditures incurred.</p>

Since this statute makes no specific provision for the award of counsel fees, it would be inappropriate to read such a provision into the statute and an award of attorneys’ fees under this statute would be inappropriate.</p>

We do note that consistent with the broader discretion granted to a sentencing court that choses to impose restitution as a condition of parole, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9754(c)(8) vests the court with an equally broad power to determine what the fruits of the crime are. This is considerably different than the language of 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106 which permits restitution only for losses that are a direct result of the crime. The more liberal language of § 9754(c)(8) is understandable given the purposes of rehabilitation and can encompass all the types of claims Mr. Harner presented, as long as the trial court is satisfied that restitution is being ordered so that the Appellant will understand the cruelty of her conduct, be deterred from repeating the conduct, be encouraged to live in a responsible manner, and be able to pay these costs.</p>
