Following trial, the court assessed delay damages against the Department in favor of Connor and the Estate of Gentile. Appeals were filed by all parties. While the case was pending on appeal, the trial court, sua sponte, vacated the awarded delay damages against <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>the Department. Appellants then appealed this ruling. At the time of briefing, the Commonwealth filed a consolidated brief in which it labeled itself appellant in the first part (i.e., that part challenging the verdicts) and appellee in the second part (i.e., that part seeking to support the trial judge’s decision to vacate the delay damages assessments).</p>

    <p id="b396-6" data-blocks='[["BL_396.6",396,[211,823,1157,693]]]'>The record is clear that the Department had challenged in its original appeal the trial court’s order awarding delay damages to Appellants. However, once the trial court vacated its previously entered delay damages assessments, the Commonwealth’s appeal on this issue became moot. However, when the Appellants appealed this order, the Department briefed the issue in response to those appeals. Given this procedural history, and because the Department did address the delay damage issue in response to the sequence of the trial court’s orders, the mere categorization of the Department’s argument as being that of the “appellee” is not dispositive; and the Commonwealth Court correctly overlooked this technicality in the interest of justice.
