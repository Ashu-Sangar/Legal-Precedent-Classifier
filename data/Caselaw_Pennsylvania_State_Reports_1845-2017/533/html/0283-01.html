The first incident occurred on December 7, 1987, when appellant, Joan Livingston McDonough, was involved in an auto accident with an oncoming car as she was making a left turn from a highway into a business driveway. While the driver of the other car went into the business office to call the police and his family, appellant drove away, leaving the scene of the accident. The following day, appellant reported the accident to the police and gave a statement. At that time appellant was asked if she was aware that her driver’s license was under suspension; she replied that she was not. As a result of this incident appellant was cited for failure to yield to oncoming traffic while turning left (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3322), failure to stop at an accident scene to exchange information (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3743(a)), driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked/suspension <em>not </em>DUI related (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1543(a)), driving an unregis<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>tered vehicle (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1301), and violations concerning licenses (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1571(a)).</p>

On January 21, 1988, appellant pleaded guilty in front of a District Justice to all charges stemming from both incidents, except for the violation of driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked/suspension DUI related (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1543(b)), which had previously been withdrawn by the officer on January 6, 1988.

The other cases, which had been properly appealed, were scheduled for a trial <em>de novo </em>on a subsequent date. At the hearing, the prosecutor immediately informed the court that the charge at issue had been previously withdrawn by the police officer. Upon review, the court found that “the citation was withdrawn by the prosecuting officer,” and held that “[therefore, the appeal is not necessary and the defendant is not guilty of these charges.” (N.T. 4/22/88, pp. 2-3).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In the subsequent trial <em>de novo, </em>appellant was tried for the remaining charges.

Proof that notice of suspension was mailed is not sufficient alone to establish notice beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Kane, </em><a href="/pa/460/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="460 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="482762" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0582-01">460 Pa. 582</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="460 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="482762" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0582-01">333 A.2d 925</a>. In the present case, the Commonwealth presented a certified copy of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (“PennDot”) records indicating that two separate notices of suspension were sent to appellant at her address of record. (N.T. 1/10/89 and 1/11/89, pp. 43-45). Appellant presented unrebutted evidence that she had previously moved from the address to which the suspension notices were mailed. Appellant also testified that she never informed PennDot of her new address. (N.T. 1/10/89 and 1/11/89, pp. 219-220). Appellant’s argument must <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>fail because her admitted failure to notify PennDot of her new address violates 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1515<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and thus, precludes her reliance on the defense of insufficient notice, where notice was sent to her address of record. <em>Commonwealth v.

Unlike <em>Kane, </em>in the present case, it was appellant’s own conduct which rendered actual notice impossible. We cannot allow appellant to use a violation of one law to circumvent a violation of another law. Therefore, we conclude that, although actual notice of suspension is still a necessary element of the crime of driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1543), a defendant’s failure to notify PennDot of a change of address pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1515, precludes his or her reliance on the defense of insufficient notice. Accordingly, we would affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming appellant’s conviction for driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked/suspension <em>not </em>DUI related (75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1543(a)) resulting from the December 7, 1987, incident.</p>

    <p id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[185,475,1160,533]]]'>The Commonwealth does not dispute that a defendant cannot be acquitted of a § 1543(b) violation and then retried for a violation of § 1543(a) arising out of the same incident, but argues that the characterization of the proceedings on April 22, 1988, as a “prosecution” is disingenuous, and hence, there could be no acquittal. The Superior Court rejected appellant’s argument. That court reasoned that because the charge had been dropped by the officer prior to the April 22, 1988, proceeding, appellant was not called upon to defend herself twice. We agree with the Superior Court.</p>

The sole purpose of that proceeding was to clear the docket of appellant’s erroneously having appealed a charge that had been withdrawn at the District Justice level. Thus, this was not a “prosecution,” but a deliberate administrative procedure intended to dispose of the charge erroneously appealed. The <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>fact that the court entered an order stating that appellant was found “not guilty”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> is inconsequential because it was not the judge’s intention to resolve the merits of the case but to dispose of the charge for the record.

There is a penalty for the summary offense of violating § 1515 — a $25 fine — and appellant might justly be subjected to that penalty, though the fifteen-day notification requirement is one which is undoubtedly overlooked by innumerable prudent, law-abiding citizens until called to their attention on application forms for renewal of driver’s license or registration.</p>

      <em>Kane, </em>relying on <em>Leary, </em>explained that due process requires all elements of a criminal offense to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Actual notice of suspension is an element of an offense under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1543(a), driving under suspension. Proof of mailing, standing alone, is not sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had actual notice of his suspension, at least when there is doubt that the notice was mailed to the correct address. <em>Kane, <a href="/us/395/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="395 U.S. 6" data-case-ids="1771825" data-case-paths="/us/395/0006-01">id.</a> </em>There is no logical or rational relation between appellant’s dereliction in notifying the department of her address change and the constitutional requirement that the Commonwealth prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she had actual notice of her suspension, one of the elements of the crime.</p>
