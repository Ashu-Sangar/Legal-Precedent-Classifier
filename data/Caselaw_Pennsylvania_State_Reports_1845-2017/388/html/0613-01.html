Defendant and Vivian Gay, apparently in a fit of jealously, attacked Dorothy Francis, the decedent, on the street. Dorothy Francis was killed by a knife wound in the breast. Who stabbed her was the crucial factual question, Vivian Gay blaming Mary Brown and Mary Brown blaming Vivian Gay. Two eyewitnesses testified that defendant, Mary Brown, attacked Dorothy Francis with a knife, while Vivian Gay beat her with a golf club.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> Defendant denied that she had a knife or that she stabbed Dorothy Francis, and testified that Vivian Gay was the one who had the knife and inflicted the mortal wound. Vivian Gay testified that she saw Mary Brown, the defendant, stab Dorothy Francis, and that while they were both in jail, defendant admitted to her that she had stabbed Dorothy Francis. Moreover, Dorothy Francis, just before her death and at a time when she knew she was about to die, made an alleged dying declaration that Mary Brown, the defendant, stabbed her.</p>

Because of the conflict of evidence, the Court’s charge on this point was important.</p>

However, a number of authorities point out that while it is a substitute for an oath and its credibility and weight is for the jury, it is merely hearsay and is not the equivalent of nor does it have the same value or weight as the testimony of a witness given under oath in open Court which, of course, is subject to cross-examination.

For all these reasons, we believe, weighing all the pros and cons, that it is in the best interests of the public that a dying declaration should be considered as the equivalent of testimony given under oath in open Court. However, from a realistic point of view, it would seem advisable for a trial Judge to omit, in his charge to the jury, any comparison and merely say that the question whether the declarant believed he was dying at the time he made the declaration, and the credibility, interpretation and weight to be given his statement under the attendant facts and circumstances of the case, are for the jury.</p>

He is accused by a person he cannot see, he is charged with words he cannot refute, he is attacked with an accusation he cannot counter-attack through cross-examination.

Why should they invest a dying declaration, which is also in the nature of a spontaneous utterance, with the solemnity of a jurat? A dying declaration would have no standing at all in court were it not that it is an exception to the hearsay rule. To now pile on that exception an additional exception by calling it a sworn statement when it is not a sworn statement at all comes, as I view it, close to depriving a defendant of due process of law.

Jealousy and criss-cross love affairs had fired the passions of this termagant trio and they fought desperately on the street. The arena of battle encompassed a street, a lawn, a flower garden, and a truck, around which the shrewish combatants chased one another, as testified to by the husband of Vivian Gay, apparently one of the heart-interests in the quadrangle. This pivotal figure testified that on Aug. 16, 1954 he was walking on old Lincoln Highway in Malvern, with Dorothy Francis, when Mary Brown and Ms wife Vivian came running toward them.

A witness by the name of George McFarlin, Jr., confirmed Mary Brown’s testimony in this respect: “When I got there Mrs. Wasson was on the porch, Vivian and Dorothy were fighting and Mary was still by the truck. I came up behind Vivian and grabbed the golf club out of her hand. It is all metal, with sharp ends sticking out, it was jagged, a series of ridges. It is was a metal head and a metal shaft. It was jagged and sharp edges. I tossed it, threw it away. I went back to the flower garden and Dorothy was bending over. I picked Dorothy up, and Vivian broke back into her again.

The Judge simplified the case for the jury, but the situation was not so simple as the Trial Judge made it. When one speaks of a dying declaration the average listener assumes that the declarant, in full possession of his faculties, coolly and clearly announces: “X shot me” or “Y stabbed me.” But the picture is rarely so clearly etched, and it certainly was not so etched in this case. Mary Scott, a student nurse, who was present at the hospital when the police officer was questioning Dorothy Francis, testified that “She [Dorothy Francis] was <em>mumbling all the </em>time, but there were times when the mask was off when she was examined.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
