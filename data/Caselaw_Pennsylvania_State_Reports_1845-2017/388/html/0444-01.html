Carlisle Trust Company were filed by the Banks and approved by the Department of State; thereafter the Articles were transmitted to the Department of Banking for approval or disapproval in accordance with the Banking Code. Both banking institutions are chartered under the law of Pennsylvania. Carlisle Trust Company has its principal and sole place of business in the Borough of Carlisle, Cumberland County. It has no branches. Dauphin Deposit Trust Company has its principal place of business, together with three branches, in Harrisburg, Dauphin County. Cumberland County and Dauphin County are contiguous counties.

From this Order of the Department of Banking, Dauphin Deposit Trust Company and Carlisle Trust Company appealed to this Court.</p>

For example, under subsection A, an approval by the Banking Board was eliminated if the Department approved a merger, the effect of which was to establish a branch in a contiguous County; and the requirement of <em>need </em>(or adequacy or inadequacy) of banking facilities, which was specifically set forth in subsection B and in old section 204 D, was conspicuously omitted.

The Department contends that if the standard for the establishment of a branch requires a finding by the Department that there is <em>a need </em>for the proposed banking services or facilities of the branch, it is equally and vitally important that the same standards and the same requirements and supervision are necessary in connection with the Department’s approval or disapproval of a merger, the effect of which is to establish a branch.</p>

The second is superficially meritorious, but on analysis falls. The new branch bank has the same building and virtually the same employes and personnel as the old, but it is not the same banking institution either in name or in banking facilities.

The Department, in an able comprehensive opinion, carefully reviewed and analyzed the facts which it had exhaustively investigated. For example, the Department found that under the plan of merger the name of the surviving institution was not likely to mislead the public as to its character or purpose, and that the interests of the depositors, other creditors and shareholders of the two banking institutions would be adequately protected by the proposed merger. It also found (and appellants concede) that the primary and motivating purpose of the merger is the conversion of the office of Carlisle Trust Company at Carlisle, Cumberland County, <em>into a branch </em>of Dauphin Deposit Trust Company. It went into considerable detail to support all of its findings or conclusions. It reviewed the statement of condition of both institutions; the population of Carlisle and of Cumberland County since 1940, with their respective numbers and their percentage of gain; the assessed valuation of real estate in Carlisle and also in Cumberland County since 1940; the number of banks and their branches and their total resources, etc., in Carlisle and in Cumberland County, with their increase in capital, surplus, undivided profits and reserves, loans, deposits and total resources since 1940; the number and amount of their mortgages, the banking facilities for each person in Carlisle and in Cumberland County, which was far greater than the State average or the National average; the location of banking offices and facilities in Carlisle and in Cumberland County; and the population and growth of townships and boroughs within the <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>trading area of Carlisle since 1940.' It likewise specifically found that the banks of Carlisle offered the same type of services that would be offered by the proposed branch, including trust services. It pointed out, with details, that the banking resources and facilities of Carlisle and of Cumberland County have grown very substantially faster than the population of Carlisle or of Cumberland County; that the banks of Carlisle have been and are now able (a) to supply all banking services and facilities needed in the Carlisle area and (b) to take care of all loans (through participation with other banks); that the Carlisle banks have stated their ability and their desire to Increase their capital and banking facilities whenever required to meet any additional need for banking facilities and services in Car-lisle; and finally, that the completion of the proposed merger would bring into the Carlisle area banking resources that are not needed and would result in an excess of banking facilities and services, causing over-banking of that area, to the detriment of the depositors, other creditors, and shareholders of the banks of that area and of all other interested persons and of the public in general.</p>

Appellants, however, disagree with the finding that the present banking facilities in Carlisle are adequate and point out that there were 13 loans in the last five years which could not be serviced by Carlisle Trust Company without participation. Appellants further point out that the merger will increase tenfold the lending capacity of Carlisle Trust Company; that the personal loan business and other bankable business in the Carlisle area is rapidly increasing; that Dauphin Deposit Trust Company has for years been serving customers and several thousand depositors who live in <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>Cumberland County; and that this merger will enable it to more adequately service the needs of this constantly growing community. Finally, appellants vigorously contend that the question whether the merger is made for legitimate purposes means what it says; it does not mean or include the question of adequate facilities or over-banking; and consequently, the Department of Banking <em>exceeded its power </em>in so holding and therefore was without jurisdiction to make the Order complained of.</p>

All of these five tests were adequately and fully met by the banks which applied for approval of the present proposed merger. The Department of Banking erroneously concluded that “whether the merger is made for legitimate purposes” did not have its plain and ordinary meaning but meant “whether there is <em>need </em>for the merger”. That test, which was established in the former §204 and also in subsection 204.1 B of the Act of 1955, is clearly inapplicable to the language of §204.1 A whether considered alone or in conjunction with §1406.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">*</a>
