Actually, the case had not been tried on the basis of the indicia of responsibility as specified in the Eestatement. In fact, the point had not been argued or even <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>raised in the trial court at any time and was first injected into the case by the defendants on their appeal to the Superior Court which court, upon consideration, rejected the rule as of no applicability to the proven facts of the case.</p>

The court was of the further opinion that this was an ultimate inference of fact supported by the basic findings as to the defendants’ knowledge of the attendant physical conditions relative to the dumps and their likely deleterious effects. In support of the view that the finding of intentional invasion was a conclusion of fact, the trial judge cited and quoted from Restatement, Torts, §825(b), as follows: “An invasion of another’s interest in the use and enjoyment of land is intentional when the actor ... (b) knows that it is resulting or is substantially certain to result from his conduct.” However, the court was also of the opinion that the decision in the <em>Waschalc </em>case was <em>res judicata </em>of the issues involved in the instant cases. Thereupon, the court entered judgments <em>nisi </em>on February 6, 1956, in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>and included also a compulsory nonsuit as to the co-defendant Glen Alden Coal Company.</p>

The court granted rules on the petitions which, after argument, were made absolute. The judgments were accordingly opened and the plaintiffs permitted to file their exceptions to the adjudications and judgments <em>nisi. </em>It is that action by the court below which is the subject matter of the defendants’ present appeals.</p>

It is true that Rule 1048 of the Pa. R. C. P., which relates to trial without jury in trespass actions, prescribes by subsection (d) twenty days for the filing of exceptions to the court’s decision and that subsection (f) suspended section 2 of the Act of 1874, cit. supra <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>(i.e., the thirty-day provision for exceptions), insofar as it was inconsistent with Rule 1048. Rule 1048 became effective upon its promulgation on April 26, 1955, and was expressly made applicable to all pending actions which the instant suits then were. But, the Rule was notably not made applicable to extant agreements of submission expressly executed in pursuance of the Act of 1874, supra. Nor can the Rules be reasonably construed as having so intended.</p>

These agreements were never changed by any action of the parties. Had the parties, or any of them, intended, subsequent to the adoption of Rule 1048, that the time for filing exceptions should be shortened from thirty to twenty days, they should have expressly so indicated by some affirmative act. The learned court below correctly concluded from the conduct of the parties in the premises that their intent continued to be that they should have thirty days for the filing of exceptions to the court’s decision. The judgments were, therefore, entered prematurely.</p>

      <em> </em>that the invasion of plaintiff’s land by gas and fumes was clearly not intentional nor unreasonable, <em>as those terms are used in the law. </em>The Court said (pages 447-455) : “An invasion of an interest may be intentional or unintentional. If an owner of land erects a factory upon it, which he operates, his act is, of course, intentional when he ignites fires under the boilers which emit smoke or fumes and operate noisy machinery. Such intentional operations may become a nuisance and cause damage to an adjoining property, depending upon the method of operation, location of the premises and surrounding circumstances. Under varying conditions the harm caused by the emission of offensive odors, noises, fumes, violations, etc., must be weighed against the utility of the operation. And even where the invasion of property rights is unintentional, and without negligence, if the activity is ultrahazardous there will be imposed an absolute liability for damages. Thus in a blasting operation, recovery was had where the damage was due solely to vibration and concussion: Federoff v.
