She intended to have a skirt dry cleaned. She had the skirt and her pocketbook in her left hand; she went to the store, which she had been in half a dozen times before, between 7:80 and 8:00 o’clock on the morning of August 3, 1953. The entrance to the store is recessed between display windows on either side. There is an <em>8%" </em>step up onto the doorstep which leads into the store. The platform is 46" wide and from its outer edge to the door is 35%". The door consists of a frame door which opens into the store and a screen door which opens out toward the street. Plaintiff stepped up onto the doorstep and reached for the screen door which she said was closed; she believes this required two steps (forward) ; she pulled open the <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>door and stepped back two steps, to allow for tbe sweeping arc of the screen door; on ber second step backward sbe landed on tbe pavement where sbe fell. Sbe does not recall where sbe was looking when she stepped back onto the pavement but thinks sbe Was looking at tbe signs in the window.

In this contention, the defendants ignore, as indeed so does the majority of this Court, that, there are acts and stated conditions which can be regarded as negligent only if they <em>exclude </em>contributory negligence. There would be nothing negligent about the defendants’ platform except that one might fall off it in opening the door in a perfectly normal fashion. In opening a door, nothing can be more natural and normal than that the pedestrian will open it wide enough for him to enter, and in that moment it would not be unusual for him to overlook or forget the step behind him.</p>

But here the plaintiff was compelled to open the door. The store owners- obliged her to open the door in order that they might sell her something, and they obliged her also to step back in getting her into the store. Under those circumstances they had the duty to see to it that when she stepped back she did not step over a drop in the level of the standing platform. Charging the plaintiff with contributory negligence as a matter of law in this case is transferring the responsibility of the store proprietor to the store’s customer. It was up to the proprietor to remove the hazard at his doorstep. This could have been done easily by extending the platform 10 inches, or, failing-to do that, he should have erected a sign warning customers of the danger involved in stepping back.</p>

Whether the plaintiff should have acted differently from what she did is a question for the jury which is peculiarly equipped to cope with such a question.

In the case of <em>Johnson v. </em>Rulon, <a href="/pa/363/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="363 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="1221684" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0585-01">363 Pa. 585</a>, the plaintiff was injured in a restaurant by falling into an open trap door which escaped his attention at the crucial moment because he was looking at signs advertising menus for the day.

His glancing up to read them as he walked along the counter, before turning left, cannot arbitrarily be said to have been unwarranted ... If, however, by looking up at the signs rather than at the floor, he was, at the time, not using the caution expected of a reasonably prudent person in such circumstances, the question presented was one of fact <em>for the jury </em>and not of law for the court . . .

Habit is stronger than memory and, unless memory is reinforced by concentration and resolution, habit will usually carry the day. Repetitive routine will smother any momentary spark of fleeting recollection, unless it is kept burning with mental resolution unaffected by other distractions. After one has opened 5,000 or 10,000 doors in his life without once having had to step back and down to a lower level in order to get it fully open, it is not unnatural for him to overlook that in this one instance he must do just that. In the case of <em>Greene v. Harris, </em>R.I. 5, 17, Judge Potter, writing for the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, sagely said: <em>“Human nature constitutes a part of the evidence in every case. </em>We more easily believe that a person has done what we should have expected under the circumstances; <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>and we require a greater degree of evidence to satisfy us that a person has done something which would be unnatural or improbable.”</p>

When she reached the fourth or fifth step she moved to the left to permit several descending persons to pass. As she did so she struck a sharp board on the edge of the ceiling bordering the stair ease. The projecting board was not concealed in any way. On this basis the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was guilty of legal contributory negligence. The Supreme Court of California rejected this contention: “But even though the evidence did establish that the alleged defect in the construction of defendant’s premises was patent and observable to anyone using the stairway, and that in addition plaintiff by reason of her past visits to the restaurant was familiar with the existing condition, there would still be <em>the question for the determination of the jury as to whether or not it was a want of ordinary care on the part of plaintiff not to have Jcept in mind such element of danger 'when stepping toward the wall rail to allow other persons descending the stairs to pass.”</em>

On this subject the California Supreme Court said: “Even forgetfulness of a known danger will not operate to prevent a recovery, for to forget is not negligence unless it shows a want of ordinary care. <em>Generally the question is one for the jury.”</em>

The restaurant owner there, had, in remodelling his establishment, altered the entrance way by constructing a wooden platform above the original top stone step or landing and by changing the entrance door to swing outwardly. In opening the door one brought its maximum outward arc to a point flush with the outside edge of the wooden platform. As the plaintiff in that case opened the door she stepped backward and off the platform, sustaining injuries. Although the situation was a patent one, as in the California <em>Neel </em>case, the Supreme Court (Appellate Division) of New York held that the question of negligence (and contributory negligence) was a question of fact for the jury. The Court added that it was for the jury to determine whether the entrance way as reconstructed did not constitute a “trap75. The same can be said of the case at bar. The architectural layout of the entrance way here could well constitute a trap for the unwary and the unsuspicious, that is, for the general <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>population that assumes, and has the right to assume, that store owners will give them maximum security and not the minimum of protection against preventable and foreseeable mishap.</p>
