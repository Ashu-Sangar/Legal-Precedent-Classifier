The complaint — regularly endorsed with a notice to plead within 20 days of service — was served upon appellants on November 29, 1954. No appearance was entered nor answer filed to the complaint. On December 22, 1954 — ■ 23 days subsequent to service of the complaint — appellee filed a praecipe for judgment by default, pursuant to Pa. B. C. P. 1511(a), directing the prothonotary to enter a judgment by default because appellants failed to plead to the complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On January 12, 1955 —21 days subsequent to entry of the judgment and 44 days after the service of the complaint — appellee petitioned the Court, pursuant to Pa.

It was not until June 2, 1955 — 5 months, 10 days subsequent to the entry of judgment and 4 months, 10 days subsequent to the final decree — that appellants petitioned to open the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[236,536,1153,930]]]'>The factual background of this litigation is necessary of recitation. Both appellee and appellants hold title to adjoining unseated lands in Lycoming County. In 1928 appellee built and has since maintained a fire line along what it claims is the proper boundary line between the respective properties. Appellants claim that this fire line is entirely on their land. In an attempt to reach an amicable settlement of this boundary line dispute the parties executed a written agreement on January 26, 1953. This agreement provided that each party was to select and employ a surveyor, that the two surveyors thus chosen were to determine the proper boundary line, that the decision reached by the surveyors would bind each set of parties and that the parties would then execute and record in the Recorder’s office in Lycoming County an agreement embodying the line thus established.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[232,1480,1149,543]]]'>In accord with this agreement, the surveyors met upon the land and certified their findings as to the correct line. Appellants, although notified of the findings, refused to abide by their agreement upon the grounds that the findings were irreconcilable with the facts, that the surveyors had acted collusively and that the survey had not been completed. It will be noted that the boundary line fixed by the Court’s decree of January 12, 1955 was the boundary fixed and certified by the surveyors.</p>

The record amply supports this conclusion. Appellants’ counsel had been retained 6 months prior to the time the complaint was served for the purpose of handling matters involved in the boundary line dispute. A secretary for one of appellants testified that he took the complaint to counsel and they talked of the necessity for filing an answer within 20 days. When the secretary was asked whether he had computed when the 20 days would expire he responded: “No, I didn’t, I left it to Mr. Szybist’s discretion with the warning that he take care of it; he said he would, and if he found he needed extra time he would try to get it.” The secretary further testified that it was not until March 26, 1955— almost 5 months later — that he again personally visited the attorney’s office and at that time he was informed <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>the appellants had bargained away their rights in this matter.</p>
    <p id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[133,452,1148,438]]]'>As the learned court below aptly said: “In our opinion the judgment taken in this case should not be opened. We are of the opinion that the defendants were not acting in good faith, that they delayed in asserting a defense. We feel that had the defendants been sincere in wanting to defend the action they would have seen that an appearance was filed, as well as an answer. They took the matter too lightly.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[130,901,1149,548]]]'>“The defendants blame the delay on their lawyer. They had paid this lawyer a retaining fee six months before the equity action was commenced. They had other litigation, however, and there is some confusion as to just what the lawyer was supposed to do. This attorney was not called as a witness although he could have been easily secured. The defendants’ own testimony indicates that the matter of the law suit complained of may have been left to the discretion of the attorney.” (Eec. 125a)</p>
    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.7",233,[129,1463,1148,432]]]'>The learned court below was entirely justified in concluding that either answering the complaint was left in the attorney’s discretion or else appellants were not acting in good faith and not sincerely interested in asserting a defense at that time. At any rate, it is clear the necessity for filing an answer was recognized and failure to file such answer was not the result of oversight or inadvertence.</p>
    <p id="b233-7" data-blocks='[["BL_233.8",233,[128,1909,1149,435]],["BL_234.1",234,[256,345,1145,376]]]'>Even after becoming aware of the entry of judgment — May 6, 1955 — appellants took no further formal action until June 2, 1955 — 27 days later — when they filed the petition to open judgment. The court below was justified in concluding that no satisfactory explanation had been given for this delay. During this period appellee began the construction of the road in the disputed area, thereby making a valuable improve<a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>ment and changing its position in reliance on the lower court’s decree. These considerations compel us to decide that the court below committed no abuse in holding that appellants made no prompt application to open the judgment, gave no reasonable excuse for their delay, and that to allow them to open this judgment would be prejudicial to appellee.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[256,735,1147,1046]]]'>The court below held properly that the appellants had no meritorious defense. Admittedly, appellee constructed a fire line in 1928 and has always maintained that this line constituted the correct boundary between the properties. Appellants agreed to arbitrate the boundary dispute and to accept the findings of the surveyors as final and conclusive and this agreement they breached. Appellants now claim that the findings are incorrect, that the survey was incomplete and that there was collusion between the surveyors. The surveyor employed by appellants under the agreement testified that he signed the certificate of findings because in his opinion the fire line was the only properly marked line in the disputed area. No proof was offered by appellants to substantiate the charge of collusion between the surveyors. The entire factual background of this litigation reveals dilatory tactics on the part of appellants, unreasonable delay in protecting their interests and even a breach of a written understanding.</p>
