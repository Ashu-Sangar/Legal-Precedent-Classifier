He was duly sentenced on May 6, 1954. Somewhat over two years later, in July of 1956, while incarcerated in the Eastern State Penitentiary at Philadelphia, he mailed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the court below which was received on July 25, 1956. The President Judge, on July 30th, made an order directing the issuance of a rule to show cause upon the Warden of the Penitentiary, with notice to the District Attorney and Attorney General, and at the same time appointed counsel to represent the relator. Hearing was fixed for August 7th, the return day of the rule. At this hearing counsel for the relator and the District Attorney were present and argument was heard on the law as to the sufficiency of the allegations in relator’s petition. No evidence was taken.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[240,1171,1149,764]]]'>The pertinent allegations for the writ are the following : “4. That said sentence is illegal, in that it was procured under coercion, threat, and duress, while relator was under the influence of narcodicts (sic), and unable to comprehend what was taking place at the time of his trial. 5. That the Foreman on the Jury, one, Mrs. Pauline Shatzer, in the case of Commonwealth versus William Kennedy, was a relative of the deceased, and should not have been permitted to serve on the said Jury, the common law states that this is not permissable (sic) in a capitol (sic) case. 6. That the said Juror was closely related to the deceased. That the said juror was prejudiced and could not give a fair and impartial verdict.”.</p>

Holding that the allegations were too vague to permit the District Attorney to prepare a responsive answer, the court entered the following order: “Now, this 28th day of August, 1956, the prayer of the petition for writ of Habeas Corpus is denied and the petition is dismissed without prejudice to the right of petitioner if grounds exist, to file a new petition.”.</p>

Moreover, at the time that this order was handed down petitioner was represented by counsel and a reapplication for the writ could have been made immediately with more definite averments, as suggested in the court’s opinion, if any facts in support existed. Instead relator took an appeal to this Court in propria persona.</p>

We have examined the record and there is not a scintilla of evidence that he was at any time before, during or after his trial subjected to coercion, threat or duress, nor did he or his counsel at any time so contend prior to his personal application for the writ, made two years after sentence. And his own testimony, which we have carefully read, devastatingly negates any lack of comprehension of “what was taking place at the time of his trial”. His answers to questions — his testimony covered 49 closely typed <em>pages </em>— were at all times responsive and showed alertness and intelligent thinking. Nothing indicated abnormalcy or that he was under the influence of any narcotic.</p>

Eelator’s counsel had the opportunity of inquiring as to whether she was related to the decedent. He and his client were apparently satisfied with the juror and accepted her. The Act of May 17, 1939, P. L. 157, §9, 17 PS §1340, provides, inter alia: “. . . After jurors are sworn without objection all objections to their qualifications as prescribed by this act . . . shall be deemed to have been waived. No indictment can be attacked or verdict challenged by reason of any juror’s disqualification under this act,.. . unless due objection is made before said alleged disqualified, or illegally selected jurors are sworn.”: See <em>Commonwealth v.

He was represented by counsel and both were present at every stage of the proceedings, from its inception to its conclusion, including the return of the jury’s verdict and the imposition of sentence. Judge Wingbed’s charge was most comprehensive and impartial. Following the verdict counsel for defendant moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, but these motions were withdrawn in a petition executed by relator which recited that after a careful review of the transcript of the proceedings by relator and his counsel they found no error or cause for complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>- Nor do we.</p>
