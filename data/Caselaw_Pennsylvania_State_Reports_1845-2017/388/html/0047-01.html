      <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Plaintiffs and the defendants Amsel were adjoining landowners of lots overlooking the Wissahickon Valley in Philadelphia. In 1947 the Amsels, wanting their property graded, arranged with the defendant D’Angelo Brothers, Inc., excavation contractors, to grade and re<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> move rock from their property, in exchange for which the contractors were to keep the rock removed. The contractors removed the rock from the Amsels’ lot, and between November, 1951 and June, 1953, they also excavated rock from plaintiffs’ property, virtually bisecting it and leaving almost half of it twelve to fourteen feet lower than the remainder.</p>
    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[160,1009,1149,265]]]'>Plaintiffs thereupon instituted an action in equity in 1954 praying for an injunction against further excavation of their land by defendants, and asking that defendants be required to either restore the property or pay damages in lieu thereof.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.6",79,[158,1288,1149,426]]]'>The chancellor, after hearings and conferences, issued the injunction, and ordered defendants either to restore the property to its former condition or to pay damages in the amount of $10,500. The complaint against defendants Edwin T. and Edith B. Weinstein, subsequent purchasers of a parcel from the defendants Amsel, was dismissed by the chancellor at that time, which dismissal is not on review here.</p>
    <p id="b79-6" data-blocks='[["BL_79.7",79,[157,1736,1148,487]]]'>The plaintiffs contended that they purchased the lot in 1945 for the purpose of building a home thereon for themselves because of the unique and beautiful view that this lot afforded of the valley. Their explanation of the delay in beginning construction of that home is based on the fact that they had also purchased a farm in Quakertown at about the same time, and that they did not have the money to build on the property here involved until about year before suit was instituted.</p>
    <p id="b79-7" data-blocks='[["BL_79.8",79,[157,2238,1146,101]],["BL_80.1",80,[253,332,1146,821]]]'>On the other hand, the defendants contended that plaintiffs had never really intended living on this lot, <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>pointing to the fact that plaintiff Charles H. Jones characterized his business as that of an “investor”, that he had purchased and sold approximately one house per year for a number of years, that no improvements had been made on this lot since its purchase, and that in 1950 a “For Sale” sign had been posted by plaintiffs on their property. Furthermore, the defendants contended that since the original purchase price of this lot had been only $1,800, and that since an estimate made by a witness produced by the plaintiffs based on the recent prices paid for similar lots in the vicinity places the current value of this lot, if unimpaired or restored to its former condition, at something less than $4,000, an award of $10,500 is unreasonable and inequitable.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[255,1174,1144,201]]]'>The chancellor in his original adjudication had made a finding of fact that this lot was unique because of the view and that plaintiffs had purchased it as a site on which to erect a house for themselves.</p>
    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.6",80,[253,1397,1145,654]]]'>Upon review, the court en banc noted that “A careful review of the testimony, as to plaintiffs’ intention in good faith to use the lot in question for the erection of a residence for their own use, convinces even the chancellor that there is room for grave doubt on that point.” It further found that since there was here a past and not a continuing trespass, no injunction was in order and that since plaintiffs’ right to a mandatory decree of restoration was not sufficiently clear to warrant such a decree, the case should be transferred to the law side of the court for trial there. From this final order, plaintiffs appeal.</p>

It does appear that shortly before trial there was an overturned mixing trough and some sand on plaintiffs’ lot, but certainly that is not the trespass of which plaintiffs complain. The excavation activities of which defendants Amsel and D’Angelo Brothers, Inc. are accused appear to have been a past trespass and to have ceased well before trial of this action. There being no continuing tort requiring or justifying the issuance of an injunction, one should not be allowed to issue: <em>Leininger’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/106/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="106 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="455708" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0398-01">106 Pa. 398</a>.

The chancellor seems to have recognized this, even pri- or to changing his mind at the hearing en banc, when he decreed the alternative of damages in the sum of $10,500 in lieu of restoration. There is grave doubt that plaintiffs ever intended this lot to be used ás a home. That doubt alone would prevent a decree of affirmative relief. In <em>Wakeling v.
