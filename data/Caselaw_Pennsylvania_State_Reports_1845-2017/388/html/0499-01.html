There is no doubt that Francis Thomas was killed in battle. Was that battle-death the kind of death which was excluded from the insurance policy of which the plaintiff in this case is the beneficiary?

But in doing so, it undertakes the hopeless task of differentiating between Boland and Oliver. Thus, it points out that in the Beley insurance policy the exclusionary phrase read: “Time of war,” whereas in the Thomas policy the exclusionary phrase reads: “act of war.” Is that a difference? The Majority says that Beley was not killed in time of war (Korean), but that Thomas was killed by an act of war (still Korean). Would Aristotle approve of that kind of logical differentiation?</p>

He did not analyze or define the word “time” as it appears in the phrase “time of war.” He considered and discussed only the word “war,” which, obviously, is the catalytic agent in the whole alembic of discussion. In the very first sentence of his opinion, Chief Justice Stern asked: “Is the present struggle in Korea a ‘war’ within the meaning of that term as employed in a certain life insurance policy?” Speaking for the Court he answered that question No. Why does the Court today answer the same question Yes?</p>

We have seen that so far as the courts are concerned, the word “war” means constitutional <em>war; </em>it means congressionally declared war. It cannot mean anything else. We said so on February 14, 1953. The Constitution of the United States says so. Do we need any higher authority? Thus, the phrase “act of war” must be read “act of constitutional war.” Since the Korean conflict is not a constitutionally declared war, that fact should of itself demonstrate that the exclusionary provision in the policy is inoperative. However, since the Majority discusses at length the phrase “act of war,” candor requires comment on the Majority’s use of those words.</p>

But not even the insurance company would argue that it could legally deny payments in such a situation. But if it still be insisted that the insurance company intended “act of Avar” to be synonymous with “warlike act,” then it must be admitted that the phrase “act of Avar” is at least capable of both interpretations: (1) a warlike act, and, (2) an eA^ent performed in a state of war.

Thus, it speaks of the sinking of the Lusitania as an act of Avar; it speaks of Pershing’s expedition into Mexico as an act of war; it speaks of Thomas’s death as an act of war. These three episodes differ as much from one another as if they happened on three individual planets. The sinking of the Lusitania was a <em>casus belli; </em>the Pershing Punitive Expedition was a reprisal which did not eA^entuate in war; the killing of Thomas was an incident of warfare. The Majority speaks of the bombing of the Panay, the explosion of the TJ.S.S. Maine, the Boxer Rebellion in China, the air attack on Rotterdam, and the destruction of WarsaAV, all as acts of Avar.

Thus, as I have already shoAvn, the sinking of the United States destroyer <em>Reuben Jones </em>was an act of war, but it did not occur <em>during </em>a state of war. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was an act of war but it did not occur during a state of war. The fact that I stated that Beley was killed by an act of Avar establishes that I regarded this particular act of Avar (and the phrase was here used in the sense of an incident of warfare) was <em>not </em>excluded by the insurance policy. I maintained that the act of war which killed Beley did not deprive his mother of benefits under the insurance policy, as I maintain today that the act of war which killed Thomas does not deprive his father of benefits under the insurance policy.

How does the death of Thomas differ from the death of Beley? As the Majority well says: “Both met their death in Korea by enemy action.” But how does the Majority explain the fact that in 1953 when it found that Beley was killed by enemy action, it authorized payment of insurance benefits, but today that it finds Thomas was killed by the same enemy action, it refuses payment of insurance? Where is the consistency? Where is the logic? Where is the law? Where is the justice?
