C., 1937), where Case, a former member who had procured a judgment against the International Association in North Carolina because of alleged wrongdoings against him by the Union, was suing upon that judgment in the District of Columbia. The International Association contended that service of process in the North Carolina suit upon the Secretary-Treasurer of Local Union No. 176 was not proper service against the International Association. The Court examined the duties of the Secretary-Treasurer of the Local Union toward the International Association. It found that the secretary was requested to forward information about membership and apprenticeship, furnish information concerning local finances on forms furnished by the International Association, perform certain functions for the International concerning members who travel or work temporarily in the local area, furnish certain information for strike fund and death benefit purposes, give information and perform duties for the International Association in connection with the imposition of fines by the Local Union, collect and transmit dues for the International Association and that for failure to perform these functions, the International Association could fine the Local Union and remove the secretary. The Court of Appeals upheld the judgment, finding that the summons in the North Carolina suit was valid, having been served “. . . upon ‘any agent or representative of the association whose character in relation to the association is such that it could be reasonably ex<a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>pected that he would give notice of the suit to his association.’ . .</p>

Process in a suit against the National Association was served upon one Angerholzer. The Court found that Angerholzer’s primary occupation was as a self-employed Shipping Master, which is an occupation similar to an employment agency. He was also employed by the State of Florida as a Deputy Harbor Master, and further by Local No. 24 of the aforenamed association at $50 per month to help place the Local’s members aboar.d ships. While he occasionally collected dues for the Local from members whom he placed, he had never been an official or even a member of the Local or of the National Association, nor was he eligible for such membership, and shortly after service of process in this case he was discharged from his employment by the Local because of dissatisfaction in the way he had been placing its members. It may be noted that he placed both union and non-union men in available jobs. The Court of Appeals held that service upon Angerholzer was invalid since he was not responsible to the National Association and there was no reasonable assurance that notice would ever be delivered to the defendants. A mere recitation of the facts makes it unnecessary to further distinguish that case.</p>

The paraphernalia of members is obtained from the corporation. A is doing business in Y.”</p>

Early in his opinion he asked the question (p. 383) : “. . . Were the unincorporated associations, the International Union, District No. 21, and the local unions suable in their names . . .”. And then, in a masterful recognition of the evolving social and economic character of the labor movement, the Court held that they were liable to suit. “. . . Undoubtedly at common law, an unincorporated association of persons was not rec<a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>ognized as having any other character than a partnership in whatever was done, and it could only sue or he sued in the names of its members, and their liability had to be enforced against each member . . . But the growth and necessities of these great labor organizations have brought affirmative legal recognition of their existence and usefulness and provisions for their protection, which their members have found necessary ... It would be unfortunate if an organization with as great power as this International Union has in the raising of large funds and in directing the conduct of four hundred thousand members in carrying on, in a wide territory, industrial controversies and strikes, out of which so much unlawful injury to private rights is possible, could assemble its assets to be used therein free from liability for injuries by torts committed in course of such strikes. To remand persons injured to a suit against each of the 400,000 members to recover damages and to levy on his share of the strike fund, would be to leave them remediless.”.</p>

There is nothing to show that the International Board ever authorized it, <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>took any part in preparation for it or in its maintenance.

We do not conceive that such responsibility is imposed on the National body. A corporation is responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course of its business, and this principle is enforced against the contention that torts are <em>ultra vires </em>of the corporation. But it must be shown that it is in the business of the corporation. Surely no stricter rule can be enforced against an unincorporated organization like this. Here it is not a question of contract or of holding out an appearance of authority on which some third person acts. It is a mere question of actual agency which the constitutions of the two bodies settle conclusively. If the International body had interfered or if it had assumed liability by ratification, different questions would have arisen.”.</p>

The Majority urges that the International directs the policies of its branches, which, to a certain extent is true. It points out also that the ILGWU is armed with wide-sweeping authority, which is also true. But we are confronted in this case with a condition, not a theory. If the ILGWU does not do business at 929 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, and Mr. Bloomfield is not an officer or registered agent of the ILGWU, how can service on him at the place indicated be legal service against ILGWU?

Both these questions must be answered in the affirmative and, with that affirmation, the litigation should end. No one questions that the Joint Board has the power and resources to meet Miss Spica’s demands if they are supported with legal proof. Wrhy, then, the recourse to the ILGWU? It would almost seem that the purpose of the lawsuit is to establish some doctrine which has nothing to do with resolving the claim outlined in the complaint.</p>

At the time of the argument before us on this appeal, counsel for the ILGWU announced in open court that the Philadelphia Dress Joint Board stands ready and is financially able to discharge any obligation imposed upon it by the Court after a hearing of Miss Spica’s case.

Still on this subsidiary road of theory, the Majority argues: “Nor can there be any question as to the opportunity of the defendant International to be heard in our courts. We are aware of no bar to its appearance before a court in this State. The distances involved are not great. And its appearance de bene esse, and at the depositions and hearings in the court below, convince us that it has sufficient opportunity to be heard.”</p>

    <p id="b446-7" data-blocks='[["BL_446.7",446,[225,1695,1148,374]]]'>The Majority says that “the distances involved are not great.” This is not only an irrelevancy but a patronizing irrelevancy.

Appearance de bene esse is tbe specific method open to a defendant to object to an ostensible Court jurisdiction, without admitting it.

A reading of the very excerpt quoted by the Majority will show that the <em>ratio decidendi </em>in the <em>Grand Lodge </em>case is entirely different from the one in the case at bar. There, as the Majority has quoted, we said: “A union local has no more power than that assigned to it by the parent body of which it is a part . . . In a labor union the central body is the custodian of the reservoir of power which it channels into the locals in such manner and according to such methods as will best serve the entire organization.
