It is to be noted that Item 7 of the will deals entirely and exclusively with Penncom stock, the only duties of the trustees named therein would be in connection with Penncom stock and without Penncom stock the trust would be inoperative.</p>

He did not state that any stood in his name as Trustee.” It is inconceivable that decedent, preparing for the disposition of his wordly assets, Avould create a trust, name trustees and set forth in detail the terms of the trust if he did not then own, either as an individual or as a trustee, the stock which was to be the <em>entire res </em>of the trust.

The articles of merger recited, inter alia, that: (1) Penncom was a holding company which owned 100% of the stock of the Comerford Publix Corporation, Comerford Publix Theatres Corporation and Midas Theatres Corporation; (2) that 21 named corporations owned 100% of the stock of Penncom; (3) “all of the stock of the above named companies (including the 21 companies owning 100% of the stock of Penncom Corporation) is owned, directly or indirectly, in the following proportions: <em>One-third by the Estate of M.

Coupled with O’Leary’s appointment as trustee, this statement furnishes a reasonable basis to justify an inquiry when and under what circumstances decedent ceased being the owner of this stock. If the appellee did not come into possession of this stock by reason of the fact that decedent had divested himself of ownership therein prior to his death, what possible harm to appellee can result from a disclosure of the facts of such divestiture? On the other hand, the doubt which now arises would be dissipated by a complete revelation of the facts.</p>

    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[177,502,1153,1531]]]'>Appellee, in his brief, argues that October 31, 1955 was “the last day, the cut-off date, for appellant to file exceptions and the Account was confirmed finally as to appellant at that time.” On the other hand, the record shows that exceptions to the account, supra, were then pending and remained undisposed of until December 15, 1955; further, the notice by publication of this account stated that if no objections were filed by March 16, 1956 the account would be audited on March 20, 1956. If appellee’s argument be sound, then there was one time limit applicable to appellant and another time limit applicable to others, a result the injustice of which is self-evident. The fact is that the petition for distribution for the first time disclosed appellee’s position that decedent had divested himself of the stock prior to his death and that petition was not filed until the audit on March 20, 1956. On the same day, at audit, appellant raised this question before the lower court and six days thereafter filed a formal answer to the petition for distribution formally raising the question. Not only was the appellant’s objection timely, but it was made when appellee first disclosed his position concerning the Penncom stock. Cf. <em>Stotesbury Estate, </em>supra, p. 595: “That the petitioners did not raise the question at the time of the audit and confirmation of the account or upon the entry of the adjudication is not valid ground for denying the petitioners the desired relief.”</p>

The Orphans’ Court Act of 1951, as amended, vests jurisdiction in the Orphans’ Court to adjudicate the title to personal property not only where it is in the personal representative’s possession but also where it is registered in the name of decedent or his nominee, or alleged by the personal representative to have been in decedent’s possession at the time of his death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Our inquiry is whether appellant has the right to ascertain whether the personalty was in decedent’s possession or registered in his name or that of a nominee when he died.

Thus, on record, we have an agreement under which the appellee, in his fiduciary capacity in this estate, and, acting with O’Leary in their fiduciary capacities in the other two estates, will pay $1,000,000 to exceptants, part of the consideration for which is the exoneration of appellee and O’Leary from the charges contained in the exceptions.</p>
