The account states assets to be turned over to an administrator d.b.n.</p>

Later, <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>Carmalia Horetsky, a daughter of the decedent was appointed administratrix pro tern. Francis Ferrar subsequently was removed as administrator, and his brother Anthony was appointed administrator d.b.n. upon his entry of a surety bond in the sum of $20,000.</p>
    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[155,621,1149,1543]]]'>The estate instituted an assumpsit action against Ray E. Steward in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. Defendant Steward counterclaimed against the estate and a verdict was entered in his favor in the amount of $8,042.01. The Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial. Prior to the order of a new trial a final account was filed by the removed administrator and the administratrix pro tern in the orphans’ court. The accountants made no provision for the payment of Steward’s claim and took a credit of $13,158.95 for distribution previously made to the heirs of the decedent without order of court. The final account showed a balance of $25,426.97, consisting in the main of cash and securities. Steward, the only creditor of the estate, filed exceptions to the failure of the accountants to make provision for securing his claim and to the credit claimed by the accountants for distribution already made. On the adjudication the orphans’ court directed that the sum of $10,000 be impounded as security for payment of Steward’s verdict and dismissed his other exceptions. The orphans’ court was then advised that a new trial had been granted by the Dauphin County Court in the matter of Steward’s counterclaim against the estate. Thereupon, the orphans’ court revoked the impounding order and dismissed all of Steward’s exceptions. From this last order Steward nov/ appeals.</p>

The record does not disclose the existence of any other creditor except the . appellant. Neither in his brief nor at oral argument was appellant able to demonstrate the possible existence of any claim against the estate in addition to his own. The appellant’s claim is unliquidated and the account now shows a balance ample to provide for payment.
