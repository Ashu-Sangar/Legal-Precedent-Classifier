To subject litigants to all the worries attendant upon a.court trial when justice-does not require it constitutes an act of gratuitous supererogation. The Majority does not say that it is shocked by the amount of the verdict rendered in the Court below, it does not say that the Trial Court erred in its charge, to the jury, it does not say that the jury misunderstood the charge or the evidence. The Majority Opinion fails to reveal one substantial reason as to why Lee Smith, who at the original trial, was required to relate the harrowing details of how he was run down by a truck, knocked unconscious, and taken to a hospital, must, in narrative, again be struck down, again knocked unconscious and again undergo all the torments of the witness stand and the agony of awaiting a jury’s verdict.</p>

Blumberg’s Son, Inc., was responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries, nor is it claimed that the plaintiff contributed in any way to the happening of the accident. The plaintiff’s injuries consisted of a fractured finger, a fractured foot, a serious injury to his lower back, and a post concussion syndrome. In his suit against the owner of the truck, the jury awarded him a verdict of $25,000 which this Court regards as “grossly excessive” but not shocking. We have said repeatedly that “the question of the amount of the verdict would be reviewed only in cases wheré so grossly excessive as to shock our sense of justice.”. <em>(Scott v. American Exp. Co., </em><a href="/pa/257/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="257 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1032416" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0025-01">257 Pa. 25</a>, 31.)

    <p id="b183-4" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[145,587,1150,869]]]'>Is $25,000 of shocking magnitude when one considers that it is compensation for the most distressing misfortune which can overtake a longshoreman? Anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with the work of a longshoreman knows that in loading and unloading ships, a disabled back is as crippling as an atrophied arm is to a blacksmith. The work of a longshoreman perhaps represents the maximum of physical exertion, involving, as it does, the all-day-long lifting and carrying of heavy and cumbersome objects, frequently over uncertain footing. The ensemble of effort required by a longshoreman in the discharge of his duties with efficiency and care epitomizes probably the most strenuous muscular exertion to which the human body can be subjected. For a longshoreman to injure his back is to spring a tendon in Atlas’s shoulders.</p>

Dr. Martin A. Blaker testified: “The range of flexion of the back continues to be restricted, and in my last examination it was approximately two-thirds of normal.”</p>
    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.7",183,[145,1911,1147,429]],["BL_184.1",184,[254,369,1144,264]]]'>Under the testimony presented at the trial, the jury was warranted in concluding the plaintiff has lost one-third of his future earning power. On the basis of an average annual wage of $5500, Lee Smith thus would lose some $1800 per year over a period of 23 years (the difference, between his age of 42 and the retirement age of 65). This would mean a total loss of $41,400, which, reduced to present worth, would still leave the <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>plaintiff a figure in excess of $25,000, especially when one considers the compensation for pain, suffering and inconvenience, plus what he would additionally be entitled to because of normal increases in wages over the years.</p>
    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[254,642,1146,596]]]'>The Majority suggests that possibly Smith’s disability is due to something other than the truck accident of December 7, 1953, because on February 19, 1954, a 100-pound sack of wheat fell across his shoulders. This accident has received in the Majority Opinion a dramatic setting out of all proportion to the realities of the occurrence. The wheat sack incident was so trifling and the resulting discomfiture so evanescent that the plaintiff lost no time from work on account of it and he made no application for compensation for any injury, nor did he receive any compensation.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[251,1250,1149,868]]]'>It is baffling to me why the Majority seeks to convey the impression that Dr. Blaker was something less than frank in his testimony. The Majority says: “Dr. Blaker did not even indicate any evidence of muscle spasm or pain until his examination on January 6, 1958.” As a matter of fact, Dr. Blaker testified that on the very first examination on January 21, 1954, he found plaintiff suffering with a back condition: “I examined his back and found the maximum to which he could bend forward and keep his legs straight — and this motion is called flexion of the lumbosacral spine— he could reach Ms fingertips about 10 inches from the floor, and that represented some limitation of motion. He could not bend beyond that because of the pain <em>when I first saw him. </em>Those are the essential findings at the time of my <em>first examination."</em>

The Majority says: “It is further significant that plaintiff failed to complain of any head pain or headaches until December, 1955, when he was treated by Dr. Fisher.” The record reveals that the plaintiff complained about headaches from the time the heavy truck collided with him and catapulted him through the air and to the asphalt. Well could he have done so. One is not rendered unconscious for ten minutes as the result of a cerebral blow, without feeling some painful after-effect. Prize fighters who are knocked out by blows on the head do not forget the sledge hammer impact easily. The Majority has utterly ignored the plaintiff’s testimony with regard to <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>Ms head injury: “Q. It was after the accident you had these headaches four or five times a week and sometimes more? A. Yes. Q. <em>Did you make complaints? </em>A. Complaints? Q. <em>Did you tell the hospital about it? </em>A. <em>Yes, certainly. </em>... Q. In any event, will you tell us what was done for you at the hospital? A. Yes. They took my ribs and fixed them, and put a cast on my foot and a cast on my finger, and they gave me <em>some pills to take for my head. </em>. . . Q. What , about your head? When you went back to work in February, how did your head feel? A. <em>I had two or three headaches a day. </em>Q. What was wrong with your head? A. I had fainting— like <em>dizziness, </em>thinking I was going to fall over, and I had to sit down for a while, and I always had to take something to relieve my <em>headaches </em>all the time. Q.

No one questioned his qualifications. He is a thoroughly trained physician, and, whether he has practised for two years or twenty years, it was for the jury to decide whether his testimony was predicated on fact.</p>

If a person limps for a long period of time, that fact should be pretty good evidence that there is something wrong with his powers of locomotion. If a young man otherwise healthy cannot lift his arm above his head, that should suggest at least that he would not be qualified to pitch a game in the World Series. Equally so, if by actual observation, study, and palpation, a doctor finds a limitation of motion in a man’s back, why' should his medical and factual finding be questioned because he has not taken a spinal puncture? A spinal puncture, as interesting and helpful a test as it is, does not represent the infallible horoscope in the sky of a man’s physical future.</p>

In view of the fact that no trial error has been discovered, it can be assumed that the plaintiff will produce the same evidence and in the same manner that he produced it at the last trial. There is nothing to suggest that another jury, upon that same evidence, may not return another verdict for $25,000 or even more. Why, then, another trial?</p>

      <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>The Majority suggests that the plaintiff’s loss of wages was of little consequence, citing the item of $800 mentioned in the evidence. But the figure of $800 does not take into consideration the increase in wages given to all longshoremen since the plaintiff’s accident and which the plaintiff would have received had he not been injured. Moreover, the fact that an injured person’s wages may be the same as the rate at which he was paid prior to the accident, or even more, by no means establishes that he has not suffered a reduction in earning power. In the case of <em>Bochar v. J. B. Martin Motors, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/374/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="374 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1241480" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0240-01">374 Pa. 240</a>, this Court justly said: “Where permanent injury is involved, the whole span of life must be considered. Has the economic horizon of the disabled person been shortened because of the injuries sustained as the result of the tortfeasor’s negligence? That is the test. And it is no answer to that test to say that there are just as many dollars in the patient’s pay envelope now as prior to his accident. The normal status of a healthy person is to progress, and to the extent that his progress has been curtailed, he has suffered a loss which is properly computable in damages.”</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[210,1597,1150,650]]]'>It is to be noted also that Smith remained at his employment only because his immediate foreman was able temporarily to find some non-strenuous work for him to perform, such as “checking and pointing.” There can be no assurance that this type of assignment will always be available or, if available, that some other foreman will not give it to some other person. When a working man has been tortiously injured, he is entitled to remuneration on the basis of what he has lost in depreciation of his physical strength, agility and endurance, unaffected by acts of fortuitous benevolence which a charitable superior might send in his direction.</p>

This Court reversed. Mr. Justice Horace Stern, in a very vigorous opinion, with which the whole Court agreed, wrote: “A new trial should not be granted because of a mere conflict in testimony or because the trial judge on the same facts would have arrived at a different conclusion . . . Neither should it ordinarily be granted on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence where the evidence is conflicting and the jury might have found for either party ... it would therefore seem clear that there was a palpable abuse of discretion in the court’s granting a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence (meaning presumably the weight of the evidence) and that in the interest of justice a new trial should be had ... as stated by the late Chief Justice Maxey in Jones v. Williams, <a href="/pa/358/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="358 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="8845974" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0559-01">358 Pa. 559</a>, 564, 565, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%2057" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="58 A.2d 57">58 A. 2d 57</a>, 60: ‘While this Court usually supports the action of the trial court in granting or refusing a new trial we do not entirely abdicate our reviewing functions in such cases. This Court, too, has the duty to determine from the record whether or not the jury’s verdict was so contrary to the evidence as to shock one’s sense of justice and to make the award of a new trial imperative so that right may be given another opportunity to prevail.’ It was there held that the court below in invading the province of the jury and nullifying its verdict for the additional defendant, showed a clear abuse of discretion, and the order of the court granting a new trial was reversed. So in Martin v. Arnold, <a href="/pa/366/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="366 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="8845189" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0128-01">366 Pa. 128</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%2099" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="77 A.2d 99">77 A. 2d 99</a>, and in Stewart v.
