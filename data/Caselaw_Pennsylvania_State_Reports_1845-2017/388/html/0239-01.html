The pertinent portion of Article II, §207 of the Act is as follows: “. . . The court shall consider the application. It may hear evidence, if any there be, on behalf of the applicants and against the application, or it may refer the application to a master to make report as to the propriety of granting the application. In such case, upon the filing of the master’s report, the court shall grant the applicants and protestants a hearing, if exceptions are filed by either of them.

    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[234,836,1150,1031]]]'>The court heard testimony without reference to a master. The purpose of the formation of the corporation as set forth in the articles of incorporation is as follows: “Third : The purpose of this corporation shall be to promote the Gospel of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ; to foster, promote and encourage understanding and good will among members of all religious faiths, and to discourage the use of violence, boycotts and sanctions by adherents of one religion against adherents of another by holding religious meetings and conferences; by radio and television broadcasting; by the imprinting of Gospel messages on records and transcriptions; by producing and distributing Gospel motion pictures; by printing and publishing religious literature; by employing and contributing to the support of missionaries; by conducting forums and instruction classes; by operating a library, and by conducting such other activities as promote the said purpose.</p>

      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>The function of the court was to satisfy itself that the purposes set forth in the proposed articles are “lawful and not injurious to the community”. This was recognized by the court below in its opinion when it stated: “We agree with counsel for the applicants that the sole question to be decided by this court is whether or not the purposes set forth in the proposed Articles of Incorporation are lawful and not injurious to the Community.”. However, in its opinion denying the application the court stated its reasons to be that to grant the charter “. . . would in effect place the blanket of approval of this court on such activity.”, and “. . . might well lead to a condition of unrest in the community . . .”. Both of these reasons were predicated upon the second paragraph of the purpose clause which stated that the corporation would place particular emphasis on the evangelization and conversion of adherents of the Roman Catholic faith, providing spiritual, temporal and financial assistance, especially to their converted clergy.</p>
    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[130,1445,1149,594]]]'>It may be immediately observed that whether the court, because of personal predilection on the subject, does not wish it to appear that it approves of the purposes of the corporation is beside the point. As stated in <em>Deutsch-Amerikanischer Yolksfest-Y erein, </em><a href="/pa/200/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="200 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="924314" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0143-01">200 Pa. 143</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.%20849" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 A. 849">49 A. 849</a>, at p. 145: “The privilege of incorporation, and the requirements to obtain it, are wholly statutory.

Indeed to the contrary it states that it agrees “. . . that the privilege of one religious group to proselyte among members of other religious or non-religious groups, to <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>win converts to its religious beliefs, stand inviolate under the law and cannot and should not be impinged by any restriction or limitation statutory or otherwise. . . .”. It also indicated at the hearings and in its opinion that it would approve the charter if the second paragraph of the purposes set forth in the application therefor were deleted, and that the incorporators would lose nothing by its exclusion,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> thus expressing the view that the incorporators could direct the preaching of their beliefs and conversion activities toward any or all sects or faiths, free to direct their activity toward any particular one. The court’s position in effect was that the proposed incorporation could concentrate its efforts toward the conversion of adherents' of the Roman Catholic Church but that it should not say so in its charter. Certainly a true and frank statement of the purposes of incorporation is desirable and contemplated by the Act of Assembly. Charters will be refused where the real or ultimate purpose of incorporation is not disclosed in its articles of incorporation and is found to be an unlawful one.</p>
    <p id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[254,1511,1148,475]]]'>It appeared from the testimony taken and the statement of counsel for the applicants that the incorporators wanted to be “straightforward” and “honest with the public” in declaring that emphasis would be placed upon the conversion of adherents to the Roman Catholic faith, and also set forth this particular objective for the information and protection of those contributing to the corporation’s support, presently and in the future.</p>

The testimony at the hearings was adduced by counsel for the applicants and, quite properly, by many questions asked by the learned court. The latter questioning included an inquiry as to the necessity of the incorporation. While in our opinion a sufficient answer to this inquiry was given, if -the purposes are lawful and not injurious to the public, the absence of necessity for a charter of incorporation is not a valid reason for refusing its grant: <em>Deutsch-Amerilcanischer Volhsfest-Verein, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b275-3" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[139,989,1148,430]]]'>It clearly appeared that the incorporators, who were not all of the same religious denomination, were reputable citizens. One of them was President of Kings College, Briarcliff Manor, New York, another a prominent real estate broker in Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and another a lay reader of the Episcopal Church. The court did not question the sincerity of any of them.</p>

Not only is a citizen of this country entitled to the free expression of his religious beliefs, but he may by peaceful persuasion endeavor to convert others thereto, and we are aware of no bar to individuals organizing to effectuate their guaranteed rights in this regard. In <em>Minersville School District, Board of Education of Minersville School District et al. v. Gobitis et al., </em><a href="/us/310/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="310 U.S. 586" data-case-ids="6140479" data-case-paths="/us/310/0586-01">310 U.S. 586</a>, at p. 593 it is stated . .

    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[256,711,1147,1089]]]'>It appears from the testimony at the hearings, which we have carefully read in its entirety, that many organizations exist for the purpose of converting members of one particular religious faith to another, amongst others St. Paul’s Guild, incorporated in New York, whose primary purpose is the conversion of Protestant ministers to Catholicism. It also appears that, as stated in the first paragraph of the proposed Conversion Center, Inc., its work will be carried on peacefully and will discourage the use of violence, boycotts or sanctions. We cannot agree with the court below that the second paragraph set forth in the purpose clause of the charter is “repugnant” to the manner in which the incorporators propose to conduct their activities, as set forth in the first paragraph. The second paragraph merely states that it will particularly direct its activities toward adherents of the Roman Catholic faith and in no way contradicts the peaceful methods or means to be used in obtaining the proposed corporation’s objectives.</p>

The court’s potential conclusion that the incorporation of the group “might” create “unrest” is not a sufficient reason for refusing the charter. In <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em><a href="/us/310/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="310 U.S. 296" data-case-ids="6138344" data-case-paths="/us/310/0296-01">supra,</a> Mr. Justice Roberts, <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>speaking for an unanimous Court, at p. 310 said: “In the realm of religious faith, and in that of political belief, sharp differences arise. In both fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor. To persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, as we know, at times, resorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or state, and even to false statement. But the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy.”.</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[148,1047,1149,753]]]'>Nothing in the purpose clause of the proposed incorporation or in the evidence adduced at the hearings indicates that the activities of the corporation would consist of or include acts inimical to the peace, good order or morals of society, but quite clearly established the contrary. If the activities engendered reaction resulting in a breach of the peace, the sanctions of the law are available, for the State may safeguard the peace without unconstitutionally infringing upon the liberties protected by the Federal and State Constitutions. But an interdiction based on nothing more than the possibility of some future transgression of the law is a violation of the applicable constitutional guarantees.</p>

Yet this Court is doing that very thing by ordering the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County to grant a charter to an organization whose incorporators are intent on unleashing the winds of intolerance, the gales of prejudice, and the forces of hate and ignorance.</p>

The organization has two members in addition to the five incorporators. These seven men are launching a program to evangelize and convert “adherents of the Roman Catholic faith, providing, spiritual, temporal and financial assistance, especially to their converted clergy.” They intend to carry on this program aggressively and militantly, with particular emphasis on inducing Catholic priests and nuns to break their vows and leave the church to which they have dedicated their souls, their lives, their fortunes, and their destinies. They intend to carry on this program under a charter bearing the seal of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, but that Court has refused to be a party to the intolerant designs of the incorporators and has refused its seal. After an extended hearing in which all the incorporators (with the exception of Percy B. Crawford, who was absent) were heard, Judge Wm. R.

The government cannot do indirectly what it may not do directly. The incorporators and members of the so-called Conversion Center, Inc., may persuade members of the Roman Catholic Church to stay away from their church, or even to disavow it, but they cannot do this in the name of the government; they cannot do this under the aegis of the Courts; they cannot do this under the flag of the United States. For government to authorize an organization or a group of individuals to solicit, persuade, or threaten members of any church to repudiate that church is a violation of the most basic principle of our whole American Commonwealth, namely, that the State and Church shall forever be separate.</p>
