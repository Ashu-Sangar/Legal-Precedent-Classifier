While descending from their relative’s apartment on the third floor of the inn, at about 1:30 a.m. on June 3, 1951, plaintiffs opened a door on the second floor, believing they were on the first floor,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> and stepped out onto a sloping roof from which they fell to the ground, sustaining serious injuries. Plaintiffs recovered verdicts totaling $33,700. Defendants moved for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial. The lower Court entered a judgment n.o.v. for the defendants upon the two-fold ground that plaintiffs had failed to prove negligence and that they were guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. The negligence alleged by plaintiffs was that the defendants had a second floor doorway in such a position that it could be mistaken for a ground floor exit, without having such door locked and without having any warning sign. The lower Court having entered a judgment n.o.v., did not pass on defendants’ motion for a new trial.</p>

      <em>plaintiffs’ testimony was against the weight of the evidence and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. </em>More particularly, the lower Court characterized plaintiffs’ evidence as “inconsistent, evasive, unreliable and at times incredible”.

From such reexamination, we have serious doubts as to the credibility of plaintiffs and some of their witnesses, particularly Raymond Schaffer, the wife-plaintiff’s brother in whose apartment they were visiting on the evening in question . . .</p>

From a consideration of all the testimony in the case, including that of other witnesses on their behalf, we have doubt that the conditions of light in the hallways were so deficient as plaintiffs tried to make out, or that the wife-plaintiff was thereby compelled to hold onto Mrs. Schaffer’s dress so that the former could not observe her surroundings as she followed the latter through the building earlier in the evening. (It is significant, incidentally, that Mrs. Schaffer was not called as a witness, she having a more protracted connection with the plaintiffs and the general situation leading up to the accident than did her husband who was called on plaintiff’s behalf.)</p>

The overwhelming weight of the evidence leaves little or no doubt but that the [storm] door was physically hung on its hinges at the time in question.

The case was then appealed to us for the second time and, now, this Court, instead of adhering to its original decision, accepts the criticisms of the lower Court, and reverses the position it decisively proclaimed a year ago. The facts are as follows:</p>

On the day in question the plaintiffs, deceived into believing this door was indeed a first floor exit, passed through it, and plunged to the ground beneath, sustaining serious injuries. The jury returned verdicts in favor of husband and wife in the respective sums of |5,000 and if28,700. The defendants filed motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v.

The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. We reversed the judgment n.o.v. and sent the case back for disposition of the motion for new trial. In doing this, we said: “The defendants are entitled to have the lower Court pass on their motion for a new trial and, if dissatisfied with the Court’s decision in that respect to re-appeal to this Court.”</p>

Without actually spelling it out, we supposed that everyone, including the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, would understand that the arguments for a new trial would be based on the 30 reasons for a new trial filed by the defendants’ attorneys. Of these 30 reasons, 25 were devoted to alleged trial errors and errors in the charge. The other 5 were the stereotyped ones that the verdicts were against the evidence, against the weight of the evidence, against the charge of the Court, and excessive.</p>

The Court went on to say, however, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to their verdicts. Speaking through the Trial Judge, Judge Satterthwaits, the Court said that it still believed the plaintiffs guilty of contributory negligence; this, in spite of our definitive decision on that very subject, namely: “It is the decision of this Court that the plaintiffs were not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law and that the jury was warranted in reaching the conclusion that the plaintiffs were not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of fact.”</p>

So satisfied were the defendants’ lawyers that there was nothing to the subject which has become the burden of the Majority’s Opinion that they did not mention it — in all the 30 reasons which they advanced for a new trial.</p>

Whether the illumination was or Avas not scanty in the hallway became a question for the jury to decide and, to the extent that it played a part in their deliberations, the jury decided the moot point in favor of the plaintiffs. But the Majority still insists the hall was Avell-lighted. It says: “We have doubt that the conditions of light in the hallways were so deficient as plaintiffs tried to make out.” But why does the Court find, in March, 1957, that the hallway was brilliantly lighted when it found, in March, 1956, that it was poorly lighted? In our Opinion of March, 1956, we said: “The anemic glimmer from the feeble 15-watt bulb in the ceiling above shed no light on the true situation.” Even the defendant, Mrs. Pummer, testified to the infirm lighting in the hallway. Why, in spite of the testimony of this extremely adverse party, does the anemia of 15 Avatts in 1956 develop into glaring luminosity in 1957?</p>

So serious an indictment cannot be left dangling in the miasmatic air of innuendo and suspicion. There is not a syllable of evidence in the whole 450 pages of evidence which clothes the sinister skeleton of “extraneous factors” with the flesh of reality. If the Trial Judge saw or felt those phantoms why did he not name them? And since the learned Judge kept these phantoms hidden in the weeds of suggestive phraseology why did the Majority not flush them out before giving them substance and standing in this Court? What were the extraneous factors? Was the jury threatened? Was the jury bribed? Was the jury improperly influenced?

Mrs. Schaffer was a tenant of the defendants, who owned the hotel. The Court intimates that had Mrs. Schaffer been summoned, her testimony would have been injurious to the plaintiffs’ case. I have no way of knowing why Mrs. Schaffer was not called as a witness, but if her testimony would have been so helpful to the defendants’ case, why was she not subpoenaed by the defendants?

The plaintiffs denied that any outside storm door was in place on the night of the accident. The Court, accepting the defendants’ side of the controversy in this phase of the case, says: “The overwhelming weight of the evidence leaves little or no doubt but that the [storm] door was physically hung on its hinges at the time in question.”</p>

If the plaintiffs actually believed they were on the first floor and if the portal was so constructed that they could reasonably believe they were on the first floor (and <em>that </em>was the plaintiffs’ contention), opening a storm door would not have been any more proof that the portal was a second floor exit than that it was a first floor exit. The whole point in the case is that the defendants allowed on the second floor of their hotel an outside door so placed, so hinged and so draped as to produce the picture of an outside first floor door and if, in addition to the normal door, there was also a storm door, how would the latter’s existence dissuade the plaintiffs from believing they were on the first floor?

Is it not the function of the jury to pass on inconsistencies? The plaintiffs produced three witnesses who said that there was only one door hung in the doorway. The defendants produced five witnesses who said that there were two doors. Does the fact that the defendants had two more witnesses than the plaintiffs on this disputed point conclusively prove that there were two doors? When some of these witnesses were being examined on this very controverted question, plaintiffs’ counsel asked the Court to sequester the witnesses.
