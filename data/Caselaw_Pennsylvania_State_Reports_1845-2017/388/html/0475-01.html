The will expressly revoked all prior wills. Testatrix died the next day. Testatrix had made a prior will dated July 29, 1931, in which she gave, inter alia, $500. to the White Memorial Congregational Church of Milroy and after certain other specific gifts, gave the balance of her pen sonal estate to said Church. This Court held that under the Act of 1917 and the prior Wills Acts of 1911 and 1855, the church could not take under either will. The Court said (pages 330-331) : “Charitable or religious institutions claiming bequests or devises must bring themselves [strictly and literally] within it [the Act]. . . . The act establishes an unbending rule and fixes an arbitrary period within which such disposi<a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>tions of property, whether by deed or by will, shall be absolutely barred. Such bequests, under the circumstances [death within the 30 day period], fail because of the incapacity in the beneficiaries to take. . . . The act provides that the voided legacies shall in the first place go to the residuary legatee or devisee. In the present case the bequest of the residuary estate is void for the same reason as the other charitable bequests, and hence the fund cannot pass to the residuary legatee but must necessarily go cto the next of kin and heir-at-law.’ ”</p>

The basic purpose of the 30 day requirement was and is to prevent a testator during his last illness from being importuned or otherwise influenced, by hope of reward or fear of punishment in the hereafter, to leave his estate in whole or in part to charity or to church. Since it would often be difficult to prove whether a man was in his last illness, or whether he had been importuned, or was unduly influenced by charity or church, or was influenced while in extremis by a sudden hope of Heaven or fear of Hades, the Legislature wisely established a clear, realistic and inflexible time period — 30 days. However, society came to realize that gifts to charity or church which were made within the last 30 days of a man’s life were not always unduly influenced by charity or church and that the law was unfair to testators, charity and church alike for the above mentioned reason, as well as because of the fact that while in good health a testator might die in a motor, railroad or plane accident within 30 days after making his will. The Legislature therefore decided that the prior statutory law in re charitable gifts should be modified and liberalized, and that gifts to charities and churches which were made within 30 days of death should, at least to a limited extent, be <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>protected and validated where the testator had made a substantially identical charitable gift in a prior extant will.</p>

Any bequest or devise for religious or charitable purposes included in a will or codicil executed within thirty days of the death of the testator shall be invalid unless all who would benefit by its invalidity agree that it shall be valid. The thirty-day period shall be so computed as to include the day on which the will or codicil is written and to exclude the day of death. Unless the testator directs otherwise, if such a will or codicil shall revoke or supersede a prior will or codicil executed at least thirty days before the testator’s death, and not theretofore revoked or superseded and the original of which can be produced in legible condition, and if each instrument shall contain an identical gift for substantially the same religious or charitable purpose, the gift in the later will or codicil shall be valid; or <em>if each instrument shall give for substantially the same religious or charitable purpose </em>a cash legacy or <em>a share of the residuary estate </em>or a share of the same asset, payable immediately or subject to identical prior estates and conditions, <em>the later gift shall be valid to the extent to which it shall not exceed the prior gift.”</em>

Expressed in another way, appellants contend that the Act of 1947 was intended to preserve and validate charitable gifts made within the prohibited 30 days’ period only where the gifts in the last will and in a prior will differed in quantity — not quality — of estate, and then only “to the extent to which it shall not exceed the prior gift”. The Act of 1947 was, they contend, “intended to take care of and protect changes in amount, proportion or quantity”, but was not intended to apply to and cannot cover “a change in kind or type of gift from one of income in perpetual trust to one of principal immediate and absolute”.
