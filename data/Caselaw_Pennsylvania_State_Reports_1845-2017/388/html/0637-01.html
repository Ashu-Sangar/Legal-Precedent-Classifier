Wholly within the defendants’ building, at street level, exists a covered alleyway leading from West Main Street to the rear of both properties. In 1870 the predecessor-in-title of the defendants conveyed the property subject to an easement over the passageway granted to plaintiffs’ predecessor-in-title. The reservation was repeated in subsequent conveyances of the servient tenement. On April 1, 1926, George L. Rahn and his wife acquired title to the dominant land, and on December 7 of that year the Rahns also purchased the servient tenement. Subsequently, both properties were sold, without mention of the right-of-way, at separate sheriff sales to satisfy unpaid mortgages.</p>

Since 1935 plaintiffs and their immediate predecessors have made use of the passageway although they have entrance to the rear of their property through a public alley, and to the front, directly from West Main Street. The passageway was said to be convenient for the making of business deliveries to the plaintiffs. The fence erected by the defendants in 1948 prevented further use of the passage and prompted the present proceedings. The court below found that the servitude upon defendants’ property was plainly visible, continuous, and necessary to the convenient enjoyment of plaintiffs’ property. Consequently, the court concluded that the easement was not extinguished even though the dominant and servient tenements were at one time in <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>the ownership and possession of the same person when in 1926 the Balms acquired both titles.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Allan, </em><a href="/pa/215/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="215 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="948410" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0383-01">215 Pa. 383</a>, 387, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.%20587" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="64 A. 587">64 Atl. 587</a> (1906). However, “merger is a technical rule at best and so, even though two rights become united in one person, a court of equity will keep them separated if that is required by an outstanding claim of a third party, or is necessary in view of the proprietor’s own situation.” <em>1 Glenn, </em>Mortgages, 288 (1943). In short, “If there is no reason for keeping . . . [the outstanding interest now acquired], then equity will in the absence of any declaration of [the owner’s] intention, destroy it, but if there is any reason for keeping it alive, such as the existence of another encumbrance, equity will not destroy it.” Sir 6-eorge Jessel in <em>Adams v. Angell, </em>5 Ch. D. 634, 645 (1877). See also <em>Hurst v.

Accordingly, Pennsylvania has long held to the doctrine that an easement may remain unaffected by unity of estates, or viewed differently, revive upon separation, if a “valid and le<a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>gitimate purpose” will be subserved thereby. <em>McClure v.

We recognize, for example, that a tenant in possession of a dominant estate has a sufficient interest in the easement to prevent extinguishment when the fee to the servient estate is united with that of the dominant lands. We adhere, therefore, to the rule that unity of possession as well as title is necessary to destroy an easement. <em>Witman v.

The record indicates that the dominant property was separately mortgaged and sold on foreclosure; therefore, plaintiffs claim title through the mortgagee.
