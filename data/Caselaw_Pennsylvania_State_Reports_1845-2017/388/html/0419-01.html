Plaintiff, on March 17, 1951, entered one of the defendant’s warehouses in order to purchase some siding. Plaintiff tried to pass around the supervisor of defendant’s warehouse, and, because of the inadequacy of light, stepped into a hole in the floor of the warehouse and fell, thereby <em>injuring his left hand and wrist. </em>Although he claims that he suffered constant pain, he lost no time from work and made no claim for any injuries resulting from this accident until January 23, 1953, <em>over months later.</em>

I would say definitely no. My reason for that is three-fold, if I may explain that. Most unfortunately, this man has, as I have told you, two previous injuries to this wrist. From examination of the X-rays, he could not have, previous to this, a perfectly normally functioning wrist. That goes without doubt because of the presence of arthritic change in the radial head. That would have prevented him, no matter what he says or what anyone says, just by looking at the X-rays, it would have prevented him from bringing that hand perfectly inside normally and give him full function. It could not have helped to. It would also prevent his putting it all the way out, and to a certain extent it would have prevented him getting it up. It may not have hurt him, I won’t argue that. But here is an injury that preceded, and here is another injury that preceded, and on top of that he gets a third injury, tie couldn’t help but have a weak arm, I don’t see how he could help it. But to blame that on an injury that didn’t even injure the bone, and injured the soft tissues, giving him, if you want to term it, a neuralgia or a neuritis, I am afraid I can’t see it.</p>

Florig, the plaintiff in this case, fell and sustained injuries to his left hand and wrist and back. His physician, Dr. Herbert Kaplan, informed him, after treating the hand for some time, that the repairing process was a slow one and he advised Florig to use <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>the affected hand, lest it waste and atrophy. In obedience to this direction, Morig resumed his work as a painter.</p>

He sued Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., claiming that his second accident was the result of his debilitated hand which had been injured through the negligence of the defendant at the time of the first accident. The jury returned a verdict of $11,000 in his favor. The defendant moved for a new trial, contending that there was no causal connection between the first and second accidents.

Here he was simply being candid. He would have had to be dishonest or he would have had to be an infallible retrospective Cassandra to say positively: “I know of my personal knowledge that the collapse of Florig’s wrist brought about the injury to his foot.”</p>

How could the doctor testify to what was beyond the ken of his knowledge? He did state categorically that the wrist collapsed because of the pain and weakness resulting from the first accident. It was up to the jury to decide whether a workingman 55 years of age on a slanting roof could arrest a precipitate descent when all power drained from one of his wrists, and Ms entire left arm thus became an impediment instead of a staff of resistance to the forces of gravitation.</p>

Nor would the situation change if the patient had left the hospital and broken his leg subsequently, so long as that subsequent break was due to the weakness of the foot. Thus, the only inquiry before us is whether there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could base its conclusion that Florig fell from the rooftop because of his inability to hold on to his precarious perch as a result of the weakness of his left wrist, for which the defendant was admittedly responsible. I agree with the lower Court that there was such evidence. It is to be noted that not even the defendant’s doctor ventured to say that the plaintiff’s second accident was not caused by the defection of the plaintiff’s exploded and helpless wrist.</p>

There being a total absence of any evidence which pointed to any other cause of the second fall, we are of the opinion that the plaintiff’s evidence furnished a rational basis for a verdict including damages resulting from the second accident.”</p>
