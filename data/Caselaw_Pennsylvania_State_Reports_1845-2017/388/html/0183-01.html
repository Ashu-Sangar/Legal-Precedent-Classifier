On May 10, 1952, at about 2 o’clock in the morning, as he was returning from an American Legion activity, the plaintiff, while driving along Lancaster Avenue in the City of Reading, observed, behind some cars parked on his right side of the road, what he described to be “a little light on the ground at the cars.” Since the light was not in his path of travel he continued on his way until, when about 35 feet away from the point which later turned out to be the place of collision, the slanting broadside of a truck loomed before him. He tried to avoid the obstacle by swinging further to his right but the interval of time and space within which to accomplish the hurried maneuver was too short, and the inevitable crash followed.</p>

The rule does not mean that the motorist must carry in his mind every possible series, of combinations which could conspire against him, and <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>that he must transport ready-made solutions to overcome all fortuitous hazards which suddenly face him. <em>Assured </em>does not mean <em>guaranteed. </em>When a driver approaches the crest of a hill, there comes a moment when, because of the convexity of the highway, he has practically no guaranteed clear distance ahead, but he can reasonably be assured that no one will be insane enough to approach the crest of the road from the other side of the summit, using the contrary lane of travel. If such a predicament should develop and a collision result, the motorist on his own side of the thoroughfare cannot be declared guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law on the theory that he did not have an assured clear distance ahead. Assured clear distance ahead does not embrace a state of affairs where a truck lurks behind parked cars and then suddenly moves into the highway. Assured clear distance does not include a situation where a vehicle is ambushed in the shadows of other parked cars and then, without warning, charges into the street.</p>

By this time, however, fate’s course had been shaped beyond man’s alteration.</p>

In the ensuing lawsuit it was argued by the defendant that the driver of the decedent’s car was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. We said: “This Court has repeatedly held that a driver at night is not bound to anticipate all possibilities. It is the <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>duty of the driver of a vehicle to have his car under control at all times. Having one’s car under control means that in any situation reasonably likely to arise he will be able to stop his car before doing injury to any person or property . . . One is not bound to anticipate negligence of another. More particularly, Schofield was not bound to anticipate that Druschel would violate the Motor Vehicle Code by driving on his wrong side of the road and without lights.

The lower Court reversed a verdict returned in favor of the plaintiff, asserting that since the evidence showed that the accident happened 50 feet from a curve, the plaintiff had ample time within which to stop his car had he been operating it carefully. The Trial Court said further that: “It was his [the plaintiff’s] duty to so drive his car that when he turned the curve he could stop it within that distance necessary to avoid a collision with what might suddenly loom up in front of him in the road after he had come around the curve.” This Court rejected the lower Court’s reasoning and judgment, saying: “Appellant was not under a duty to anticipate that the driver of a vehicle coming in the op* posite direction around the curve would occupy the center of the highway in violation of the law of the road.”</p>

There also, the defendant charged the plaintiff with - contributory negligence. This Court said: “The question of contributory negligence was also for the jury . . . The truck, going at twenty miles an hour, was not in her view over three seconds before the accident, and for only a fraction of that time did the truck appear to be turning against her. Whether in that brief time Mrs. Wilson could have changed her course to the right and escaped the collision is problematical, and was for the jury. ‘Negligence cannot be imputed because of the failure to perform a duty so suddenly and unexpectedly arising that there is no opportunity to apprehend the situation and to act according to the exigency.” We affirm the lower Court’s refusal to enter judgment n.o.v.</p>

When three sheets of paper had been filled with interrogations and answers, a pen Avas thrust into the plaintiff’s uninjured hand and he scrawled his signature. At the trial, defendant’s counsel cross-examined the plaintiff at length on the ansAvers he had made in the hospital. At no time-did defendant’s counsel indicate to the Court and jury the identity of the person who was responsible for the statement. Upon redirect examination, plaintiff’s counsel asked the plaintiff if he knew who it was who <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>had put the questions to him at the hospital. The plaintiff replied that, the visitor was a total stranger to him, and then the following colloquy occurred: “Q. Did you know later who he was? A. Yes, he left his card on the dresser, and a visitor a day or two later told me a certain man was in to see me because he must have left a card, and I didn’t know anything about it. Q.

It is also obvious that the question put by plaintiff’s counsel was one which the situation practically demanded. Defendant’s counsel had questioned the plaintiff for 14 printed pages on what information he had given the person who wrote up the statement in the hospital, but at no time was the curtain raised on the individuality of the statement-taker, whom, if anybody he was representing, and what purpose lay behind his inquisition of the plaintiff.

Especially is this true when the injured person declares, as Fleischman did in the case at bar, that he never saw the statement, and, in addition, denies the accuracy of many of the answers attributed to him. Here, the plaintiff denied, contrary to what he is charged with having declared in the statement, that he had two beers before the accident, he denied that he told his wife to wait up for him and that then they would go out for a “few beers,” he denied that he had said he was travelling 30 to 35 miles per hour at the time of the collision, he denied that the first time he saw the truck it was 15 feet away, and he denied that he had talked about his doctors. With so many categorical refutations to the alleged assertions in the statement (and there were more than here enumerated), the inquiry naturally arises in the mind of any impartial observer as to who was telling the truth. But in deciding who was telling the truth it was first necessary to know who were the antagonists in the contest of veracity. At the end of the cross-examination on the hospital statement, two adversaries faced each other in the arena of disputed probity: on the one side Mr. Fleischman and on the other side Mr. Shadow. So far as the jury was concerned, Mr. Shadow could even have been someone speaking for the law, someone representing the Court, someone authorized to conduct an impartial interrogation.

Manifestly the effect of the answers, unexplained, to the questions in the statement to Heyduck were most damaging to the plaintiff’s case and many of them admitted to have been made by the plaintiff, or at least not denied by her, were indirect contradiction of her sworn testimony on material and determinative elements of her case.

At 41 years óf age .he should be at the peak of his muscular strength and artistic creative power. Normally he would remain on that plateau for a long time. His injury has toppled him from that elevation. His earning power has been greatly impaired. According to the mortality tables, which were introduced in evidence, he has a life expectancy of 28 years. While it is difficult to compute just what 'he would earn in those 28 years had he not lost the use of his left arm, it is reasonably certain that with the full employment of that now useless member he could have earned more than. $20,000 in excess of what he may now earn. In addition to the irreparable damage done to the plaintiff’s capacity to earn a. living, he has suffered, in the telling words of the learned Court below, “a serious deformity and disfigurement which, for the rest of his life, will be his unfortunate lot.”</p>
