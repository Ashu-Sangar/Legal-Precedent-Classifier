Cf: <em>Storm, v. School District of Borough of Moscow,, </em>supra, p. 239. The similarity of duties of both officials and the testimonial in the record to appellant’s fidelity to his duties over a long period of time give rise to speculation whether a change in district classification warranted the exchange of a tried and proven educator for a new and unproven one. The wisdom, however, of such action is for the school board, not this court. In addition, an Associate Superintendent can be removed at the board’s will every 4 years, whereas a Supervising Principal cannot be removed except for cause. The result is that the present highest ranking school official in the district can be removed quadrennially if the board sees fit.</p>
