Engler was the crane operator and plaintiff was his helper. On the day of the accident, Lehigh’s foreman spotted the railroad cars immediately underneath Metropolitan’s power lines and directed Engler where the work was to be done. Four of Lehigh’s employees assisted in the unloading operation. The work proceeded under the direction of Lehigh’s foreman who was there when the work began and at intervals during the day until the work was completed, when Lehigh’s foreman and employees left the railroad siding. Engler and plaintiff then began knocking out the stabilizing blocks underneath the crane preparatory to moving the crane from Lehigh’s premises. While plaintiff was on the ground alongside the crane in the act of placing a sledge hammer in the tool box of the crane the 40-foot boom of the crane operated by Engler came in close proximity to Metropolitan’s power lines above the unloading area causing the current carried in one or the power lines to arc from the line to the boom of the crane. The current passed through the crane and into plaintiff’s body causing serious injury. On the previous day a similar unloading operation took place on Lehigh’s premises but the work was done in a safe place some distance away from Metropolitan’s power lines. On the day of the accident there was no need to conduct the work immediately underneath Metropolitan’s power lines. There was ample room elsewhere on the railroad siding to unload cars a safe distance from the power lines.</p>

His injuries were admittedly of a most serious nature. We have discussed them in detail in our prior analysis of the medical testimony. Upwards of 20,000 volts of electricity passed through plaintiff’s body causing deep burns in his feet and one of his hands and damaging his brain and nervous system. The brain injury has left him with a tremor of <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>the head and hands, excessive salivation and a ‘deadpan’ expression on his face. The brain injury has also seriously affected his emotional behavior. He has been left with permanent scars, due to numerous skin-grafting operations. He has suffered most severe pain and will continue to suffer pain as long as he lives. It is the uncontradicted medical testimony that all of these injuries including his disfigurements, deformities, pain and suffering and mental anguish, are permanent. These matters must all be taken into consideration in measuring the size of the verdict awarded him.</p>

Plaintiff was 24 years of age, and according to the Mortality Tables had a life expectancy of 43 years at the time of the accident. He was earning a little over $4,000 a year. If we treat money as producing 5% net, the present value of $4,-000 for 43 years, according to the Giauque and Mc-Clures ‘Present Worth Tables’ is $70,183.60.
