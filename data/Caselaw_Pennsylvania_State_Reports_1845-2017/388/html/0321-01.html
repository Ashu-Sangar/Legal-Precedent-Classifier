Elliott created an inter vivos trust under the terms of which he was the sole beneficiary and the Colonial Trust Company (now, by merger, the Fidelity Trust Company) and George F. Elliott were trustees. On September 19, 1950, George F. Elliott, a brother of William E. Elliott, presented a petition to the Court of Common Pleas of Yfestmoreland County to have William E. Elliott adjudged weak-minded and to have a guardian appointed for his estate. After a hearing, the Court, on September 30, 1950, adjudged Yvbliiam E. Elliott unable to take care of his property and appointed the First National Bank of Greensburg as guardian of his estate.</p>

In this proceeding the corporate trustee (appellant) alone, by way of preliminary objections, attacked the order of September 30, 1950 appointing the bank as guardian upon <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to make the appointment. In order to secure a preliminary-determination of this question the corporate trustee alone filed a petition for a rule to show cause why the order of September 30, 1950 should not be vacated to which petition the guardian made answer. After a hearing, the court below discharged the rule and from that decree this appeal was taken.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
