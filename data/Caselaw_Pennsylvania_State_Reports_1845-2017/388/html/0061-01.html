When the Board in that case considered the petition of the Hotel Casey for a refund, there thus existed no doubt in view of our decision as to the illegality of the payment and the fact that the Commonwealth was not rightfully entitled thereto. At p. 583 Mr. Justice Parker stated: . . Here the writ is not employed in order to interfere with the exercise of a legal discretion by the board, but only to compel it to act according to law and within legal limitations, particularly those defining its jurisdiction. . . . Here relief is sought upon the theory that the board has misconceived the extent of its powers and its duties.”. It was held that under the circumstances, §503 (a) (4) of The Fiscal Code made refund of the taxes paid mandatory.</p>

The statement by the Court in <em>Casey </em>that the Board does not enjoy unlimited discretion when considered in connection with the decision rendered simply means that the Board’s exercise of discretion does not extend to refunds held to be mandatory under §503 (a) (4), or, if given broader significance, is quite consistent with the qualification of the rule stated in <em>Kaufman </em>that the discretion must be exercised in good faith and not fraudulently, arbitrarily or in an unwarranted enlargement of its power and duties. Other language in the opinion <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>referred to by appellant was not necessary to the decision of the case and has no authoritative status in view of the later <em>Kaufman </em>case where the <em>Casey </em>case was referred to and distinguished.

The Realty Transfer Tax Act of 1951 was held constitutional in <em>Sablosky v. Messner, </em><a href="/pa/372/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="372 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1238069" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0047-01">372 Pa. 47</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.2d%20411" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="92 A.2d 411">92 A. 2d 411</a>, but the scope of the Act, that is whether it applied to deeds executed and delivered without as well as within the State, was not an issue in the case and therefore not decided. The express language of the Act imposed liability for the tax with respect to <em>all deeds whereby any land within the Commonwealth is granted, bargained, sold or otherwise conveyed, </em>with no limitation as to the place where the deed was executed and delivered. It contained no exception as to deeds executed and delivered outside the Commonwealth. No court of competent jurisdiction had ruled contrary to the interpretation of the Act made by the Board.

Appellant claims that the Board should have declared the Act of 1955 unconstitutional because of its retroactive provision. When the Board disallowed the refund, no court of competent jurisdiction had declared the Act of 1955 unconstitutional in this or any other respect. Moreover, retroactive tax legislation is not per se unconstitutional. As stated in <em>Shirks Motor Express Corporation v.

We deem it unnecessary to enter upon a detailed discussion of these cases. It suffices to say that in all of them the question involved was, as in the <em>Hotel Casey </em>case, whether a public official or an administrative or judicial tribunal misinterpreted <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>the law defining his or its powers and duties. No one of the cases cited holds that mandamus will lie to review the interpretation of a law other than the law of its creation, by a governmental agency such as the Board of Finance and Revenue whose action is made final and there has been no interpretation of the law involved by a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction. The <em>Kaufman </em>case is authority to the contrary.</p>
    <p id="b103-3" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[154,844,1152,1443]],["BL_104.1",104,[249,336,1143,145]]]'>Appellant states that its claim for refund is not made under §503(a) (4) of The Fiscal Code but under the general provisions first set forth in §503(a). Obviously the claim does not fall within §503(a) (4) because appellant does not aver in its petition for refund or in its complaint in mandamus that subsequent to its payment of the tax, the tax legislation in question was interpreted contrary to the Board’s interpretation by a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, or that there was any case pending involving such interpretation. But we fail to see how appellant’s position is bettered if its claim for refund falls within the general provisions of §503(a). These provisions authorize a refund of taxes or monies to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully or equitably entitled, and this authorization extends to all of the differing situations set forth in the four subsections upon the conditions therein specifically set forth. Under subsection 4 as construed in the <em>Hotel Casey </em>case, if the petition for refund is timely made and the final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction rendered subsequent to the tax payment determines the question involved favorably to the petitioner, the refund is mandatory. It does not follow that all petitions for refund under §503(a) must be granted. Such absurd result would render meaningless the authorization to the Board “to hear <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>
      <em>and determine” </em>petitions for refund, and as well the provision of §503 (e) that the <em>action of the Board </em>“shall be final”.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[247,512,1147,1323]]]'>In permitting the prosecution of claims against the Commonwealth the Legislature as a matter of grace may make refunds of taxes paid mandatory as it was held it did in §503(a) (4) under the circumstances presented in the <em>Hotel Gasey </em>case, or, as a condition to the privilege conferred, the Legislature may leave the disposition of claims for the refund of taxes paid to the discretion and judgment of a governmental agency and prescribe that the latter’s action shall be final. Appellant’s claim falls within the latter category. Under our decisions the action of the Board of Finance and Revenue may not be reviewed unless the Board has acted fraudulently, arbitrarily or in excess of the powers and duties vested in it. It is not claimed that the Board acted fraudulently, and in following the language of the tax legislation in question which in the absence of a judicial interpretation thereof, represented the existing law, it may not be said that the Board acted arbitrarily or beyond the powers and duties conferred upon it. Therefore the preliminary objection filed to the complaint that the action of the Board in the instant case was final and not subject to review by mandamus was well taken, and this required dismissal of the appellant’s action.</p>
