        "text": "Mr. Justice Sterrett\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nEach of the parties to this contention was a .creditor of William Davies, Jr. & Co., whose leasehold, sold by the sheriff, produced the fund in court for distribution. The appellant, Thomas Birney, had a judgment against the firm for over $3,000, to indemnify him as surety &c., and also a mechanics\u2019 lien for $185.56, against the rink erected on the leasehold. The appellee, W. S. Barker, had a mechanics\u2019 lien against same building for over $4,000. By virtue of an execution issued on Birney\u2019s judgment, the leasehold premises were levied on and finally sold to Barker for $1,500. When the property was first offered for sale Barker, by his counsel gave written notice that the purchaser would be required to pay in cash to the sheriff or to himself; and then bid the property up to $4,400. Birney bid $50 more, and adjourned the sale. When it was offered the second time, the notice was repeated. Barker bid $3,100; Birney bid $500 more, and again adjourned the sale. The third time it was offered, the notice was not repeated ; Barker bid $1,000, Birney bid $50 more, and then stayed his writ. At the fourth and last sale, on the alias writ, Bark\u00e9r\u2019s counsel in his presence gave notice \u201cthat the rink would be sold subject to his, Barker\u2019s, mechanic\u2019s lien \u201d; and thereupon it was sold to him for $1,500, which sum, less costs, is the fund for distribution. This is substantially what occurred, as found by the Auditor, when the property was offered for sale by the sheriff.\nIn view of the notice given by Barker at the last sale, and his purchase of the property in pursuance thereof, appellant\u2019s contention is that he should not be permitted to participate in the distribution.\nAs found by the learned Auditor, it does not appear from the evidence what was the object of Barker\u2019s announcement that the property would be sold subject to his lien, or under what view of the law or facts it was made, or what effect, if any, it had on the sale. It cannot be doubted however that the obvious effect of the notice was to mislead or deter bidders, and thus lessen the price of the property, and we think the result shows that such was the case. When it was first offered for sale, Barker\u2019s bid, as we have seen, was $4,400. He says in his testimony; \u201c At the first sale I bid either $4,400, or $4,450. It was a Iona fide bid. I would have paid the money in. The second time my bid was $3,500. I think Mr, YanYoorhis bid over me. I w.as prepared to take and pay the money. The third time I think my bid was $2,000. It was bid over me by Mr. YanYoorhis. He then stayed the writ. I was prepared to pay the money in on that bid.\u201d He denies, however, that the notice given at the last sale differed from the written notice given at the first and repeated at the second sale; but, the Auditor found otherwise, and it must now be accepted as true that his counsel, in his presence, did make the announcement found by the Auditor, and that appellee then and there became the purchaser of the property for $1,500, nearly $3,000 less than he bid and was prepared to pay for same, at the first sale. The inference is neither strained nor unfair that this result was brought about, in great part at least, by the verbal announcement made at the last sale. If appellant, in making that announcement had any laudable object in view, it would have been in order for him to show it. In the absence of any explanation, it is not unreasonable to infer that his purpose was to secure the property at an undervalue, and then, to the detriment of the defendant in the execution, as well as his creditors, claim the greater part of the proceeds of sale as applicable to his own lien. To sanction such a transaction would be to encourage the practice of deception, trickery and fraud, of which there is already too much in judicial sales. As was said in Power v. Thorp, 92 Pa,. St., 346, it will not do to allow a purchaser to control an official sale, make what representations he pleases in order to cheapen the property, and then, after he has obtained it on his own terms and at his own price, permit him to shelter himself from the consequences of his own fraud, under the technical rules applicable to judicial sales. In the face of his own announcement that the property would be sold subject to his lien, appellee became the purchaser thereof at a greatly reduced price \u2014 about one third of the sum he bid, and says he was prepared to pay at the first sale. Under these circumstances, and with no attempt to explain his conduct, there is no hardship in holding him to the terms of sale, officiously dictated by himself, with the view, doubtless, of gaining an undue personal advantage at the expense of others.\nDecree reversed at the costs of appellee, and record remitted with instructions to distribute the fund in accordance with this opinion.",

    "head_matter": "Birney\u2019s Appeal.\nA. gave notice, at a sheriff\u2019s sale, of a leasehold interest in certain real estate, that the sale would be subject to his mechanic\u2019s lien, and thus became the purchaser at a low price. On distribution of the fund arising from said sale, held that in the absence of any explanation as to his conduct in giving said notice, that he should be held to the terms of the sale announced by himself, and should not be allowed to participate in the distribution, on his mechanic\u2019s lien.\nOctober 29th, 1886.\nBefore Gordon, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ. Merctjr, C. J., and Paxson, J., .absent.\nAppeal from the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Allegheny county: Of October Term 1886, JSfo. 97.\nAppeal of Thomas Birney from the decree of said court overruling his exceptions to and confirming the Auditor\u2019s report making' distribution of the fund arising from the sale of the leasehold estate in certain real estate of William Davies Jr. & Co. This decree was assigned for error.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThomas Patterson (Isaac S. Van Voorhis with him), for appellant.\n\u2014 This court, in Power v. Thorp, 92 Penn. St., 351, has said, \u201c It would not do to allow a purchaser to control an official sale, make what representations he pleased, in order to cheapen the property, and then after he has obtained the property on his own terms and at his own price, permit him to shelter himself from his own fraud under the technical rules applicable to such sale. Legal rules and precepts were not intended to furnish sheltering places for fraud, and he who buys property at an official sale, through a trick or misrepresentation, must not expect to hold it through the help of the courts: Buchannan v. Moore, 13 S. & R., 304; Miller v. Miller, 10 P. F. S., 16; McCaskev v. Graff, 11 Harris, 321; Waters v. Gernat, 1 Id., 515.\u201d\nAs was said in the case cited, Barker loses nothing; he purchased all he bargained for, to wit, the property subject to the mechanics\u2019 lien aforesaid.\nFrom Ziegler\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey, 182, to the present, the doctrine has been established that by a clear understanding between the sheriff\u2019s officer and the purchaser, that certain liens are to be continued, it is competent for them to change the legal effects of the sale and continue liens that would otherwise be discharged. The cases holding this are affirmed in Ashmead v. McCarther, 17 P. F. S., 327.\nA. H. Qlarhe (Q. Q. Taylor with him), for appellee.\n\u2014 A party is not estopped by an expression of an opinion upon a matter of law which is equally open to both parties: Dungan v. The American Life Insurance and Trust Company, 52 Pa. St., 253; Plummer and Jones\u2019 Appeal, 14 W. N. C., 313; Zeigler\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey, 173.\nNotice of a claim given at a sheriff\u2019s sale does not estop the party'\u201cfrom claiming according to his legal rights: Stiles v. Bradford, 4 Rawle, 394; Rudolph\u2019s Appeal, 1 Pitts., 397.\nAn estoppel can only be pleaded by one who was adversely affected bv the Act which constitutes it: Cuttle v. Brockway, 32 Pa. St., 45.\nNo one can set up an estoppel who was not affected by the Act which constitutes the estoppel: Diller v. Brubaker, 56 Pa. St., 498.\nNovember 8th, 1886."
