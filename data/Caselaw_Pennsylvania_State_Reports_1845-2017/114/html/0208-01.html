The plaintiff swears the agreement was that the judgment note was to be held until he became embarrassed, and then to be entered and the property sold so as to secure it for his wife and family. That such an agreement is in itself a fraud and cannot be enforced is fully settled by the authorities.

In such cases the character of the device is referred to the time when it is used for the purpose of fraud; and if then false and feigned, it is fully within the interdict of the statute and the provisions of the common law. For that which is beautiful and true in its origin, may become foul by subsequent events, either performed by principals, agents or instruments.”</p>

Justice Thompson in delivering the opinion of the Court says: “If the transaction was covinous, and the intent was to cover the property from creditors, in case of embarrassment of either party to it, neither one nor the other would set up the fraud, as between themselves, to defeat the other of any claim under it.”</p>

That a trust cannot be enforced where it is designed to effect a fraud on creditors, is settled by authority. The cases, without exception, decide that such a trust is void in itself, and therefore incapable of being made the foundation of a right in others.”</p>

S., 273, which was a judgment confessed, and opened to let the defendant into a defence, the court said: “ If parties concoct a scheme to defraud others, and resort to a judgment to effect their object, both having in view the same thing, there is uo fraud between them assuredly of which either can complain or call on a court for relief. Courts will not move to change the condition of the parties any more readily in such case than they would- to enforce an executory contract, which as a general rule, they will not-do.” To the same effect is Gill <em>v. </em>Harvey, 14 Norris, 388: “ If a transaction is coviuous, and the intent was to cover the property from creditors, in case of embarrassment of either party to it, neither one nor the other can set up the fraud as between themselves to defeat the other of any claim under it. A party to such transaction cannot give in evidence his own fraud in defence against his own act, whether it be an absolute deed, or a mortgage, or a confession of judgment, and no matter how it may be mingled with other arrangements or agreements between the parties.” Controlled by these authorities we directed the jury to find a verdict for defendant, being satisfied that plaintiff by his own testimony proved such an agreement as was incapable of being enforced. It may be said of plaintiff as was said by one of old “ My own mouth shall condemn me.”</p>

We thus have on the face of the transaction, a judgment, presumptively <em>Iona fide </em>and for a full consideration, a judicial sale of real estate to defendant, and subsequently a private sale and conveyance of the same by him to Mrs. Candor. Instead of even tending to show that either of the plaintiffs has any interest in the property so sold, or in the proceeds thereof, the record evidence referred to proved the contrary, and thus whatever interest either of them may have had in the land was regularly divested b]r judicial sale. The substance however of plaintiff’s contention is that the judgment did not represent any indebtedness by Shank to Simpson, but was given for the sole benefit of Mrs. Shank to be held in trust for her by Simpson, and when the property on which the judgment was a lien, was sold, it was purchased and afterwards disposed of at her instance and for her benefit; that the object of thus giving the judgment was to make suitable provision for Mrs. Shank at a time when her husband was not indebted nor about to embark in any hazardous business, and therefore not in fraud of creditors. If plaintiffs had introduced or offered testimony that would have warranted the jury in finding the truth of their contention, they might have some reason to complain of the adverse rulings of the court; but they did neither, and as the learned president of the Common Pleas has shown in his charge, it would have been error to have submitted the case to the jury on any evidence that was admitted or offered. In any view that can be taken of the evidence it would not have warranted the submission of plaintiffs’ case to the jury. Upon the testimony introduced in connection with that embraced in the offers of evidence rejected by the court, the case of the plaintiffs is fatally defective both in the kind and degree of proof <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>that was necessary to sustain their contention. There was, therefore, no error in giving binding instructions to the jury to find for the defendant.</p>
