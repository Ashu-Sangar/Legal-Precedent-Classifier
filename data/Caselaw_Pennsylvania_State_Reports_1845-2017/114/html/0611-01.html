He was also the owner of other valuable real estate, and all of it, including lots Nos. 1, 2 and 8, was encumbered by tax and other liens. Some of the tax liens were filed before the property was subdivided into lots, and required .an almost impossible apportionment, and a municipal lien, under the Penn Avenue Act, was filed against an entire frontage, and besides being disputed was, in other respects, difficult of adjustment.

Accordingly the tax sale was allowed to proceed, and at the' sale L, E. Johns bid the lots in for the sum of $150, in the name of his wife, Y. M. Johns. Shortly after the sale, and before the sheriff had made a deed to the purchaser, L. E. Johns sold the three lots to the defendants, C. P. Tiers and G. W. Irwin, for the sum of $2,250, cash. At the time of the sale L. E. Johns explained to the defendants the condition of plaintiff’s property, that the sale was for his benefit, and how title was to be made. Five dollars was paid on account, and L. E. Johns gave the defendants a receipt, of which the following is a copy:</p>

The title was not yet complete, for the lots were subject to redemption for a year. To enter into an agreement of non-redemption with Levi Bird Duff, the guardian, C. P. Tiers and L. E. Johns visited him at his office, where it was agreed that instead of giving a written stipulation, not to redeem, the guardian should permit the time for redemption to expire, whereby a complete title would be vested in the defendants according to the terms of the receipt. The time for redemption having expired, Levi Bird Duff, the guardian, called upon C. C. Dickey, Esq., attorney for the defend<a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>ants, and requested payment of the purchase money.

P. Tiers, one of defendants, and then rested. In rebuttal, plaintiff introduced testimony tending to prove, substantially, the several matters of fact embodied in his second, third and fourth points for charge, to wit: that the defendants acquired title to the lots in controversy at sheriff’s sale for taxes, during plaintiff’s minority'-, by virtue of a parol agreement with Leonard S. Johns his brother, and Col. Duff his guardian, both acting in his behalf; that his said guardian having the right to redeem said title within one year, waived the right of redemption for the purpose of carrying out the arrangement to divest plaintiff’s title and withdraw the proceeds from the grasp of the Orphans’ Court, etc. The testimony was such that the jury would have been warranted in finding these facts; and that the sale was pro<a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>cured, with assent of the guardian, not with the view of enforcing the judgment for taxes, but for the purpose of divesting plaintiff’s title without authority from the Orphans’ Court, and that defendants acquired the title with full knowledge of the means employed, and their intended purpose. Iu view of the testimony tending to prove these facts, the court was requested to charge the jury that if they found the facts to be as stated in the points, the defendants hold the title and possession thus acquired, as trustees for plaintiff; and iu the absence of any ratification of the transaction by him, after he attained his majority, their verdict should be in his favor. Without, in express terms, refusing to so instruct the jury, the learned judge impliedly did so by affirming defendants’ second point and charging the jury, “that, under the pleading and evidence iff the case, the defendants are entitled to a verdict.” This is complained of as error; and we are of opinion that it was.</p>

It is not every sale and conveyance of real estate by the-sheriff, that vests iu his vendee ah absolute and indefeasible -title, as against the defendant, in the execution under which the sale is effected. If, for example, execution process is resorted to for the purpose of illegally divesting the title of a minor, or any one not <em>sui juris, </em>and the purchaser, with knowledge of the illegality of the proceedings, acquires the legal title, he holds it in trust for the person whose property is thus sold and conveyed. Or when, by procurement and with the consent of his guardian a minor’s title to realty is divested iu any other mode than that prescribed by law, the purchaser taking title with knowledge of the facts, cannot claim to be the <em>bona fide </em>holder .thereof in his own right, unless.the minor, after attaining his majority, has ratified the sale.. On the contrary, it is equally clear that when such process is used adversely, and for the purpose of enforcing the judgment on which it is issued, and not by procurement for the purpose of divesting the minor’s title, with the concurrence of his guardian but without authority of the Orphans’ Court, the purchaser acquires a complete and indefeasible title.

This was-all fully known by defendants before they acquired the legal title. The} were parties to the arrangement and, therefore, not innocent purchasers without notice. The sale was a mere form to divest title, and had no effect on the beneficial interest of the then minor owner. It would be altogether different if the testimony pointed merely to an adverse proceeding to enforce a tax lien. Duff <em>v. </em>Tiers, 15 Pitts. Leg.

In that case, arising out of the same judicial sale, but not disclosing the purpose thereof, etc., we decided that a sheriff’s sale, under the Pittsburg Tax Act of March 22d, 1877, and failure to redeem within one year, vests a good title in the purchaser, notwithstanding the owner is a minor. That decision is predicated of a <em>bona fide </em>purchase under adverse process, not of a procured sale, arranged'for the very purpose of divesting the minor’s title, with the assent of his guardian and knowledge of the purchaser, and without any authority from the court that should have ordered and supervised the sale, if such sale was necessary.</p>

The procurement of a judicial sale on execution, issued by the Court of Common Pleas, for the purpose of divesting the minor’s title, without application to and authority from the Orphans’ Court, was improper and illegal; and, if the defendants acquired the legal title with knowledge of these facts, they should be treated as trustees of that title for the benefit of the then minor, to whom the property belonged.
