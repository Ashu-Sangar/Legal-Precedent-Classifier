      <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>In 1881, and prior thereto, Mrs. Nill owned a life estate in a woollen mill situated near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. About May 1st, 1881, she authorized her husband, Thomas J. Nill, to effect an insurance on this mill to the amount of $1,500, and he procured a policy for that amount from the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, through Kauffman &amp; Brown, their agents at Harrisburg, for one year. When this policy expired (May 1st, 1882) she procured one for a like amount from The Imperial and Northern Insurance Company, from Kauffman &amp; Brown, they being also this company’s agents. About June 1st, Mrs. Nill was advised by the company’s agents that they were ordered to cancel the Imperial and Northern policy, and they sent her as a proposed substitute a policy in the Clinton Insurance Company of New York for eleven months — the remainder of the year. After Mrs. Nill had talked the matter over fully with her husband, she accepted the Clinton policy, and returned that of the Imperial. Thus matters remained, so far as all parties to this action knew, until August 9th, 1882, when the mill was burned. Mr. Nill gave notice of the loss the same day by letter, received on August 10th, to the Clinton’s agents, now Brown &amp; Beggs, claiming under the Clinton policy, and on the latter date he received a telegram to come to Harrisburg the next day, and to bring with him the Clinton policy. On the 11th, he went to Harrisburg with this policy; and was told by Mr. Brown that about the 1st of August, the Clinton Company had ordered their policy cancelled and that he had issued one in the Lancashire (the defendants) in its stead, but neglected to send it to Mrs. Nill. Brown &amp; Beggs were also the agents of the Lancashire. Mr. Nill hesitated about giving up the Clinton policy and accepting that of the Lancashire, but being assured by Brown that “ the Lancashire was a first class company,” he surrendered the Clinton’s polic]' and took the Lancashire’s home with him. The Lancashire company’s general officers were ignorant of all these facts, but being advised by Brown &amp; Beggs that they had a loss on the mill in question, they sent a man to inquire into it, and upon learning the facts regarding the issuance of their policy, they refused to pay.</p>

Brown &amp; Beggs simply of the fact that a fire had occurred; that he did not give the notice formally as a claim against the Clinton Company, but he gave it to these parties as insurance agents generally. If that be the wajr in which it was given, then I instruct you that the notice given to Brown &amp; Beggs in that way was a notice to whatever company really was bound to Mrs. Nill, and for which they were the general agents.

    <p class="summary" id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.6",267,[149,580,1186,875]]]'>Answer. — I affirm this point in its general terms, but not without qualification with reference to the circumstances of the case. An agent of an insurance company has no authority to insure property already destroyed. But Mrs. Nill, through, her counsel, contends that this property was insured before it was destroyed, because this policy is dated the 28th of July, and she claims that it was delivered to her on the 1st of August, that is, delivered to Brown as her agent, and that that was a delivery before the property was destroyed. If you find that there was no delivery, under the instructions we have given you, until after the property was destroyed, then the plaintiff cannot recover, and the point is well taken. But if a policy was written and intended as a substitute for a subsisting policy in another company, and it be delivered before the fire occurs, then that the assured had no knowledge until after the property was destroyed does not affect it, if, in point of fact, the agent had the authority, express or implied, to change from one company to another, and. was the agent of the insured for the purpose of accepting a policy.

First of all, it assumes certain facts as existing which are not conceded, and which you must ascertain for yourselves; as, for instance, it assumes that Mr. Nill’s testimony was to the effect that he gave notice under the Clinton Company’s policy to that company. But it is for you to say whether he did or not, under the instructions I have already given you. This point, therefore, I cannot affirm in the language in which it is stated, and I must submit the matter to you on the instructions I have already given you without repeating them. If you once decide that this policy was duly issued by and was the deed of the Lancashire Company,- that the preliminary conditions were fulfilled and <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>that the premium was paid, then the question resolves itself very much into this: Whether, under all the circumstances of the case, Mr. Brown was really the agent of Mrs. Nill as well as for the company, that is to say, was her agent for the purpose of placing the insurance wherever he thought best and for her. If you be of that opinion, then the matter stated in this point would not prevent recovery by her. (Tenth assignment of error.)</p>

I suppose $31.95, which we find in this policy, would be the amount. Then, if the Clinton Company would have to refund that sum, and he [Brown], being their agent and having their moneys in his hands, cancelled their policy, it is contended, and it seems to me properly, that he would then have in his hands $31.95 of Mrs. Nill’s money to appropriate to some other insurance ; and then he appropriated it to pay the premium for $1,500 insurance for nine months, making the remainder or the year, in the Lancashire Company. And thus it would seem, if these be the facts of the case, that Mrs. Nill did pay the premium, $31.95, in this way; Brown &amp; Beggs <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>acting as her agents in this business of transferring the policy from one company to the other, they being the agents for all these companies, and acting for Mrs. Nill in making these transfers.

In the very outstart, under the defendant’s plea of <em>non est </em>factum, it was the plaintiff’s business to prove the execution of the policy sued upon; but this was not done; nevertheless the court, notwithstanding the defendant’s objection, admitted it, and sent it to the jury with the instruction that they should treat it as the defendant’s deed if they found that it was countersigned by Brown &amp; Beggs, and if they were also satisfied that these persons were the company’s agents. In this there was double error, for neither was the execution of the policy proved, nor the agency of Brown &amp; Beggs. “ It purports,” says the court, “ to have been signed by Henry Robinson, the United States manager, and countersigned by Brown &amp; Beggs, at Harrisburg. Mr. Nill tells you that it was received by him from Mr. Brown, of the firm of Brown &amp; Beggs, and that'Brown &amp; Beggs claimed to be the general agents of the company at Harrisburg; he treated with them as such.

I then asked him if it would make any difference in the exchange, or whether our rights would be affected or prejudiced by the exchange. He, the said Brown, then said it would not, as the company he had put us in was a first class company. I then gave him, the said Brown, the said Clinton policy, and he gave me the Lancashire policy. This was the first notice we had received of any change or any desire for a change.” From what is here said, and it accords strictly with his evidence given on the trial of the case, it is very clear that Brown’s previous action was without warrant from the assured, and it will, we presume, hardly be pretended, that, had Nill on the llth of August, refused to surrender the Clinton policy, Brown’s pretended cancellation of it would have released that company from its obligation to Mrs. Nill. But if the Clinton policy was still in force on the llth of August, 1882, two days after the fire, the action of Brown &amp; Beggs in the delivery of the Lancashire policy as a substitute for that of the Clinton company, was a mere attempt to shift the loss from the company upon whom it had fallen, to the other which, at the time of the fire, had assumed no responsibility. It requires no argument to show that this could not be done, and that the attempt to accomplish a design of this kind was a fraud on the defendant. Neither does it appear from the evidence that the defendant received a premium as a consideration for its policy.</p>

This might have been so, but as there was no evidence of it, the court ought not to have devised and sent to the jury a theory that had no foundation in fact.
