Simple knowledge by the lender of money that the borrower was likely to, or was going to, use it in gambling might not be enough to prevent a recovery of the money loaned, but if the plaintiff paid this money to Mr. Lamberton, the oil broker, in accordance with an arrangement made between himself and Mr. Cornwell, and if he knew that this money was to be used for the purchase of oil on margins, he could not recover. Therefore, so far as this case is concerned, this request is refused. There is one matter in this request that has been left indefinite. I presume the time of the knowledge, of course, is meant to apply to the time of the loaning of the money. Of course, if Judge Waugh did not know at the time the money was loaned and the notes were given that this money was to be used in a gambling transaction, but learned that afterwards, he would not be bound by that subsequent knowledge.

This is said of a case where the means were furnished with a full knowledge of the object to which they were to be applied, and for the express purpose of accomplishing that object: Cannan <em>v. </em>Bryce, 3 B. &amp; Ald., 254. That case arose out of the violation of a statute, founded on public policy to prevent* stock-jobbing, and it prohibits payment or receipt of money for satisfying or making up any difference under penalty of ¿£100.</p>

The law which prohibits the end will not lend its aid in promoting the means designed to carry it into effect. That which the law prohibits, either in terms, or by affixing a penalty to it, is unlawful, and it will not promote in one form that which it declares wrong in another: White <em>v. </em>Buss, <a href="/mass/57/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="3 Cush. 448" data-case-ids="1984137" data-case-paths="/mass/57/0448-01">3 Cush., 448</a>.</p>

But the principle is not limited in its application to such. It applies in many cases where the acts are illegal solely on the ground of public policy. A bond given in consideration of the loan of money with which to put a substitute in the Confederate army, cannot be enforced: Chritchlu <em>v. </em>Holloway, <a href="/nc/64/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="64 N.C. 526" data-case-ids="8683165" data-case-paths="/nc/64/0526-01">64 N.

A note given for money knowingly lent to be applied to the purpose of suppressing a prosecution for a crime is illegal: Plumer <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/nh/5/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="5 N.H. 553" data-case-ids="6757243" data-case-paths="/nh/5/0553-01">5 N.

    <p id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.5",445,[154,476,1187,1443]]]'>At the argument, the case of Third Nat. Bank, <a href="/f/10/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="10 F. 243" data-case-ids="6731038" data-case-paths="/f/10/0243-01">10 Fed. Rep., 243</a>, was cited as favoring the position that the rule that money lent knowingly and for the purpose of furthering an illegal act cannot be recovered, applies to acts contrary to statute law, and not those contrary to the law founded on public policy. That case was upon promissory notes, the plaintiff claiming to be an innocent holder for value. The notes were given for balances on an illegal agreement, unenforceable between the original parties; but it was not within the gaming statute of Missouri which destroys the negotiable character of a note given for a gaming consideration, within the terms of that statute, for it pronounces a gaming contract absolutely void. And it was held that an innocent holder for value could recover. In the opinion it is said that the great weight of authority supports the rule that a broker or agent, employed to buy or sell commodities for the purpose of speculating on the rise and fall of prices merely, and the agent buys in his own name, but on his principal’s account, and after losses have occurred in such transactions, he advances money at his principal’s request to pay such losses, or if he pays such losses and afterwards his principal gives him a note therefor, may recover against his principal the advances so made, or the note so executed, notwithstanding the illegal character of the original venture. Whether such be the rule in this state need not be considered. But it is further remarked: “If a broker or factor supply his principal with funds for the express purpose of enabling him to engage in illegal transactions, and if lie (the agent) conducts the illegal venture in his own name, it seems clear that he becomes a <em>particeps criminis, </em>and the law will not aid him to recover moneys advanced for such purposes, nor will it enforce securities taken therefor.” And this makes near approach to the controlling principle and facts, as alleged in the case before us.</p>

There was no dispute as to the use which was made of the money. The gist of the controversy was whether the plaintiff confederated with the defendant for its unlawful use. The court referred to the cases of felony and misdemeanor, stating what would make an accomplice in one, and a principal in the other, to enable the jury to understand that <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>there must have been an agreement that the plaintiff would furnish for the defendant’s benefit $500 for the defined purpose of buying oil for the defendant’s benefit, and for the further defined purpose that that purchase should be upon margins, in order to defeat the plaintiff’s recovery. There was.no error in that. The third assignment is not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[255,648,1181,568]]]'>The plaintiff’s second point was — “ That if the jury believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff loaned the money which formed the consideration of the notes for the benefit of the defendant, and, although he knows the money was to be used in buying oil on margins, still the plaintiff can recover.” Answer: “Simple knowledge by the lender of money that the borrower was likely to, or was going to, use it in gambling might not be enough to prevent a recovery of the money loaned, but if the plaintiff-paid this money to Mr. Lamberton, the oil broker, m accordance with an agreement made between himself and Mr. Cornwall, and if he knew this money was going to be used on margins, he could not recover. Therefore so far as this case is concerned, this request is refused.”</p>

It is for him to show by the weight of the evidence that Judge Waugh knew that this was being used for the purchase of oil upon margins.

    <p id="b446-6" data-blocks='[["BL_446.7",446,[255,1476,1184,901]]]'>The plaintiff’s second point omitted reference to the allegation that he furnished money for the purpose of purchasing oil on margins, although there was evidence from which the jury could find that fact. If they believed all that was assumed in the point, it did not follow that the verdict should be for the plaintiff. It was rightly refused. The jury might find the facts assumed and also find that the plaintiff gave the money for the purpose of being used to speculate in the rise and fall in the price of oil, that is, to purchase oil upon margins. Then, the money having been so used, the verdict should be for the defendant. But the point simply referred to the plaintiff’s knowledge of the borrower’s purpose. The answer was explicit that if the plaintiff knew of the defendant’s intention to purchase oil upon margins, he could not recover. And the same thought was expressed in the closing part of the charge. That, we think, was error. While proper instruction was embodied in the remarks respecting a felony or misdemeanor, it is by no means clear that the jury would not understand that they could infer the purpose from the mere fact of knowledge. The fourth and fifth assignments of error are sustained.</p>
