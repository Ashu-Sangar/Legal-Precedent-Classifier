Defendant moved in arrest of judgment because of the refusal of the court to sustain the plea of former jeopardy. This motion was refused and judgment given on the verdict. The proceedings were removed to the Supreme Court on writ of error, and the judgment of the lower court Avas reversed on the ground that the plea of former jeopardy ought to have been sustained, and was therefore a bar to further proceedings on the indict<a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>ment. The order was there made that the record be remitted witli a copy of the opinion for further proceedings in the lower court. Since then an information has been made against the petitioner charging him with the offence of involuntary manslaughter, and he is now in the custody of the keeper of jail of Mercer county, held to answer said charge. It is admitted that the fact of killing or homicide, on which the charge of involuntary manslaughter is based, is the same as that charged in the indictment for murder above referred to, and which was tried at No. 1, of March Term, 1885, in the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Mercer county, Pa.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b391-7" data-blocks='[["BL_391.7",391,[178,1239,1186,1220]],["BL_392.1",392,[259,413,1186,389]]]'>It has been contended on behalf of the petitioner that his situation in regard to the charge of involuntary manslaughter is the same as though, on the indictment for murder, there had been a trial, conviction and pardon; or a trial, conviction and execution. If there had been a lawful conviction on the trial on the indictment'for murder, it needs no argument to show that the petitioner could not thereafter be tried for involuntary manslaughter based upon the same homicide. For a conviction of murder would be a conviction of all the elements essential to that crime. But it seems evident that the situation of the petitioner uow is the same as though his plea of former jeopardy had been sustained by the lower court, on the trial there had. While it is true the plea was not sustained but the trial proceeded to verdict and judgment, it is also true that thereafter all proceedings were without force, and that the verdict and judgment were ineffectual for any purpose. Then, the present situation of the petitioner, without reference to this second charge, is not exactly as it would have been had there been a lawful conviction on the first charge. The most that can be claimed for the result of the former trial is that it lias the same effect as though the petitioner had been acquitted of the charge embraced in that indictment. But even here the analogy does not hold good, so far as special effect is given to an acquittal, for the special reason that it was an adjudication on the merits. Nevertheless, a plea of former jeopardy, if sustained, is an effectual bar to a second prosecution for any offence whereof a conviction could have been had on the former trial. Does its effect extend beyond this point, and <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>so far as to bar a prosecution for any offence which was a part of the crime charged in the first indictment? The word “jeopardy,” as used by our Constitution, plainly means danger of conviction and punishment. A second, jeopardy, then means a danger of a second conviction. Viewing the term, then, with reference to the simple meaning .of the word it would seem that a second prosecution would not be debarred by this plea, unless, under the former indictment, there was danger of conviction of the offence charged in the second.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[252,802,1190,911]]]'>It is plausibly argued on behalf of the petitioner that, as a conviction of the former charge would have been a bar to this new prosecution, so, therefore, an acquittal or discharge of defendant on a plea of former jeopardy has the same effect. This does not follow. The crime of murder is made up of several parts, punishable separately as distinct offences. When there is a conviction of murder, there is necessarily a conviction of all the parts making up that crime. Such conviction, ho wever, can be had only upon proof of all of those parts. If proof of any part fail, there must be an acquittal of that charge. But because all the parts were not proved, it does not follow that no part was proved. An acquittal of that crime, then, is not an adjudication that the accused is not guilty of a lesser offence included in it. Hence it is that upon an acquittal of a charge of murder there can be a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. Why, then, upon the same reasoning can'there not be a subsequent prosecution for a still lesser part of the crime, if a conviction of that part could not have been permitted on the first ? That there can be such second prosecution has always been a doctrine of the common law, and it has more than once been recognized by our Supreme Court as the law of this state.</p>

      <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>The plaintiff was indicted and convicted in the court below of involuntary manslaughter. When called upon to plead to the indictment he filed a special’plea setting forth the fact that he had been indicted and tried in the same court upon the charge of murder; that upon such previous trial the jury had convicted him of murder in the first degree; that the judgment in that case had been reversed by the Supreme Court, and that he had been discharged from said indictment; that the indictment for involuntary manslaughter involves the same facts and circumstances as were involved in the charge of murder, “ and that the offence charged in this indictment (involuntary manslaughter), under the guise of a misdemeanor, is none other than the offence of which the said defendant was discharged or acquitted at said No. 1, March Term, 1885.”</p>
    <p id="b396-6" data-blocks='[["BL_396.6",396,[253,1020,1176,89]]]'>To this plea the Commonwealth entered a demurrer, and the case is before us now solely upon the effect of the pleadings.</p>
    <p id="b396-7" data-blocks='[["BL_396.7",396,[247,1102,1184,559]]]'>The former case, Hilands <em>v. </em>Com., will be found reported in <a href="/pa/111/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="111 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="545401" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0001-01">111 Penn. St., 1</a>. The judgment below was reversed for the reason that the jury first empanneled to try the case had been discharged by the court of its own motion, not only without the consent, but against the will of the prisoner. Another jury was placed in the box, when the prisoner pleaded former jeopardy. The court overruled this plea, and the trial proceeded! resulting in a conviction of murder in the first degree. This court held that the plea should have been sustained, and ordered the discharge of the prisoner from the indictment. He has now been convicted of the offence of involuntary manslaughter, and as is admitted by the demurrer, for the same homicide.</p>
    <p id="b396-8" data-blocks='[["BL_396.8",396,[246,1672,1180,171]]]'>As before observed, the case comes before us now upon the pleadings only; the evidence is not here; hence, we do not know whether upon the trial for involuntary manslaughter, a felonious homicide was proved.</p>
    <p id="b396-9" data-blocks='[["BL_396.9",396,[244,1844,1181,392]]]'>It is very evident the plaintiff can never be tried again upon any charge of which he might have been convicted upon the first indictment. As was said in McFadden <em>v. </em>Com., <a href="/pa/23/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="23 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="974071" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0012-01">23 Penn. St., 12</a>, “A discharge of the jury in .a capital ease after the trial has begun is not a continuance of the cause. It is the end of it. And for all purposes of future protection it is the same to the prisoner as an acquittal, unless it was done with his own consent or demanded by some overwhelming necessity, such, for instance, as the sickness or death of a juror.”</p>
    <p id="b396-10" data-blocks='[["BL_396.10",396,[245,2236,1181,215]],["BL_397.1",397,[161,401,1190,395]]]'>But the protection extends no further than the offence charged in the first indictment, or of which he might have been convicted under it. He was not in jeopardy for any other offence. The first indictment charged murder. Under it he might have been convicted of murder of the first or <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>second degree, or of voluntary manslaughter, bub not of involuntary manslaughter. The latter offence is a misdemeanor; it must be charged as such, and cannot be included in an indictment charging felonious homicide excepting in the case of an indictment for voluntary manslaughter,' where it may be joined by force of the Act of 31st of March, 1860. Walters <em>v. </em>Com., <a href="/pa/44/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="44 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="484308" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0135-01">44 Penn. St., 135</a>. It follows that when the plaintiff was put upon this trial for murder, he was placed "in no jeopardy of a conviction for involuntary manslaughter.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[165,792,1187,702]]]'>If we regard the result of the first trial as the equivalent of an acquittal of the charge of murder, which is stating it in the most favorable form for the plaintiff, it does not help him. It does not follow that because the crime charged may not in law amount to felonious homicide, that it may not constitute a misdemeanor, and be punished as involuntary manslaughter. The failure of the Commonwealth to convict of the higher crime does not preclude her from establishing a lesser crime, even though arising from the same state of facts. The evidence necessary to establish involuntary manslaughter is essentially different from that required to support an indictment for murder. It was said in Com. <em>v. </em>Trimmer, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20Pa.%2069" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="84 Pa. 69">84 Penn. St., 69</a>, that, “ when the evidence necessary to support the second indictment would have been sufficient to procure a legal conviction upon the first, the pleas of <em>autrefois acquit </em>is generally good, but not otherwise.”</p>
    <p id="b397-6" data-blocks='[["BL_397.6",397,[166,1494,1184,208]]]'>We need not pursue the subject further. The question was very carefully and intelligently discussed by the learned judge below upon the writ of habeas corpus, and it scarcely needed even these brief remarks to show that his rulings were entirely accurate.</p>
    <p id="b397-7" data-blocks='[["BL_397.7",397,[941,1713,361,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
