Among other things, he put in evidence the contract of July 19th, 1873, between Dr. Early and Mr. "Watson, then president of the Erie Railway Company, embracing over 20,000 acres of coal lands, including the lands in question ; and, in connection therewith, proved by Dr. Early and others that in the transaction Mr. Watson acted for and on <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>behalf of the railroad company, giving as a reason for using his name in the contract, “that it must not be .known the Erie Railway Company was purchasing mineral or mining property in Pennsylvania,” etc. Dr. Early also testified in substance that the consideration for the lands was paid or secured by the railroad company. In short, that the company, through his agency, purchased and paid for the lands. He also testified in regard to the purchase of the charter of the Northwestern Mining and Exchange Company, that the attorney acting for the railroad company declared they must have “a charter to cover the lands purchased — the bituminous coal lands,” — as the company could not hold them in its own name, “ nor could Mr. Watson hold them as trustee.” The result was that the charter of the Northwestern Mining and Exchange Compan}-, then in the market for sale, was selected, and the witness, Dr. Early, was deputed to purchase it, and did buy it for the railway company for $5,000. The same witness then testified, in detail, how the directors of the Mining and Exchange Company resigned, and their places were immediately filled by the election of persons who were either officers or employés of the Erie Railway company, the then owner and holder of all the stock ordered to be issued by the new board of directors of the Mining and Exchange company, except ten shares given without consideration to each of the directors to render them eligible. These shares, or certificates of stock, were indorsed in blank and deposited with the treasurer of the railway company; so that, in fact, that corporation actually owned and controlled all the stock of the Northwestern Mining and Exchange Company, whose charter it is alleged to have purchased for the purpose of making it the mere repository of the legal title to the lands in question. The testimony" further shows that the lands were conveyed by Dr. Early to the Mining and Exchange Company, pursuant to an assignment of the contract by Mr. Watson. It also tends to show that the stock of the last mentioned company, representing the lands in question, continued to be held by the Erie Railway Company until all its property, rights, franchises, etc., were sold and subsequently transferred to its successor, the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad Company. We might refer at considerable length to other portions of the testimony corroborative of the testimony of Dr. Early, and tending to prove other allegations of fact put in issue by the pleadings, but it is unnecessary; it is sufficient to say that the testimony introduced by the Attorney General tended to prove substantially all the disputed allegations of fact.</p>

They have used a Pennsylvania charter, and although'they virtually paid for all the stock — giving to certain persons ten shares, and using them as directors — we do not think that the lands are subject to escheat.
