Beatty, died intestate, seized of 57 acres of land, now in the city of Pittsburgh, leaving as her only heirs at law her husband and three minor children, viz: Annie B., Robley D. and Bell C. Beatty. The land of course descended to the children subject to their father’s life estate therein. On July 31st, 1804, Annie B., the eldest daughter, died in her minority, unmarried and without issue, leaving her father, brother and sister surviving her. Subject to the outstanding life estate and charged with the collateral tax or duty, which by the devolution accrued to the Commonwealth, her undivided third interest in the land passed to and rested in her brother and sister. There was no administration of her estate for the reason that she had no personal <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>property or unsettled accounts. In March-1866, Dr.' Beatty as guardian of the surviving children, under direction of the Orphans’ Court, sold at private sale three acres of the 'land for the purpose of paying $1,050, assessment for street improvement, etc. Having in the meantime attained their majority, the son and daughter in.March 1870, conveyed four acres of the land to their father, who in consideration thereof released his* life estate in about twenty acres of .the residu.e. Dr. Beatty, having thus by purchase become the owner in fee of the four acres, devised the same to Richard and Mary, son and daughter by his second marriage, and died^ April 12th, 1872. Shortly thereafter, partition was had of the same in the Orphans’ Court, and in October 1876, the purpart allotted to Richard was sold at sheriff’s sale to James R. Mellon, one of the appellants, for $7i400, which was applied to the execution against Richard on which the sale was made. Mary F.

Beatty, respectively, all the other subdivisions of the 57 acres, charged, as to one undivided third thereof, with collateral inheritance tax, was from time to time sold to <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, chiefly by sheriff’s sales, aggregating more than sufficient to have paid the entire tax. These sales, public and private, were all made prior to August 1st, 1885, when the first step was taken by the Commonwealth towards the assessment and collection of the collateral inheritance tax.

Indeed, it is practically conceded that, under the Acts referred to, the tax on estates in remainder accrues immediately upon the decease of the person from whom the remaindermen derive title, that they are to be then appraised, and, after deducting the value of the life estate, the tax on the remainder is immediately payable to the Register, and, if not paid within one jmar after decedents’ death, interest at the rate of twelve <em>per centum </em>per annum from the date of his decease shall be paid.

The duration of the lien, as to purchasers, is no longer unlimited, as it was under the Act of 1849. As we have already seen, under the 3rd section of the supplement, “ All collateral inheritance taxes not sued for <em>within twenty years after they accrued </em>” are presumed to have been paid and cease to be a lien as against purchasers; but, neither of them contains any provisions which, under the circumstances of this case, necessarily postpones the time at which the tax accrues from the devolution of estates made subject to the payment thereof. The Act of 1850, recognizing the hardship of requiring-remaindermen to pay the tax. before, and in many cases .long before they came into possession and actual enjoyment of their respective estates, provides, among other things, that upon certain conditions they may “elect to wait their coming into actual possession of the estates or property subject to the tax.” One of these conditions is that they “shall make a full return of such property within one year......of the death of the decedent, etc. The Act further provides that “the tax on real estate shall remain a lien.....until paid, bearing lawful interest as aforesaid; and no law heretofore passed shall be taken or construed to make any collateral inheritance tax a lien on any other property or estate than those chargeable with such tax.”</p>

    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[267,609,1189,609]]]'>It is evident the first clause of this section, including the first proviso, is applicable only to cases where the settlement of estates is delayed beyond the legally appointed time, “by claims made against the estate, litigation or other unavoidable causes;” and hence it has no direct application to the case before us. The purpose doubtless was to relieve -collateral heirs and legatees from the twelve per cent, penalty on so much of the estate as is withheld from their actual enjoyment, beyond the usual time, from either of the causes therein mentioned; but, they are nevertheless required to pay, with the tax, six per cent, interest from the end of the year, provided the estate, or part of the estate so withheld, yields that amount; if not, they are not required to pay, as interest, any more than it yields.</p>
    <p id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.6",588,[263,1219,1189,1214]]]'>The second proviso, in express terms exempts from the twelve per cent, penalty “ any collateral tax,” of the character therein particularly described, without requiring the remainder men to elect as provided for in the first section of the Act of 1850; but, it does not exempt them from payment of “six per cent, per annum interest on the amount of the tax from the time the same accrued until paid,” as required by the same section. No change, as to the time when the tax accrues appears to have been made or contemplated. As previously provided for, the tax accrues upon the devolution of1 the estate that is subject thereto; and the law contemplates an appraisement as of that date, not only for the purpose of ascertaining the tax on estates that rest in possession and enjoyment immediately, but also for the purpose of determining the amount of tax to be paid on those whose actual possession and enjoyment are deferred until the expiration of an intervening estate or term of years: the latter with interest thereon at the termination of the intervening estate. But, if the legatees or devisees elect to anticipate payment of the tax, the last clause of the second proviso to the first section of the supplement, above quoted, directs that “the same shall be received at the then valuation of the legacy or devise, deducting the value of the life estate or term of years.” Whatis meant by “the then valuation of the legacy or devise,” is its value as of the date it vested — the death of the decedent, with six per cent, added thereto. As we have seen, the value of the estate in remainder is to be ascertained by deducting the value of the life estate or term of years from the valuation of the entire estate.</p>

      <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>We are therefore of opinion that the tax in. question accrued upon the death of Miss Beatty, and that the limitation, as to purchasers, commenced to run at that time.</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[110,537,1187,873]]]'>The several Acts and supplements to which reference has been made are in <em>pari </em>materia, and should be construed not with the view of remedying real or supposed defects in either, but so as to harmonize -the several provisions of each so far as they are not modified or expressly or by necessary implication repealed. If the law is defective, it should be amended not by strained judicial construction but by the law making power. The failure to commence proceedings for the ascertainment and ultimate collection of the tax in this case within the twenty years was doubtless due to the fact that there was no administration on the estate of Miss Beatty, and hence the matter was not brought to the attention of the Register. In this respect the machinery of the law may be defective; but, we have no right for that, reason to make the case an exception to the law limiting the right to sue, or commence proceedings under the Act to a period of twenty years from the time the tax or duty accrued. The Act itself recognizes no such exception, and the limitation clause being a statute of repose in favor of <em>Iona fide </em>purchasers, it should not be construed unfavorably to them, even if it admitted of any such construction.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.6",589,[106,1410,1188,652]]]'>If the Register in 1864 had been aware that a tax or duty on Miss Beatty’s undivided interest in the land had accrued to the Commonwealth by her death without lineal heirs, there was nothing to have prevented him from causing an appraisement of that interest and of the life estate to be made,-thereby ascertaining the value of the estate in remainder that descended to her brother and sister, and thus fixing the amount of the collateral inheritance tax. Under the view we have taken of the law it was his duty to do so. The tax being thus definitely ascertained would have borne interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum until the death of the life tenant; at which time payment of the same with the accrued interest might have been enforced. In the meantime the remainderman would have had a right to anticipate payment and thus satisfy the lien by paying the tax and accrued interest'thereon.</p>
    <p id="b589-6" data-blocks='[["BL_589.7",589,[107,2063,1183,175]]]'>It follows from what has been said that at the expiration of twenty years from the death of Miss Beatty, a conclusive presumption of payment arose in favor of the purchasers and as against them the lien ceased.</p>

As to her, the limitation clause does not apply, and that portion of the land, still owned by her, remains subject to the tax lien in favor of the Commonwealth, unless the claim has been actually or constructively paid. It is con<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>ceded the tax has never been actually paid; but it is contended that inasmuch as the money, realized from judicial sales of the interest bound by the heir, was more than sufficient to have paid the tax lien and should have been so applied, the claim js constructively paid and the lien discharged. This position appears to be well taken. The Commonwealth was undoubtedly entitled to be first paid out of the fund, and if the tax and accrued interest had been claimed, it would have been paid and the lien satisfied. The fact that the amount of the lien had not been ascertained and fixed cannot affect the result. It was capable of ascertainment, and might have been definitely fixed even after the monejr applicable to its payment was raised by judicial sale. If the claim had been made, the court would doubtless have retained its grasp on sufficient amount of the fund to pay the tax lien. But, no claim upon the fund was ever made, for the reason doubtless that neither the Register nor the court distributing the fund was aware of the existence of the claim. That fact however did not prevent the discharge of the lien by judicial sales producing funds applicable primarily to the lien, and more than sufficient to pay it.</p>
