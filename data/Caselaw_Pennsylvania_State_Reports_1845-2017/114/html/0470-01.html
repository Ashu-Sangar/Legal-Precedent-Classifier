In our own, we have many laws conferring this authority qu courts, on county and township officers, on city and borough councils, and on special commissioners. In very many cases, also, the General Assembly has by its own direct and immediate Acts, ordered that streets and roads should be vacated, as-well as opened, widened, and otherwise,altered-. Do all these laws violate the constitution? We,cannot find anything in that instrument with which they are in conflict.” In the same case, it was held that a highway •might be vacated without providing for compensation to those whose private interests were affected thereby. “Surrendering the right of way,” says this court, “over a public road to the owners of the soil, is not taking private property for public use, and the proprietors of other land incidentally injured by the discontinuance of the road, are not entitled to cortipeu<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>sation. A private road is private property, and an Act of Agsembly to close it up without paying for it, would be depriving the owner of his property. But a public road belongs to nobody but the state; and when the government sees fit to vacate it, the consequential loss, if there be any, must be borne by those who suffer it, just as they would bear what might result from a refusal to make it in the first place.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.6",493,[120,882,1187,130]]]'>Art 1, sec. 10. — “ Nor shall private propertj" be taken or applied to public use without authority of law, and without just compensation being first made or secured.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.7",493,[118,1013,1188,1434]]]'>Art. 16, sec. 8. — “Municipal and other corporations and individuals, invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use, .shall make just compensation for property taken, injured, or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements; which compensation shall be paid or secured before such taking, injury or destruction.” But by the vacation of Washington street, no private property was taken or applied to public use; on the contrary, private property which had heretofore been appropriated by the public, was surrendered to the proper owner, and when thus surrendered, who can gainsay the right of the owners to use it with their other property in the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements. Whether or not the ordinance of the councils was a wise and prudent measure we are not called on to consider; its avowed, and doubtless real purpose was to subserve the public interest; it may however have originated in a mistaken policy; it may have conferred a benefit upon one, to the incidental injury of others. But tire fuu'ctions of civil government must be trusted to somebody, and the results of its injudicious exercise must be borne without complaint. We are of opinion therefore that the vacation of Washington street and the appropriation of the ground by the railroad company, the owners of the abutting property, would not, in the absence of any special legislative provision for damages in such case be subject to the constitutional condition that compensation shall be first made for property taken, injured, or destroyed. If, as in the vacation of Center street, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20W.N.C.%2089" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="19 W.N.C. 89">19 W. N. C., 89</a>, there had been a special provision for the award of damages to the owners of property injured by the vacation, a different question would be presented. The injury which the plaintiff suffered was from the vacation of the street, and this was the act of a municipality to which the plaintiff was subject.</p>

This is a proceeding by a bill in equity for an injunction. It would certainly be inequitable and unjust to restrain the company from doing what they have an undoubted right to do. If the street lias not been vacated, by a formal ordinance of councils to that effect, it should have been, and in equity we will consider that as done which ought to have been done.</p>

The question as to the constitutionality of the Act of 1869, upon the ground of the alleged defect in its title, does not affect our view of the ease. The title of the Act is, “An Act to authorize the Select and Common' Councils of the city of Pittsburgh, to vacate streets and alleys in said city,” and the vacation of Washington street, or the ordinance stipulating for its vacation, is the precise matter complained of. If it be conceded, however, that the title does not fully express the subject of the Act, it is only those provisions not covered by it, that are void.
