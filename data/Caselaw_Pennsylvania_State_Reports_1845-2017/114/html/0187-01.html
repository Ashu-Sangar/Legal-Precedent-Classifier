It is not only' evasive but it was made by a stranger to the record. It is true he styles himself “attorney for Jacob Grid,” but whether he was attorney at law or attorney in fact does not appear. No reason is given why the defendant did not make the affidavit himself, nor does the affidavit show that it was made for and on behalf of the defendant, or even with his knowledge.</p>

Under such and similar circumstances we have no doubt that an affidavit of defence may be made on behalf of the defendant by an attorney at law or other person duly authorized, but the reason why it is .not made by the defendant should be set forth in the affidavit. The court can then judge of the sufficiency of such reason. It would never do to allow a stranger to the record to intermeddle in this manner.</p>

    <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.7",207,[147,787,1184,605]]]'>Nor is the supplemental affidavit specific. The original is wholly evasive, as before observed.

Such language as that “ the whole bill is in excess of the price agreed upon, and is extortionate, and labor and material charged for which was not furnished,” is too vague. How much labor and material were charged for and not furnished ? Surely if the defendant knows the fact to be so he can tell the amount. And as to the few items which are more specific, there is no distinct averment made of any agreement with the defendant in regard to their price.
