W. Johnston, one of the defendants. Mr. Johnston entered into writings agreeing to fulfill these contracts for carrying the mail, and bound himself, and gave as sureties in the same obligation the other two defendants, for the sum $3,000 in the two contracts; that is to say, $1,500 each. The condition of the obligation was, substantially, that W. W. Johnston would faithfully fulfill his agreements with the plaintiff, Mr. Patterson. It is not denied that the three defendants signed these writings which have been given in evidence. It is also a conceded fact that in February of 1885, W. W. Johnston ceased to carry the mail, contrary to the stipulations made by him, as set forth in these writings.</p>

The evidence as to the first assertion or matter of defence is to the effect that prior to the time these writings were entered into, Mr. Patterson had represented to Mr. W. W. Johnston that the road from Cadiz to Cambridge was better than the road from Mercer to Sharon, and that the road from Cadiz to St. Clairsville was better than the road from Cadiz to Cambridge.</p>
