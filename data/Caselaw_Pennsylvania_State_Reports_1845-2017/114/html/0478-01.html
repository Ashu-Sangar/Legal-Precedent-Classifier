A bridge company, in pursuance of its charter, Act of March 19th, 1810, and a supplementary Act of February 17th, 1816, and upon the faith of their provisions, erected a toll bridge over the Monongahela River at Pittsburgh. By the Act of April 18th, 1889, P. L. 749, a street railway company was incorporated and authorized to lay its tracks across said bridge. The railway company and the bridge company, for about twelve years, agreed upon the rate of toll for a street ear.</p>

The bridge company then petitioned the court for an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, and demanded a trial by jury; this the court refused. On a <em>certiorari </em>to the Supreme Court, <em>Held </em>— (a) That the Quarter Sessions had jurisdiction to fix the tolls for a street car; the acceptance of the Act of 1871 by the bridge company was subject to the Act of 1859. <em>(b) </em>That the general description of vehicles in the Act of 1871, viz., “ other wheeled vehicles of whatsoever description,” must be restricted to the same kind or general class of vehicles with those particularized, viz., “ carriages, wagons and buggies,” and therefore does not include street cars, <em>(c) </em>That the right of the railway company to petition the Court of Quarter Sessions to fix the rate of tolls is not precluded under the facts in this case, <em>(d) </em>That the bridge company is no't entitled to an appeal under Article XVI., Section 8 of the Constitution.</p>

It is a conceded fact, that in 1871, street cars in the cities of the commonwealth, were a well known instrumentmf conveyance; for twelve years and upwards they had been extensively used for passeng'er travel over the Monougahela bridge, and, if the framers of the Act of 1871, intended to embrace them within its provisions, it is very remarkable indeed, that they were not specifically mentioned. A street car certainly is a wheeled vehicle in the general sense of that term; it is a vehicle in the same sense that an ordinary railroad car is a vehicle, but both are vehicles of a somewhat extraordinary character; in this respect, that they can only be used a means of conveyance or transportation upon a permanent, continuous and connected track. To pass the railway company’s cars over this bridge, their railway track must be permanently laid upon it, so as to connect with their tracks at either end. In other words the bridge must form part or parcel of the route of the railway. The vehicles which are specified in the Act of 1871 “ carriages, wagons, buggies, sleighs and sleds,” are all of that class which requires no such special appliance to promote their passage, and it is reasonable to suppose that the general phrase, “other wheeled vehicles of whatever description, used in immediate connection therewith, may refer to vehicles of the same general class or kind, as those particularly specified. In view then of the fact, that special provision had already been made in the Act of 1859, for the regulation of the rate of tolls which the railway company should pay for the passage of their street cars over the Monongahela bridge; that the railway company for twelve years and upwards had occupied the bridge with their track, and had paid, and the bridge company liad received, tolls according to rates from time to time amicably agreed upon, in apparent conformity to the provision of that Act; that notwithstanding the extraordinary character of street cars as a means of conveyance, and of the unusual appliances required in order to facilitate their passage over the bridge, no particular reference was made to them in the designation of the tolls which might be charged under the Act of 1871. We are of opinion that it was not the legislative intention to embrace the railway company’s cars in the provisions of that Act, and that the general designation, “ other wheeled vehicles of whatever description,” must be restrained to the same kind or general class of vehicles with those par<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>ticularized. The bridge was and is a public highway, and the commonwealth had the power to authorize such use of it for a public thoroughfare, as was reasonably consistent with the purpose of its erection, subject, of course, to the payment of such tolls as the company might lawfully and reasonably require ; and for the passage of street cars over it the Act of 1859 prescribed the method by which the tolls should be ascertained. The bridge company must be taken to have accepted the Act of 1871, in view of the provision, made for the railway company's cars, in the Act of 1859.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[149,832,1188,1140]]]'>The further contention of the bridge company is, that assuming the power of the.legislature to regulate the amount of their tolls, the exercise of power by the court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny county, by the express terms of the Act of 1859, is limited to a period of thirty days from the original organization of the company, and cannot after that time be exercised. We do not so understand the provisions of the Act of 1859. It is perfectly plain, upon the slightest examination of the Act, that the application could not be made within thirty days from the organization of the company, and if it could not be made <em>after </em>the lapse of that time, the Act would have no force whatever. There is no limitation of time; the proceedings- are authorized to begin at any time after the expiration of the period stated, but not before, if the parties fail to agree. It is equally plain that the parties did not agree, except for a limited time, and cannot now agree; no permanent arrangement was at any time effected; the Quarter Sessions therefore has full power in the premises. It is true, the railway company had originally no right to the use and occupancy of the bridge until an agreement was effected, or an application made, but the railway company, under the temporary agreement referred to, has been and is now in the use of the bridge, without objection of the bridge company; the railway company is therefore not a trespasser; it has forfeited none of its rights under the Act of 1859, and is entitled to an adjudication under it.</p>

The company's charter contemplates that they shall be paid by tolls and not otherwise, and the conduct of the company has been in accordance with their charter. It does not appear that their property has been taken, injured or destroyed, they are not <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>therefore entitled to damages; they are entitled to tolls, according to a rate to be ascertained by law, and this proceeding is properly instituted for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b502-6" data-blocks='[["BL_502.6",502,[890,523,494,44]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
