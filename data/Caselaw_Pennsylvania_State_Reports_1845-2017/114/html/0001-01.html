D. Lundy, dated April 2d, 1884. at three months, for $376.98, and payable at the First National .bank of DuBois,.and which, it is alleged, was endorsed by A. D. Lundy and A. D.

A few days thereafter, they received a remittance, from the DuBois bank for the checks, which remittance by draft, was enclosed in the original letter sent from the Williamsport bank, but no mention of the note. See copy of letter in the opinion of the Supreme Court. The cashier of the DuBois bank denied, positively, that the words “Simon &amp; P. 376.98” were upon the letter received from the Williamsport bank, at the time it was received and returned. The president of the DuBois bank also testified that he did not see the entry upon the letter. The cashier of the Williamsport bank, and two clerks of the same bank, whose depositions were taken at Williamsport, testified as to the manner of doing business with regard to the transmission of collections, and their bank books were produced before the notary who took their testimony, identified by the witnesses, and copies of the entries alleged to have been made of this transaction were attached or copied in the testimony. Upon the trial of the cause, no person connected with the Williamsport bank appeared at court or was called as a witness. The depositions of the Cashier and the two clerks were offered in evidence and objected to by the defendant bank, because the books containing what is alleged to be the original entries of the transaction were not produced in court for inspection by the jury, and that copies were not competent evidence under the circumstances. The Court overruled the objections and-admitted the evidence. (First, second and third assignments of error.)</p>

The suit is not brought upon the book charges, nor were the books relied upon as books of original entry, or referred to as such; indeed, the books themselves were not offered in evidence at all, either at the taking of the depositions or at the trial.’ The best proof, of which the case appears to have been susceptible, was the evidence of the bank officers themselves; the books were but secondary evidence of the facts alleged. But whilst it was competent for the witnesses named to explain the course of their business, to state that entries in the regular course of business were made of this transaction at the time, and, by <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>reference to the books, to refresh their recollection, it was not competent, we think, in this oblique way, to introduce the entries themselves. If the books, supported by the oath of those who made them, were conceived to he evidence, they should have been offered, and upon proper identification produced at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b25-4" data-blocks='[["BL_25.5",25,[164,665,1192,1643]]]'>It is conceded in the argument that if thé memorandum, “ Simon &amp; P. — $376.98,” was in fact written upon the letter, exhibit “A.,” when received at DuBois, and the note was not found enclosed therein, it was the duty of the DuBois bank to notify the Williamsport bank of the fact. This neglect of the DuBois bank to give notice in such case, was, we think, the equivalent, in the first instance, of an admission that the note was received ; this neglect was of course open to explanation, but unexplained; it was, as the court said, “almost conclusive that the DuBois bank had lost the note.” Whether the memorandum was made before the remittance to DuBois, and if so, whether the failure to give notice of the fact was satisfactorily explained, were, under all the evidence questions for the jury. Mr. Harris testifies that the exhibit “A.,” with the exception of the “O. K.” and the pencil figuring, is all in his handwriting. Pie does not say in terms that it was all written at the time, but he states fully his method of doing business, and the fair inference is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that it was so written. We are not to presume or to infer a fraud or a forgery without proof. W. H. Sloan, the cashier, testifies that he directed the remittance of the note and checks to be made, and that on the 14th June, 1884, he receive an envelope by mail, in which he found the exhibit “A.,” with a draft for $169.85, covering the amount of the checks, on the DuBois bank. He does not say that the memorandum of the note was then written upon it, but as the witness is supposed to speak of the paper as it was exhibited to him on the stand, in the absence of any suggestion of the witness to the contrary, this is the reasonable presumption as to his meaning. The testimony on these points is certainly not as-full as its importance would seem to require; it is meagre in details, and to some extent, on this account, unsatisfactory. Sufficient was shown, however, to send the case to the jury. When there is evidence on part of the plaintiff which, taken alone, would justify an inference of the disputed facts, the ■ question is for the jury: Howard Express Co. <em>v. </em>Wile, 14 P. F. S., 205 ; and in civil cases, the facts are to be determined by the weight of the evidence.</p>

The $100 note matured on the 23d June, 1884, the note, now in question, for $376.98, on the 5th July fol<a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>lowing. Mr. Arnold testifies tlmt the bank.gave their advance notices, from one to two weeks before the notes matured. Mr. Simon says that he removed to Big Run on the 14th June, and that he received a notice very soon after. He does not pretend to say upon which note the notice was given ; he did not read it; lie knew it was a notice from the bank, but as he knew he was unable to pay, he gave it no attention. Now this notice was just as likely to be upon the one note as the other. There was literally no evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the notice was upon the note for $376.98; and it was plain error to submit a question of fact, which was conclusive in the case, to be determined upon mere conjecture.</p>
