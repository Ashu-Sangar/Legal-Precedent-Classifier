It is plain that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the first prayer, and the second was rendered impracticable by the denial of the complainant’s possession and title. In the bill for partition, she demanded one fifth of the land to be set apart to her in severalty; but, to this she may not have been entitled, and yet have a right to recover in ejectment oné fifth undivided. Partition is made of lands of tenants in common, when their possession is common ; ejectment is the remedy when the possession of one is adverse to the other. The dismissal of the partition bill, would not necessarily have any conclusive effect upon her claim in ejectment. The Smithfield Savings Bank was entitled to the possession of Peter Bigley, the defendant in the execution, and in the answer, the bank claimed that his possession was of the whole land as an entirety ; the bank’s claim of possession through Bigley was, therefore, adverse to Sarah Bigley, and ejectment, whether by the bank whilst she remained in possession, or by her after she went out, was the appropriate remedy for the determination of her i-ights; Law <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20185" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 185">1 W. &amp; S., 185</a>; Longwell <em>v. </em>Bentley, 11 Harris, 99.</p>
