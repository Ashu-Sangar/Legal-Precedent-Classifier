Under the intestate law each of the heirs would be entitled to one eighth of the land; under the will each devisee is entitled to one sixth. A few elementary principles dispose of the question. Purchase includes every other method of coming to an estate; but merely that by inheritance. If the ancestor devises his estate to his heir at law by will, with other limitations, or in any other shape than the course of descent would direct, such heir shall take by purchase. <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>But if a man, seized in fee, devises bis whole estate to his heir at law, so that the heir takes neither a greater nor a less estate by the devise than he would have done without it, he shall be adjudged to take by descent. Even this rule, in England, was long ago abrogated bj a statute which enacts that an heir to whom land is devised by his ancestor, shall take as devisee, and not by descent.</p>
    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[259,712,1179,550]]]'>The principal difference, in effect between the acquisition of an estate by descent and by purchase, consists in two points : 1. By purchase the estate acquires a new inheritable quality, and is descendible to the owner’s blood in general, and not the blood only of some particular ancestor; and 2. An estate taken by purchase will not make the heir answerable for the acts of the ancestor, as an estate by descent will. And the intestate law of Pennsylvania, which differs from the common law in many particulars, provides “ that no person who is not of the blood of the ancestors or other relations from whom any real estate descended, or by whom it was given or devised to the intestate, shall in any of the cases before mentioned take any estate of inheritance therein.”</p>
    <p id="b44-5" data-blocks='[["BL_44.6",44,[259,1273,1177,344]]]'>It is impossible for the six children to take the whole of the estate except by virtue of the devise. Necessarily they hold the estate by purchase, and it acquires a new inheritable quality. The course of descent was broken, altered. Had the devise been made to strangers they would have taken as purchasers. The six heirs hold precisely in the same way, for their title is the will. And the effect on the legal course of descent is the same as if the devise were to strangers.</p>
    <p id="b44-6" data-blocks='[["BL_44.7",44,[255,1618,1180,602]]]'>Soon after the enactment of April 13th, 1840, Gibson, G. J., remarked of the provision relative to cases where the descent had not been altered, that it “was, perhaps, superfluous; for wherever exactly the same interest passes by the law that would pass by the will, the devisee takes by descent, and the testator may be said, in language strictly technical, to have died intestate as to the particular land: ” Selfridge’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 55" data-case-ids="12168867" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0055-01">9 W. &amp; S., 55</a>. In Waln’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/4/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="401952" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0502-01">4 Pa. St., 502</a>, the same justice spoke of this provision as unnecessary and amounting to nothing. These dicta, contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute, though not authority, show how quickly the great jurist saw that no devise could be made of an estate different from that which would descend to the heir, without altering the course of descent.</p>
