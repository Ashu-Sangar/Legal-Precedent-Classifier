The original capital was $100,000, in shares of $50, which seems to have been,paid in full. On July 18th, 1873, at a stockholders’ meeting, it was resolved to increase the capital stock $300,000. Thereupon 138 shares were subscribed. At a meeting of the Board of Directors, held July 7th,' 1874, it was determined “that we iucreaseour subscriptions to $175,000, and that unless said amount is subscribed it will not be binding on said subscribers.” Then a subscription list was opened, which set forth that “ we, the undersigned, hereby agree to subscribe for the number of shares of the capital stock of the Keystone Iron Company, set opposite our respective names; provided, however, that no subscription hereto shall be binding unless the amount of the said subscriptions added to the amount of the subscriptions heretofore made shall equal one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars of the capital stock of said company.” On that list subscriptions for 1362 shares were obtained, making, with the 138 shares theretofore subscribed without condition, 1500 shares, representing $75,000, which, with the $100,000 of original subscriptions, made up said $175,000.

Its capital stock was originally $100,000. By the unanimous resolve of the stockholders the capital was authorized to be increased $100,000; and in 1874 it was increased by additional subscriptions amounting to $75,000. A small part of the increase was unconditional; the greater .part was on condition that no subscription should be.binding unless the total subscriptions to the captial stock should equal $175,000. On the face of the subscriptions they equalled the stipulated sum. All the additional capital was subscribed before December 26th, 1874, and on that date the treasurer was instructed to call in ten per centum per month until otherwise directed.

Nothing more is demanded of each defendant than so much of his subscription as remains unpaid. The plaintiffs put little stress on the claim that they gave credit on the faith of these subscriptions. They are creditors, and as such demand that part of the trust fund for payment of the debts of the company which remains in the hands of the defendants. There are other creditors of the company, but none of them have asked to be made parties. They might have come in as plaintiffs, had they chosen to do so, and if they stand aloof no party in the litigation shall thereafter suffer by their action. For reasons satisfactory to themselves, the defendants have not pressed for the appointment of a receiver, or that anything else be done in the interest of all the creditors. The plaintiffs are not bound to prosecute .the suit in the interest of others who might if they would come in as co-plaintiffs. Nor was it necessary to make all stockholders, who had not paid, defendants. The burden does not rest on the plaintiffs to adjust the equities between persons who individually hold portions of the trust fund, especially where each denies that he holds any part of the fund. Every person who holds any of the fund is bound to pay all that he holds, if necessary for satisfaction of tire plaintiff’s debt, although he may-have right of contribution. Under the facts in this case, the bill praying for direct payment byr the defendants to the plaintiffs, is not fatally defective, but is sanctioned by precedent.

In that case John Maxwell and others, suing as well for themselves as for all other creditors who might become parties, brought suit in equity against the corporation and the holders of its capital stock, to compel payment of the unpaid capital. In the elaborate opinion, at the outset, Justice Green thus states the points for consideration: “ The chief contention before the Master as in this court, was upon the liability of the stockholders in this proceeding. It was contended on behalf of the defendants that they could not be called upon by bill in equity, as proposed in this case, for two reasons: First, because the complainants have a complete and adequate remedy at law specifically provided by the Act of April 29th, 1874, under which the company was incorporated; and second, that the plaintiff, John Maxwell, the principal creditor, had a complete and adequate remedy by attachment in.execution upon his judgment.” These were the defences considered, and it was clearly shown that a bill in equity was the proper proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b180-6" data-blocks='[["BL_180.7",180,[318,2115,1184,253]]]'>Doubtless there are cases where the action should be by or for all creditors, and against all persons liable to pay, or to contribute to payment of the debts. Arid cases may arise when, upon proper application, creditors who were not parties in the first instance will be made parties, and where all persons liable to contribute must be made defendants.</p>
    <p id="b180-7" data-blocks='[["BL_180.8",180,[320,2377,1185,88]],["BL_181.1",181,[94,402,1200,1137]]]'>The second point urged by appellants, is, that the subscription having been made on condition that the whole amount <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>of the additional $75,000, should be subscribed, and part thereof having been made by married women, is not binding. Both their subscriptions were made on the same condition, and a part of the stipulated sum. They knew the condition of the subscription, that it contained the names of Mrs. B,obertson and Mrs. Bercaw, and for aught that appears they were as well informed respecting those persons as any officer or other stockholder in the company. Cornell says the subscription was to complete the furnace; they did not have money enough to complete it. The appellants paid on the twenty shares first subscribed. What difference does it make whether the payment was made on the first or second ? Each was part of the same sum. If one was binding so was the other. By paying the first calls on one subscription they waived the written condition. Their payment of call, their active part in the meetings of stockholders, their silence respecting nonliability until after payment of more than seven-tenths of the whole additional subscription, forbid that they may now evade payment of the balance on the ground that one seventy-fifth part of the subscription was inadvertently received from married women. They paid part, others paid all they subscribed, liad the business proved successful the appellants would have been entitled to every share of stock for which they agreed to pay. They must bear their share of the burden in common with the shareholders who paid in full, while they were actively and openly recognizing their liability.</p>
    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[96,1539,1204,872]],["BL_182.1",182,[311,401,1185,87]]]'>The third ground of defence relates to the ten shares last subscribed, “having been made upon the further parol condition that it was not to be called in until the furnace was put in blast by the company, and to be used only as working capital.” As shown by the testimony of one of the appellants, none knew better than they that the increased subscription was needed and made for the completion of the furnace. They do not pretend that the parol agreement was such as to vitiate the subscription already made. The parol agreement related to further subscriptions, made after more than two-thirds of the stipulated sum had been subscribed. It is a part of the $75,000, but the time of its payment was agreed tó be postponed until completion of the furnace. A disinterested 'witness, called by defendants, testifies: “At the time the subscriptions were made the question had not yet arisen whether the furnace should be put in blast by any other person than the company. The expression used was.that the subscriptions should not be paid until the furnace was put in blast. The linderstanding was that the furnace was to be put in blast by the company. Upon that day nothing was said about putting <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>in the blast by the company. The subscription was to be used as working capital.”</p>
    <p id="b182-6" data-blocks='[["BL_182.6",182,[309,488,1189,350]]]'>In view of all the evidence, that is a fair statement of the oral promises at the time the appellant subscribed for. the ten shares. — Dr. Arndt was not then present. Debts were contracted for completion of the furnace, the unpaid capital was insufficient for working capital, the furnace was leased by authority of the stockholders, and the tenant put it in blast in 1876. The court did hot err in holding that the condition was performed according to its reasonable intendment.</p>
    <p id="b182-7" data-blocks='[["BL_182.7",182,[309,837,1188,433]]]'>In any view the subscription is not void, or voidable. Its condition is stated in the answer thus: “That the same was not to be called in or payable until the furnace of said company was put in blast by the company, and that the same should only be used for working capital.” It was due when the furnace was put in blast. It was payable before it could be used for working capital. If the company failed to pay its debts, the creditors could demand it from the shareholders as soon as due and payable. The company had right of action for its recovery immediately after it became due.</p>
    <p id="b182-8" data-blocks='[["BL_182.8",182,[308,1271,1186,301]]]'>No false representation of fact is alleged, and the contract is not voidable. A failure on the part of the corporation to comply with the special terms of a subscription for shares, is merely a cause for an action against the company: Morowetz on Corp. § 803. This principle will surely apply when the promise is to use the money after its payment as working capital.</p>
    <p id="b182-9" data-blocks='[["BL_182.9",182,[308,1574,1186,261]]]'>Upon the appellants’ own contention and showing, the money for' the ten shares did not become due and payable until in the year 1876. The bill was filed April 23d, 1881. All the calls on the prior subscription for twenty shares, made more than six years before the filing of the bill, were paid. The Statute of Limitations is not a bar to any part of the demand.</p>
    <p id="b182-10" data-blocks='[["BL_182.10",182,[571,1836,921,86]]]'>Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at costs of appellants.</p>
