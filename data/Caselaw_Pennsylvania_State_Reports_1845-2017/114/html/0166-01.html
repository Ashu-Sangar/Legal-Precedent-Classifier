For although the original design of the defendants’ agent may have been honest, it is a fraud in the defendants, in order to procure an unfair advantage, subsequently to deny the parol qualification, upon the faith of which the contract was made; evidence as to the real intent of.the parties, at the time, therefore, becomes admissible: Lippincott <em>v. </em>Whitman, <a href="/pa/83/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="83 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="1050838" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0244-01">83 Penn.
