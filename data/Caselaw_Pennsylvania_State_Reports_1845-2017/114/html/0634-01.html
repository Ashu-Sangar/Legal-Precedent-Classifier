It is true that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>governs as to the legality and construction of a contract. But the <em>lex fori </em>will not always enforce a contract because it was lawful where made. It will not be enforced by the courts of other states where the contract is against public morals or the public interests. The <em>lex loci </em>always governs as to the disability of minors, married women, etc., to contract; and sometimes it governs as to their ability to contract. But I do not think it should always govern. If so, the property in this state held by guardians, trustees, etc., might be swept away by contracts made in other states directly in conflict with our laws. Our laws save a married woman’s property from the debts or contracts of her husband and from her own imprudent acts. Shall we enforce contracts that deprive her of this protection ? We say she shall not engage in general business or bind herself or her estate by giving negotiable notes. If another state allows her to give such notes shall we enter judgment on them and. permita foreign creditor to sweep away her paternal patrimony, which we would not allow one of our own citizens to touch ?</p>

The argument of the plaintiffs is, that, because she may be sued in certain cases and a judgment obtained against her on which her property may be taken in execution, therefore she is authorized to make all such contracts and bind herself personally for all such debts. On this mode of reasoning (quoting the words of the sections), a married woman in Ohio may become a “partner” in any kind of business; may enter into any “ written obligation, contract dr agreement”; may “be engaged as owner or partner in any mercantile or other business ”; and if so, then, in Ohio, all the common law disabilities of married women are removed.</p>

They were intended to prescribe the instances in which .they may sue and be sued alone, and to alter, and perhaps enlarge the remedy: Jenz <em>v. </em>Gugel, <a href="/ohio-st/26/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="26 Ohio St. 527" data-case-ids="891228" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/26/0527-01">26 Ohio St., 527</a> ; Allison <em>v. </em>Porter, 29 Id., 136.. In Avery <em>v. </em>Van Sickle, 35 Id., 270, it was said by Boynton, J., in delivering the opinion of the court: “The cases of Jenz <em>v. </em>Gugel, and Allison <em>v. </em>Porter are decisive of the question that no new cause of action was created (by the code), and the character of the action was in no wise changed; that it is plain that it was not intended to remove the incapacity of a married woman to enter into contracts binding at law.” In Phillips <em>v. </em>Graves, 20 Id., it was held that a <em>feme covert </em>may charge her separate estate, at least to the extent that such liability may be incurred for the benefit of such separate estate; that such power is only limited by the terms of the instrument creating such estate, or by implication arising therefrom; that the intention to change the separate estate may be implied by the giving of a bond or note; that courts of equity will enforce payment out of the separate estate through a receiver, 1st, by sequestering the personal property2d, by sequestering the rents and profits of the realty, and, 3d, by a sale of the real estate if necessary. In Levi <em>v. </em>Earl, 30 Id., 147, the syllabus, which is the law of the case, reads as follows: “ The ground upon which a court of equity charges a married woman’s separate estate for her general engagements in the absence of a valid contract binding the same, or of an express charge thereon, is not because her contracts have any validity, nor by way of appointment or charge, but because the circumstances are such that equity decrees it to be just that they should be paid out of said estate.” That case rules that under the statute the separate estate of a married woman is liable for debts contracted in improving, repairing or cultivating it. In such cases the wife is liable in an action at law, but all other obligations are void as at common law. It was said by the court: The <em>Jus clisponendi </em>which attaches in Ohio to the estate of a married woman is largely regulated by statute. She cannot convey or mortgage or lease for a longer period than three years without consent of her husband.....all contracts made by her concerning her separate estate other than for labor and materb als for improving, repairing and cultivating the same are sub<a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>ject to her disabilities as <em>a feme </em>covert.....except where a case is made out for a court of equity to charge her separate estate.” In Rice <em>v. </em>The Railroad Co., 32 Ohio, it was held that the separate property of a married woman was not liable for her general engagements, in the absence of a contract valid in law to bind the same. In the recent case of Payne <em>v. </em>Thompson,decided in March, 1886, and reported in the Ohio Law Journal of April 5th, the court says: “Except so far as capacity has been given to her <em>{feme covert) </em>by statute to bind herself by her contracts, they are void......It should be borne in mind that the provisions of sections 4,996 and 5,319 of the Revised Statutes, were not intended to enlarge or vaiy the liabilities of married women, but relate merely to the form of the remedy.” Many other cases to the same.point might be cited were it necessary.</p>
    <p id="b658-10" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[260,1078,1189,171]]]'>A careful examination of the authorities cited for the plaintiff: fails to show any that break the force of the foregoing. None of them holds that by the law of Ohio a married woman can be held'personally on her contracts generally.</p>
    <p id="b658-11" data-blocks='[["BL_658.7",658,[259,1250,1190,902]]]'>As I understand the proceedings in Ohio under the Revised Statutes it is practically a proceeding in <em>rem </em>not against the <em>feme covert </em>personally or on the footing of a personal contract. If she has given a note or contracted a debt for the benefit of her separate estate, or under such circumstances as indicate an intention to charge her separate estate, the proceeding is by petition with a prayer to have the debt declared a lien upon the particular property, and to make the same subject to its payment. In such cases if equity requires the particular order to be made it is done. How widely this differs from an absolute personal liability is apparent. It is true in Patrick <em>v. </em>Littell, <a href="/ohio-st/36/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="36 Ohio St. 79" data-case-ids="908525" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/36/0079-01">36 Ohio St., 79</a>, the court allowed a personal judgment to be recovered against a married woman. But it was upon a contract affecting her separate estate, and where the authority to contract exists there is no doubt that under the Code, a general or personal judgment may be given. But the difficulty which underlies the plaintiff’s case, and confronts him at every turn, is that the Revised Statutes of Ohio do not authorize married women to contract generally and personally. With a few exceptions her powers in this respect remain as at-the common law.</p>
