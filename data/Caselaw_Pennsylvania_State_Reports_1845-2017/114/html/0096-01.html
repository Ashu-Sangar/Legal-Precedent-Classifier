On April 3d, 1875, the councils of the city by ordinance directed the chief commissioner of highways to enter into a contract with a compe<a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>tent paver or pavers for the paving of Sixty-third street, between the points above named, with rubble pavement; and on May 6th, 1875, the contract was awarded to Messrs. Iiorter. This is the usual manner of proceeding to have a street paved in this city. The property owners agree to have the street paved under the directions of the department of highways, an ordinance is passed and the contract awarded. That the agreement is assigned, is unimportant; the property owners want the street paved and the public want a competent paver, all of which was obtained in this case. Testimony was given to show that Frederick was a quarryman and not a paver, that the Horters were skilled pavers, and that the stone used to carry out the contract was furnished by Frederick. The time for doing the work was extended by the Chief Commissioner of Highways to the year 1876, during which year the work was done. The power of the councils to order the paving of the street, the kind of material to be used, and to fix the price therefor, is no longer open to question: City <em>v. </em>Hays, 93 Pa.

Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bidwell <em>v. </em>The City of Pittsburg, 85 Pa. St. R., 412, and McKnight <em>v. </em>Same, Id., 273, I held that he was estopped, and ruled out his offers to prove that the property was rural and was not benefited by the paving. The facts were admitted by the replication, and on those facts the law is against the defendant. The agreement was for paving the street, to be done under the directions of the department of highways. It was assigned to the use plaintiffs, and they obtained the contract from the city and did the work. It would be a great injustice to permit the defendant to defeat their claim for payment on an objection of this kind, when he has, by writing, induced them to lay out their money and labor for the improvement of the street in front of his property. The plaintiffs had a right to rely on the writing, and <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>infer that the defendant would not set up this objection to their claim.</p>

It was opened and used, according to the testimony of the witnesses, more than twenty-one years before it was paved in 1876, and at one time there was a plank road on it. The defendant’s deed calls for it as a boundary, and so do other conveyances of propert} on that street made since 1854. Stronger evidence of dedication by matter <em>in pais </em>cannot be had: Schenley <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/36/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="36 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="992221" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0029-01">36 Pa.

The proof was convincing that the work was well done ; the defendant conceded that the stones were the best of rubble stone which could be obtained ; and the gravel produced in court satisfied the jury that it came up to the standard. Numerous witnesses owning property on that street testified that the paving was a good piece of work, that it had lasted eight years without requiring repairs ; and it was not without great effect that the plaintiffs showed that forty-three out of forty-six owners of property on the line of that street paid their bills without suit.

Noticing that the jurors were looking about at each other in an uneasy manner, I asked the foreman to send up the paper which he had in his hands. On examining it I could not find the figures on it which the foreman had given. It had on it the figures $1,658.59, being the principal of the plaintiff’s claim, but the figure 6 was written so that it resembled the figure 5. The jury were yet together ; they had not yet been discharged. I told them to look over the paper again and say whether we had the proper amount of the verdict. They again consulted in the court room, and then the foreman said that they found for the plaintiffs and assessed the damages at $2,470.98, principal and interest. It will be noticed that the jury had not been discharged nor separated ; the first rendering of the verdict by the foreman was self-contradictory and manifestly in<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>correct; the verdict was for the full amount of the claim, and yet the figures given were less than the principal of the claim; it was a plain mistake.

    <p class="summary" id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.6",120,[266,1072,1171,1338]],["BL_121.1",121,[161,389,1171,732]]]'>The defence is, that the property is rural, that is, that Sixty-third street is in a rural locality, that the paving of the street is a public improvement, not a local improvement, but simply intended for the general welfare of the entire city, and which ought to be charged to the general taxation fund and paid out of the city treasury, and not charged against the adjoining owners. Municipal assessment — that is the more proper term to use — municipal assessments, or claims for paving streets, are a species of taxation. Every property is liable in this city to be taxed once for paving in front of it; and once taxed for the paving it goes free afterwards for. all other expenses in the way of re-paving or paving anew. Keeping the streets in repair is a charge to the city generally, and after a man has once paid for having paving done, if the city repair the street, or if the city entirely re-pave it, she cannot charge it against the owner of the property, but must charge it to the general fund. But every city lot is liable to be assessed once for paving done in front of it. This rule, which authorizes the city to charge the assessment, or to assess the charge against the adjoining lot, does not, however, apply to rural or farm property, and therefore where the city projects an avenue through farm property which is not cut up into compact city lots, nor built upon as city lots, the property is not liable to be charged by the per foot front rule of assessment, to wit, $1.50 a foot. City councils have power to enact that a street shall be paved. That power is vested in councils by law. They shall determine the time when it shall be paved ; [they have a right to determine what kind of a pavement, the material to be used, and they have a right to fix an uniform price to be paid by all the owners]. These are powers vested in the city legislature or councils, and the property owners may petition for paving <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>or ask for another kind of pavement, but where the city authorities elect that a certain kind of pavement shall go down, all disputes as to the kind of pavement are at an end. The power is lodged by the people generally in councils. It is not wise to permit one jury to say what kind of pavement ought to have been put down, and for another jury to select another kind, but it shall be as councils shall select. When councils say that a certain kind of pavement shall be put down, then the adjoining properties become liable, unless the adjoining property is farm or rural property, and then it is not liable to be charged by the per front foot rule of assessment [and the property owner may prove that the property is rural, and therefore not liable, or he may prove that the work was not done at all, or he may prove that the price charged for the paving is more than the value thereof. These are the only defences to a municipal claim]. (Eighteenth assignment of error.)</p>

Now, if this defendant set up as a defence and produced evidence that the property was rural or farm property, you might have some doubt upon that question to solve. However, that question is taken out of case by the pleadings of the parties. [The city — the contractors —have for the sake of narrowing the issue down, admitted in the pleadings that this street is in a rural neighborhood, but they say the defendants are estopped from setting up that defence because they signed a petition for the paving- of the street. Well, gentlemen, if that answer is made out and proven to your satisfaction to be true, it is a legal answer to the objection that the street is rural. Now, Pepper’s signature to the petition for paving is admitted beyond any question whatever, and by all law and all justice he is estopped from setting up the defence that this street is a rural street, and that the paving was not a local benefit merely but a general one. A man cannot blow hot and blow cold. He cannot induce the city to have his street paved and have contractors take the contract and do the work, and all' the time reserve to himself the right to object to paying for the paving because the street is rural. Therefore, when Pepper signed that petition to have the street paved, he estopped himself from setting up the defence that this error.) street was a rural one]. (Fourteenth assignment of</p>

Now, gentlemen, upon that point there-has been a great deal of testimony — I do not propose to go over it all in detail. You have had the proof here that there were forty-six owners of property along the street, and of them forty-three paid their <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>bills. Of these owners a good many came before you and testified that the work done, as done, was a good job, and said that it has lasted ever since 1876 without any repairs being done upon it. The defence admitted that the stone is good rubble stone. No defence is made upon that score, and the only defence left is that the gravel used is not good, sharp gravel, and that not enough gravel was used as is required b,y the ordinance. You have had the gravel brought before you and it will go out with you — samples of it. You have had the testimony of witnesses who have examined it in various places. You have the testimony of other witnesses that, upon an average, it was of the depth required by the ordinance, and that the work as done was a good job, and lasted since without repair. Gentlemen, if the work was done by the contractors in substantial compliance with the ordinance of councils, the3 are entitled to recover. Instances here and there of a shallow depth of gravel would not defeat the right, unless they convince 3-ou that the whole work was not of the required depth, or unless the gravel supplied was not such gravel as is required for paving. If you find that there was a substantial compliance with the ordinance of councils, that plaintiffs dug out this street to the required depth, put in good gravel, put down good-stone and did a good job in compliance with the ordinance of councils, they are entitled to recover. [On the contrary, if yum are satisfied that the charge made for that work is greater than the value of the work, ymu may-, in that ease, allow the plaintiffs the value of the work. Upon this point, gentlemen, there is no evidence to show what proportion ought to be allowed on a bill of this kind for the depth of gravel furnished, there having been no estimate given you, and you nnty have some difficulty in finding what sum to allow where the proof is so meagre upon the point.]</p>

True, the sum first entered on the record ought to have been struck off; and the record may 3et be amended by order of the court.</p>

It appears that the street where the work was done is in West Philadelphia, a place not incorporated at the date of that Act, and consequently not within its operation: Craig <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20Pa.%20269" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="89 Pa. 269">89 Pa.

The contractor covenanted to do the work in accordance with all the ordinances and resolutions relating to paving, and the city covenanted to pa3r therefor' in assessment bills, except the intersections at cross streets, the cit3r to pa3r for such intersections in mone3'; said assessment bills to be taken without recourse to the city in the event of failure to collect an3’' part or the whole. The work was to be done under the direction and approval of the chief commissioner of highways. It was done b&gt;r August 1st, 1876, accepted, ever since possessed and enjoyed by the cifc3r, paid for according to the terms of the contract; and this action is to recover the tax on one of the property owners for his share of the cost of the improvement. There is no evidence of fraud or collusion by contractor or city official. For eight years no defect was seen in the work, and none was discovered until the digging of holes in search for it.</p>

The doctrine seems to be this: “ Where a thing is so far perfected as to answer the intended purpose, and it is <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>taken possession of and turned to that purpose b] the party for whom it was constructed, no mere imperfection or omission, which does not virtually affect its usefulness, can be interposed to prevent a recovery, subject to a deduction for damages, consequent upon the imperfection complained of. Of course, the indulgence is not to be so stretched as to cover fraud, gross negligence, or obstinate and wilful refusal to fulfil the whole engagement, or even a, voluntary and causeless abandonment of it: Danville Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Pomroy &amp; Colony, <a href="/pa/15/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="15 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="408767" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0151-01">15 Pa.

Contracts lawfully made at the dis-¡ cretion of the authorities, are binding upon the landowners, though injudiciously made; but the owners are entitled to have such contracts performed substantially in all things according to their terms, and the authorities have no power to dispense with such performance to the gain of the contractor and the loss of the property owners. If the . authorities are about to accept and pay under a contract, for what in substantial and important respects has not been performed, the property owners may have remedy to enjoin the wrongful payments: Schumm <em>v, </em>Seymour, 9 C. E. Green, 143. There, it was held that the remedy is in equity. But in this state, where by the laws and ordinances the contractor receives the assessment bills in payment from the city, and it turns out that his work was so defectively done as to be worthless, he has no just right to recover in an action against the property owner, and the latter is not precluded from the defense because he is not a nominal party to the contract. If the work was substantially done as contracted for, answers the intended purpose, but in some minor particulars which do not materially affect its usefulness the contractor failed, then the property owner may have deduction for such failure. This is not the case of a municipality contracting for a public improvement, accepting it, and making payment therefor absolutely, and afterwards itself collecting the assessments; and it.is unnecessary to consider whether in that case the property owner could allege defective work as a matter of defense against the tax.</p>

He cannot complain that the instructions permitted such deduction. His sixteenth point, namely, <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>“ If the jury find that the pavement, as laid by the contractors, was not done in substantial compliance with the ordinances of councils, either as to depth of gravel, the quality of the gravel, or the size of the stone, their verdict should be for the defendant,” ought to have been refused for the reason that evidence was wanting to warrant so finding. All he was entitled to, under the evidence, was á deduction from the contract price, if the jury found defects which lessened the value of the pavement. This, in case of such finding, they were explicitly instructed to make. The abstract proposition in answer to the sixteenth point, and the instruction as to the limit of defence against a municipal claim, were not in the least harmful to the defendant, for they limited recovery to the value of the work, and accorded with the instruction that if the jury were satisfied that the charge was greater than the value, they could allow only what the pavement was worth.</p>
