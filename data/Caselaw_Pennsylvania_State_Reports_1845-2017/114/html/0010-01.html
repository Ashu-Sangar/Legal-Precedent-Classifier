If the testimony is such that after a fair and impartial trial resulting in a verdict against the proponents of the alleged will, the trial judge, after a careful review of all the testimony, would feel constrained to set aside the verdict as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, it cannot be said that a dispute within the meaning of the Act has arisen. On the other hand, if the state of the evidence is such that the judge would not feel constrained to set aside the verdict, the dispute should be considered substantial, and an issue to determine it should be directed.</p>

Neither age, nor sickness, nor extreme distress, nor debility of body will affect the capacity to make a will, if sufficient intelligence remains. The failure of memory is not sufficient to create the incapacity, unless it be total, or extend to his immediate family or property. The want of recollection of names is one of the earliest symptons <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>.of the decay of the memory; but this failure may exist to a very great degree and yet the solid power of the understanding remain.</p>

At that time decedent was about eighty-one years of age, feeble in body, walking with a shuffling gait, and very slowly. He was an eccentric man : coarse and immodest in his manners and conversation, and dirty even to filthiness in his habits. He was never married. He had accumulated a large fortune ; his estate at the time of his death aggregated between $350,000 and $400,000. He was close in money matters, even with his dealings with the poor; .and yet he was not altogether devoid of kindly feelings, having lost heavily by endorsements for his friends whom he had been willing to help in that way. Among his other characteristics was one which for want of a better term may be called “ devilishness,” which manifested itself on one occasion in the girdling of a shade tree in front of the hotel where he boarded, and on others in using the napkins belonging to the hotel for water closet purposes, and on still others in using towels and the petticoats of the servant girls to kindle his fires. Pie would in the day time lie in his room, which was opposite the ladies’ parlor naked with his door open, and on one or two occasions he exposed himself in the same condition in broad day-light on the front balcony of the hotel, which was located on a busy thoroughfare.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b28-5" data-blocks='[["BL_28.6",28,[262,1566,1175,718]]]'>It is clear if there were nothing more in contestants’ case than what is stated above, that the case would fail through its inherent weakness. There is nothing in decedent’s age or physical condition to militate against his testamentary capacity. In Wilson <em>v. </em>Mitchell, <em>supra, </em>the will was sustained, although the testator was at the time of making it over one hundred years old, and"much more feeble in body than was the present decedent. As to the decedent’s eccentricity, as was said by Lowe US, J. in McMaster’s <em>v. </em>Blair, 5 Cas., 304: “An eccentric man is not intestable.” The same is true of a filthy or even a devilish man. It may well be, if up to within a reasonable time prior to making his will, the decedent had been neat and tidy in his person and surroundings, and free from all vagaries of conduct, and had then suddenly changed, that this would be a circumstance which might be of considerable weight in passing upon his mental capacity, but the evidence does not establish this.</p>

The contestants seem to have spent most of their strength in bringing out the details in reference to the decedent’s filthy habits. Many of these details are too disgusting for insertion here, nor is the insertion necessary. Some of these habits were the result of physical weakness; some were superinduced by faith in peculiar remedies which, whilst not universal, the evidence shows to be not uncommon. The habit of exposing his person may have sprung either from contempt for the conventionalities of society or from the spirit of devilishness above referred to. But whatever the explanation, nothing is more clear than that the mere existence of such habits and eccentricities is not inconsistent with the possession of a sound and disposing mind.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b29-6" data-blocks='[["BL_29.6",29,[151,989,1178,739]]]'>We-come next to consider the evidence adduced to show want of memory on the part of decedent. We have seen that decedent was a man of large wealth, and yet he frequently complained of being poor, from which it was argued that he did not have, in the language of Wilson <em>v. </em>Mitchell, a “full knowledge of the property he possessed.” But this we think is a <em>non sequitur. </em>The evidence discloses ample motive for these complaints of poverty without referring them to want of memory. As already stated the decedent had lost heavily by endorsements, and to say that he had lost all in this way, as he did sajq whilst it might not be sound morality, was a pretty effectual way to put a stop to future importunities. Besides, these complaints were mostly made when he was trying to drive a close bargain. But speculation is unnecessary, since the fact that decedent made a will at all, and especially such a will that he did make, is a conclusive answer to this part of contestants’ theory.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b29-7" data-blocks='[["BL_29.7",29,[152,1727,1179,692]],["BL_30.1",30,[274,394,1175,432]]]'>Nor do we think there is anything in the testimony of Mrs.. Seip and Mrs. Knauss, half sisters of decedent, to the effect that he did not recognize them on a certain occasion. It is more than probable that the want of recognition was feigned. Decedent had never exhibited an overpowering affection for these half sisters. Although living within easy distance from them he had not visited them, nor they him, for many years. He may have suspected that their sudden interest in him was with an eye to testamentary bounty, and may have pretended not to know them, in order to get rid of them. He did remember one of them in his will, and gave her $1, thus showing that lie had not forgotten her, at least. ■ Of the same inconsequential character is the testimony of A. B. Knauss, to show that decedent had forgotten his full brother Henry. It is altogether probable that this forgetfulness was feigned also, for .in his will he mentioned his brother, Henry, by name, and gives <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>his son a full share in his estate. The lapses of memory testified to by the Hottenstines, Hartzell, Danowsky and Dr. Nagle, are trifling in their character, and such as a man of decedent’s age and infirmity might easily fall into without impairing in the least his testamentary capacity. That decedent, who always retired very early and arose veiy early, should awaken before the night was far spent on two or three occasions and go to the dining room for his breakfast, looking wild, is more naturally attributable to temporary disturbances than to any permanent impairment of his mental faculties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b30-4" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[271,826,1176,1164]]]'>The testimony of Dr. Fetherolf is not of much importance. This testimony is relied upon chiefly because of his opinion given on a hypothetical case. The value of bis opinion is very much weakened by the cross-examination, but we think the opinion should be thrown out altogether, as was done in Wilson <em>v. </em>Mitchell, supra, because “in no just view of the evidence can such a case be found as he considered and passed upon.” The hypothetical case assumed that the decedent “imagined himself to be poor,” that he “did not recognize his relatives and friends;” that “he did not recognize his sisters, taking the younger of them to be the mother of the other; ” that “he had forgotten his brother Henry;” that “he bought things in the drug store and forgot to pay for them,” which was more than a year after the will was made; that “ he imagined a young lady had called on him,” and that “ he imagined himself j'oung,” etc. Upon a question of testamentary capacit37 these are very serious allegations, but the trouble is that they are <em>not facts </em>either proved or admitted. They are merely the contestants’ inferences, which we think unwarranted by the evidence. In this connection it may be noticed as a somewhat remarkable circumstance, that Dr. Fetherolf is the only one of contestants’ witnesses who offers an opinion that decedent was not competent to make a will. It is true that such opinions are not of much positive value outside of the facts on which they are based, but the usual practice is to give them in evidence, if favorable to the party calling the witnesses, and the failure to do so naturally excites suspicion.</p>

It is enough, as has been seen, if the testator is able to remember his “immediate famity,” if he has such, and that he has “an intelligent perception and understanding of the persons he desires shall be the recipients of his bounty.” That the decedent possessed such perception and understanding clearly appears from the will. He divides his whole estate into sixteen equal parts among the children of five of his brothers and sisters of the whole blood. Every one of these beneficiaries is described so that there is ■ not the slightest doubt as to who they are, although they were widely scattered, some living in Ohio, some in Illinois, one in Iowa, and the rest in different parts of this state.

This witness says that he wrote the will from written memoranda prepared by decedent himself, the witness doing nothing more than reduce these memoranda to form. Decedent called, upon witness alone and asked him to write his will. A time was appointed for the decedent to call again, and he did call again at the time appointed, when he received the will and took it away with him for examination. Having examined it decedent returned with it to the witness, pronounced the will all right, and asked the witness to make a copy of it, which was subsequently done.

He kept an account in two banks, drawing cheeks on each; he rented his houses and collected the rents; he signed, and acknowledged releases; he carried on law suits, in one of which as late as March 25th, 1881, he testified intelligently and without objection; he settled up his <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>own board bills, drawing up the receipts himself; he collected moneys other than rents due him, calculating the interest correctly; he kept up a running correspondence with his western agent, calling for statements from time to time. On May 10th, 1881, he contracted for a monument to mark his last resting place, which was subsequently erected and paid for by him, and in the summer of 1883 he subscribed $100, to be put at interest to keep his monument and cemetei’y plot in repair. He made no mistakes to his detriment and his light to control his affairs in his own way was disputed by no one. “ When,” says Lowrie, J., in Stevenson <em>v. </em>Stevenson, supra, “a decedent has been permitted to go through life attending to his own affairs, and. taking good care of his estate, it is too late, after he has made his will and died, for collaterals to discover that for six or eight jmars his mind had been under a cloud, and that it passed into total eclipse just at a moment of their disappointment.”</p>

The sole question is whether, upon the testimony presented by the respective parties, a serious dispute has arisen as to the testamentary capacity of the alleged testator; such a dispute as should be submitted to and passed upon by a jury. In rightly determining that question there is only one safe and reliable test. If the testimony is such that after a fair and impartial trial, resulting in a verdict against the proponents of the alleged will, the trial judge, after a careful review of all the testimony, would feel constrained to set aside the verdict as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, it cannot be said that a dispute, within the meaning of the Act, has arisen. On the other hand, if the state of the evidence is such that the judge would not feel constrained to set aside the verdict, the dispute should be considered substantial, and an issue to determine it should be directed. This simple and only safe test is supported alike by reason and authority: Graham’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/61/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="61 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="428586" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0043-01">61 Pa.

In the last cited case, the present chief justice says: “The issue is of right, under the 41st section, when the fact arising and in dispute is substantial and material to the inquiry, unless the whole evidence of the fact alleged be so doubtful and unsatisfactory, that a verdict against the validity of the will should not be permitted to stand.” In DeHaven's Appeal, supra, it is said we ought not to reverse a decree refusing an issue if the Court of Common Pleas, after trial, would have been bound to set aside a verdict against the will as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. “ Of what- use would it be if the case can be decided but one way.”</p>
