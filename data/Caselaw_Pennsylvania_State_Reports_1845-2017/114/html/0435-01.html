Between the 20th of April, 1874, and the issue of the bond in suit, the borough had incurred or created a large indebtedness of upwards of $9,000, and the bond in suit, with others, was issued by the alleged authority of the town council of the Borough to cover or fund said indebtedness. Prior to the issue of bonds the Burgess of the Borough filed in the court of Quarter Sessions of Butler county, a paper purporting to be a statement of the actual indebtedness of the borough, the last preceding assessed valuation of the taxable property, the amount of proposed increase of debt, the number and form of bonds, pursuant to the Act of 20th of April, 1874, which said statement did not give the real indebtedness of the borough, but an amount much below the real indebtedness. The indebtedness, $4,332,74, of the Borough as shown by the statement of the Burgess filed, all of which, except perhaps about $500, was created after the new Constitution took effect in January, 1874, and the passage of the Act of April 20, 1874, was more than two per cent, of $72,529, the last assessed valuation of the taxable property of said borough. Said indebtedness as above set forth was created without giving the electors of said borough an opportunity to vote thereon, or give their assent to such increase of indebtedness, as provided in the 3d section of the Act of April 20, 1874, and section eight of article nine, of the Constitution. After incurring this indebtedness without the approval of the electors of the borough, the town council, by resolution dated November 14th, 1874, determined to increase the indebtedness $744.29, and issue bonds to cover the entire indebtedness, including said increase, pursuant to which resolution the bond in suit, with others, was issued.</p>

This offer was rejected by the court, and we think rightly. The resolution of the town council and the Burgess used the exact words of the Act of Assembly. They were acting by its authority, and of course they meant as near as words can be made to mean, that they were not trying to fund an illegal debt, but only the debt allowed to be funded by the Act. The Burgess’ statement stated that it was the actual indebtedness; that is, as we understand the words, the real, true and legal indebtedness, as distinguished from an untrue, supposed or illegal indebtedness, which we suppose one which had been contracted in violatiqn of the Constitution and the Act of Assembly would have been, and which the Burgess is presumed to have rejected when he prepared the statement, as he is presumed to have done his duty.

We think, too, that it was proper for the defendants, by any competent proof, to establish the facts set forth in these several offers; the effect of the evidence was to deny the power of the municipality of Millerstown borough to issue the bonds, and if there was no power to issue them, they are of course utterly unwarranted and worthless in the hands of the holders. If, when the present constitution came into operation, the borough of Millerstown was, in point of fact, not indebted in any sum whatever, or, at all events, was not indebted in a sum exceeding $500, the indebtedness, which is conceded to have existed on the 20th November, 1874, was greatly in excess of the constitutional limit, and was for that reason in great part unauthorized by law; and, as the bond in suit is one of a series issued to fund that invalid debt, it could create no binding obligation'upon the borough of Millerstown.</p>

This was the very evil which the constitutional provision was intended to prevent. The municipal officers had no power to create such a debt, and they could not by any contrivance, whatever, bind the borough for payment of it. It is, of course, impossible to distinguish the valid from the invalid portion of the debt secured by the bonds; the transaction involved in the issue of the bonds is entire and indivisible, and, therefore, the whole is invalid: Felson’s Trustees <em>v. </em>Hines, 5 Barr, 452.</p>

The question then was not one of power, but rather the effect of the perversion of a lawful power, in the application of the bonds to an unlawful purpose. “ If the councils of the City of Cony,” says the court in that case, “had no power to issue the bonds in controversy, then, without regard to their form they would be as worthless as so much blank paper; and the operative legal principle here mentioned applies as well to a natural person and to a private corporation as to a municipality. If one receives the negotiable paper of another, purporting to have been executed by an agent, it is not enough to show that they came to hand in the regular course of business, and that the holder gave a valuable consideration for it, for this is of no avail, unless it be first shown that the alleged agent had authority to execute it.”</p>

It was apparent, from this record, that the indebtedness of this borough was greatly in excess of the amount allowed by law, unless that debt, or a great portion of it, existed when the provisions'of the present constitution attached, or was incurred with the assent of the electors, and there was certainly no legal presumption that either the one or the other of the facts existed.</p>
