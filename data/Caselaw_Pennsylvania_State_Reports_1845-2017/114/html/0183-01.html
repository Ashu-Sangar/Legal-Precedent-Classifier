J.: Thomas Patton, on February 6th, 1884, being indebted to Daniel Conn and others, the defendants in this ease, gave to Alfred J. Patton, in trust for his wife, Rebecca J. Patton, the plaintiff, his judgment note for $1,695. This note was entered of record in the Common Pleas of Juniata County, an execution issued thereon, and the personal and real estate of Thomas Patton sold. Daniel Conn and others had in the meantime obtained judgments and disputed the right of Rebecca J. Patton to the proceeds of the sales. 'To determine the validity of her judgment and her right to participate in the distribution of the funds arising from these sales, this issue was framed by the court.</p>

Thomas Patton was the administrator of his father-in-law. In his account as administrator, under advice of counsel, he claimed credit for the said $500 for the care and keeping of the decedent. His account was confirmed. He never paid this sum to his wife, but included it in the said judgment note. The note also included the amount due his <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>wife as her interest in the real estate of her father, which he had. received and never paid her.</p>

But if any person was entitled to receive these five hundred dollars, it was her husband, he being entitled under the law to the earnings of his wife, and he could not agree that his money should be received by his wife to the prejudice of his creditors, and it appearing in evidence that Mr. Conn was his creditor at that time, these $500 could not be considered as against him to belong to his wife, and therefore could not legally be included in her judgment against her husband. It is an axiom of the law that fraud taints and vitiates everything it touches ; the law does not stop to sift out the fraudulent sums included in a judgment and declare the remainder good; but as poison permeates the whole mass with which it is mixed and renders the whole poisonous, so a judgment cannot be fraudulent in part and good as to the remainder, and if it is knowingly confessed for more than is owing, with the intention of depriving other creditors of the means of receiving payment, the whole judgment becomes fraudulent '■and void. But, on the other hand, if the judgment is innocently confessed for more than is legally owing, either through mistake of calculation or from an honest belief that the wife was entitled to demand and receive what the law declares is not hers, then there would be error or mistake, but not fraud, in conferring the judgment; and no part of the judgment being fraudulent, the error or mistake might be corrected and the judgment reduced to its proper amount; just as if, in the tendered payment of a debt, counterfeit notes or coin have been innocently included in the aggregate amount, they may be separated and thrown out from the genuine money, and the actual payment reckoned according to the true remainder. If the jury, therefore, should find from all the evidence in the case, that this sum of $500 was fraudulently included in the judgment to prevent other creditors from collecting their claims, then the whole judgment in dispute, for the purpose of increasing the judgment, is fraudulent and your verdict should be for the defendants. But if you should find from the evidence that these $500 were included in the judgment through mistake, in the belief that the wife was honestly entitled to claim this money by reason of the agreement of the heirs, then the whole judgment would not, for that reason, be fraudulent and void, and the jury should consider the other items iucluded in it......As to the pro<a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>ceeds of the mill, if you are satisfied, that the wife was entitled to receive the proceeds of the mill, and the husband got the proceeds instead of paying it over to her, and is indebted to her in that amount, then that would be a proper subject to add.</p>
