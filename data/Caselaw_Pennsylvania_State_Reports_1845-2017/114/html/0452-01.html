But the proposition, considered with reference to the legal discretion of the court in such cases, is untenable. If it be so that the court has an arbitrary discretion to grant or refuse licenses, without limitation or control, then, as was well observed in a recent case by the president judge of the 28th judicial district, it is in the power of the fifty or sixty quarter sessions’ judges of the state, outside of the large cities, to practically abrogate the license laws entirely; to substitute in their place a prohibitory law or regulation of their own, and thereby set themselves up above the” only constitutional lawmaking power of the Commonwealth..,</p>

F. Smith, 200. In order to properly understand that case it is necessary to briefly outline the facts <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>as officially reported.- By special Act of May 10th, 1871, the Court of Quarter Sessions of Erie county was required to appoint annually a board of licensers, with the same authority to grant licenses as the Court of Quarter Sessions had. Sehlaudecker, among others, had filed his petition in due form for an eating-house license, and a proper bond, conditioned according to law. The board declined to grant the license. Schlaudecker then obtained a rule from the Court of Common Pleas on the board to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue to compel them to grant him a license. The board, in response to the-rule, showed, <em>inter alia, </em>that there were before them, at the time the}'- refused license to Schlaudecker, thirty-one applications for tavern license, eight for wholesale liquor license, and ninety-five for eating-house license; of which the board granted twenty-five tavern licenses, six wholesale liquor licenses, and thirtj'-nine eating-house licenses, and they say: “ Judging that they had granted a sufficient number of licenses in those different branches to accommodate the public and entertain strangers and travelers, the respondents did adjudicate upon said application (Schlaudecker’s, to wit), and refused the same.” The Court of Common Pleas, after hearing, discharged the rule and refused to grant the mandamus; and thereupon Schlaudecker sued out a writ of error. The opinion of the Supreme Court, affirming the action of the Common Pleas, was delivered on the 6th of January, 1873— the law being the same then as now in regard to the question of the discretion vested in the courts in regard to the granting and refusal of licenses — the Act of 1875 having, in my judgment, made no change in that respect.</p>

Courts sit to administer the law fairly as it is given to them, and not to make or repeal it.

The act of deciding is judicial and not arbitrary or wilful. The discretion vested in the court is, therefore, a sound judicial discretion, and to be a rightful judgment, it must be exercised in the particular case and upon the facts and circumstances before the court, after they have been heard and duly considered: in other words, to be exercised upon the merits of each case, according to the rule given by the Act of Assembly. To sa}r that I will grant no license to any oné, or that I will grant it to every one, is not to decide judicially on the merits of the case, but to determine beforehand without a hearing, or else to disregard what has been heard. It is to determine, not according to law, but outside of law, and it is not a legal judgment, but the exercise of an arbitrary will.”</p>

On the other hand it is objected that there is no necessity for a quart license in this borough, or in any other.part of the county; that the granting of such license will be productive of great and deplorable evils, and the court is asked by a very large number of citizens generally, and especially by ministers of the gospel,, represen ting nearly all the churches of the town, by the faculty of the College, by the representatives of the Female Seminary, by the members of the Washington Temperance League, and by others, to.reject this application and save the community from a flood of evils which will, as they believe, surely follow the granting of the license prayed for. All these classes are certainly entitled to be heard, and, in fact, their objections and remonstrances have received the most anxious and respectful consideration. But their reasons for remonstrance are, in my opinion, such as address themselves to the conscience and judgment of the legislature, rather than to the judicial discretion of the court. They furnish us with most weighty and convincing reasons why the existing state of the law in relation to quart licenses should be repealed; but, I regret to say, they do not, in my judgment, present any reason why, under the law as it now is, this license should not be granted. As the law now stands, it distinctly recognizes the right of the people to use intoxicating liquors as a beverage and for domestic uses. The same law provides, among other <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>things, for the granting of quart licenses to accommodate the public. There is at present no such license extant in tire county. More than half the voters resident in the town, and many in the vicinity, have signed petitions asking that such license be now granted. The applicant appears to be a proper person with whom to intrust such license, and. his papers are all in substantial compliance with the law. There is therefore, in law, no good reason why tlie court, in the exercise of a judicial — not arbitrary — discretion, should not direct the license to issue.</p>

L. 190, which provides that the Quarter Sessions of this county shall not be compelled to grant any tavern license “ unless satisfied that the granting of the same would be for •the good of the people and promote the public welfare.”- As this Act relates exclusively to tavern licenses, I am at a loss to perceive how, on any fair rule of interpretation, it can be construed so as to enlarge the discretion of the court in regard to the granting or refusing of quart licenses.</p>

It is evident that the intention of the legislature was to comply with a popular demand for a restriction of the whole license system. See Acts of 1866, pages 333, 337, 339, 5'60, 658, 679, 735 and 896; Acts of 1867, pages 40, 190, 226, 229, 372, 440, 591, 731, 740, 825, 893, 1178, 1288.. These various Acts show that the legislature was besieged with applications to restrict and abolish the license system. Washington county -was not behind in this movement. At page 190, P. L., 1867, we find an Act that declares that the Acts in force in regard to tavern licenses “ shall not be so construed as to compel the Court of Quarter Sessions of Washington county to grant any tavern license unless the court is satisfied that the granting of the same would be for the good of the people and promote the public welfare.” Under this Act the discretion vested in that court is wider than in any other court in the state. Now the same legislature, at page 226, passed the Act forbidding the treasurer of the county to issue quart licenses, and at page 893 passed an Act for Mercer county, transferring to the Quarter Sessions the power to grant quart licenses. It is evident that there was a misapprehension as to where the power lay, but it is manifest that it was the purpose of the Act, on page 226, to abolish quart licenses in Washington county.</p>

L. 40, imposes on the court the duty'of comparing the names and character of the signers of the' petitions for and against the license, and of refusing the license if the weight of names and character showed there was no necessity for the license. It is manifest that the legislature, instead of grasping the evil of intemperance, and passing the laws demanded by public sentiment, threw the burden on the Courts of Quarter Sessions, and on the people, requiring the courts to refuse license in all cases in which public sentiment, embodied in remonstrances, was against the granting of license, and denied the necessity of license in any particular application. The petitions for license assert its necessity; the petitions against license deny its necessity. The issue is’ made up and the .court decides the case, “ having due regard to the number and character of the petitioners for and against such application.” Did the court so decide in this case? It allowed the assertion of the petitioners that the license was necessary, to stand as verity, but imposed on the remonstrants the duty of giving good reasons for the denial of the necessity of the license, and none, in the opinion of the court, being given, the remonstrances were disregarded for that reason. The court says: “Buttheir reasons for remonstrance are, in my opinion, such as address themselves to the conscience and judgment of the legislature rather than to the judicial discretion of the court. They furnish us with most weighty and convincing reasons why the existing state of the law in relation to quart licenses should be repealed, but I regret to say, they do not, in my judgment, present any reason why, under the law as it now is, this license should not be granted.”</p>

Our complaint is that the court did not exercise its legal discretion under the Act of March 22d, 1867, by deciding the necessity of the license on the weight of names and character. If the Court had said, “ Having due regard to the number and character of the petitioners for and against this application, I am of the opinion that this license is necessary,” we could not complain. Not having done so, we ask this court to reverse the judgment of the court below for that reason, and because the special Act cited above forbids the granting of quart licenses in Washington county.</p>

The error into which counsel for appellants have fallen is, that the court must determine the necessity of the license from the number and character of the petitioners for and against the application alone. If the courts of the Commonwealth were bound down to this single method of determining the necessity for a license, then affidavits that a dozen similar places existed in the locality for which the license is asked could not be considered. The authority given the court to hear petitions in addition to that of the applicant, in favor of, and remonstrances against the application for license, certainly does not prevent the court from hearing and considering other evidence. The Act of 1875, 2 Pur.d Dig., page 1077, place 15, expressly provides that: “All persons applying or making objections to applications for licenses, may be heard by evidence, petition, remonstrance-or counsel.”</p>

The courts are authorized by this section to refuse applications for license where '‘such license is not necessary for thevaccommodation of the public and entertainment of strangers and travelers.” A quart license does not authorize sales of intoxicating liquors by the drink, and the place of sale is not a place for the entertainment of strangers and travelers.</p>

The court is to hear petitions in addition to that of the applicant in favor of, and remonstrances against the application for such license, and in all cases to refuse the same whenever, iu the opinion of the court, having due regard to the number and character of the petitioners for and against such application, such license is not necessary for the accommodation of the public, and entertainment of strangers-and travellers. In this we see, that the petitions and remonstrances are for the sole purpose of determining, without regard to the character of the applicant, whether such license is, or is not, a matter of public necessity. Furthermore, the legislature has prescribed the method by which this necessity shall be ascertained, that is, by the number and character of those petitioning for or against such application. We may also here call attention to the fact that the remonstrance, as well as the additional petition, must be special, not general; that is, for or against a single, or particular application, otherwise it may be disregarded. Iu the ease in hand the remonstrance conforms to the Act, so that no objection can be taken to it in that respect. But the Act does not require that either the petitioners or remonstrants should be voters; it is enough that they be citizens, whether male or female, hence, it is a mistake to pass over women, and count only voters. The Act is a valuable one if properly administered, but whether it was so administered in this case, we cannot determine. The petitions, pro and con, are not matters of record, but in the nature of evidence for the information of the conscience of the court, and, as a consequence, we cannot review them, or reverse the action of the judge of the Quarter Sessions on a <em>certiorari. </em>Moreover, as no appeal has been given, we have no power to take cognizance of the complaint of the appellants.</p>
