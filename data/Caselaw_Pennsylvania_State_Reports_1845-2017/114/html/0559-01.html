Little to saw the timber on the lauds. Little accordingly took possession of the tract and manufactured a large amount of lumber.

At the same time suit was brought by Little against Bindley, for the balance claimed to be due him on account of his services in sawing the lumber. To all these cases various defences were made by Bindley, arising out of the special circumstances of ea-ch case, and notice given by him of the Little suit to McLean. The result in the McLean case (the one out of which the present appeal arises) was a verdict for the plaintiff for $700. After the recovery of judgment in that case the suit of Little against Bindley was tried before a referee, resulting in an award against Bindley for $661.53. After the recovery of the latter judgment, Bindley filed his petition in the McLean case, setting forth the facts and avering that the amount of the Little judgment should be properly paid out of the money due McLean for the lumber, as it was a charge against said lumber and one for which a lien had existed in. favor of Little, which had been transferred to the purchase money by agreement of all parties. He subsequently <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>filed an affidavit averring that he had paid the Little judgment.

To avoid this difficulty it was agreed at bar by counsel to treat the case as if here upon a writ of error. We do not see that this helps the matter. , The order asked for, was a matter in the discretion of the court below, and it is at least doubtful whether we have any power to review it here. Were we to attempt to do so we would be without the information necessary to a proper disposition of the case. There is nothing before us but the petition and answer. The latter denies all the facts essential to sustain the equitable interference of the court. It would be a great stretch of power for any court to grant the prayer of this petition upon the facts as they are presented here. The plaintiff asks that the court below shall order a credit to be entered upon a certain judgment against him upon the ground that another judgment has-been recovered <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>against him which the plaintiff in the first judgment ought to pay, and that in the meantime execution shall be stayed upon said judgment. Yet this claim was a matter of defence which existed and might have been set up as a defence to the suit-of .McLean to use <em>v. </em>Bindley, 216, June 7th, 1881. When one man is sued for money which another man claims, there is always a way, if the proper means are taken at the proper time, to avoid having two judgments against him for the same debt. Here the judgment of Little et al. <em>v. </em>Bindley was entered upon the award of a referee, without exception or appeal. Neither McLean, nor the use plaintiff, agreed to this reference, nor does it appear that they had notice of it. That they should be now bound by it is a proposition which cannot be sustained for a moment.</p>
