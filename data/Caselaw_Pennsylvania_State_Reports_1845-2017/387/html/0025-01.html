The jury returned a verdict in favor of the minor plaintiff for $40,000 and for his parents in the sum of $10,-000. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial which was withdrawn and a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto which was dismissed by the ,court below.

The area where this accident occurred may be described as follows: On 67th Street between Elmwood Avenue on the south and Woodland Avenue on the north, in the City of Philadelphia, there is a bridge which goes over the defendant’s electrified four-track main line between New York and Washington, on which freight and passenger <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>tracks at this point run east and west. On the east side of 67th Street as one proceeds in a northerly direction towards the bridge the John Bartraxn High School is located. Immediately to the north of the school is a high cyclone fence owned and maintained by the Philadelphia Electric Company. This fence which runs up to the bridge, separates the school property from a strip of land, between 40 and 46 feet wide, owned by the electric company between 66th and 67th Streets on the Elmwood Street side of the railroad right-of-way, and runs up to the bridge. On the north side and below the electric company’s property is the railroad right-of-way which extends 50 feet, north and south, from the center line of the four tracks. For some time prior to the accident there had been a hole in the gate of the electric company’s fence and the gate, which is immediately adjacent to 67th Street, was sometimes left open. Just inside of the fence and opposite the gate is a 63 foot high tension tower owned by the Philadelphia Electric Company. On the steep banks leading down to the railroad tracks are hedges and undergrowth where, according to plaintiffs’ evidence, children frequently played. Immediately east and next to the abutment of the bridge is a concrete sluice leading partway down the embankment. Bridges for pedestrians and vehicles cross the tracks overhead at 71st, 70th, 67th, 65th, 63rd and 62nd Streets, and a foot bridge crosses at 66th Street. On both sides and on the street level of the 67th Street bridge are high, solid sheet metal fences which appellees admit in their brief made it impossible for anyone to reach the railroad’s electrified, catenary wires running underneath the bridge. On these metal fences are signs that say “danger, live wire, keep off”. From 160 to 200 passenger and freight trains — one every nine minutes — daily pass in both directions on the rail<a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>road’s tracks at this point at speeds np to 75 miles per hour. The two northernmost tracks are used for trains proceeding toward Washington, while the two southernmost tracks are lor trains moving toward the center of Philadelphia. Train movements in this area are controlled by defendant’s signal tower operator at Brill Tower in the vicinity of 81st Street. Because of train movements in and out of the Grays Ferry yard area which is to the east of Brill Tower, trains on the second track going toward Philadelphia are sometimes stopped at the signal bridge near 62nd Street. Evidence adduced by plaintiffs showed that when and how long trains might be stopped in transit by the Brill Tower operator was unpredictable and depended on conditions as they arose. During the month immediately preceding the accident the train in question, known as ME-2, passed under the 67th Street bridge practically daily and was delayed six times for periods-of 8, 11, 14, 17, 44 and 59 minutes.</p>

They walked north on 67th Street until reaching the 67th Street bridge where they climbed through the hole in the electric company’s gate and played around the hedges and the concrete sluice for approximately one-half an hour which, according to their testimony, they had done on a number of occasions before. A long freight train, ME-2, consisting of 61 cars and extending about three-fifths of a mile in length, was standing on the second track. The minor plaintiff could not see either end of it from where he was standing at the foot of the 67th Street bridge. This freight train was temporarily stopped because of train movements ahead for approximately 44 minutes. De<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>siring to cross tbe tracks so as to continue on to tbe movies, tbe minor plaintiff crossed over tbe first track and climbed up tbe side ladder of one of tbe boxcars located one or two car lengths east of tbe bridge.

This section of the Restatement supersedes and supplants the doctrine of “attractive nuisance” and the “playground rule”: <em>Thompson et al. v. Reading Company, </em><a href="/pa/343/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="343 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="1208371" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0585-01">343 Pa. 585</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20729" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 A.2d 729">23 A. 2d 729</a>; <em>McGill et al. v.

The issue here is whether the evidence presented by the plaintiffs at the trial brings the case within §339. We think it does not.</p>

      <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>Section 339 provides: “A possessor of land is subject to liability for bodily harm to young children trespassing thereon caused by a structure or other artificial condition which he maintains upon the land, if (a) the place where the condition is maintained is one upon which the possessor imows or should know that such children are likely to trespass, and (b) the condition is one of which the possessor knows or should know and which he realizes or should realize as involving an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children, and (c) the children because of their youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling in it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and (d) the utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition is slight as compared to the risk to young children involved therein.”. The Restatement thus lays down four requirements, all of which must be met before a possessor of land is liable for injuries to trespassing children : <em>Verrichia v. Society Di M. S.

The public interest in the possessor’s free use of his land for his own purposes is of great importance. A particular condition is, therefore, regarded as not involving unreasonable risk to trespassing children unless it involves a grave risk to them which would be obviated <em>without any serious interference with the </em>possessor’s <em>legitimate use of his land. </em>...”. (Emphasis supplied). In Prosser on Torts, supra, it is said at p. 624: “The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition must be slight as compared with the risk to children involved. Here, as elsewhere, negligence is to be determined by weighing the probability and the gravity of the possible harm against the utility of the defendant’s conduct. The public interest in the free use of land is such that, in general, he will not be required to take precautions which are so burdensome or expensive as to be unreasonable in the light of the risk, or to make his premises ‘child-proof.’ Such things as standing freight cars and moving vehicles are undeniably attractive to children, but are socially useful and very difficult to safeguard, and so may call for very little in the way of care. . .</p>

In all of the cases where recovery has been allowed, we have stressed the necessity of proving that the danger could be eliminated at moderate cost and effort on the part of the defendant. In every one of these cases, the hazard which caused injury to the child was confined to a small fixed location and could have been eliminated with little effort. In <em>Thompson et al. v. Reading Company, </em>supra, where an 8-year old boy was injured on a rail<a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>road turntable, the accident could have been prevented by a simple locking device which was on the turntable but had been broken for a long time.

The cost of such precautions in the course of a four-day demolition job was obviously inconsequential. In <em>Bartleson et al. v. Glen Alden Coal Company et al., </em>supra, on which plaintiffs principally rely, we allowed recovery where an 11-year old boy climbed upon a stationary tower and came in contact <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>■with a high tension wire.

He admits that the 67th Street bridge was properly constructed so that it was impossible to gain access to the electric wires running over the tracks from the street level of the bridge. It is also not contended that the uninsulated wires, necessary for the electrical operation of defendant’s trains, could or should have been insulated. Plaintiffs maintain that the defendant was under a duty to fence in the right-of-way at the 67th Street bridge, or else to see that the electric company’s fence was maintained in good condition. However, it is so well settled in this State as to admit of no argument, that it is not obligatory on the part of the railroad to fence its right-of-way to prevent trespassing by children: <em>Malischewski et al. v. Pennsylvania Railroad Comyany et al., </em><a href="/pa/356/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="356 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="470727" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0554-01">356 Pa. 554</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20A.2d%20215" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="52 A.2d 215">52 A. 2d 215</a>; and cases cited therein. In addition it should be noted that on the north side of the tracks between 67th Street and 66th Street, practically the entire block gave easy access to the railroad and of course this would also have to be fenced to prevent children from playing in the area. Moreover the plaintiffs’ evidence in the instant case amply shows not only that children played at the base of the 67th Street bridge, but also that they played in many other areas along this right-of-way. One of plaintiffs’ witnesses, a Mr. Brower who <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>was a former locomotive engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad, testified that he had often seen children playing beside the right-of-way and on the railroad cars -all along his entire run which was from New York to Washington and return, and in the Philadelphia area he specifically mentioned 39th, 49th, 50th, 59th, 67th, 71st and 72nd Streets in Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Within a 30-mile radius of Philadelphia, the defendant has 275 miles of electrified main tracks. Although the plaintiffs are interested only in the railroad right-of-way at 67th Street, if the present argument should prevail, it would apply to any spot along the tracks at which children frequently played. What the plaintiffs are saying is that in any area along the railroad property which children frequent, the defendant must make it impossible to reach its tracks either by the erection of child-proof fences of its own or by making certain that the fences of others are sufficient and maintained in good condition. Clause (d) of §339 imposes liability where the owner of the premises, the other conditions being present, could eliminate the dangerous condition at no great expense and with little interference with the use of the land. It is, of course, obvious that if there were imposed upon the defendant the requirement of fencing the place where this accident occurred, <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>it would likewise be subject to tbe duty of fencing tbe innumerable places along its many miles of tracks frequented by trespassing children, to prevent them from clambering over cars of a train halted in transit. The same is true of plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant should patrol up and down the length of a train, temporarily halted at an unpredictable point, to protect against children who might happen to climb upon one of its cars. Railroad passenger and freight trains are frequently quite long and they would have to be manned by a score of employes simply to patrol the train while it was thus temporarily standing. Patently the ordinary train crew, aside from their duties in connection with the train’s operation, could not effectively perform such function. It would be hopelessly impracticable to employ sufficient guards to police every car on a train which the safety of railroad operations re-' quired to be stopped in transit.</p>

In this area boys had dug caves and tunnels and, in the spirit of imaginative adventure, which makes childhood an infinity of delight, they had named the place “The Jungle.” Here they played the usual boyhood games of “hide-and-seek” and “cowboys,” adding in the exhilaration of phantasy, another one which they called “explorers.” <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>A concrete sluice, built to drain off water from the bridge abutment, and sloping down the embankment to the railroad tracks, served the young explorers as a toboggan slide which carried them to the very edge of the railroad right-of-way which was occupied by four tracks.</p>

Five steps away from the end of this exciting journey the box cars, with their welcoming ladders, beckoned to fresh adventure.

As Ms brother Harry prepared to follow up the ladder, Daniel called out, warning him that when he got to the top of the car, he was not to “fool around the wires.” With this admonition Daniel pointed to the wire to make his point clear. Suddenly the jolting force of 11,000 volts arcked through the atmosphere and struck Daniel, toppling him to the ground. Although no part of Daniel’s body had actually come into contact with the wire, the burns inflicted were of such a character that he lost an arm and suffered other serious injuries.

The railroad was thus charged with the knowledge that boys might climb over the halted cars as they had been doing for years in the past. Why did the railroad company not do something to prevent this dangerous practice? Daniel Dugan was not the first person injured by the catenary wires in this vicinity. Sergeant Elijah L.

It knew that boys had been mounting box cars; it knew of the catenary wire. Was it too much to expect that in ascending to the top of the cars, boys might come within range of the deadly current overhead? If the railroad had placed ladders under the wires would it be an unwarranted assumption that eager and spirited boys would climb the ladders? In the case of <em>Bartleson v.

At the height of 15 feet he was hit by the shock of a 4000-volt wire. In order to get to the tower young Ross Bartleson had to enter into a fenced enclosure 7 feet high, the gate of which had been left open. In the suit for damages against the owner of the land, the defendant argued that the dangerous wire was not on the ground and thus not within the foreseeable orbit of danger. This Court said, however: “There is no rule which requires that the dangerous condition must be on the ground or within reach of a minor. Such a distinction <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>is artificial, without logic or experience to support it. What this distinction really drives at is the question of whether or not a defendant shall be held reasonable to anticipate that a child will bring himself within the orbit of the danger. . . The act of climbing was not unusual, on previous days other boys had done precisely the same thing. The tower was equipped with pegs or studs intended to facilitate climbing. These pegs were accessible from the ground. It is strange that defendant would argue that he could not anticipate the use of these pegs for precisely the purpose for which they were put there.”</p>

Matthew A. Duffy, Inspector of Electric Transmission for the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Pennsylvania Railroad, testified that it was necessary for him to teach his own men about the “arcing” propensities of tension wires.

For years without objective disapproval children had played games within 20 to 400 feet of the tower; for years adults and children alike had used pathways carrying them past and within a few feet of the tower. In view of the overwhelming character of the testimony the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant coal company, through its agents, actually knew that children played in the vicinity of its tower. ‘Toleration of trespass for sufficient time gives rise to privilege which adds to the duties of the occupier in the maintenance and use of his premises’.”</p>

We reversed: “. . . in view of the use of the ground surrounding the enclosure as a playground, defendant was bound to recognize the fact that children in their play might heedlessly act in a way tending to result in personal injury and that childish curiosity in all probability might lead them to investigate the nature of the mechanism within the enclosure and under such circumstances there was imposed upon defendant the duty to anticipate and guard against such acts. It does not help defendant to say the main attraction on the lot was not the transformer but the old wagon standing near by. The latter was separated from the enclosure by a distance of but fifteen or twenty feet. If children played about the wagon it is but natural they would also, in the course of their play, pass around or into the small building and enclosure and probably climb upon, through or over the fence, whichever their fancy should dictate.

The clause makes no-mention of expense. Of course, the “condition,” which is the subject of controversy here is not the movement of the train, which naturally is of great consequence. The “condition” is the stoppage of the train <em>without </em>taking measures to keep the children off it. Obviously the fact of not warning the children has no utilitarian <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>value to the railroad company at all.

On the day of the accident a train with a crew of five men stopped within the playground known as “The Willows.” Not one of the crew descended from the train to warn children not to board the train although the crew knew, or should have known, that for eighteen years children had been doing this. The minor plaintiff, seven-year-old Frank Scibelli boarded one of the cars and when it jerked he was thrown under the wheels, losing a leg. It was the contention of the plaintiff that the accident would have been avoided if one of the crew or anyone representing the railroad had exercised supervisory protection around the train when it stopped within the playground. The Majority of this Court, using the same type of reasoning that it is employing in this case, said that there was no duty on the part of the railroad “to patrol its tracks or police its trains with a sufficient number of guards to prevent children from attempting to board them.” Here again we have that sophistry in argument which make of a limited proposition an assertion of universal application. The playground in the <em>Scibelli </em>case was only one block long,- — 375 feet. But, in answering the plaintiff’s position that the rail<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>road should patrol the fragmentary distance of 375 feet for a matter of minutes, perhaps only seconds — when the train momentarily stopped in the playground — this Court answered that there was no obligation on the part of the railroad to patrol the whole length of the railroad and to have police guards on every train!</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[260,707,1147,657]]]'>This is not the place for a reargument in the <em>Scibelli </em>case. I gave my views on the matter at the time the Majority Opinion was filed, but I would not want the mere citation of the Scibelli judgment to be interpreted (insofar as I can voice objection to it) as one worthy of being regarded as a precedent. I regard the injustice of the <em>Scibelli </em>decision as one of the dark pages in the history of the development of the rights of children and I believe that some day this Court will repudiate it. However, until that day comes I can only look upon it with a depressed spirit and an intellectual abhorrence.</p>

Progress would be a melancholy phenomenon if it were to be made at the expense of the well-being of children. While it is important that railroads run, it is more important that they run to serve mankind. Of course, railroads cannot be mulcted in damages without law. No railroad could possibly exist if it were enough merely to <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>charge it with negligence in order to require it to disburse large sums of money. On the other hand, it cannot be successfully argued that because railroads supply an indispensable service to civilization’s needs, they are immune from the laws of liability which govern every other type of commercial venture.</p>
    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[170,720,1149,1456]]]'>The argument that the railroad’s exchequer takes precedence over the value of human life runs counter to everything that has been advocated and done in America in the way of social and economic progress. In every progressive step of the laws of safety, the protest of those who have opposed has often been the cost for the installation and maintenance of the innovation. But we have seen how safety and greater appreciation of the precious commodity of existence advances, notwithstanding. When a dangerous curve wrecks a train, railroad architects and civil engineers consider at once ways of straightening out the track so as to avoid future wrecks. When a hillside caves in, burying a train and its passengers beneath an avalanche of death and crippling injuries, the mountain is trussed up with bands of steel and fortified with masonry. When a flood washes a train into a swollen river the tracks are raised and future inundations balked. Tunnels are bored through mountain sides, interlocking systems are developed, bridges are thrown across chasms and ravines, all at huge expenditures of money, and all for safety, all for progress, and eventually for greater profit to the railroads too, because no railroad can hope to become successful if its tracks are strewn with the skeletons and limbs of victims of brutal indifference to humanity.</p>

It has been made necessary because of the Majority’s <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>assumption that clause (d) under Section 339 of the Bestatement, Torts, absolves railroads from responsibility for negligence if it can be shown that it will cost them money to remedy a situation which sounds its own alarm calling for repair. The law of Pennsylvania proclaims in terse and clear terms the theme on which I have just expatiated, perhaps at too great a length. In the ease of <em>Hawk v. P. R.R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/307/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="307 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1138208" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0214-01">307 Pa. 214</a>, this Court, quoting from 20 R.C.L., page 25, sec. 18, said: “When human life is at stake, the rule of due care and diligence requires everything that give reasonable promise of its preservation to be done, regardless of difficulties or <em>expense”.</em>
