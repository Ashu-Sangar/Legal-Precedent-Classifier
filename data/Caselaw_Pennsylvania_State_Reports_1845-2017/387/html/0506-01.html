The complaint filed April 28, 1954, alleges that the defendant illegally holds that office, because at a municipal election held in Philadelphia on November 3, 1953, Francis D. Pastorius, the Republican Party’s candidate for the office of City Treasurer, received the highest number of votes and was duly elected for a four year term beginning January 4, 1954.</p>

This change by ordinance in the office of City Treasurer from an elective to an appointive office was made shortly before the municipal election, and the appointment of the defendant was just prior to the beginning of the new term for which the plaintiff claims he was elected. . . . The validity of the City Ordinance is in dispute.</p>

He did not, however, withdraw his name of record, it having then been represented to the Court that the Attorney General desired to see justice done. In effect, we understand the position of the present Attorney General to be that he would take no further action in this matter, nor would he further prosecute the case in any respect.</p>

The Act (of 1953) then specifically authorized City Council “to legislate with respect to the election, appointment, compensation, organization, abolition . . . powers, functions and duties of the Coroner, Recorder of Deeds, City Treasurer, Clerk of the Court . . . and the Board of Inspectors of the Philadelphia County Prison. . . .” Under and pursuant to that Act of the General Assembly, City Council has abolished and reorganized all of the aforesaid offices except clerk of <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>the Court.’ Our Chief Justice [Horace Stern], at page 382, clearly expressed the view that the Legislature had authority by the Act of 1953 to delegate to the Council of the City of Philadelphia the power to abolish the offices specified in that statute. Our learned Chief Justice in his concurring opinion said: ‘After the adoption of the Amendment (Article XIV, Section 8) the General Assembly could have provided for the abolition, merging, or regrouping of former county offices within the municipal governmental structure in either one of two ways; it could have itself legislated directly on the subject, or it could have authorized the Council of the City of Philadelphia to do so. It chose to adopt the latter method, and, by the Act of August 26, 1953, P. L. 1476, it vested the Council with “full powers to legislate with respect to the election, appointment, compensation, organization, abolition, merger, consolidation, powers, functions and duties” of several of the former county offices, but it withheld such grant of power in the case of the Sheriff, the City Commissioners, the Board of Revision of Taxes, and the Registration Commission. <em>The vesting in the Council of the power with respect to the other offices was clearly </em>valid/ (Parenthesis and emphasis supplied) It is our view, then, that the Legislature was acting within its province in delegating to the Council of the City of Philadelphia the power to abolish the office of City Treasurer and the other offices specified in the Act of 1953. It follows, therefore, that the Ordinance of the Council dated October 16, 1953, was valid, and that the defendant was legally appointed in accordance with the provisions of that ordinance.</p>
