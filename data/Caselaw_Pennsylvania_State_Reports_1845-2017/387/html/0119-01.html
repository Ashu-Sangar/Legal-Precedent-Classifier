Mr. King took out his large bunch of keys and exhibited them, and then said “Ruby, you have almost as many as I do”, and after saying that he had a key to the cottage, one for the box, one for the apartment and that he could name them all, he compared his keys with Ruby’s and said that she had a key to the safe deposit box which was on her chain.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a>

      <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.6",160,[292,1593,1145,172]]]'> Chief Justice Steen dissented on the ground that the acknowledgment of the receipt of the keys to the safe deposit box constituted a delivery of them by the bank to the lessees and that consequently aU the requisites of a gift inter vivos were complied with.</p>
      <p id="b160-6" data-blocks='[["BL_160.7",160,[287,1781,1151,546]]]'>Justice Bell and Justice Musmanno dissented not only for the reason given by Chief Justice Steen, but also for the more important reason that the signature card executed by all the parties constituted a <em>contract </em>which by its clear and specific terms, immediately created a present joint ownership of the contents of the box. If this view prevailed, the instant case is a contract case, not a so-called gift case, and must be governed by the principles of contract law. Under such principles no delivery of a key is necessary, and King’s executrix has <em>utterly </em>failed to upset the written contract which immediately vested in Harry C. King, and his wife, Ruby T. King, the joint ownership of the contents of the safe deposit box with right of survivorship thereto.</p>
