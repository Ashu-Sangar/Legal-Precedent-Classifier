At approximately 5:40 P.M. he received a telephone call from his father and returned to the station within two minutes. Arriving at the station he observed his father standing at a doorway wiping blood from his face; that “His right eye was protruding out of his head”; that blood was coming from the back of his head; that there was blood in various parts of the station; that a jack handle, normally kept some distance away, was found near a pool of blood in another part of the room; and that all money had been taken from the cash register. In the course of his examination he also testified that upon arriving he “Immediately . . . saiv he [decedent] was beaten up” and that decedent told him “he was robbed.”</p>

Specifically, he would have this Court declare there was grave doubt that a felonious homicide did occur, likening the case to <em>Commonwealth v. New, </em><a href="/pa/354/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="354 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="467421" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0188-01">354 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.2d%20450" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="47 A.2d 450">47 A. 2d 450</a>. But the basis for the Court’s decision in the cited case does not exist here. As quoted by appellant at page 198, we there declared: “Furthermore, if he [defendant] was with Lee Joe Avhen he Avas killed, that fact alone is not sufficient to convict him of Lee Joe’s murder <em>unless there was evidence that no one else was with Lee Joe at that time.” </em>(Italics supplied). Here, the proof was that within a very few moments of the occurrence, decedent and defendant Avere the only persons in the station. One Commonwealth witness testified that they Avere the only ones in the station when he left to drive to his home five blocks aAvay, where he arrived at 5:45 P.M. With the call from decedent to Ms son established at 5:40 P.M., and with defendant’s admission that no one else Avas in the station after the witness left, and that the injuries Avere sustained when defendant was alone with the decedent, the evidence was clearly sufficient. “The requirement of the law is that in order to warrant a conAdction the facts and circumstances proved must be of such character as to produce a moral certainty of the guilt of the accused beyond any reasonable <em>doubt </em>— not <em>that they need be absolutely incompatible with his innocence </em>— and <em>that doubt is for the jury unless the evidence ‘be so weak and inconclusive that as a matter of law no probability of fact can be drawn. from the combined circumstances’.”: Commonwealth v.

The evidence was that they were not caused by “a sharp instrument”; that they could have been caused by a “blunt instrument”; and that the force ivas “such as one that might occur in a fall from a <em>great height and landing or falling on the head; </em>or in an automobile accident . . . sustained when the automobile had been moving at a rapid rate of speed and came up against a solid force”; that these injuries resulted from “two impacts”; that decedent “couldn’t, from standing on the ground, do that much damage to his brain and skull” by falling. The medical examiner distinctly ruled out a fall as the cause. It is to be noted also, that the opinion of the doctor was based upon full examination of the decedent, not upon any hypothetical statement of facts, and was proper: <em>Commonwealth v.

The court committed no abuse of discretion; and having admonished the jury to disregard it, “it must be taken for granted that the jury obeys the instruction and that [if it was error] . . . was harmless error”: <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Fugmann, <a href="/pa/330/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="330 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="1183024" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0004-01">330 Pa. 4</a>, 17, 18, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%2099" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="198 A. 99">198 A. 99</a>.</p>

Defendant apparently objects only to the word “robbed” in that it was a “conclusion or an opinion.” We cannot find it objectionable that the word used was “robbed” rather “burglarized.” The declaration was that of one not learned in the law, and could not have been misunderstood, in its effect, by the jury. It came spontaneously from decedent’s lips under the shock and excitement of inflicted violence impelling its utterance, and so soon thereafter as not to break the continuity of events, and was therefore admissible. See <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Edwards, <a href="/pa/380/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="380 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1256083" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0052-01">380 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.2d%20216" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="110 A.2d 216">110 A. 2d 216</a>.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[234,1478,1150,832]]]'>The court correctly refused to strike the son’s testimony regarding the changed position of the jack handle. Defendant’s contention is based upon the assertion that there was no proof the jack handle was actually used in the assault. However, it was an element to be considered by the jury under proper instructions. • The court did charge the jury that “No blunt instrument was found . . . There was a jack handle there upon the floor, but [the Commonwealth witness] . . . frankly admitted <em>there was nothing upon it that-would indicate in any way’ it had been </em>used, <em>if blows- were aeiiidlly struck </em>... ; it is true, If there was such blunt instrument used, the defendant had an opportunity to discard it.” (Italics supplied). This was a more favorable disposition than defendant had a right to expect.</p>

      <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>Defendant complained that the court erred in sustaining Commonwealth’s objection to the examination of his medical expert in seeking to elicit from him a declaration that the injury to the front of the skull could have been caused by a fall. The court’s action was based on the ground that there had been no competent testimony that decedent had fallen. But, after defendant testified to a fall, the doctor was permitted to testify fully as to the cause, and declared that the injury could have so resulted. The question is one merely of order of proof; and defendant was in no wise prejudiced. His contention that he was forced into taking the stand by virtue of the ruling is quite tenuous, to say the least. It was not a circumstance to “force” such action on his part, particularly in view of the evidence then before the jury. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Neill, </em><a href="/pa/362/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="362 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="477351" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0507-01">362 Pa. 507</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20276" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="67 A.2d 276">67 A. 2d 276</a>.</p>

We first have to have the defendant’s sworn testimony to the fact that there was a fall.” Defendant now contends that such colloquy was reversible error, although no objection was made at trial. The court did not, as contended, “comment in the presence of the jury upon defendant’s right to testify,” but was merely explaining the basis of objection and the means by which the testimony could be made competent. Thereafter the witness was withdrawn and the defendant voluntarily took the stand. There was no error in this. <em>Cf. Johnson v. The </em>

    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[236,697,1145,491]]]'>Lastly, defendant assigns as error that the court failed “to more fully charge the jury as to all possible verdicts after the jury interrupted its deliberation to ask the court a question relating to defendant’s sentence”. It is to be noted that no attack, in this regard, can be made upon the full charge of the court. All possible verdicts had been fully and clearly explained and admitted to the jury. Defendant’s contention arises from the following:</p>
