Mortensen, the President and Trust Officer of the First National Bank of Greenville, the persons to whom she wanted to leave her estate and the exact amount she wanted each legatee to receive. The Will was prepared by Mr. Dilley in accordance with her instructions; it was witnessed by Mr. Dilley and by Dr. Gilbert H. Diehl, who had been the decedent’s physician since she came to Greenville in March, 1953. Before she signed her Will each paragraph was read to her and she expressed definitely and unequivocally her approval of each bequest. They testified that she was mentally alert and knew and understood exactly what she wanted. The trial Judge characterized Dr. Diehl, Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Dilley as “three gentlemen of unquestioned integrity”.</p>

It is unfortunate that she did not leave anything to Toten, Talbott and Ramsey, but as people grow older, their appreciation of prior acts of friendship and help, often wanes.

He had discussed with Mrs. Thompson the <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>question of an additional witness. Dilley considered that Mortensen should not be a witness because his bank would have an interest in the Will and the Stitts should not be because they were named as residuary legatees. So Dilley took with him Dr. Gilbert H. Diehl, a reputable physician who was and had been since March 9, 1953, Mrs. Thompson’s physician. When Dilley and Dr. Diehl arrived they had some pleasant conversation and the Stitts withdrew from the room into the back yard. Dr. Diehl then made a physical examination of Mrs. Thompson, which took approximately ten or fifteen minutes. After that Dilley read the Will to Mrs. Thompson, paragraph by paragraph, and explained and discussed it with her, in order to make certain that it was precisely what she wanted and had directed. She specifically approved every gift; several she commented on or discussed. For example, she said that $5. was all she wanted to give Margaret; “that she wasn’t interested in Margaret having anything, but she would give her Five Dollars, just to name her in her Will.” In connection with the bequest to St. Paul’s Childrens’ Home, Mrs. Thompson mentioned the work that the Home was doing. She also said something about Reverend Shoemaker, who was pastor of the Zion Evangelical and Reformed Church. She made no mention of the gift to the Masonic Home except to say that that was what she wanted to give them. She again repeated that Clara and Mont had looked after and taken good care of her and they were the ones she wanted to have everything that was left of her estate. She mentioned again that she had stocks, bonds and securities in the Bank at Sharon and real estate in Sharon, but she did not know exactly what she did have because she hadn’t received a statement from Mr. Bieber for some time. She also said she wanted Mr. Mortensen of the First <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>National Bank to look after her estate; she no longer wanted Mr. Bieber or the Bank in Sharon to look after her affairs because she did not like some of the things they had done in connection with her business. “. . . she referred to their failure to give her an accounting when she wanted it”; and she apparently had some grudge against them that caused her to change to the First National Bank. She mentioned that she had had a son and that she had had prior wills. In reply to a specific question, she said she understood that this was her last Will and that it contained exactly what she wanted to be done with her estate. She signed her name but because her hand shook, her signature was not very legible so she made a mark. After she signed the Will with her signature and a mark, Dr. Diehl and Dilley witnessed it. After the Will had been signed the Stitts were invited back to the house. Dilley took the Will with him and kept it in his safe until after Mrs. Thompson’s death. <em>The Will was never discussed in the presence of the Stitts nor were they ever informed of the provisions of the Will until after Mrs. Thompson’s death.</em>

She did not have control of her bowels or her urine and she wanted to sleep in the daytime and stay up most of the night. After a month or two of care in the Stitt home she responded quite well, as (he said) many older people do when they are given good care, good proper food and certain medicines. “She regained control of her bladder and bowels, and became mentally alert again, and was able to get around the house”. The doctor gave a number of reasons for Mrs. Thompson’s prior confusion, including high blood pressure, narcotics and shock treatments. Dr. Diehl saw Mrs. Thompson several times during March, April, May, June, September, October and December, 1953, and January 1954. After a couple of months, Mrs. Thompson was much improved mentally and physically, and joked a lot with Dr. Diehl. He further testified that <em>“her mental condition had become quite normal </em>early in May or June that year, and that, in October, it was very good for her age group, and I felt she knew exactly what she was doing and who she was, and where she was, and that <em>all her mental capacity had </em>returned.” He attended her until her death on January 21, 1954, which was caused by a cerebral thrombosis on January 10, 1954.</p>

He testified that Dilley read each part of the Will, each paragraph and each sentence to Mrs. Thompson very slowly and carefully and asked Mrs. Thompson if that was exactly what she wanted, to which she replied “That’s right” or “That’s exactly what I want”, and then made other comments in connection with several of the bequests.

In the 1950 Will Mrs. Thompson left $1,000. each to Toten, Talbott and the Bamseys. In her last Will she eliminated these bequests and instead gave similar small bequests to her brother Charles Zuschlag and her sister Lizzie Buffing. This is neither unusual nor unnatural.

The “sister” relationship certainly did not create a “confidential relationship”. The evidence was utterly insufficient (a), to prove that the Stitts exercised “an overmastering influence” upon Mrs. Thompson, or (b) to establish the existence of “weakness, dependence or trust justifiably reposed”. “Weakness, dependence or trust <em>justifiably reposed” </em>is not created merely by nursing and caring for an old sick lady; that language or yardstick refers to and requires a relationship which involves or includes managing or advising a dependent person in business or financial matters: cf. <em>Brennan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/312/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="312 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1150694" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0335-01">312 Pa. 335</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20A.%2025" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="168 A. 25">168 A. 25</a>; <em>Rover’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/339/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="339 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1201289" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0423-01">339 Pa. 423</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%20923" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="12 A.2d 923">12 A. 2d 923</a>.

Mrs. Stitt refused to permit this. On another occasion Mr. Robertson offered to take Mrs. Thompson to Sharon to visit her store and Mr. Stitt prohibited this. A suggestion was made that Mrs. Thompson could be better cared for in a nursing home and Mr. Stitt stated that Mrs. Stitt would never stand for that. In addition, Robertson, who suggested this move, and the reduction of the nursing fee from $300.00 to $240.00 per month, was refused permission to return to visit Mrs. Thompson” [after he had visited her six to eight times].</p>

Because of her physical condition or her lack of desire, she never went any place after moving to the Stitts’ home in March 1953. She disliked her sister, Mrs. Frye. There is nothing to indicate that at the time of the suggested visit Mrs. Thompson wanted to visit Mrs. Frye or was well enough to do so. This is likewise <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>true with reference to Robertson’s offer to take Mrs. Thompson to Sharon to visit her store. Mrs. Thompson had resented Robertson’s interfering in her affairs, and it is likely that the Stitts resented Robertson’s efforts to reduce their compensation for caring for Mrs. Stitt. Certainly Mrs. Thompson did not want to be put in a nursing home with utter strangers, and it was only natural that her sister should resist and resent this plan.

This care and solicitude, <em>without some substantial evidence of control which operated as a present restraint upon her at the time she made her Will, </em>does not amount to proof of undue influence. Moreover, when an ill old lady, 83 years of age, comes to a strange city to live with her sister, to whom else would she turn except to her sister for the recommendation of a doctor, a lawyer and a banker? We note once again that the trial Judge described her doctor, lawyer and banker as “gentlemen of unquestioned integrity”. The lower Court and the appellees also place much weight upon the testimony that the Stitts never left Mrs. Thompson alone with her visitors from Sharon except for the briefest intervals. Wasn’t it natural for Mrs. Stitt who had no outside interests or amusements to want to see and talk with friends whom she and Mrs. Thompson had known for many years?

The trial Judge pointed out that at the prior hearing Stitt testified that he hadn’t seen Mrs. Thompson from the time he left Newcastle fifty years ago until she came to Greenville, whereas at the present trial he testified that he had seen her three or four times in Sharon. There was also contradiction and conflict between the Stitts as to whether Mr. Mortensen or they first suggested Mr. Dilley, and who telephoned Dilley. Stitt also testified that Mrs. Thompson’s health was good each month commencing with June 1953, whereas he wrote three letters stating that her health had been bad for a couple of days. The lower Court also lays emphasis on what it terms is a contradiction in Stitt’s testimony — he testified that he voluntarily reduced the payments from $300. to $240. a month, whereas two other witnesses testified that they pressed him to reduce the nursing fee. There was irreconcilable testimony as to what was done with the proceeds of a $150. Water Company dividend check.</p>
