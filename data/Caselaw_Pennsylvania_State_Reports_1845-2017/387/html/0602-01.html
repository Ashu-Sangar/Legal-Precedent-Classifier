Defendant did not take the witness stand. He filed a motion in arrest of judgment and a motion for a new trial. He contended (1) that there was not sufficient evidence to prove the corpus delicti; (2) that the verdict was against the evidence and against the weight of the evidence and against the law; (3) that a new trial should be granted for the additional reason that two jurors should have been disqualified, and (4) that a new trial should be granted for alleged prejudicial remarks made by the District Attorney during his closing argument to the jury.

As a result of this fight Elsie and the defendant were arrested and put in jail. The same evening they were released, and they returned to Bobtown, Greene County. Later Elsie left defendant to go to her home with Tanner.</p>

There he discussed the fight and said: “Someone is going to pay for this.” The Commonwealth then.proved that the defendant returned in his automobile to his store at Bobtown about four A.M.</p>

While standing before his kitchen door at about four A.M., Tanner was shot and killed from ambush by a shot gun. Mrs. Alice Tanner, his mother, saw him alive, heard a gunshot, saw him fall and held him in her arms as he died. Mrs. Jean Tanner, widow of the deceased, heard the shot, placed a a pillow under her husband’s head and immediately called a doctor.</p>

Defendant was arrested at eight A.M. on the morning of June 12, 1954, at his home at Bobtown, Green County, which was approximately three miles from Tanner’s home. At the time of his arrest he gave vague as well as contradictory accounts of his whereabouts and actions prior to and about the time of the shooting.</p>

A shot gun owned by the defendant was offered in evidence at the trial. John Laskody testified that he saw the defendant when he was at Nassar’s take three shot gun shells from his pocket, and state: “Someone is going to pay for this.” The defendant made several contradictory statements as to where the gun and shells were located, but later showed, the officers where the gun was.

John-Rock obtained four pellets identified as four shot gun pellets from inside the body of the deceased in the Lucas funeral home as they were removed from the body by Doctor Ramsey. Michael Lucas, the undertaker, who was deputy coroner, testified that there were one hundred penetrations over Tanner’s body, his ribs were broken, and his lungs and heart were lacerated. He also testified that after the autopsy had been performed by Doctor Ramsey, at which he was present, he prepared the certificate of death, offered in evidence as Commonwealth’s Exhibit No. 13, which he identified. When this certificate of death was offered in evidence by the Commonwealth, it was admitted to show that Gerald Tanner died ón June 12, 1954, of shot gun wounds on the left chest. Counsel for defendant made no objections to the offer of the death certificate except to request that the words “shot to death from ambush” be not read to the jury. This was granted. Lucas further testified:- “Q. As the autopsy progressed, were you aware or did you find out of what Mr. Tanner died? A. Yes. Q. What was it? A. His heart was punctured by shot gun pellets. Q.

The District Attorney, in his closing remarks to the jury, directed the jurors’ attention to defendant’s peculiar stride and its length as they had observed him entering and leaving the court room, and argued that the footprints showed that the person making them had a peculiar walk or run or stride. This was not a statement or the legal equivalent of a statement that defendant had failed to take the stand or testify. Actually it was the defendant’s counsel who first referred to the fact that the defendant had not taken the witness stand. Defendant’s counsel said that defendant was not bound to testify against himself in any respect, to which the District Attorney responded that under the law he, the District Attorney, had no right to comment on whether the defendant did or did not take the stand. Moreover, the trial Judge in his charge to the jury said: “The Commonwealth having brought a charge of murder against the defendant, was challenged to produce its proof when the defendant pleaded not guilty. He is not obliged to take the stand or offer a single witness in his behalf.

The other challenges, in the main, were based on the fact that the jurors were either relatives of the county detective, who was the active prosecutor in the case, or political allies of the district attorney. All of the jurors stated they had formed no opinion on the case. No sound reason was shown for excluding them. ‘The test of dis<a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>qualification is the juror’s ability and willingness to eliminate the influence of his scruples and render a verdict according to the evidence, and this is to be determined by the discretion of the trial judge, based upon the juror’s answers and demeanor. . . . Nothing short of a palpable abuse of discretion justifies a reversal in passing on a challenge for cause’: Com. v.
