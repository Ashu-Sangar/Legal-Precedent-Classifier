Panetta and Massone pleaded not guilty to all charges and asked for a jury trial. Crawford pleaded guilty to receiving stolen goods and asked to be tried by a judge without jury on the other charges. Judge Kun of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County, before whom the defendants appeared, decided to try all cases together and simultaneously, thus sitting as a judge with jury in the indictments against Panetta and Massone, and sitting as a judge without jury in the charges against Crawford. At the end of the Commonwealth’s evidence, the Trial District Attorney moved to nolle pros the charges of eónspiracy añd accessory after the fact to larceny. The motion was granted, thus leaving only the charge of receiving stolen' goods to be considered. The jury found Panetta and Massdne guilty, and Judge Kun imposed a jail sentence against <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>both. He later vacated Massone’s prison sentence. Panetta has appealed, seeking a new trial on two grounds: (1) that the Tidal Judge’s prejudicial attitude against the defendants, his excessive participation in the trial, and his argumentative charge to the jury denied the defendants the fair trial guaranteed under the Constitution; and (2) that the consolidation of a jury trial with a trial by judge alone deprived Panetta and Massone of a trial by jury as known at common law and as guaranteed by our Constitution.</p>

    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[260,1006,1144,266]]]'>A reading of the record in this case impels one reluctantly, but helpless a.gainst the facts, to the conclusion that Panetta and Massone did not receive that fair, impartial, and unprejudiced trial which is the pride and the glory of our American courts.</p>

The Trial Judge probably believed the defendants guilty but so far as Panetta and Massone were concerned, it was not for him to pronounce their guilt. The Constitution leaves the determination of guilt or innocence to the jury. The fact that occasionally the Judge told the jury that upon them depended the determination of the factual issue did not purge his fault which consisted of a never-ceasing demonstration, by attitude, questions, words, sneers, sarcasm and threats, that he was in no mood to tolerate a not guilty conclusion to the contest. The man who tells a stranger that he has a choice of routes in reaching his destination and then leads him <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>through a labyrinth of roads and paths to the top of a cliff cannot, when the stranger falls off the cliff, exculpate himself by saying that it was not he who pushed him off the precipice. A jury, and especially a new jury, as this one was, looks to the judge for guidance and direction. If he shows by his every action that he wants the defendant convicted, why should they thwart his will when he is assuredly regarded as the fount of wisdom and the embodiment of justice? Novitiates as they are in a courtroom and overawed by the majesty of the law and its ceremonious procedure, they are only too eager to give heed to the wishes of the man who is the voice of authority, even as travelers in a foreign land will gladly trail in the wake of a native guide.</p>
    <p id="b489-3" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[165,1161,1149,824]]]'>A new jury is apt also to reflect a judge’s unconcealed feelings. If he scolds a lawyer before him, they can only assume that the lawyer is deserving of the censure. The Trial Judge here did not attempt to hide his displeasure with defense counsel. Although the printed record does not reproduce grimace, gesture, or intonation of voice, it would be difficult to believe that when Judge Kun made the following remarks he accompanied his harsh language with a gentle demeanor: “You are just barking up the wrong tree.” “You are objecting? Very well, you are objecting and I will ask you to take your seat.” “Mr. Rosenfield, we are going to do everything within our power to bring out the truth. Take your seat. You have your motion and it has been refused.”</p>

Every humiliation suffered by a lawyer in a court weakens his client’s case, and no judge has the right to strike at an accused by crippling his defender.</p>
    <p id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[250,531,1152,708]]]'>A judge, of course, may ask questions during a trial. When, with a few questions, he can clarify an obscurity or untangle a seeming complication, it is his duty to intervene to the extent necessary to enlighten the jury on the issue they are to resolve. A judge is not merely •a robed referee. He is to exercise command, and it is his job to maintain decorum and a dignified atmosphere in the solemn proceeding of the ascertainment of justice. However, when he asks questions, his questions ■should be interrogations, not fulminations or bludgeons. And he should never relinquish the sceptre of serene authority to pick up the sword of partisan attack.</p>

Gilbertson, presumably to testify that Massone, after obtaining stickers from DiStefano, sold two of them to Gilbertson. Of the questions put to Gilbertson in direct examination, some two-thirds of .them came from the Judge who was obviously determined that this witness should carry forward the Commonwealth’s case, even if the Judge had to lift him when •he stumbléd, scold him when he failed to fóllóAV a suggestion, and threaten him when he hésitatéd in making positive statements because he was in., doubt. ....</p>

If the transaction did occur, Panetta was not telling the truth. If it did not occur, DiStefano ivas perverting the facts. One or the other was lying. In his spirited denial of DiStefano’s testimony in this respect, Panetta said: “I chased DiStefano. I didn’t even know his name at the time. The man claims he knows me 12 years. I never knew DiStefano until I got locked up by the city police. That man is an out-and-out liar.” Panetta’s language was censurable, but it did not deserve the vitriolic denunciation the Judge poured upon him because, in his own way, he said that DiStefano was telling lies about him. Fulminated the Judge: “It is not for you to say who is the liar. The jury will decide who is the liar. You are a defendant here and it is for you to give testimony. How dare you call another man a liar? The jury will decide who is the liar. Therefore we will strike out your comment because that is a highly improper thing for one witness to say about another.” From Panetta’s point of view, DiStefano <em>was </em>a liar, and while he should have been warned that he was not to characterize witnesses he did not deserve to be castigated in a manner that completely ruined his chances of an acquittal by the jury. Defense Counsel Eosenfield attempted to explain the defendant’s shortcomings: “Your Honor, the witness is not a lawyer, and witnesses frequently say things — ” But the Judge would not listen. He repeated: “It is stricken out. The jury will understand that they are the ones to decide who is telling the truth. It is not for this defendant who is charged with this crime to decide that.” The defendant indeed was charged with crime, but he was not to be treated as if he had already been <em>convicted </em>of the crime.</p>

The fact of the matter, however, is that Massone did <em>not </em>have a criminal record! Judge K/cjn himself finally admitted this in his opinion denying Panetta a new trial. He did not, however, have the grace to say that he had been in error and that a grave injustice had been perpetrated against Massone.

One of these temptations is to affirm a conviction where it is believed the defendant is guilty anyway, so that nothing is lost in allowing the conviction to stand, despite violations of the Constitution. No reasoning could be more fallacious than that one which assumes nothing is lost by sending anyone to prison or to the gallows over the road of illegal procedure. Much is lost, and irreparably so, in condemning the most wretched criminal to a morally just doom at the expense of constitutional transgression.
