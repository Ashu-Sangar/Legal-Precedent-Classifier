Justice Stearne, speaking for the Court, said: “Appellant . . . sought to introduce oral testimony to establish the testatrix’s <em>true intention concerning the meaning of the language </em>employed in the item of the will now in question, in relation to the above conditions and restrictions. The learned hearing judge correctly excluded this testimony. We agree that the judge was required to interpret the words as written in the will: ‘a dignified and proper home for elderly people as a memorial to [testatrix’s] grandparents.’ Doubtlessly Miss Read sincerely believes that the oral testimony of testatrix’s conversations indicating her wishes made to appellant, to officers of the Home, <em>and to attorneys, </em>should have been admitted as proof of testatrix’s testamentary intent. Such contention is apparently without personal benefit to her. . . .

This construction was adopted especially if a gift of personal effects (a) was not restricted by other language of the Will, or (b) if it was contained in a residuary clause: See <em>Reimer’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/159/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="159 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="850207" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0212-01">159 Pa. 212</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.%20186" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="28 A. 186">28 A. 186</a>, and cases therein cited.

The Court held that the words “personal effects” did not even include household furniture, and said (pages 359-360) : “1. Appellants contend that the gift in paragraph 3 of ‘all of my jéwelry, wearing apparel, automobile or automobiles and othér personal effects . . .’ includes household furniture and furnishings, though not mentioned in the gift.

The legatee contended that the bequest included all the personal property in the house such as furniture, pictures, etc. The Court decided that the language meant and included only such effects as were' connected with the person of the testator, and said (p. 369) : “The general principle of interpretation that applies is that, when ‘effects’ is preceded by and connected with words of narrower import and the bequest is not residuary, it will be confined to species of property ejusdem generis with those previously described: 1 Roper on Legacies, star page 280.

The Court admitted evidence to show that testatrix habitually referred to her property which was in the hands of the trust company as her “things”, and decided that testatrix intended by those words to give to her two sisters all her property which was in the possession of the trust company. The Court aptly said (page 266) : “This evidence was not to show the intention of Anna H. Arnold, but to <em>fathom the exact meaning of the words she employed; </em>that is, it was not offered to prove directly what the testatrix meant, but <em>to show the precise meaning of her words, </em>so that her intention might be deduced therefrom.”</p>

If he sees fit for any reason not to dispose of any part of his estate, or such is the result of ignorance or oversight, the courts cannot supply the gap or hiatus and reconstruct the will. </em>To do so would be a perversion of the functions of the court, and deprive a testator of the right to dispose of his property.’ See: Morrison Will, <a href="/pa/361/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="361 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="476380" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0419-01">361 Pa. 419</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20384" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="65 A.2d 384">65 A. 2d 384</a>, and cases therein cited.” Furthermore, the presumption against an intestacy, even where there is no countervailing presumption, cannot be used to ignore or distort or alter testator’s language in order to avoid an intestacy. It merely means that if the testator’s language is reasonably susceptible of two constructions, one of which will produce and the other avoid an intestacy, the latter interpretation or construction will be adopted unless it defeats the testator’s intention: <em>Ingham’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/315/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="315 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1156644" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0293-01">315 Pa. 293</a>, 296, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20662" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="172 A. 662">172 A. 662</a>.</p>
