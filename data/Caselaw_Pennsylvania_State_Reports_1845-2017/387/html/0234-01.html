Whether the order entered below is really appealable is at least open to question. It certainly is not definitive and does not put the plaintiff out of court. It merely suspends further procedure in the court below until the plaintiff submits his grievances to the arbitration provided for in the written partnership agreement between him and his sister (now deceased) who, as defendant in the suit, is represented on the record by her executors. The court was justified in refusing to set aside the agreement on manifestly insufficient allegations of fraud in its execution.</p>
