The examination was made by defendant, Dr. Charles Wilmer Wirts, Associate Professor of Medicine and Head of the Division of Gastro-enterology at the Hospital, who, as a specialist, had been regularly performing such examinations for many years. While it was an operation that would normally take but a few minutes, it was apparently more than of a merely casual or routine nature, as is somewhat evidenced by the fact that the patient received prior medication of demerol and a hypodermic Injection of atrophine sulfate, — sedatives given to in<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>duee relaxation of the muscles of the esophagus and stomach during the course of the examination. The operation itself consisted of the insertion into the esophagus of a gastroscope, which is a flexible tube approximately three feet in length and three-eighths of an inch in diameter, with a soft rubber tip to guide the instrument downward and with a light at the end to permit of a visual examination of the interior of the stomach for cancerous or other diseased conditions.</p>
    <p id="b327-4" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[141,881,1153,1173]]]'>In this instance the gastroscope was passed along with ease until the cardia or esophageal orifice of the stomach was reached; there an obstruction was encountered, apparently due to spasm. Dr. Wirts explained that such spasm occurred .at times because of the natural tendency of the esophagus to repel a foreign object. He testified that he applied gentle pressure and insufflation aimed to distend the walls of the stomach and esophagus so as to clear the passage for the tube, which he stated ivas the normal and recognized method in such cases of overcoming the obstacle created by the spasm. The patient, however, showed signs of distress, and an emphysema of the upper abdomen, neck and cheek occurred which made the doctor suspect a possible puncture of the wall of the esophagus ; accordingly he immediately removed the tube and had the plaintiff taken to the surgical ward where it was discovered that there was in fact a puncture approximately an inch to an inch and a quarter in size, requiring a thoracotomy for the removal of a rib and the suturing of the puncture.</p>

Stearne (pp. 541, 542, A. pp. 844, 845), that all that had been shown Avas that the defendant did certain things and failed to do other things, but that there was no evidence as to whether a careful and competent practitioner Avould have done otherwise. Accordingly the opinion proceeded to state that “It is argued . . . that a jury of laymen under the present facts could find negligence in the same manner as in any other tort action. It is urged that a lay jury might find that plaintiff’s jaiv was found to have been broken, and from this fact might conclude that defendant had used unwarranted force and was therefore negligent. We disar gree with such doctrine. . . . Negligence may not be <em>inferred </em>by <em>laymen </em>merely because the jaw was found to have been broken. A jaiv could be broken even though there Avas no lack of care or skill by the dentist. <em>Expert </em>testimony is necessary to establish negligent prac<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>tice in any profession. ... As plaintiff failed to offer any <em>expert </em>witness to establish the measure of professional skill required of a dentist in extracting a tooth, she did not meet the burden of establishing, by the weight of the evidence, that defendant failed to treat her with reasonable and ordinary professional skill. . . . In all such <em>malpractice cases </em>this Court has uniformly applied the above principles:” [citing many cases]. Accordingly, the court affirmed the entry of a compulsory nonsuit by the trial court.</p>

The court affirmed the action of the lower court in entering a nonsuit. It was said (p. 379, A. p. 536) : “The plaintiff had the burden of proving Dr. Montgomery’s negligence and in a case such as this it could be proved only by expert testimony to establish negligence in the operation or a procedure which was not in accord with standard medical practice or negligence in his treatment of the patient after the operation:” [ citing authorities ].</p>

In the instant case the plaintiff failed to show by any expert testimony just what Dr. Kisser should have done or refrained from doing. . . .

The only exception to this otherwise invariable rule is in cases where the matter under investigation is so simple, and the lack of skill or want of care so obvious, as to be within the range of the ordinary experience and comprehension of even nonprofessional persons, as, for example, where a gauze pad is left in the body of a patient following an operation <em>(Davis v. Kerr, </em><a href="/pa/239/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="239 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="995992" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0351-01">239 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20A.%201007" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="86 A. 1007">86 A. 1007</a>), or where a dentist, in working on a tooth, uses a tool with a small rotating emery disc at the end and allows it to slip and to remain revolving in the patient’s mouth, grinding and tearing her tongue <em>(Dux v. Shaver, </em><a href="/pa-super/105/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="105 Pa. Super. 344" data-case-ids="701622" data-case-paths="/pa-super/105/0344-01">105 Pa.

So, likewise, there might be imagined a case where a surgeon engaged in removing a tumor from a patient’s scalp would let his knife slip and cut off his patient’s ear, or where he undertook to stitch a wound on his patient’s cheek and by an awkward move would thrust his needle into the patient’s eye. It would be a matter of common knowledge and observation that such things do not ordinarily <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>attend the service of one exercising ordinary skill and experience in the work of surgery because they involve ulterior or extraneous acts or omissions the judgment of which would not require scientific opinion. But such is not the present case. Here it certainly could not be said that the injury to the wall of the esophagus — similar to the fracture of the jaw in the <em>Bier-stein </em>case — indicated that the gastroscopio examination must have been conducted negligently, or that the application of gentle pressure and insufflation in order to pass the gastroscope beyond the obstacle caused by the spasm was not in accord with the ordinary and approved procedure of gastro-enterologists engaged in such specialized practice; on the contrary, the only evidence in that regard at the trial was the testimony of defendant, called by plaintiff as for cross-examination, that it followed the normal and recognized practice under the circumstances. The mere fact that the puncture occurred, due, as it well may have been, to an abnormally weak wall of the esophagus or to other natural causes, did not, under all the authorities, justify the application to the case of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur or of exclusive control.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

He turned to his two assistants and remarked: “Her esophagus is punctured.” The patient was immediately taken to the surgical ward, and an operation followed.

His whole body was tightly bound in wet sheets, folded and knotted like thongs. As the wet sheets began to dry, constriction set in, disturbing the patient’s breathing and causing great pain in his chest. Powell complained but after 6 hours of this treatment he was tied up in another wet-sheeted strait-jacket. No one took his pulse, no one ascertained his temperature. The hermetically tight wrappings interfered with the patient’s blood circulation but neither of the two defendant doctors appeared upon the scene to examine, inquire, probe, or investigate. At the end of the first pack, one of Powell’s arms was in pain. At the end of the second pack, both arms were swollen and numb; his hands, which had received the full impact of the constriction, had “puffed” to twice their normal size.

There were blisters in the center of both palms, about the size of a half-dollar, and other blisters over his hand and fingers.” The blisters were toxic and capable of spreading poison throughout the body. Dr. Norman Daley, the other defendant in the case, proceeded to cut into these blisters with an ordinary pen knife which he carried around in his pocket. He did not sterilize the blade, he took no precaution to pre<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>vent infection.

Every school child is taught the necessity for hygiene, every housewife knows the absolute need for cleanliness in handling all items used in feeding her infants or caring for a sick one at home.

In the lower Court he recovered a modest verdict of $5,000, but this Court reversed, and entered judgment for the defendants notwithstanding the verdict. One would need to search a long time before finding a case where the facts of themselves more clearly established negligence on the part of defendant doctors than was revealed without expert testimony, in the <em>Powell </em>case.

I was not a member of this Court when the Opinion in the <em>Bierstein </em>case was handed down. There the plaintiff’s jaw was broken by a dentist in the process of extracting a tooth. In affirming a nonsuit entered in the Court below, this Court said: “Negligence may not be inferred by laymen merely because the jaw was found to have been broken. <em>A jaw could be broken even though there was no lack of care or skill by the </em>dentist.” The italicized statement speaks a harsh doctrine. It is not difficult, of course, to believe that in the days when teeth were removed with a chisel and hammer, a jaw might suffer breakage even though the extraction was performed by the best blacksmith in town. But if law is supposed to keep pace with modern progress in dentistry, surgery, engineering, and every other field of science, it cannot possibly accept a fractured jaw as a normal sequence of a tooth extraction. While a dentist, who breaks a jaw, in taking out a tooth, should not be compelled ipso facto to pay damages to the injured person, he should, in the event of a lawsuit, be required to show that he used due care because, contrary to what this Court said in <em>Bierstein, </em>a broken jaw is something which just does <em>not </em>ordinarily happen when the defendant uses due care.</p>

I dare to give voice to a prophecy that the decision in the <em>Bierstein </em>case, which this Court today quotes for authority in the disposition of this case, will one day be repudiated by this Court because a declaration which opposes demonstrated phenomena can no more influence the tide of modern scientific law than King Canute’s edict could shut out the waves of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
