Bausman Street dead-ends on Saw Mill Run Boulevard and is a two lane, 20 foot roadway running east and west, which fans out into an intersection 153 feet wide, thereby permitting traffic to exit from the boulevard into Bausman Street. It also permits entry upon the northbound lane of Saw Mill Bun Boulevard without using the lanes actually intersecting with that boulevard. The boulevard in question is a four lane, two way street, 56 feet wide, running north and south, with a concrete divider. Directional lights control the left turn from Bausman Street into the southbound traffic on Saw Mill Bun Boulevard, and also controls the left turn from the <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>boulevard into tbe eastbound traffic on Bausman Street. Likewise the traffic light controls the north and southbound traffic on the boulevard.</p>
    <p id="b54-4" data-blocks='[["BL_54.5",54,[226,519,1148,1103]]]'>At approximately 4:30 P.M. the plaintiff was driving west on Bausman Street. At a distance of 400 feet from the intersection he saw that the directional light was red and reduced his speed so that he could stop “on a dime”. Until 25 or 39 feet from the intersection he proceeded at approximately 8 to 10 miles per hour, when he noticed defendant’s bus to his left, travelling northerly towards the intersection. Plaintiff continued at this low rate of speed; saw that the light changed to green; and when approximately 10 to 15 feet from Saw Mill Run Boulevard again looked to his left and saw the bus approaching at a distance of “possibly 100 feet”. He then looked to his right and determined that the southbound traffic on Saw Mill Run Boulevard had been halted by the traffic light. He did not look again but stated that he “thought everything was under control”. He crossed the two northbound lanes and began making a turn to the left to go south on the boulevard when he “saw or imagined a bus”.</p>

The court <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>adequately charged the jury on the question of negligence and contributory negligence. The appellant-defendant took a general exception and submitted points for charge which were disposed of by the court below, concerning which action the defendant makes no complaint.</p>

He was <em>42 </em>years of age and had an industrial expectancy of at least 20 years. He suffered a ruptured diaphragm permitting his intestinal contents to go into his left chest; fractures of <em>4 </em>ribs; lesion to the brain affecting his entire left side, with damage to the corticospinal tract and hemiparesis; and memory impairment. He underwent an emergency operation on the diaphragm, which necessitated a tracheotomy with the insertion of a tube. He was in the hospital for 68 days. His weight dropped from a normal 175 pounds to 128 pounds. At the time of the trial his weight was only 145 pounds.</p>

Incentive bonuses averaged $4.00 per day, which <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>is an approximate guess at the plaintiff’s impairment of earning capacity.</p>

Although he tried to avoid collision, his automobile was struck by defendant when plaintiff’s car had reached a point some three-fourths of the distance across Wallace Street.” His testimony was corroborated by three witnesses. This Court properly left the question of contributory negligence to the jury and, speaking through Justice Arnold, said: “The law requires the driver of a vehicle approaching a two-way street to look first to his left and then to his right. ‘ “That is because he first enters the lane in which traffic coming from his left is travelling. If he sees nothing approaching that would be likely to prove a source of danger to him, he may proceed, but as he nears the middle of the street, it is his duty to look to his right again before entering into the traffic lane coming from that direction” ’: Grande v.
