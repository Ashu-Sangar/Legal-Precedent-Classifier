This is contrary to the clear and specific language of the Ordinance. Section 1, which is the pertinent section which deals specifically with the question at issue, clearly and explicitly provides that $10,000 shall be paid to a surviving widow of a fireman who is killed in the course of fighting a fire, <em>or </em>in the course of performing an heroic deed which involves a special hazard or risk. “Or” in its ordinary usage and meaning clearly and undoubtedly means “or”. “Or” can only be construed to mean “and” when to give the word “or” its ordinary meaning would be to produce a result that is absurd or impossible of execution or highly unreasonable or would manifestly change or nullify the intention of the legislative body. Cf. Section 52, Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS §552. Section 1 of the Ordinance could not be <em>clearer; </em>“or” means <em>“or”; and; “When the </em>
      <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>
      <em>words of a law are clear and free from all ambiguity, </em>the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its [real or supposed] spirit”: Section 51, Statutory Construction Act.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[253,572,1149,776]]]'>If we consider §1 in connection with the entire Or<em>dinance </em>— Sherwood <em>v. Elgart, </em><a href="/pa/383/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="383 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1261967" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0110-01">383 Pa. 110</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="117 A.2d 899">117 A. 2d 899</a> — we arrive at exactly the same result. There is no merit in the contention of the City Solicitor that to construe the word “or” to mean “or” “would produce inconsistencies and absurdities” in the Ordinance. “Or”, by any reasonable interpretation, considering the language of every paragraph of the Ordinance — and even considering also (as the City urges) the object to be attained and the consequences of a particular interpretation (§51 of the Statutory Construction Act), — clearly and undoubtedly means what it says — “or”. Any other interpretation would be a plain perversion and violation of the clear language of §1 of the Ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[251,1369,1148,778]],["BL_481.1",481,[162,354,1145,147]]]'>The Ordinance first provides for the payment of an honor award to widows of firemen who lose their lives —not from a heart attack or fall in the fire house or in their home, not in the course of performing some routine duty within the scope of their employment, but —“in the course of performing <em>certain </em>duties”. The next paragraph similarly provides for firemen who <em>daily </em>risk their lives not in the performance of their duties but in the performance of <em>certain </em>duties. Those duties are clearly and specifically set forth and defined in §1, namely, a fireman (policeman or park policeman), who is killed (a) in the course of responding to an alarm; (b) fighting a fire; (c) apprehending a Criminal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a>
      <em>or </em>(d) in the course of performing an heroic <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>act which involves a special hazard or risk. A fireman or policeman does not <em>daily </em>risk his life performing an heroic deed.</p>
    <p id="b481-4" data-blocks='[["BL_481.6",481,[153,531,1155,1398]]]'>Who is to determine whether the fireman was killed in the course of responding to an alarm, or in fighting a fire, or in apprehending a criminal, or in the course of performing an heroic deed? City Council wisely answered this question by saying the Award Committee. Many cases will arise where a fireman is killed by a fall or a heart attack, or dies in the course of or as a result of performing his routine duties, but perhaps not in the course of fighting a fire or performing an heroic deed. Whether death resulted in the course of fighting a fire may often be quite doubtful or a border line case — hence the determination thereof was properly and wisely left by City Council to the Award Committee. Similarly, whether death occurred in the course of performing an heroic deed, which is a matter on which many people can sincerely differ, was properly and wisely left by City Council to the Award Committee. That is the meaning of §3 of the above mentioned Ordinance, considered in conjunction with the entire Ordinance. Furthermore, such an interpretation gives to §1 the clear and exact meaning of the language therein set forth, and at the same times gives a reasonable and harmonious construction to every paragraph of the Ordinance and produces a fair, just and highly desirable result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a>

      <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>The lower Court was correct in stating (1) that mandamus lies where there is a clear legal right in the plaintiff and a corresponding duty in the defendant, and the act requested is not discretionary but only ministerial, and (2) that mandamus will not lie <em>to control </em>an official’s discretion or judgment where that official is vested with a discretionary power. However, <em>the discretion is reviewable and reversible where it is arbitrarily or fraudulently exercised or where, as here, it is based upon a mistaken view of the law: Maxwell v. Farrell School District Board of Directors, </em><a href="/pa/381/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="381 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1258924" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0561-01">381 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20192" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="112 A.2d 192">112 A. 2d 192</a>, and cases therein cited. If a fireman is unquestionably killed in the course of fighting a fire, the Award Committee has merely a ministerial and not a discretionary duty to make the award to his <em>widow; </em>if the proofs leave the factual question in doubt, the Committee’s decision is a discretionary one which, unless arbitrarily or fraudulently made, cannot be controlled by the Courts. Similarly, if it is doubtful tinder the facts whether a fireman or policeman “was killed in the course of performing an heroic deed which involves a special hazard or risk”, the Award Committee has a discretion in the determination of that qttestion which cannot be controlled by the Courts unless arbitrarily or fraudulently made or based upon a mistaken view of the law.</p>
