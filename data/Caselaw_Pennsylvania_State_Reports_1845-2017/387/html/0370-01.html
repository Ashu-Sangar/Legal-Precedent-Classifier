Without such power, a decree would in many cases be useless. ‘All courts have this power, and must necessarily have it; otherwise they could not protect themselves from insult, or enforce obedience to their process.

Without the record in No. 1871, April Term, 1950, it is impossible to review the order of the court below as it applies to that case. Aside from the dubious propriety of merging in a single commitment order separate con-tempts arising out of different cases, before an order may issue for payment of a wife’s counsel fees, witness fees and expenses in a divorce case, there must be proof of the need of the wife and the husband’s financial ability: <em>Rothman v. Rothman, </em><a href="/pa-super/180/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="180 Pa. Super. 421" data-case-ids="730844" data-case-paths="/pa-super/180/0421-01">180 Pa. Superior Ct. 421</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.2d%20584" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="119 A.2d 584">119 A. 2d 584</a>. In the absence of the record in No. 1871, April Term, 1950, there is no evidence whether there was a hearing in the court below on these issues and, if so, whether the necessary proofs were established. The question whether a defendant may be committed for contempt for failure to comply with an order to pay counsel fees in a divorce case was not argued before this Court, nor specifically considered by the court below. For the foregoing reasons, we do not decide in this appeal whether defendant could be committed for contempt because he failed to comply with an order to pay counsel fees and witness fees and expenses in the divorce action.</p>
