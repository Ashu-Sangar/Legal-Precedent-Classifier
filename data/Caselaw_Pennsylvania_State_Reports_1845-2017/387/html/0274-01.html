F. of L. The company has its principal office in Pittsburgh where it maintains a manufacturing plant as it also does in several other cities in Pennsylvania as well as in a number of other States. A labor relations contract was entered into by the company and the union acting as the bargaining agent of the company’s employees. While the contract endured, the plaintiff employees caused to be lodged with the National Labor Relations Board charges that the employer was guilty of unfair labor practices in that it was about to remove one of its plants from the Pittsburgh area under circumstances which allegedly constituted a violation of the existing labor relations contract and its supplement. Regional counsel for the Board declined to seek an injunction in the federal court on the basis of the unfair labor charges lodged with the Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In any event, two days after the <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>lodging of the charge -with the National Labor Relations Board, the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the instant suit for injunctive relief in the court below alleging substantially the same grounds as were set forth in the charge of unfair labor practices.</p>

The court accordingly denied the plaintiffs the injunctive relief sought, and, from the final decree entered, the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

L. 1168, had issued a preliminary injunction restraining the peaceful picketing of an interstate business by union members for organi<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>zational purposes. In speaking for. this court, Mr. Chief Justice Stern, after noting .the applicable provisions Of the federal Labor Management Relations Act, concluded it “provided a completó remedy whenever there was a charge presented to [the Board] of an unfair labor practice, — immediate injunctive relief on petition of the Board, a final hearing by the Board, a review of such order in the Federal court. In our opinion such provisions for a comprehensive remedy precluded any State action by way of a different or additional remedy for the correction of the identical grievance.”</p>

As to that, the learned jurist said, — “The same reasoning which prohibits federal courts from intervening in such cases [matters within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board], except by way of review or on application of the federal Board, precludes state courts from doing so.” In disposing of the further argument that there was no conflict between state and federal actions as the State enforced “private rights”, Mr. Justice Jackson went on to say that “even if we were to assume, with petitioners, that distinctly private rights were enforced by the State authorities, it does not follow that the state and federal authorities may supplement each other in cases of this type. The conflict lies in remedies, not rights. The same picketing may injure both public and private rights. But when two separate remedies are brought to bear on the same activity, a conflict is imminent. It <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>must , be remembered that petitioners’ state remedy was a suit for an injunction prohibiting the picketing. The federal Board, if it should find a violation of the national Labor Management Relations Act, would issue a cease-and-desist order and perhaps obtain a temporary injunction to preserve the <em>status quo. </em>Or if it found no violation, it would dismiss the complaint, thereby sanctioning the picketing. To avoid facing a conflict between the state and federal remedies, we would have to assume either that both authorities will always agree as to whether the picketing should continue, or that the State’s temporary injunction will be dissolved as soon as the federal Board acts. But experience gives no assurance of either alternative, and there is no indication that the statute left it open for such conflicts to arise.”</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[239,1259,1153,881]]]'>It is clear that the foregoing pronouncement of highest judicial authority furnishes a complete answer to the appellants’ insistence upon concurrent federal and state jurisdiction in the premises on the ground that the federal Act does not afford to the individual the right to seek injunctive relief. The appellants contend, however, that decisions of the Supreme Court subsequent to the <em>Garner </em>case indicate that state courts may exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the National Labor Relations Board. In support of that contention, they cite <em>Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em><a href="/us/348/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="348 U.S. 468" data-case-ids="6931860" data-case-paths="/us/348/0468-01">348 U.

Just as in the instant case, the party alleging the unfair labor practice in the <em>Weber </em>case had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board and then, without awaiting the Board’s decision in the matter, sought to enjoin in the state court the same alleged unfair practice. Mr. Justice Feankeuetee, speaking for the court,,said, — “. . . where the moving party itself alleges unfair labor practices, where the facts reasonably bring the controversy within the sections prohibiting these practices, and where .the conduct, if not prohibited -by the federal Act, may be reasonably deemed to come within the protection afforded by that Act, the state court must decline jurisdiction in deference to the tribunal which Congress has selected for determining such issues in the .first instance.” So far as it is presently pertinent, the <em>Weber </em>case represents an unqualified affirmance of the doctrine of the <em>Garner </em>case.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[155,1406,1149,894]],["BL_314.1",314,[246,346,1150,1162]]]'>The <em>United Automobile </em>case, supra, was decided by a divided court. Mr. Justice Reed, who spoke for the majority, held that, under Wisconsin’s labor relations statute, a state court could enjoin mass picketing attended, as it was, by threatened physical violence (which, if perpetrated, the State could, of course, punish under its criminal law) and that it was immaterial that the restraint was enforced through an administrative tribunal concerned solely with labor relations problems. It was of no consequence, in the majority’s view, that in the particular instance there, might be a duplication of remedies; such an eventuality was not specifically prohibited by the federal Labor Management Relations Act, and the States, as “the natural guardians of the public against violence” have a “dominant interest . . . in preventing violence and property <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>damage . .. .” See our own recent decision in <em>Westinghouse Electric Corporation v. United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, </em><a href="/pa/383/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="383 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1261957" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0297-01">383 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.2d%20180" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="118 A.2d 180">118 A. 2d 180</a>. Mr. Justice Douglas, in Ms dissent in the <em>United Automobile </em>cáse, wherein Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Mr. Justice Black joined, deemed the decision in that case a “retreat from Garner.” However, the Supreme Court’s most recent decision on the subject Was a summary reversal, <em>per curiam, </em>on the authority of the <em>Weber </em>case, of the action of the Supreme Court of Idaho in assuming jurisdiction to enjoin picketing which constituted a “secondary boycott” under the labor statute of that State: see <em>Pocatello Building and Construction Trades Council v. C. H. Elle Construction Co., </em><a href="/us/352/0884-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="352 U.S. 884" data-case-ids="6230496,6230853,6231123,6231837" data-case-paths="/us/352/0884-01,/us/352/0884-02,/us/352/0884-03,/us/352/0884-04">352 U. S. 884</a>. In no way does the <em>United Automobile </em>case afford the appellants’ argument any support. Notably, neither actual nor threatened violence is averred or implicit in the complaint; and the subject matter in controversy is the same before the National Labor Relations Board as in the state court.</p>

It was assumed without discussion that the matter was witMn the federal sphere and, hence, “outside state authority”. The only question for decision, therefore, was as to the power of the federal court to enjoin the procedure in the state court. Because of the limitations imposed by Act of Congress (<a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A72283" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="28 U.S.C. §2283">28 U.S.C.A. §2283</a>) <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>on the power of District Courts to grant injunctive relief, it was held that the court was without jurisdiction.
