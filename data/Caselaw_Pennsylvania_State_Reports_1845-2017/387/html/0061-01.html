Defendant exercised this option and the lease was accordingly extended for two more years ending November 30, 1955. However, in October, 1954, defendant vacated the premises, whereupon plaintiff, acting under a power of attorney contained in the lease, entered a judgment by confession against defendant for the balance of the rent for the remainder of the term, together with attorney’s commission, in the total sum of |3,958.50.</p>

This is a total misconception of what is involved in defendant’s petition to open the judgment. What the petition alleges is that plaintiff made, not a contractual promise or agreement Avhich should have been contained in the written lease and therefore could not be added to it by oral testimony, but a statement of an existing fact as to the strength of the floor for storage purposes; indeed plaintiff’s witness, who negotiated the lease on his behalf, stated that he knew that the floor would sustain a weight of only 120 to 125 pounds per square foot, although he denied the making of the statement attributed to him by defendant. A misrepresentation of a material fact, even though innocently made, if relied upon by the other party as intended that it should be, confers upon the latter the right to rescind the contract when the falsity of the representa<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>tion is discovered: <em>LaCourse v.

The one is based upon the fact that, contemporaneously with the execution of the lease agreement, the parties signed a collateral agreement, one of the prolusions of which was that “The Tenant has inspected the premises and accepts the property in its present condition.” Plaintiff argues that even, therefore, if the alleged misrepresentation had been made as to the strength of the flooring, it was superseded and nullified by this admission on the part of the tenant. This undoubtedly would be a valid argument as to any condition of the property reasonably ascertainable, but only as to such conditions can it be held that the tenant ivas bound by this provision. Thus, in <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa/350/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="350 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="461197" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0355-01">350 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20139" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="39 A.2d 139">39 A. 2d 139</a>, where a contract Avith the Turnpike Commission purported to contain information as to the subsurface conditions and the nature and approximate quantities of the material to be excavated, but stated that each bidder must acquaint himself Avith conditions affecting the work and that the contractor should not plead misunderstanding or deception because of such estimate of quantities or of the character of the work described in the contract, it was held that the contractor nevertheless had a right to rely upon the inaccurate statements, that the misrepresentation in reference thereto was constructive even though not actual fraud, and that the contractor could not have been expected, under the circumstances, to make borings of <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>Ms own to check on the information set forth in the contract. In <em>Lake v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/pa/366/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="366 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="8845573" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0352-01">366 Pa. 352</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20364" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="77 A.2d 364">77 A. 2d 364</a>, it was held that the plaintiff conld rescind his contract for the purchase of a house because of certain misrepresentations that had been made by the seller as to the good condition of the heating plant, plumbing and electric wiring, the court pointing out that the actual defects in this equipment were not readily observable as the result of ordinary inspection by one not an expert. On the other hand, in <em>Abrams, Inc., v. Wolkov, </em><a href="/pa/371/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="371 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1237098" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0044-01">371 Pa. 44</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20359" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="89 A.2d 359">89 A. 2d 359</a>, it was held that where the parties entered into a written agreement in which the buyer of an apartment building acknowledged that he had entered into the agreement as the result of an inspection of the premises made by him and not as the result of any advertisement or statement by the seller, the buyer could not take advantage of a misrepresentation by the seller that each of the apartments in the building contained two bathrooms whereas in fact each contained only one, this being a fact determinable by the most casual examination.</p>

This is especially true in view of defendant’s testimony that plaintiff’s agent had pointed out steel beams and posts which he claimed had been recently installed for the purpose of strengthening the floor, with the further assurance that he himself had used the premises in the past for the storage of heavy furnaces and equipment.</p>

It is true that ordinarily it is the duty of a tenant, under such circumstances, if he wishes to disaffirm the contract, to do so promptly; he cannot continue to occupy the property and pay the rent for a period of time and then claim the right to rescind the lease agreement on the ground that he ivas induced to enter into the contract by the misrepresentations of the lessor or his agent: <em>Spaulding v.

The lease also provided: “The tenant has inspected the premises and accepts the property in its present condition.” Moreover, the tenant admitted that he actually inspected the premises prior to the lease and then stored his merchandise in and occupied the demised premises for two years.

The Court said (page 505) : “Plaintiffs averred that they contemplated engaging in the business of bottling Hires Root Beer and informed defendant’s representatives that their business required a location with ‘ample water facilities for the several operations’, ‘large drainage facilities for the operations’, ‘definite electrical facilities and a switchboard for the operation’ and ‘heating facilities capable of quickly heating water to minimum required temperatures and of keeping said premises warm’. . . . Averment is made, however, that the defendant’s agents falsely, intentionally and fraudulently represented at <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>the time the premises were being inspected that the facilities thereon <em>met the standards required by plaintiffs and that in reliance upon sueh representations </em>a five-year lease beginning May 1st, 1947, was entered into.” Those representations were representations of existing facts — the representation in the instant case, to wit, “should accommodate”, does not even amount to a representation of an existing fact.</p>

In the instant case, Paragraph 1 of the <em>typewritten </em>rider attached to the lease recites: <em>“The tenant has inspected the premises and accepts the property in its present condition.” </em>This provision certainly includes the weight-bearing capacity of the floor, and is equivalent to a statement that no warranty has been made as to the condition of the premises, or if made, has been waived.

    <p id="b113-3" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[169,455,1150,948]]]'>There is an additional reason why this judgment should not be opened. The evidence highlights the weakness of defendant’s case — equitably and legally— and demonstrates that the Order opening the judgment was a manifest abuse of discretion. Prior to leasing the premises, Mr. A. H. Berger (plaintiff’s son) conducted Mr. R. E. Smith (defendant’s superintendent) through the building. Berger testifed that he told Smith that Smith should make a thorough inspection of the premises and then decide whether or not it would be suitable for his needs. Smith admits he made a thorough inspection of the premises. Smith then sent a letter to the plaintiff <em>in which he set forth the repairs needed to put the premises in proper condition for the defendant’s use. </em>It is highly significant that Smith’s letter made no mention of the weight-bearing capacity of the floor.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[168,1416,1149,892]],["BL_114.1",114,[241,343,1147,608]]]'>Defendant’s case is further weakened and equitably destroyed by its letter exercising its option to extend the term of the lease for another two years, after it had been in possession approximately eighteen (18) months. During this eighteen months occupancy, defendant had ample opportunity to determine for itself the weight-bearing capacity of the floor and whether the premises met its requirements. It was only after the defendant received notice from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Building Inspection that a permit for its occupancy had never been applied for and that it would have to make certain repairs — both of which defendant was bound to do by its lease — that the defendant determined that the floor’s weight-bearing capacity was inadequate to meet its needs and vacated the premises without giving the plaintiff any notice. Defendant’s <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>actions speak far loader than its words! But even if defendant’s actions did not belie its words, its words would not suffice to justify opening of the judgment. Defendant bases its entire claim to equitable relief on the alleged oral representation that the floor of the demised premises “should accommodate what we had stored in his classrooms”. Even if this testimony had not been specifically contradicted by plaintiff and refuted by defendant’s evidence, it does not constitute an averment of an existing fact nor under the authorities is it sufficient to justify an opening of the judgment.</p>
