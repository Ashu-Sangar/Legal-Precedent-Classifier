Each of the drivers was the sole occupant of his automobile at the time of the accident, and each sued the other for damages. The eases were tried together. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Cottom for $8,500 in the case in which he was plaintiff and also a verdict for him as the defendant in the action wherein Risbon was plaintiff. Risbon’s motions for new trial were denied and, from the judgments entered on the verdicts, he took these several appeals.</p>

However, we may note in passing that, while the doctor’s opinion that Risbon had been drinking, standing by itself, was not sufficient to prove intoxication (see <em>Critzer v. Donovan, </em>supra), it became <em>de minimis </em>and, consequently, harmless. The State police officer, who saw Risbon at the hospital an hour after the accident, testified that he was boisterous, had the smell of alcohol on his breath and admitted recent drinking at Brownsville and again en route at a place just two miles from the scene of the accident. Risbon also admitted at trial that, just prior to the accident, he had travelled several miles out of his way on the wrong road in country with which he was thoroughly familiar; and he failed to account for the extra hour of .elapsed time between his departure from Brownsville and his arrival at the point of accident. Whether, under all the evidence, Risbon’s drinking had been such as to impair his ability to operate his automobile safely was properly sub<a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>mitted to the jury by the learned trial judge with cautionary instructions which fully satisfy the requirements specified in our more recent opinion in <em>Fisher v.

Cottom testified in chief that Risbon had driven his automobile across the center line of the highway and had crashed head-on into Gottorn’s car. He was asked on cross-examination whether he had not stated to Risbon, upon a visit to the latter approximately fifteen days after the accident, that he had no recollection as to how the collision had happened and that his mind was a blank in such regard. Cottom admitted the visit but denied the statement thus imputed to him. Risbon, upon taking the stand, testified that Cottom had admitted to him that he had no recollection of the accident. The effect and real purpose of this testimony was to impeach Cottom’s credibility and to ascribe to him a deliberate fabrication of his testimony at trial relative to the happening of the accident. For the purpose of restoring Cottom’s credit, his counsel offered in rebuttal, and the learned trial judge admitted in evidence, the testimony of the investigating State police officer that Cottom (whom he had been unable to interrogate at the hospital the night of the accident because of his injuries and who was under oxygen for five days) had described the accident to him a week after it had happened, as follows, “I was travelling west on Route 31, about thirty-five or forty miles an hour, just as I neared the top of this hill a car came over on my side and hit me; that is all I can remember.” This state-<a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>meat was entirely consistent with Cottom’s version of the accident as related by him at trial and was properly admitted in rebuttal by the learned trial judge in the exercise of a sound discretion. It had been uttered upon a proper occasion to a proper person when its ultimate effect with respect to what transpired at a conversation that had not yet taken place could not possibly have been foreseen. Nor did the defendant object to its admission on the ground that it had been made untimely. No question, therefore, as to the effect of a lapse of time on the admissibility of a prior utterance, when offered as a consonant statement, is presented by this appeal, and no opinion is expressed in regard thereto.</p>

Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., </em><a href="/pa/236/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="236 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="986764" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0038-01">236 Pa. 38</a>, 47-51, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20595" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="84 A. 595">84 A. 595</a>, directly rules the point presently under consideration. The circumstances which gave rise to the evidential question in the <em>Lyke </em>case (which also was an action for damages for personal injury) are so analogous to those of the instant case as to justify extended reference thereto. In the <em>Lyke </em>case the plaintiff testified that he received his injuries by being thrown from a flat car, upon which he was working on a railroad siding, when the car was suddenly jolted by a box car negligently put in motion by agents or employees of the defendant company. As stated in the opinion for this court, “. . . the defendant offered at least five witnesses who testified that the plaintiff had declared to them either specifically or in effect, that he was not on the car at that time. When the plaintiff was under cross-examination counsel for the defendant interrogated him as to whether he had not stated to these witnesses that he was not on the car [at the time of the jolting] .... The plaintiff denied all this, but witnesses for the defense testified, in <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>substance, to the matters suggested in the cross-examination. . . . Under these circumstances the plaintiff offered [in rebuttal] the witness in question to prove that he had stated immediately after the accident (almost two years before the institution of his suit and more than five years before the trial), that he was injured upon the car. ‘This for the purpose of showing that his testimony in this suit was not a fabrication of recent date.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b196-4" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[235,869,1152,1347]]]'>The trial judge admitted the rebuttal testimony in the <em>LyJce </em>case, and this court approved the ruling. In so doing, Mr. Justice Moschziskhr, speaking for the court, said that “the testimony of numerous witnesses for the defendant to declarations by the plaintiff contrary to his evidence given at the trial . . . could well be taken as conveying the charge that the plaintiff’s testimony was not the story told by him from the time of the accident but one concocted for the purpose of the trial, or what is known in the law as a recent fabrication . . . .” After quoting with approval the applicable rule as “well-stated” in <em>State v. Parish, </em><a href="/nc/79/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="79 N.C. 610" data-case-ids="8697835" data-case-paths="/nc/79/0610-01">79 N.C. 610</a>, 614, Mr. Justice Moschziskhr noted that most of the cases on the point of the admissibility of consonant statements to rehabilitate the credibility of impeached witnesses are reviewed by President Judge Rice in <em>Commonwealth v.

Such an instruction should, of course, have been given: see, e.g., <em>Lyke v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., </em>supra, at p. 51. But, counsel for appellant stood silently by and made no <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>request for an instruction in such regard even when, at the conclusion of the charge, the learned trial judge specifically inquired whether he had “missed anything as a matter of law” and, again, repeated the inquiry. “The rule that an appellate court will not grant a new trial on the ground of inadequacy unless there is omission of something basic or fundamental, is especially applicable where the complaining party was invited to suggest additions to or modifications of the charge and remained silent”: <em>Pryor v.

Not only did counsel for appellant make no response to the trial judge’s repeated inquiry but, in subsequently excepting to the charge, he failed to call to the court’s attention that it had not explained to the jury the scope and purpose of the State policeman’s testimony in rebuttal embracing Gottorn’s prior consonant statement. Nor did the appellant later, in his motion for a new trial, assign the trial court’s obviously inadvertent omission in the premises as a reason for a new trial. So far as the record and briefs disclose, the point was never argued in the court below but was raised for the first time in this court; and that is too late: <em>McCann v. Hedin; Keane v.

The learned court below had no difficulty in concluding that the severe, painful and permanently inconveniencing injuries, which the plaintiff suffered, and the substantial expenses for medical, surgical and hospital services to which he was put justified the amount of the verdict. The record is barren of anything that would warrant us in holding that the court below, in so concluding, was guilty of a clear abuse of discretion.</p>

    <p id="b199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_199.6",199,[173,393,1151,827]]]'>Cottom testified at the trial that Eishon had driven his automobile across the center line of the highway and had crashed head-on into Cottom’s car. He was asked on cross-examination whether he had not stated to Eisbon fifteen days after the accident that he had no recollection as to how the collision had happened. Cottom denied that he had ever made such a statement. Eisbon testified that Cottom had admitted to him that he had no recollection of the accident. The lower Court admitted in evidence the hearsay testimony of a State Police officer that Cottom at the hospital <em>seven days after the accident </em>had told him that as he “neared the top of the hill a car came over on my side and hit me”. The question is whether or not such testimony is admissible under the doctrine of consonant statements.</p>
    <p id="b199-5" data-blocks='[["BL_199.7",199,[168,1241,1152,659]]]'>As President Judge Rice said in the leading case of <em>Commonwealth v. Kay, </em><a href="/pa-super/14/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="14 Pa. Super. 376" data-case-ids="827846" data-case-paths="/pa-super/14/0376-01">14 Pa. Superior Ct. 376</a>, 387: “The subject of the admissibility in evidence of the previous statements of a witness consonant with his testimony is not free from difficulty; that is to say, it is not easy to harmonize all the decisions and to deduce therefrom a single general rule governing every case. ... a mere conflict of testimony ... is not, alone, a sufficient reason for the admission of the witness’s prior unsworn statements [made the day after the occurrence].” The consonant statement in that case was held to be <em>inadmissible.</em>

    <p id="b199-6" data-blocks='[["BL_199.8",199,[166,1919,1149,271]]]'>The eases seem to be in agreement that a mere conflict of testimony or the making of inconsistent statements is not alone a sufficient reason for the admission of the witness’s prior unsworn and frequently self-serving or false statements.</p>

Unless the doctrine of consonant statements is narrowly limited and strictly construed, the opportunity for easily manufacturing false or self-serving evidence is tremendous. For example, (a) if a party to an automobile accident stated sometime after the accident that he did not see the red light until too late, or made some other damaging statement, or indeed, (b) if such party decided sometime after the accident what version of the accident it would be advantageous to tell in order to exculpate himself, any self-serving hearsay statements he might make to a dozen or more of his friends would be admissible if his testimony was challenged as a recent fabrication or on the ground that he had made prior inconsistent statements. The practical effect of such a broad rule would be to permit, if not invite, manufactured testimony and often defeat justice, even though theoretically the consonant statement was limited to prove that the testimony at trial was not a recent fabrication. A similar result could be obtained by every criminal who sought to establish an alibi or who made incriminating statements which he could disavow and discredit by self-serving or false declarations to a dozen friends. As stated by the Court in <em>Clever v. Hilberry, </em><a href="/citations/?q=116%20Pa.%20481" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="116 Pa. 481">116 Pa. 481</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.%20647" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="9 A. 647">9 A. 647</a>, the Court said (page 440) : “Nor do they show that the same statements were made before their ultimate effect on the question trying could have been foreseen. ... It would be a very dangerous practice, in our opinion, to permit a party who is about to commence an action against another, to go about making declarations to third persons as to the substance of his cause of action, and then on the trial of that same action to give those declarations in evidence for any purpose. It looks too much like an attempt to manufacture im<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>proper testimony for the very purpose of using it on the trial.”</p>
