It was once held to be ‘whatever is given for the love of God, or for the love of your neighbor, free from any taint or stain of any consideration that is personal or selfish.’ But the purity and unselfishness of the motive came to be regarded by the courts as important only in the moral aspects of the act, and was not insisted on in determining whether a gift was to a charitable use; In Donohugh’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20312" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="86 Pa. 312">86 Pa, 312</a>, charity was defined as something ‘done out of good will, benevolence, a desire to add to the happiness or improvement of our .fellow beings.’ The fact that selfish considerations induced the act done was thus left out of view, and the act alone considered. In the recent case of <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>Boyd v. The Fire Insurance Patrol, <a href="/pa/120/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="120 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="559800" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0624-01">120 Pa. 624</a>, another advance was made, and the court held that a corporation acting in aid and ease of the city of Philadelphia in the preservation of life and property at fires, without gain or profit to itself, was a public charity, notwithstanding the fact that among its acknowledged objects was that of lessening the losses of fire insurance companies. In view of these cases it may be safely said that whatever is gratuitously done or given in relief of the public burdens or for the advancement of the public good is a public charity. In every such case as the public is the beneficiary, the charity is a public charity. As no private or pecuniary return is reserved to the giver or any particular person, but all the benefit resulting from the gift or act goes to the public, it is a ‘purely public charity,’ the word ‘purely’ being equivalent to the word ‘wholly.’ . . .”.</p>

Philadelphia, </em>supra, at p. 413, requires an affirmative answer to that query. The quotation on which they fely is: “Taxes are not penalties but are contributions which all inhabitants are expected to make (and may be compelled to make) for the support of the manifold activities of government. Every <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>inhabitant and every parcel of property receives governmental protection. Such protection costs money. When any inhabitant fails to contribute his share of the costs of this protection, some other inhabitant must contribute more than his fair share of that cost. There are substantial reasons why an institution wholly devoted to public charity should be exempt from taxation, since one of the duties of the government is to provide food and shelter for the poor. Any institution which by its charitable activities relieves the government of part of this burden is conferring a pecuniary benefit upon the body politic, and in receiving exemption from taxation it is merely being given a ‘quid pro quo’ for its services in providing something which otherwise the government would have to provide. Just as the exemption of the property of a municipality is founded on the fact that the municipality is a governmental agency of the State, vested by the State with a part of its sovereignty, and employed in aiding the State in matters of government and the execution of its laws, so likewise the exemption from taxation of institutions of public charity is founded on the fact that such a charity is assuming a share of the public burden. The measure of an institution’s gratuitous aid to those requiring it is the measure by which the government is relieved of its responsibilities. It is therefore just that an institution which assumes pro tanto the taxpayer’s burden should be relieved of its own tax burden.”.</p>

A. </em>case, the Supreme Court had before it a familiar type of organization which had been carrying on its work in Germantown for years and, from all that appears, whose members were residents of Germantown or, at least, of Philadelphia. The local Board of Bevision of Taxes granted <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>an exemption as to three-fifths of the property, but refused the exemption as to the other two-fifths because of the commercial rooming house operation carried on by the association on its property. The question before the Court, therefore, was whether the use of part of its premises as a dormitory was “so clearly ‘necessary for the occupancy and enjoyment’ of the part of the building devoted to plaintiff’s work of charity or benevolence as to entitle it to exemption from paying taxes on that dormitory”, and the Court held that it was not. The heart of the decision comes at p. 409; where the Court says: “. . . In all our decisions on this subject there can be discerned as a prerequisite to the taxation exemption of an institution claiming to be benevolent or charitable that it, or the portion of its property, in respect to which exemption is claimed, must possess an eleemosynary characteristic not possessed by institutions or property devoted to private gain or profit. What is ‘given’ must be more nearly gratuitous than for a price which impresses one as being proportionate to the services rendered. There must be facts which justify a finding that the ‘actual use and occupation’ of the premises is primarily for the designated charitable object and not largely for commercial purposes . . . The fact that all the net proceeds of a business are used for charitable purposes does not make that business a charitable institution. If any business is manifestly commercial in character, it is not relieved of that classification simply because its earnings are devoted to charity. . . .”. The opinion then discusses why the Germantown Y. M. C: A. failed to meet this test with respect to its dormitory, before coming to the paragraph quoted earlier, upon which appellees rely as enunciating the “quid pro quo” theory,-</p>

There are substantial <em>reasons </em>why an institution wholly devoted to public charity should be exempt from taxation, since <em>one </em>of the duties of the government is to provide food and shelter for the poor. Any institution which by its charitable activities relieves the government of part of this burden is conferring a pecuniary benefit upon the body politic, and in receiving exemption from taxation it is merely being given a ‘quid pro quo’ for its services in providing something which otherwise the government would have to provide. . . .”. (Emphasis supplied.) It is to be noted that there the reference is to “reasons” for an exemption to charities and an expansive illustration of one of them. There is nowhere a declaration that relief of “the government of part of this burden” is the only and determinative test of a charity for tax exemption purposes. Can it be denied that the encouragement of certain endeavors that the body politic considers beneficial or desirable is also one of the “reasons” for a tax exemption? Could we, except in the broadest terms, say that the government is being relieved from its burden when we allowed an exemption for property on which was located the offices of a Sunday School Union, or a Board of Home Missions, or real estate on which the Central Pennsylvania Bible Confei’enee or the Pocono Pines Assembly held its religious training sessions, or even on that part of a Y. M. C. A. or a Y. W. C. A. devoted to “religious welfare”? Our traditional concept of the separation of church and state would not permit us to even consider such activities as part of the <em>burden </em>of government.</p>

The taxing authorities to which Section 202, Article II, of the Act of May 21, 1943, applies, are counties and smaller political subdivisions. If the controlling consideration is that the institution claiming charitable exemption will be exempted only to the extent that the taxing authority has an obligation to the beneficiaries of the charity’s labors, then each county, school district, or township would have to limit exemptions in so far as the beneficiaries of the charity were residents of adjoining townships, counties or persons residing in other parts of the Commonwealth. Our research does not uncover a single case where we allowed an otherwise charitable exemption to be denied because the beneficiaries of the charity resided outside the taxing school district or county, or even outside this Commonwealth, for that matter.</p>
