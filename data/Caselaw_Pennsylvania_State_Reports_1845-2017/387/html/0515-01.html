It is not argued that the proceedings in the court below were in any way irregular. Appellant contends that the court below exceeded its jurisdiction in that it assumed the role of a jury in reviewing the after-discovered evidence on the issue of credibility, but a careful reading of the court’s opinion shows that it determined only that in its view, the new evidence wag insufficient to justify the granting of a new trial. Appellant also contends that since the Commonwealth joined in his petition for a new trial, the court below had jurisdiction only to determine whether appellant actually possessed the after-discovered evidence he alleged in his petition to this Court. However, the Act of 1903 specifically gives the court of oyer and terminer jurisdiction to determine whether the grounds are sufficient to justify the granting of a new trial.</p>

The court had jurisdiction, he was represented by competent counsel, and had a fair and impartial trial before an able and just judge. Consequently, the imprisonment under which he is held is lawful: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Harris v.

The question before us is not whether William S. Green was convicted under due process of law. No one disputes that the defendant was accorded due process of law when he was tried for murder in 1947. What the defendant submits to this Court for consideration, and what his learned counsel so ably presented to this Court, both orally and by exhaustive brief, is that, after Green was convicted, the light of events brought into focus the astonishing fact that two of the witnesses who had contributed much of the motive power which had carried him to the penitentiary for life, had committed perjury at his trial. Thus, in this state of affairs, the path of law and logic is invaded by the foliage of irrelevancy when the Majority Opinion says: “. . . it is clear that appellant was convicted and sentenced under due process of law. The court had jurisdiction, he was represented by competent counsel, and had a fair and impartial trial before an able and just judge.” Of course, the trial Court had jurisdiction; of course the appellant was represented by competent counsel; of course, he had a fair and impartial trial before an able and just judge, and, I am happy to add, one of the ablest trial judges in the country. But what the appellant brings to this Court’s attention is that, with all of the Court’s jurisdiction, and <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>with all of the competence of counsel, and with all of the fairness and impartiality of a trial before an able and just judge, the Commonwealth still convicted the wrong man! Not because of any failure of due process of law, but because of false testimony introduced against him. If that contention wears the flesh of truth and reality, no one should seriously maintain that he does not deserve a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[241,786,1147,1002]]]'>The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree on the testimony of three identifying witnesses: James Hargett, Alonzo Suggs, and Lonnie Caldwell. About a year ago, one of these men, James Hargett, confessed that he had given false testimony at the trial. He stated, under oath, that he not only could not identify Green as the killer but that in fact he was not even at the scene of the crime. Further, that it was Alonzo Suggs, one of the other witnesses, who, on the offer of a bribe, suborned him, Hargett, to commit the perjury. This recantation was brought to the attention of the District Attorney of Philadelphia County, who, with commendable dispatch, launched an investigation of his own. Hargett repeated to him the story of his perjurious testimony against Green, and related further that Suggs recently had been calling on him to “stick to his story,” sinee the District Attorney was opening up the case again.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a>

The District Attorney summoned Suggs for questioning and, after various interviews with him, declared that Suggs had made so many contradictory statements that it was “almost impossible to attach credibility to any one statement.” It was also ascertained in the examination conducted by the District Attorney, what was not known prior to the trial, that Suggs had a long criminal record.</p>

Instead of acting like the proverbial district attorney of dramatic fiction — who is portrayed as always demanding that the conviction and sentence, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, remain untouched and untouchable — the District Attorney of Philadelphia County joined with the prisoner in calling upon the Courts to take action which would lift the trapdoors which had closed over the case, so that the light of dispassionate inquiry would reveal whether or not an innocent man was languishing in prison.</p>

The Majority of this Court is of the view that we have no jurisdiction to review in a case of this kind, citing the seeming limitations in the Act of 1903. I cannot believe that the Legislature, in enacting the law of 1903, had in mind interdicting this Court from turning the pages of the record of a murder trial to ascertain if somewhere in the story, innocence did not meet with foul play at the hands of perjury. Although the Act of 1903 does indicate that the proceedings shall terminate if the Trial Court refuses a new trial, it does not declare that in the event the petitioner deems himself aggrieved he may not apply to this Court for correction of any possible error committed in the proceedings authorized by that very Act.</p>

      <em> </em>Moreover, the subject matter in that case had to do with a claim presented to the Board of Arbitration and Claims of Pennsylvania for property damages. Here, we are not considering property or money but a man’s liberty. We have before us the spectacle of a man convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on the testimony of three men, one of whom has declared, repeated, and reiterated in various forms under oath that his testimony was false and that the testimony of another one of the witnesses was false. It cannot be possible that the Legislature ever meant to preclude this Court from correcting, if there was such, an erroneous interpretation of law or facts by a Court of original jurisdiction, nor do I believe that this Court, by its language in the <em>Kaufman </em>case, ever intended to so close the record of a murder case that it could not be opened by this Court when justice requires we do so. In fact, in the very <em>Kaufman </em>case, we quoted with approval what was said in <em>Twenty-First Senatorial District Nomination, </em><a href="/pa/281/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="281 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1087037" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0273-01">281 Pa. 273</a>, namely, “Where, in a statutory proceeding, the legislature fails to provide for an appeal, and because of that omission, the action of the tribunal involved is, generally speaking, considered final <em>... a certiorari to inspect the record, in the broadest sense allowed by our cases, may, nevertheless, issue . . .”</em>

The wording of the statute and its parliamentary setting do not envisage a situation where the Commonwealth would agree to a new trial, because in such a case there would be the natural assumption that if the sovereign power prosecuting a case concedes the necessity for a new trial, the Court would order the requested re-trial as a routine function. Of course, it is not imperative that the Court accept the Commonwealth’s position, but it would need to be a most extraordinary case indeed for the Court to refuse a new trial when both litigating parties are of accord that perjury has been committed and justice requires a re-submission to the jury of the factual question involved.</p>

Assistant District Attorney Harris has gone on record: “For all these reasons,■ together with the fact that I had contacted Mr. Fleming in New York, plus, the work of counsel in the interviewing of all the witnesses, <em>I am convinced that the two witnesses, Fleming .and Hargett, were solicited to commit perjury”</em>

Fleming was suborned to commit perjury by Suggs at the magistrate’s hearing thus corroborating Hargett’s testimony that Suggs was arranging perjured testimony for the trial of Green; further that <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>Suggs committed perjury by testifying that Green came to Ms, Suggs’ room after tbe shooting for the purpose of hiding, for he, Fleming was in this room after the shooting and Green did not come there. 3.

Three witnesses to testify that defendant was <em>not </em>the slayer; 2. One witness, Caldwell, who hesitantly identifies defendant as the slayer, but whose eyesight is poor. 3. One witness, Suggs, that defendant was the slayer and that he afterwards came to his, Suggs’ room. 4. One witness that defendant did not go to Suggs’ room after the slaying. 5. One witness that Suggs did not go to a certain restaurant near the scene of the slaying. 6. Contradictory statements made by Suggs to the investigating assistant district attorney. 7. Two witnesses that Suggs suborned them to commit perjury. ... In the face of this evidence the jury would now have only one credible witness placing the defendant at the scene of the slaying, Caldwell. As to Suggs a jury would be required to sift the testimony very carefully. Since the sole issue here is one of identification and the defense is alibi, great latitude should be permitted in the interest of justice. <em>Counsel for the Commonwealth is of the Opinion that a different result would be probable on a second trial.”</em>

There is not in the whole record the slightest indication, suggestion, or . breath of -suspicion that Hargett confessed to having committed perjury at the original trial because he may have expected any reward for such recantation. To the contrary, so far as his personal fate is concerned, he had less cause to worry by remaining hidden in the forgotten woods of a forgotten trial than to make himself conspicuous by coming forward to confess having committed perhaps the most hideous crime of all, next only to murder itself. To lie and by that lie to rob a man of the precious gem of liberty, to strip from him his Christian name and brand him with a number, to drive him from his home and separate him from all that he holds dear, to entomb him in a living cemetery for the period of his natural life — what greater offense could there be against one’s fellow-man? This is the offense to which Hargett confessed, for no apparent personal advantage or reward. . If Hargett feared that.his victim Green might wreak vengeance on him for having testified against him in Court, he had less to fear from him as he remained helplessly behind stone walls and iron bars than if he were free. In addition, Hargett had less to be concerned about his fellow-witnesses by remaining silent than, through speaking, to incur their enmity and hatred by accusing them of. perjury and evil doing. Thus, Hargett’s sworn confession is not a matter to be taken lightly.</p>

In the absence of such evidence, why should a Court with no personnel to investigate, assume that what has been incontrovertibly established is anything less than the truth? And if it is the truth, on what possible basis can Green .be denied the opportunity to prove his innocence, untrammeled by the perjurious testimony which heretofore played so devastating a part in sending him to prison?

The Act of 1903, which we have been discussing, reads as follows: “Whenever by petition, supported by after discovered evidence, it shall be. made to appear to the supreme court that there is ground for substantial doubt as to the guilt of., any prisoner convicted of murder of the first degree, the said court shall have power to authorize the court of oyer, and terminer- in which such prisoner has been convicted to grant a rule for new trial, nunc- pro tunc, notwith<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>standing the expiration of term in which such prisoner was convicted and sentenced; and thereupon the said court of oyer and terminer may, in its discretion, grant and proceed to hear such rule, as in other cases.

    <p id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[254,906,1149,830]]]'>When the petition, with the after discovered evidence, was presented to us, we decided that there was “ground for substantial doubt as to the guilt” of the prisoner. We came to that conclusion without reservation. We could not have referred the case to the Court of Oyer and Terminer unless we were satisfied of that substantial doubt. What is a substantial doubt? It does not differ from the classical phrase, “reasonable doubt,” except perhaps that it bespeaks an even firmer and more supportable basis for doubt. And in this connection it may be observed that in America the Rocky Mountains could be more easily budged than the rule that no accused person may be deprived of his liberty if there is a reasonable or substantial doubt as to his guilt.</p>

But, of course, there is another step. The Act provides for a hearing before a Court of Oyer and Terminer so that the opposing party may test the authenticity and reliability of the after-discovered evidence. This is done by means of a rule to show cause on the opposing party, namely, the Commonwealth. Such a rule did issue in <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>tlie lower Court. The Commonwealth, in replying to the rule and the allegations in the petition, did the surprising thing of not opposing but agreeing with the petitioner. This is a development which the Act did not anticipate or provide for. The Legislature would naturally have assumed, as already stated, that if the prosecuting authorities were convinced the prisoner should have a new trial, the Court would order such a trial as a matter of course. In view of the fact, however, that the potential opponent envisaged in the Act, namely the Commonwealth, did not in this case oppose the rule, the Court below held no hearing and disposed of the petition on the statements made by the recanting witnesses, plus the observations submitted by the District Attorney’s Office. It thus considered the same evidence which had been considered by us — but it arrived at a conclusion opposite to ours. The lower Court passed on our deliberations and decided we were wrong, namely, that there was no substantial doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner Green. The case then came back to us on appeal, and the majority of this Court perceived nothing strange in the fact that a lower Court had reversed the findings of the Supreme Court!</p>

A man’s whole future is at stake, that is to say, his life, because he has been committed to the penitentiary for the remainder of his days. Thus, putting aside all philosophical considerations and discarding all euphemism, I must note the stark fact that this Court, the last resort of the aggrieved in our Commonwealth, refuses to take cognizance of uncontra;dicted evidence which proclaims that unmitigated perjury sat in the witness chair of a trial which condemned one of Pennsylvania’s citizens to an endless doom.</p>

It says that if the defendant is really innocent he does not need a new trial in order to achieve his freedom. He may go to the Pardon Board: “There is obviously another door open to the appellant if his further restraint is unjustified in the light of subsequent developments. He may ask the Board of Pardons to recommend that the Governor exercise his power to grant a pardon.” But with this statement, the Majority strays more deeply into the fields of inconsistency and unreasonableness for, if the appellant’s imprisonment is “unjustified in the light of subsequent developments,” he is entitled to an acquittal by a jury of his peers, not to a pardon as an act of pity or clemency. If the path of pardon was to be the only or sufficient exit from an unmerited confinement and an undeserved disgrace, there would have, been no need.for the Act of 1903. The Legislature must be given credit for knowing that there was always the possibility of executive clemency in criminal cases, when it passed the law of 1903. It was because the General Assembly believed with reason that a jury’s exoneration would mean more to a person unjustly accused and convicted of murder than a pardon, that it set up the precise machinery blue-printed in the Act of 1903.</p>

I filed a Dissenting Opinion in that case, with which Mr. Justice Jones (now Chief Justice) concurred, but the remainder of the Court, as then constituted, saw no wrong in the Commonwealth’s introducing in evidence, in a trial for murder, the record of a prior conviction of manslaughter, which had been wiped out by a pardon.
