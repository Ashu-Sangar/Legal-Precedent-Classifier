It is of no material significance to the principle involved that, in the <em>Connell </em>case, the plaintiff-parent claimed that there was a mandatory duty on the school district to provide his school-age child with free transportation to and from her non-public school while the instant proceeding merely sought court approval of the school board’s willingness to transport non-public school pupils in public school buses where that could be accomplished without apparent expense to the school district. The matter of the expense to the taxpayers of the school district for the free transportation of non-public school pupils, which was averred in the <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>
      <em>Connell </em>case as constituting a violation of Article X, Section 2 of the State Constitution, played no part in the decision in that case. The matter of alleged expense was expressly not passed upon in view of the <em>ratio decendendi </em>that there is no authority in the School Code for a school board’s transportation of non-public school pupils in school district buses.</p>

    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[120,1152,1151,1063]]]'>The appellant, totally ignoring the primarily controlling question of law as to the scope of the School Code in the premises, irrelevantly enters upon a discussion as to whether the proposed transportation by the plaintiff school district of non-public school pupils would violate Article X, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution which provides that “No money raised for the support of the public schools of the Commonwealth shall be appropriated to or used for the support of any sectarian school.” On the assumption that such transportation of non-public school pupils would not violate the cited constitutionál provision, the appellant asserts that the school board consequently possesses <em>dis-ere lionary </em>power to permit non-public school pupils to be transported in public school buses under the circumstances here averred. A more patent non-sequitur would be hard to imagine. Article X, Section 2 is a negative restraint and not a positive authorization to anyone to do anything.</p>

Orderly judicial procedure requires that nothing more be passed upon by a court than the justiciable question posed for its decision. Beyond that, there is the further familiar principle that a court will not pass on a constitutional question unless it is absolutely necessary to do so in order to decide the case before it: <em>Commonwealth, to use v.

The court below, therefore, correctly refrained from expressing any opinion on the constitutional question which the appellant sought to raise; and we necessarily do likewise. Whether a school district’s transportation of non-public school pupils to and from the site of its public school in public school buses would constitute a violation of Article X, Section 2 of the State Constitution cannot properly come before us until the legislature authorizes or permits such a practice and the constitutionality of its action is directly called in question in a due judicial proceeding.</p>

The court below, in asserted reliance on Buie 2327 of the Buies of Civil Procedure, as authority for its action, entered an order as prayed for.

    <p id="b275-3" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[140,568,1151,1609]]]'>The order allowing the petitioners to intervene in the instant case was plainly improvident. Eule 2327 of our Eules of Civil Procedure prescribes that intervention may be had “during the pendency of an action.” And, there was no action pending at the time the intervention was allowed. Pendency, in practice, has been said to be “the state of an undetermined proceeding”: 70 C.J.S. 420. Black’s Law Dictionary, 3rd Ed., p. 1345, defines the term as “the state of an action, etc., after it has been begun, and <em>before the final disposition of it” </em>(Emphasis supplied). In <em>Rea v. Klein, </em><a href="/wash/14/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="14 Wash. 82" data-case-ids="8530697" data-case-paths="/wash/14/0082-01">14 Wash. 82</a>, 83, the court pertinently stated that “In all of the cases which we have examined, in which the right to intervene has been allowed, there was a proceeding pending, with further steps to be taken before this was concluded.” The action in the <em>Rea </em>case having terminated in the entry of a judgment whereon execution had been issued, it was held that “There was no proceeding pending, in which the parties could intervene.” The correct interpretation of Rule 2327 is, as stated in Standard Pennsylvania Practice, Vol. 2, Parties, §97, p. 429, that “After adjudication, a petition to intervene is too late”, citing <em>Collins v. Martin, </em>30 Dauph. 33, 34. In that case the petitioner did not offer to intervene until after the proceeding had been adjudicated by the court. The application was consequently héld to be untimely. Cf. also <em>De Lucca’s Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/124/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="124 Pa.

Neither cites any authority for the dictum whose inherent error is patent, upon a moment’s reflection, and does not require further discussion. In this connection, it is not inappropriate to note that the right of appeal from the action of a lower court is <em>not </em>constitutionally ordained in Pennsylvania.

They did not have such an interest that they could have joined as original parties to the action and could not have been joined therein within the contemplation of subdivision (3) of Rule 2327 for the very patent reason that they did not have a <em>legally enforceable interest </em>in the subject-matter of the controversy within the intent of subdivision (4) of Rule 2327: see <em>Connell v. Kennett Township Board of School Directors, </em>supra.

Intervention was, therefore, no longer allowable. Nor need Stinner be troubled by the thought that, in some future litigation, he may be met with a plea of <em>res judicata </em>on account of the final order entered herein by the court below. <em>Res judicata </em>as is generally known, binds only parties to the conclusive <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>proceeding. So long as one is not a party thereto, he need have no fear that he will be concluded thereby.

However, after the lower Court had spoken and the School District took no appeal, it then did become necessary, in fact imperative, that the petitioners intervene in order that their rights might be adjudicated by the highest Court in the Commonwealth. Stinner and Macek accordingly applied to the Court below for the right to intervene, and the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, granted the petition. This Court cannot now invalidate the granting of that petition unless it shows that the lower Court abused its discretion. This Court has not done that, nor do I believe it can do so.

Although professing to dispose of the appeal on the ground that the intervenors never had a legally enforceable interest and that, in any event, they may begin all over again, the Court nonetheless passes on the merits of the controversy, thus sinking Stinner’s new lawsuit before he can even launch it. The Majority says that the lower Court was justified in dismissing the plaintiff’s Complaint because of the law laid down in the case of <em>Connell v. Kennett Township Board of School </em>Directors, <a href="/pa/356/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="356 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="470667" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0585-01">356 Pa. 585</a>. After citing the <em>Connell </em>case as controlling the issue raised in this controversy, the Majority proceeds to argue that there is no legal difference between the principle in the <em>Connell </em>case and the one involved here. A mere glance at the <em>Connell </em>case will reveal that it is as far removed from the situation before us as Mercury is from Neptune. In the <em>Connell </em>case, Paul Connell, father of a parochial school student, sought a writ of mandamus against the defendant school directors, averring that the School Code imposed upon them a <em>mandatory duty </em>to furnish free transportation for his daughter on her way to a parochial school. In refuting the plaintiff’s contention this Court said: “We hold that there is no duty, mandatory or directory, <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>ministerial or discretionary, provided by the School Code, which requires the defendant school boards, or any of them, to furnish free transportation for Catherine Connell to and from her residence and the Kennett Consolidated School for the purpose of her attendance at the school of which she is a pupil.” Thus, it should be as clear as looking through a plate glass window that in the <em>Connell </em>case an attempt was being made to <em>compel </em>the school administration to supply free transportation to non-public-school students, whereas in the case at bar, no one is seeking to compel the school authorities to do anything.</p>

Perhaps not, but it cannot be denied that it was in the case. The Court, in pointing out that the plaintiff insisted there was a mandatory duty on the School District to supply free transportation, said: "Defendants deny that there is any such duty, express or implied, imposed upon them, or any of them, by the provisions of the School Code, and aver that <em>the expenditure of public monies for such purpose would be a violation of Article 10, section 2, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth.^</em>

Therefore, anything which can mitigate that load, consistent with maintaining the highest standards in education in accordance with our present system, is welcome to the citizenry of the State. The parochial schools which absorb a not infinitesimal percentage of the number of children of school age eases the public school budget to a not insignificant extent.

Whether it be a private automobile or a public school bus, the driver of the vehicle or its owner can render assistance to the footsore boy or girl on the highway, without authorization from anyone. Of course, if the driver or the school authority can accomplish his charitable act only at the expense of someone else, a principle of man-made law does intervene and it must be respected.

The school here is directly supported by the parishioners of Our Lady of Loretta R. C. Church. The school is not dependent for its support on moneys raised by taxation within the school district. The school has functioned and can function without such support. The test is whether the parochial school would stand to gain or lose if no means of transportation were afforded its students? It would not. Its pupils are legally bound to attend school while they are of school age and although it would inconvenience them to some extent, they would continue to attend said school in all probability. It must be borne in mind that many children attended parochial schools long before the section of the Education Law in question was amended to provide for their transportation. Therefore, applying this test it can readily be seen that the service afforded by this amendment to the law is distinct and independent of the school itself and is intended solely for the convenience of the pupils and to promote their education, and is not 'aid or maintenance’ of a denominational school, as such words are contemplated by article 9, section 4, of the State Constitution.”</p>
