    <p id="b247-13" data-blocks='[["BL_247.21",247,[183,1957,1148,385]]]'>“There was a provision in the deed to the plaintiffs’ property, which adjourned that of the defendants, to the effect that the defendants were permitted to use an auto ramp crossing over the plaintiffs’ land ‘so long as the second floor of (the defendants’ building) is used and occupied as a garage or place for keeping and storing of automobiles.’</p>

The aforesaid company was engaged in the manufacturing business which had no' connection whatsoever to the operating of a garage or the storing of automobiles.</p>

Therefore, the Chancellor, concluded that the rights in the easement over the property of the plaintiffs had terminated.</p>
