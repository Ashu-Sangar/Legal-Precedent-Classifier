The Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Beview of Allegheny County assessed the property of the Airport for the year 1953 at a total of $12,913,139, of which $5,-451,849 was allocated to land and $7,461,290 to buildings, all of which was placed by the Board in the tax exempt column. The Township of Moon, in which 930 of the 1540 acres of the Airport are located, and the Moon Schools Union School District, appealed to the Court of Common Pleas from this action of the Board, claiming that a large part of the Airport should not have been declared tax exempt. The County of Allegheny, which is the owner of the Airport, intervened in the proceedings. The court below concluded that certain portions of the property which it enumerated were taxable, others not. The Board of Property Assessment and the County of Allegheny appeal from the order of the court to that effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Article IX, Section 1, of the Constitution permits the General Assembly to exempt from taxation public property <em>used for public purposes. </em>Undoubtedly the portions of the Airport employed in its actual operation — the landing fields, runways, ramps, hangars, ticket offices, waiting room for passengers, management offices, control tower, repair shops and the like — represent a public use which properly exempts them from taxation; this is conceded by all the parties. There is likewise no question but that property the use of which is <em>reasonably necessary </em>for the efficient operation of the Airport, even though not indispensable or essential thereto, is also entitled to exemption. Nor can such property be denied exemption merely because it is rented out by the Airport and thereby yields a return which serves to reduce expenses, because, where the primary and principal use to which property is put is public, the mere fact that an income is incidentally derived from it does not affect its character as property devoted to a public use: <em>Common</em>

      <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>Applying these principles, then, to the present controversy, the question resolves itself into one of fact rather than of law, namely, did the use of such portions of the Airport property as were declared taxable by the court below constitute a reasonably necessary and incidental part of the Airport itself if it was properly to function? That these commercial activities all served the <em>convenience </em>of the traveling public is undisputed, but that is not enough to warrant a tax exemption; it must be shown that they were needed for the efficient operation of the Airport as a public instrumentality and thereby partook of the character of its own public use. Based on that criterion it would seem clear that the court properly held taxable those areas occupied by concessionaires which could not, by any proper interpretation of “reasonable necessity,” be held to enjoy a tax exempt status, even though their activities may have been similar to those frequently associated with large airports. The court pointed out that while the service of food and refreshment was no doubt an essential activity for the benefit of the patrons of the Airport, it would not include as a reasonable necessity night clubs, cocktail lounges, and the like, and therefore the night club, cocktail lounge, service bars, tavern, roof garden restaurant and cafe, banquet rooms, private lounge and bar, were taxable. Further, that the jewelry store, display windows and areas, drugstore, news stand, bakery, amusement arcade, confectionery, women’s apparel shop, dairy bar, toy shop, car rental service, fruit store, gift shop, motion picture theatre, linen supply service, coin-operated binoculars, and toy helicopter sales stand, were nothing more than attractions for the patrons; therefore they also were taxable. That, as there was no reasonable necessity at the Airport for the bank, the lumber sales office, the <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>insurance agency, the steel company sales office, or the real estate office, all these were likewise taxable. That the hotel was taxable in view of the proximity of other suitable accommodations for travelers who, because of delay in making connections, might be required to stay overnight or for an extended period during the day. That while the parking areas were reasonably required for passengers going to and from the Airport in cabs and automobiles, no such necessity was shown for the refreshment stand, comfort station, or automobile service station within that area, nor for the dwelling houses, all of which were therefore taxable.</p>
    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[174,1026,1150,947]]]'>Following the conclusions thus reached the court ordered that the Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County restore those parts of the property to the taxable classification for the year 1953 and subsequent years with an evaluation in proportion to the valuation placed on the entire property for the respective years. This was in accordance with the established rule that where a property is devoted partly to public and partly to commercial uses it may be divided for the purpose of taxing the part of it engaged in business use and exempting the part devoted to public use: <em>Philadelphia v.

Thus, the opinion for this court deems the answers to the issues involved as being conclusively determined by the lower court’s factual findings to which finality is accorded on the ground that there is evidence to support them. Actually, the material facts are not in dispute. What is called for is a conclusion of law as to whether, under the established facts, the contested uses of the airport property serve a public purpose or are reasonably essential to a public service. The learned court below has correctly observed that “the mere rental of public property to private parties to operate for private gain is not a bar to a claim for exemption and . . . the question turns on whether the use to which the property is put is actually a public one.” After referring to the statutory powers specifically conferred on Allegheny County by Sections 2401 and 2402 of the Second Class County Code of 1953, P. L. 723, the court below further noted that “Appellants [appellees here] do not contend that the operation of a municipal airport is not a public use. They narrow the issue to a question of whether certain operations conducted therein are within that public use.”</p>

With the latter, <em>taxation </em>is the rule and exemption the exception whereas in the case of a county <em>exemption </em>is the rule (see The General County Assess<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>ment Law of 1933, P. L. 853) and taxation the exception. Consequently, while a private citizen claiming exemption from taxation has the burden of showing clearly that his claim comes within a specific statutory provision, the burden is upon one asserting that a county’s property is subject to taxation to prove its taxability.</p>

After conceding that “The 60-room hotel comes, closer to the line of necessity . . the court below went on to say,— “However, in view of the proximity of other suitable accommodations for the traveler who because of delay in making connections is required to stay overnight, or for an extended period during the day and who may need rest, which in air travel is unusual except during occasional periods of dense fog, I would rule it without the exempt class.

Yet, the majority of the court approve the action of the court below on the briefly stated ground “That the hotel was taxable in view of the proximity of other suitable accommodations for travelers who, because of delay in making connections, might be required to stay overnight or for an extended period during the day.”</p>

However, I shall not take the time to enumerate them. For present purposes, it is sufficient to observe that to hold that a private commercial motel on a public highway near the airport supplies the need for sleeping or resting accommodations for arriving or departing airline passengers stretches one’s imagination beyond the breaking point.</p>

Additional proofs can then, and no doubt will, be adduced to demonstrate beyond reasonable dispute that many <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>of tbe presently assessed uses of tbe terminal property are in furtherance of the authorized public use of the airport.</p>
