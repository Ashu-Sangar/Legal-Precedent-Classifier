Moschetta of certain dwelling lots in the Village of Crucible, Pa. Plaintiff filed a prolix complaint of 94 paragraphs in which he sought (a) to vary by parol evidence the terms of a written agreement made between him and John J. Moschetta, and (b) to avoid and nullify a release given by him to Moschetta which covered particularly the properties in suit and all claims arising therefrom. Moreover, plaintiff filed his complaint more than 7 years after he had given Moschetta the above mentioned release. Defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to plaintiffs complaint. The lower Court sustained the preliminary objections, dismissed the complaint and entered judgment for the defendants.</p>

Plaintiff also alleged that when he executed the release on July 6, <em>19J¡8 </em>(which will be hereinafter more specifically referred to), he was partly induced to do so by Moschetta’s statement that new homes would be erected by Moschetta on various lots which he (Moschetta) owned in that part of the adjacent ground known as the “Second Addition”, and that streets would be laid out and improved, and water, gas and electricity made available, and that plaintiff would realize from the sale of the 45 lots which Moschetta conveyed to him larger profits than if he waited until all the properties in the development were sold.</p>

This was the purchase price and did not include the large sums defendants paid for expenses and development. <em>Plaintiff never paid one penny for the purchase or development of the property. </em>Plaintiff further averred that at his suggestion Moschetta subsequently agreed to employ A.

Tapper, an insurance agent, to negotiate for the sale of dwellings, and that this additional expense would be considered as a cost incurred in connection with the resale of the properties, which cost was to be borne not by Palone as the written agreement provided, but by both Palone and Moschetta.
