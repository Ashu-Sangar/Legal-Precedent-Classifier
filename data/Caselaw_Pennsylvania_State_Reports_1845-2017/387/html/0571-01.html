As in many of such cases, no difference of opinion is admissible with respect to the germane rules of construction. It is only a matter of their relative applicability. The basic question involved is whether a specific devise of the testatrix’s “home” property to “three nieces”, appositely named, was a devise to them individually or as a class. One of the nieces having predeceased the testatrix, residuary legatees and the decedent’s executors asserted that the specific devise lapsed to the extent of a one-third share in the property and fell into the residue.</p>

On stipulation of counsel, the court disposed of the proceeding on the pleadings without a jury, there being only one question involved— and that a question of law. After argument by counsel, the learned trial judge entered a final order wherein he found a verdict for the defendant transferee and against the plaintiff executors, entered judgment in favor of the defendant on the verdict and dismissed the complaint with costs following the judgment. In support <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>of its conclusion of law, the court filed an accompanying opinion holding that the specific devise was of an integral property to the testatrix’s three nieces as a class. The executors have appealed the judgment. In addition to the substantive question of law involved, the appellants pose several procedural questions, raising matters not really in dispute, to which we shall refer briefly.</p>

As we read the opinion of the court below, the plaintiffs were not held to be so barred.

By her codicil, dated June 25, 1946, the testatrix declared, “Let the <em>Turnbach girls </em>have <em>my home </em>but have them pay 2,000 for it to help with expenses as I am afraid until my funeral is paid for and the Government takes out their big fee the rest of the children will not have any thing at all” (Emphasis-supplied). By a second codicil, dated September 2, 1946, the testatrix resolutely affirmed, — “I want every thing to be carried out as I have it in my first Codicil-except not to have the Turnbachs (Edna, Emma, and Gladys) to pay $2,000 to the estate for my home. I want to give my home to them, free from any charge. They have been very unfortunate and have been <em>very very </em>good to me” (Underscoring, the testatrix’s).

    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[183,813,1152,883]]]'>The learned court below, guided by the foregoing basic principles of testamentary construction, logically and cogently deduced from the testatrix’s will and codicils a clear intent that the “Turnbach girls”, as a class, were to receive her “home” and the southern end of the lot whereon it was situated. True enough, the testatrix, in devising her “residence property” by her will proper to her “three nieces”, also named them individually. But, the enumeration was obviously for the purpose of fixing with certainty the members of the class (cf. <em>Billings’s Estate, </em>supra) and not for the purpose of individuating aliquot shares in the property. The will named many other persons as beneficiaries thereunder; and confusion was to be avoided. Apparently testatrix left only collaterals to survive her; at least no issue is mentioned or referred to in her will or codicils.</p>

This <em>class </em>devise, the testatrix expressly reaffirmed in her subsequent codicil by positively declaring, — “I want every thing to be carried out as I have it <em>in my first Codicil </em>except not to have the Turnbachs (Edna, Emma, and Gladys) to <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>pay $2,000 to the estate for my home. <em>I want to give my home to them, free from any </em>charge” (Emphasis supplied).

Certainly it is not to be inferred that, while the charge existed under the first codicil, the testatrix could have intended that the three Turnbach nieces were to pay $2,000 upon receiving the whole of the home property but that, if only one of them survived the testatrix, she alone was to pay $2,000 to the estate although she would receive only a one-third interest in the property. Furthermore, if the contention of the appellants were to be adopted, the two surviving sisters would be required to pay to the estate one-tlxird of $17,000 (the stipulated fair value of the home property) notwithstanding that testatrix’s second codicil specifically declares that she wanted “to give [her] home to [the Turnbachs] free from any charge.” One may divide, in relative material interests, a piece of commercial real estate, but he cannot divide “a home”. And, that is what the testatrix devised to her “nieces”— the “Turnbach girls”.</p>

Thus, the residuary clause apportions the pecuniary legacies to the fund to be derived from the executors’ conversion of all of the deceased’s personal property. The plainly expressed scheme of the residuary clause is that, if the fund derived from the prescribed conversion proves insufficient to pay in full all of the pecuniary legacies, each was to suffer a proportionate reduction. But, if the fund was more than enough for the purpose, then each pecuniary legacy should share proportionately in the surplus. Nowhere, however, is there the slightest suggestion that the fund for the payment of the pecuniary legacies was to be augmented by any interest in or charge upon the “home” property except for the provision in the first codicil which the testatrix abated a few months later by her second codicil.</p>
