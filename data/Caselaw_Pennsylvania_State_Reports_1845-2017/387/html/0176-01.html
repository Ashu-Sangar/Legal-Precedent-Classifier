Manning, to compel the defendant Civil Service Commission of the Borough of Millbourne, to grant him a hearing regarding his discharge from the position as patrolman on the borough police force for reasons that he felt were not valid. The court below, sit<a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>ting without a jury, entered a decree nisi ordering the defendant to grant a hearing to plaintiff.

    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[263,627,1151,1277]]]'>The plaintiff was appointed chief of police of the borough by its council at a council meeting on January 3, 1951 at an annual salary of $3,600. This was plaintiff’s first employment on the borough police force, he never having served the borough as a patrolman previous to being sworn in as chief of police. In September, 1951, the borough council passed an ordinance relating to the police department whereby the plaintiff was again designated as chief of police at the same salary and four other individuals were appointed as patrolmen at a salary of $3,000 per annum. Plaintiff performed the duties of chief of police from January, 1951, until February, 1954, at which time the office of chief of police was abolished, the police force reduced to a total of four patrolmen, and plaintiff became a patrolman. Plaintiff performed the duties of patrolman until December, 1954, when, at a regular meeting of the borough council, he was dismissed from the Millbourne police force on charges preferred by a fellow policeman. It was from that dismissal that he requested a hearing before the Civil Service Commission which was denied on the ground that he had no civil service status.</p>

The commission shall certify for each existing vacancy from the eligible list, the names of three persons thereon, or a lesser number where three are not available, who have received the highest average. The council shall thereupon, with sole reference to the merits and fitness of the candidates, make an appointment from the three names certified, unless they make objections to the commission as to one or more of the persons so certified for any of the reasons stated in section 1177 of this act. Should such objections be sustained by the commission, as provided in said section, the commission shall thereupon strike the name of such person from the eligible list and certify the next highest name for each name stricken off.

Hereafter each and every appointment to and promotion in the police force or as fire apparatus operators paid directly by the borough in every borough shall be made only according to qualifications and fitness, to be ascertained by examinations which shall be competitive as hereinafter provided.”. There is absolutely no evidence in the record that Manning ever took a competitive examination or qualified for appointment <em>as a patrolman </em>under the procedure set forth in §1178 of The Borough Code quoted above. Plaintiff’s appointment as a patrolman, being in violation of the statutory prerequisites for such appointment, was therefore illegal. Inasmuch as he was never validly employed under The Borough Code as a patrolman, he is not entitled to the protection of its provisions regarding a hearing. In <em>Detoro v.

An administrative officer is not permitted to violate such declared policy and no court may sanction its violation. An employment which in its inception violates such an act as this is illegal and against public policy and it is the duty of the administrative officers of the state or its civil subdivisions to discontinue any illegal employment when they note its illegality. The illegality should not go unchallenged. In such a case the defense is not waived by the action of the representatives of the municipality.”.</p>

      <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>Plaintiff contended in the court below, and also in this Court, that he was validly appointed as chief of police in accordance with the second paragraph of §1178 of The Borough Code, supra, and therefore could not be discharged from his position as a patrolman without a civil service hearing. A careful reading of the record leaves grave doubt as to whether the plaintiff was ever legally appointed as chief of police in accordance with §1178. But be that as it may, the issue here is whether Manning was validly employed as a patrolman. Section 1178 provides that “Every position or employment in the police force . . . shall be filled only in the following manner: . . .”. There is no evidence that the procedure set forth for employment as a patrolman was followed when Manning was first employed in January, 1951, or at any time thereafter. The section is clearly mandatory and admits of no exception when a patrolman is to be appointed. To grant plaintiff’s contention would require us to read an exception into §1178 to the effect that every position or employment in the police force, <em>unless filled by reduction in ranh, </em>shall be filled only in the manner provided. This we cannot do. The Civil Service Act of June 5, 1941, P. L. 84, 53 PS §351.1 et seq., originally dealt with appointments in police forces in boroughs, incorporated towns and townships of the first class. Section 14 of this Civil Service Act, 53 PS §351.14, is practically identical with §1178 of The Borough Code except that it provides: “Every position or employment, except that of chief of police or equivalent official, <em>unless filled by promotion, reinstatement or reduction </em>shall be filled only in the following manner: . . .”. (Emphasis supplied). The Civil Service Act of 1841 was expressly repealed in so far as it related to boroughs by The Borough Code of 1947. The Legis<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>lature lias clearly indicated, by removing tbe above italicized words from tbe comparable provisions in tbe Borough Code, that the position of patrolman of a borough can only be filled in accordance with the procedure set forth therein.

Manning was appointed Chief of Police by Borough Council on January 3, 1951, after and pursuant to the Civil Service Commission’s recommendation and <em>certification </em>of Manning to Borough Council for the office of Chief of Police. This recommendation and certification were made by the Civil Service Commission after a lengthy examination of Manning by the Chairman of the Commission who was duly authorized to do so by the Commission. Manning served until March 1, 1954, a period of over three years. The office of Chief of Police was then abolished and Manning was reduced to the rank of patrolman, in which rank he continued to serve until December 6, 1954, when he was dismissed summarily and without hearing.
