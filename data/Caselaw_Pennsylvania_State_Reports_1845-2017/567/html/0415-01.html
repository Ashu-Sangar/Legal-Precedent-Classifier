On that day, Detective McDermott and another detective transported Appellant, who had remained in custody, from prison to the Police Administration Building. They placed Appellant in an interview room at approximately 1:00 p.m., at which point, Appellant asked why he was being charged. Detective McDermott advised <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>Appellant that the authorities had evidence in the form of statements from persons who had implicated him in the Vargas and Carrisquilla shootings. The detectives proceeded to complete the necessary biographical form with Appellant’s input. Between 1:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., Detective McDermott informed Appellant on several occasions about the charges that the Commonwealth was prepared to bring against him, and told him what Roman and Ortiz had said about him in the statements they had made respectively to the police regarding the shootings. On apparently the last of those occasions, Detective McDermott showed Appellant the statements that Roman and Ortiz had given. At about 4:50 p.m., Appellant told Detective McDermott that he did not shoot Carrisquilla; that he did not want to be blamed for her death; that he shot only Vargas; and that he wanted to set the record straight by making a statement. Detective McDermott advised Appellant that before he could make a statement, he had to be given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Detective McDermott gave Appellant the appropriate warnings, which Appellant acknowledged and waived, both orally and in writing. Detective McDermott then took down Appellant’s statement in question and answer form.</p>

The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.

Looking at the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that Appellant’s initial, unwarned admissions regarding his involvement in the shootings and desire to make a statement, although the subject of a <em>Miranda </em>violation, were voluntary within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Likewise, Appellant’s subsequent, warned confession was voluntary, the result of his free and rational choice. Nothing about the environment in which Appellant found himself or in the police’s manner was oppressive. Appellant does not argue, nor would the record support the contention, that the authorities subjected Appellant to threats, intimidation, deceit, improper inducements or deprivation 'at any point during his custodial interrogation.

Nevertheless, the majority concludes, this does not mean that the Detective’s words and actions could not also have been reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from appellant and, as such, constituted the functional equivalent of express questioning for purposes of <em>Innis. </em>Although the majority purports to be focusing upon appellant’s “perceptions” in this regard, its discussion is confined to Detective McDermott’s testimony concerning his general approach to investigations and his subjective motivations. The majority concludes that, “when Detective McDermott explained to [a]p-pellant that he had been implicated in the shootings, telling him what statements [George] Roman [an individual who sold drugs with appellant but did not participate in the killings] and [Arisbol] Ortiz [one of appellant’s accomplices in the murders] had made to the police concerning his involvement, the Detective should have known that his comments and conduct were reasonably likely to evoke an effort on [appellant's part to defend himself and give his own version of his involvement in the crimes at issue.” Majority Op. at 404. The majority finds that the Detective “testified as much” when he stated at the suppression hearing that if appellant “want[ed] to make a statement about his action” it would be McDermott’s “intention to talk to him about the case” and when he later stated at trial that “one of the reasons” he told appellant about the evidence against him was because he was “hopeful” that appellant “would give a statement admitting to what he did.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> The majority then summarily concludes, as a matter of law, that Detective McDermott’s perceived subjective intention — which was never conveyed to appellant — rendered his otherwise perfectly lawful conduct in informing appellant of the damning statements that Roman and Ortiz had made about him, the functional equivalent of a custodial interrogation, which had to be preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>

      <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>As a preliminary matter, it must be emphasized that appellant also testified on the question of suppression and, in point of fact, he never claimed that the Detective’s summary of the evidence against him caused him to make his initial incriminating statement. Accordingly, it appears that appellant’s actual perceptions were not as the majority divines them from its reading of the Detective’s testimony about <em>his </em>intentions.</p>
    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[255,728,1156,1652]],["BL_573.1",573,[223,341,1154,630]]]'>But even laying aside the majority’s creative reading of the Detective’s testimony to get at appellant’s perceptions, I see no error in the trial judge’s finding that there was no interrogation here. Detective McDermott’s unexceptional testimony that, as a general matter, if a suspect wants to make a statement, it would be his intention to talk to the suspect, and that he was “hopeful” this appellant would confess when the facts were laid out to him, hardly made his accurate disclosure of factual information conduct that was “reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.” Indeed, if such factual disclosures satisfy the <em>Innis </em>standard solely because of the officer’s undisclosed subjective intent, as the majority holds, then it is hard to imagine any circumstance involving a disclosure of factual information that could not be labeled “interrogation.” Any competent police officer who has arrested a suspect for a major crime is “hopeful” that the suspect will confess. However, “[ojfficers do not interrogate a suspect simply by hoping that he will incriminate himself.” <em>Arizona v. Mauro, </em><a href="/us/481/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="481 U.S. 520" data-case-ids="6217720" data-case-paths="/us/481/0520-01">481 U.S. 520</a>, 529, <a href="/us/481/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="172" data-cite="481 U.S. 520" data-case-ids="6217720" data-case-paths="/us/481/0520-01">107 S.Ct. 1931</a>, <a href="/us/481/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="481 U.S. 520" data-case-ids="6217720" data-case-paths="/us/481/0520-01">95 L.Ed.2d 458</a> (1987). There is nothing nefarious in an officer harboring such a hope. Nor is there anything wrong with hoping that even a bald disclosure of the factual basis for the charges will lead a particular suspect to confess his involvement. Because the majority focuses on the Detective’s alleged subjective intent to the exclusion of all other’ factors — such as the suspect’s own testimony as to his own perceptions, the duration of custody, the amount and type of interaction with police while in custody, the physical surroundings, evidence that police knew the suspect was susceptible to being influenced for some subjective reason, the nature of the suspect’s response to the factual disclosures, and the suspect’s familiarity with the <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>criminal justice system-the majority has erected a <em>per se </em>rule which renders an officer’s subjective intent, even if undisclosed, the exclusive and determining factor in the <em>Innis </em>inquiry. In addition, the testimony cited by the majority simply does not amount to proof that Detective McDermott knew, or should have known, that his disclosure of accurate factual information in this case was likely to elicit an incriminating statement from this particular suspect. Detective McDermott’s statements as to his subjective hope shed no light whatsoever on appellant’s perception of the situation which, the majority acknowledges, is the relevant focus under <em>Innis.</em>

Nor was he denied food, water, or bathroom breaks. In fact, appellant testified that the police did not mistreat him in any way. <em>See </em>N.T. 7/30/99, at 234. The challenged statements by the Detective consisted of a few brief, intermittent, factually accurate references to the evidence against appellant over the course of several hours.
