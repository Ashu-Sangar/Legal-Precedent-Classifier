It based its decision on the grounds that the statute was “breathtakingly broad,” <em>id. </em>at 2060, and that the state court gave no deference to the mother’s determination that more limited visitation with the third party (grandparents) was in the best interests of her children.</p>

First, 1 believe that the child custody provisions of the Domestic Relations Code, 23 P.S. §§ 530P5314, are due greater emphasis. The majority downplays the significance of the legislative scheme primarily because “Appellee has never relied on a statutory provision and instead has invoked the common law doctrine of in loco parentis.” Maj. Op. at 918. Regardless of the arguments chosen by a particular litigant, however, where the Legislature has created a framework governing all facets of the resolution of child custody disputes, it is questionable whether a common law doctrine can retain independent viability, other than as a reference for contextualizing the legislative policy choices made. <em>See </em>N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction § 50:05 (6th ed.2000) (“general and comprehensive legislation, where course of conduct, parties, things affected, limitations and exceptions are minutely described, indicates a legislative intent that the statute should totally supersede and replace the common law dealing with the subject matter”). At all events, a common law doctrine may not, after a statutory pronouncement on the same subject, continue to develop in a manner inconsistent with the statute. <em>See <a href="/a2d/744/1255-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="744 A.2d 1255" data-case-ids="11495457,95752" data-case-paths="/a2d/744/1255-01,/pa/560/0334-01">id.</a> </em>§ 50:01 (“In cases of conflict between legislation and the common law, legislation will govern because it is the latest expression of the law.”).

Thus, a faithful application of the in loco parentis doctrine requires, at a minimum, due regard to the legal definitions of the relevant relationships. In this case, because Appellee’s relationships with Appellant and with A.M. are not recognized as familial relationships under Pennsylvania law, <em>see </em>23 P.S. §§ 1704, 2903, I believe that the Court’s decision to recognize her claim to in loco parentis status vis-á-vis A.M. marks not only a departure from established common law principles, but also one which appears to be in conflict with an expressed legislative design.</p>
    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[260,1545,1156,667]]]'>There is little doubt that Appellee established close relationships with both A.M. and Appellant. Certainly, those relationships, as well as Appellee’s sincere interest in A.M.’s well being, denote important concerns in the formulation of policy concerning child custody. But there are respectable competing considerations as well, considerations to which the Legislature, whose responsibility it is to weigh such factors, has in this instance accorded primacy. As the legislative policy is currently fashioned, emotional bonds and a demonstrated custodial interest, outside of the context of legally recognized familial relationships, are not sufficient grounds to confer standing to petition for child custody over and against the natural parent’s interests.</p>
