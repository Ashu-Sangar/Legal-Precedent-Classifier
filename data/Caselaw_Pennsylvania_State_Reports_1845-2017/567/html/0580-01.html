In the language of <em>Fulton, </em>there are three conditions necessary for a valid compensatory tax. First, a State must, as a threshold matter, identify ... the intrastate tax burden for which the State is attempting to compensate. Second, the tax on interstate commerce must be shown roughly to approximate — but not exceed — the amount of the tax on intrastate commerce. Finally, the events on which the interstate and intrastate taxes are imposed must be substantially equivalent; that is, they must be sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutually exclusive proxies for each other.</blockquote>

That assertion overlooks the fact tha1 the material, labor, and financing necessary to construct or expand manufacturing operations potentially entail interstate elements.</p>

The <em>PPG I </em>opinion contains a statement which, at first glance, appears to hold that the ''reach-back” capability is mandated by the <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>statute. In particular, the court stated, "The Commonwealth Court, thus correctly determined that PPG’s headquarters’ properly and payroll are entitled to the manufacturing exemption only insofar as the headquarters’ employees administer manufacturing plants actually located in the Commonwealth.” <em>PPG I, </em><a href="/pa/567/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="567 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="404483" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0565-01">567 Pa. at 572</a>, 790 A.2d at 256. The issue decided in that portion of the opinion, however, did not pertain to whether or not the statute mandated that any of the headquarters property or payroll should be exempt, but rather dealt with the question of whether out-of-state manufacturing activities entitled PPG to an exemption for the portion of the headquarters administering such activities. There was no discussion of the primary question of whether any of the headquarters capital stock should be exempt in the first instance, on the ground that no manufacturing occurred at headquarters. Taken in context, then, the Court's statement merely served to exclude from the exemption that portion of the headquarters associated with out-of-state manufacturing activities.</p>
