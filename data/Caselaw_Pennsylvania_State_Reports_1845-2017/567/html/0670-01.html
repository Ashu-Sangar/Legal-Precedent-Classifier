In addition, the provision for a chairman who can act as a “tie-breaker” eliminates the possibility of a legislative deadlock on reapportionment.... At the same time the Legislature’s expertise in reapportionment matters is essentially retained.</blockquote>

The petition at 7 MM 2002, however, does not identify the appellants as individuals authorized to vote and, thus, we would normally dismiss this petition for lack of standing.

The appellants at 236 MM 2001 identify themselves as the directors of The Neighborhood Club of Bala Cynwyd, a civic association. They are also identified, however as residents, voters and taxpayers in Lower Merion Township. Their arguments reiterate those that are presented by the appellants at 231 MM 2001.

I write, therefore, to express my own position that facets of the Commission’s present plan for reapportioning the Pennsylvania Legislature test the outer limits of justifiable deference, at least in the absence of some specific explanation for why the constitutional prerequisites of compactness and respect for political subdivisions cannot be accommodated simultaneous with the maintenance of substantial equality of population and enforcement of voting interests of protected groups in the manner prescribed by federal law.</p>
