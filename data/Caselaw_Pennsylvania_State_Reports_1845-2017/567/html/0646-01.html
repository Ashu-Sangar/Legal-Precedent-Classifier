First, R.M. suffered from potentially serious behavioral problems, frequently acting in a violent and disruptive manner in the home environment.

The court therefore granted MCCYS legal custody of R.M., with authority to grant medical and educational consent in lieu of parental authorization. It declined, however, to award physical custody in favor of the agency, but rather, restored physical custody to Appellants.</p>

The Superior Court distinguished <em>M.B., </em>however, on the basis that MCCYS had invoked the Juvenile Act with respect to R.M. and included the essential allegation of dependency. According to the court, the petition was sufficient to comport with due process requirements, since it clearly communicated the nature of Appellants’ interests at stake. Additionally, the Superior Court attributed significance to the fact that the circumstances giving rise to the dependency determination were elicited for the first time at the hearings before the juvenile court. Regarding the claim that MCCYS violated statutory procedures, the Superior Court conceded that MCCYS’s actions were not in strict compliance with the CPSL. Nevertheless, since MCCYS did adhere to other requirements that resulted in notice to Appellants and enabled them to secure representation for purposes of the juvenile hearings, the court concluded that any departures constituted harmless error.</p>

Although MCCYS’s petition did allude to the sexual misconduct involving R.M.’s brother, <em>see supra </em>note 3, this reference was couched in terms of describing aspects of the alleged parental abuse and arguably did not assert the involvement of R.M. in an actual incident. Thus, while certainly the Superior Court was correct in its conclusion that Appellants were adequately apprised of the nature of their interests at stake, in the circumstances presented we conclude nonetheless that they were not provided sufficient notice to satisfy constitutional due process mandates. <em>Cf.

Here, however, the variance between MCCYS’s allegations and the proofs (and decision) is plainly material, as Appellants were required to mount a defense against pointed contentions of grave misconduct on their part. Particularly in the face of such directed allegations, it simply cannot be fairly expected of them to defend against claims based upon an alternative set of circumstances not stated. <em>Cf.
