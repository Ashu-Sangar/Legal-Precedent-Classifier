In making this determination, this Court is ever mindful of the manufacturing exemption's long history and the potential chilling effect that an ultimate decision holding the manufacturing exemption unconstitutional would have on manufacturing in the Commonwealth.

Curiously, in i1s reply brief to this Court, PPG "emphasizes that it has never sought to have the [manufacturing] exemption itself declared unconstitutional." (Reply Brief for Appellant at 13). We find this assertion disingenuous. PPG, throughout these proceedings, has challenged the manufacturing exemption on constitutional grounds, claiming a violation of the Commerce Clause. PPG cannot now, at this advanced stage of the proceedings, retract its constitutional "attack [on] the goose that has been laying golden eggs for it." <em>See </em>Peter D.
