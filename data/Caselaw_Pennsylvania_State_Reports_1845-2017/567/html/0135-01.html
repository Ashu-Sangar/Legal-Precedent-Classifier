Appellee was incarcerated in New York from February 3, 1999, to March 13, 1999. On February 12, 1999, while Appellee served his sentence in New York, the Commonwealth lodged a detainer against him. On March 5, 1999, eight days before his release from prison in New York, Appellee agreed to waive his extradition and return to Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth obtained custody of Appellee on March 13, 1999, and placed him in Dauphin County Prison on March 15,1999.</p>

On that day, the trial <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>court conducted an evidentiary hearing and subsequently granted Appellee’s motion.

In determining that the Commonwealth obtained custody of Ap-pellee via the IAD, the Superior Court focused on the fact that a detainer was lodged against Appellee while he was incarcerated. <em><a href="/a2d/757/0959-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="757 A.2d 959" data-case-ids="11243854" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0959-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/757/0959-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="757 A.2d 959" data-case-ids="11243854" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0959-01">at 961</a>. The Superior Court concluded that the mere filing of a detainer was sufficient to trigger the Commonwealth’s obligation pursuant to Art. IV of the IAD, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9101 to bring Appellee to trial within 120 days. Since Appellee was not called for trial within 120 days of his return to the custody of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth did not offer good cause regarding why Appellee was not brought to trial within this time, the Superior Court concluded that the trial court properly granted Appellee’s motion to dismiss.</p>

      <em>DISCUSSION</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.7",258,[252,1431,1155,581]]]'>Appellee contends that the IAD provides a mechanism that allows a sentenced prisoner located in the sending state to be brought to the receiving state to face outstanding charges in that state. According to Appellee, the Commonwealth lodged a <em>capias </em>“as a detainer” against Appellee, while he was serving his sentence in Buffalo, New York. Appellee contends that such an act invokes Article IV of the IAD, and the Commonwealth had 120 days to bring Appellee to trial. Ap-pellee further argues the fact that he completed his sentence in New York before being returned to Pennsylvania does not preclude the application of the IAD.</p>

Article III of the IAD allows a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged to request that he or she be transferred to the jurisdiction that filed the detainer and be brought to trial within 180 days of his or her request. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9101, Article III. Appellee never made such a request and, accordingly, never triggered the 180 day period of Article III. Moreover, contrary to the conclusion of both the trial court and the Superior Court, the Commonwealth never triggered the 120 day period of Article IV. The error of both the trial court and the Superior Court was their determination that the lodging of a detainer against Appellee implicated Article IV of the IAD. The clear language of Article IV indicates otherwise: “[t]he appropriate officer .... shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he <em>has lodged a detainer </em>.... made available .... <em>upon presentation of a imitten request </em>for temporary custody or availability.....” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9101, Article IV(a) (emphasis added). By its terms, Article IV of the IAD requires: (1) an already lodged detainer, and (2) a subsequent written request for temporary custody or availability. The record contains nothing to show that the Commonwealth made a written request for the temporary custody or availability of Appellee subsequent to filing a detainer against him. Accordingly, the Commonwealth never triggered the 120 day period of Article IV of the IAD.</p>
