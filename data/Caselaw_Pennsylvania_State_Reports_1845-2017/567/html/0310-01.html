Moreover Appellant has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by Agent Reem’s error, or trial counsel’s failure to object. Additionally, Appellant presents no argument that counsel’s omitted objection was not a legitimate trial tactic. It is apparent from the record that counsel attempted to refute the inculpatory serological evidence with what he believed to be exculpatory DNA evidence. The position of the defense was that DNA testimony, presented later in the trial during defense testimony, would exculpate Appellant by showing definitively that it was not his saliva.

The affidavit of Dr. Shields, presented for the first time to this Court, simply does not address the deficiency recognized by the PCRA court in Appellant’s argument. Dr. Shields makes hypothetical conclusions regarding Dr. Bing’s testing which were already refuted at trial. Dr. Shields did not do an independent DNA test, rather he reviewed the tests done previously and the trial testimony. From this, he makes assertions such as: “If all ■controls were judged to have worked as required, and the DNA attributed to the evidence and known samples was typed correctly, .... then the only scientifically valid conclusion is that much of the evidence .... was not left by the victim or Mr. Hawkins, but by some other unknown individual.” Shield’s affidavit at 3.

First, I do not agree with the majority’s assessment of trial counsel’s failure to object to the erroneous calculations of FBI Agent Richard Reem, the Commonwealth’s expert. Agent Reem testified that: saliva found on the victim’s body was from a person with type AB blood who was also a “secretor”; only one in 143 African-Americans possesses both of those characteristics; and one of them is Appellant. In his closing argument, the prosecutor described Appellant’s inclusion in this serological category as “the critical piece of evidence” and emphasized to the jury that “[y]ou can exclude 99.3% of the black population from having left this sample of saliva [but] you can’t exclude [Appellant].”</p>
    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.7",462,[252,1152,1170,997]]]'>It appears, however, that Agent Reem miscalculated: 17.6 percent of the African American population, or roughly 1 in 6 — not 0.7 percent, or 1 in 143 — are type AB secretors. Given the magnitude of the witness’s error and the predictable use made by the Commonwealth of the erroneous statistic, I do not view trial counsel’s failure to challenge the witness’s testimony as a legitimate trial tactic. Trial counsel’s expectation of offering DNA evidence that would exculpate Appellant was no reason not to point out the flaw in the Commonwealth’s serological evidence. Failing to do so risked the possibility (later realized) that the DNA evidence would prove less . convincing than expected, while Agent Reem’s testimony remained unchallenged. Nevertheless, although I consider the case a very close one, upon a review of the record, in light of the other substantial evidence against Appellant, and with due consideration to the defense evidence presented at tidal, I would ultimately conclude that Appellant has failed to meet his present burden of establishing the degree of prejudice necessary to obtain post-conviction relief.</p>

In support of this argument, Appellant has attached to his brief, <em>inter alia, </em>copies of affidavits from Appellant’s mother, attesting to the paternal abuse, and from Dr. Tepper, stating that if he had been provided with the information at issue, he would have diagnosed Appellant as suffering from intermittent explosive disorder and possibly post-traumatic stress disorder and would have concluded that, at the time of the current offense, Appellant’s ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.</p>

On the basis of this information, Dr. Tepper opined that Appellant did not suffer from a mental illness, major thought disorder, or organic brain dysfunction, but that he kept very tight control over his emotions and might lose control intermittently.

While certainly courts emphasize the obligation of capital defense counsel to undertake an adequate penalty-phase investigation of potential mitigating circumstances, <em>see generally Commonwealth v. Michael, </em><a href="/pa/562/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="562 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="225941" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0356-01">562 Pa. 356</a>, 377, <a href="/a2d/755/1274-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="755 A.2d 1274" data-case-ids="11219557,225941" data-case-paths="/a2d/755/1274-01,/pa/562/0356-01">755 A.2d 1274</a>, 1285 (2000)(Saylor, J., dissenting)(citing cases), this case is distinguishable from those in which trial counsel failed to investigate critical aspects of a mitigation defense that a competent attorney would have presented at the penalty phase of trial. <em>See, e.g., Lockett v. Anderson, </em><a href="/f3d/230/0695-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="230 F.3d 695" data-case-ids="1094323" data-case-paths="/f3d/230/0695-01">230 F.3d 695</a>, 711 (5th Cir.2000). Here, trial counsel’s investigation/preparation subsumed extensive interviews between Appellant and an attorney and licensed clinical psychologist with particularized expertise in the mitigation arena, as well as interviews between the expert and Appellant’s central family members. Although it may be that facts were concealed from Dr. Tepper by Appellant and his family in the pre-trial interviews, I do not believe that the brief and affidavits presented establish a basis for faulting trial counsel for any such omissions.<a class="footnotemark">1</a> Accordingly, I am able to join in the majority’s disposition of this claim.</p>
