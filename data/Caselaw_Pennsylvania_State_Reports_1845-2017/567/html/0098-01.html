Since lead paint was not listed among or closely related to the examples of pollutants offered by the policy, the trial court reasoned, it was possible that the exclusion was not meant to, and did not, apply to residential lead paint poisoning claims. As for the methods of transmission, the trial court noted that numerous jurisdictions had determined that terms such as “discharge” and “dispersal” were terms of art intended to denote environmental pollution. In the court’s view, that interpretation of the terms was entitled to as much weight as any other, and rendered the terms ambiguous with respect to residential pollution. Finally, the court noted, as a supporting although not decisive factor, the divided state of the law among other jurisdictions on this issue.

This question was answered affirmatively on the basis of the record: a manufacturer’s report referred to the irritating effects of Euco Floor Coat and noted that its constituents included chemicals known 'to be toxic. <em>See id. </em>at 606-08, <a href="/a2d/735/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="735 A.2d 100" data-case-ids="11533791,56742" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0100-01,/pa/557/0595-01">735 A.2d at 107-08</a>. The Court turned then to the more difficult question of whether the exclusion’s requirement of an “actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape” of a pollutant was similarly unambiguous when judged against the facts of the case. Noting that the policy did not define those terms, we proceeded to determine their natural, plain, and ordinary meanings, and drew from those meanings the conclusion that the exclusionary language had been intended “to comprehend all such types and degrees of movement.” <em>Id. </em>at 608-09, <a href="/a2d/735/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="735 A.2d 100" data-case-ids="11533791,56742" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0100-01,/pa/557/0595-01">735 A.2d at 108</a>. In reaching this conclusion, the Court specifically rejected the argument, made by Madison and accepted by the trial court, that the words at issue were terms of art in environmental law and, as such, implied a discharge or dispersal “into the environment.” Such argument, <em>Madison </em>explained, did not comport with the principles of contract interpretation previously cited: the trial court, in striving to discern the considerations underlying the policy language, had failed to acknowledge and apply its plain meaning. <em>See id. </em>at 609-610, <a href="/a2d/735/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="735 A.2d 100" data-case-ids="11533791,56742" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0100-01,/pa/557/0595-01">735 A.2d at 108</a>.</p>

In determining that it is, the Superior Court read the exclusionary language as encompassing all types and degrees of movement. <em>Steely, </em><a href="/a2d/746/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="746 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="11471932,11471981,11472060,95747,95758" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/0607-01,/a2d/746/0607-02,/a2d/746/0607-03,/pa/560/0527-02,/pa/560/0528-01">746 A.2d at 612</a>. The Superior Court was correct to conclude that <em>Madison </em>endorses a plain meaning approach. But just as in determining the scope of the term pollutant it is necessary to focus on the particular substance, in determining whether there has been a discharge, dispersal, release, or escape, it is necessary to assess the specific form of movement in question. Thus, we clarify that the critical question 'is whether the process by which lead-based paint becomes available for human ingestion/inhalation unambiguously involves a type of motion that can be characterized as a discharge, dispersal, release, or escape. <em>See Danbury, </em>727 A.2d at 284 (observing that such terms “limit the ways ‘by which the pollutant must travel from a contained place to the injured person’s surroundings and then cause injury’ ” (quoting <em>Lefrak Org., Inc. v.

Dr. Silbergeld stated that lead-based paint deteriorates and degrades (slowly or rapidly, depending upon condition and use), and that the painted surface sheds microscopic dust through the process of exfoliation. According to Dr. Silbergeld, this process of surface degradation occurs continuously at a slow rate. Dr. Girard stated that lead-based paint abrades and that it “chips, peels, chalks, or otherwise breaks down into dust.” Mr. Shockley explained that lead-based paint deteriorates or abrades, producing paint dust, chips, and flakes. Following the experts’ lead, the Superior Court concluded that lead-based paint “over time exfoliated, abraded, flaked, deteriorated or otherwise <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>moved off of the walls.... ” <em>Steely, </em><a href="/a2d/746/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="746 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="11471932,11471981,11472060,95747,95758" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/0607-01,/a2d/746/0607-02,/a2d/746/0607-03,/pa/560/0527-02,/pa/560/0528-01">746 A.2d at 612</a>. Indeed, the United States Congress used similar language when, in the Residential Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act, it identified the ingestion of household dust containing lead from “deteriorating or abraded” lead-based paint as the most common cause of lead poisoning in children. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204851" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 4851">42 U.S.C. § 4851</a>(a).</p>

Rather, the process of surface degradation occurs continually, but at a slow rate. <em>See Sphere Drake, </em>990 F.Supp. at 243 (observing that, in accepted usage, the terms “discharge, dispersal, release, or escape” do not encompass the type of “movement” associated with lead paint poisoning); <em>Byrd, </em>722 A.2d at 602 (noting that “discharge,” “dispersal,” etc., ordinarily imply an active or clearly perceived physical event, and thus do not apply to the imperceptible flaking of lead paint, which is attributable to an involuntary process that occurs over a considerable period of time).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

One would not ordinarily describe the continual, imperceptible, and inevitable deterioration of paint that has been applied to the interior surface of a residence as a discharge (“a flowing or issuing out”), a release (“the act or an instance of liberating or freeing”), or an escape (“an act or instance of escaping”). <em>See Madison, </em><a href="/a2d/735/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="735 A.2d 100" data-case-ids="11533791,56742" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0100-01,/pa/557/0595-01">735 A.2d at 108</a>.

We recognize that the line between plain meaning and untempered literalism is a difficult one to draw, and that, as pertains to the absolute pollution exclusion clause, it must be guided by the decisional law as it develops against the context of individual facts. That the issue of coverage should turn upon such distinctions may well prove frustrating for the insurers who draft the policy, the consumers who purchase it, . and the jurists who are required to interpret it. It merits repeating, therefore, that, of those three, it is the drafters of the policy who are in the best position to introduce greater clarity into the process, as, for .example, by including in their policies an explicit exclusion for lead-paint poisoning. <em>See, e.g., Sullins v.

Subsequent to the grant of allocatur in the present case, this Court was required to address yet another pollution exclusion clause, this one excluding coverage for all but "sudden and accidental" releases of pollutants. <em>See Sunbeam Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/566/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="566 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="706245" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0494-01">566 Pa. 494</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="781 A.2d 1189" data-case-ids="706245,9480706" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0494-01,/a2d/781/1189-01">781 A.2d 1189</a> (2001). The Court accepted an insured's argument that, under the law of contracts, evidence of industry custom or trade usage is always relevant and admissible to demonstrate that words used in a commercial contract have a specialized meaning in the’ trade or industry. <em>See id. </em>at 500, <a href="/pa/566/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="781 A.2d 1189" data-case-ids="706245,9480706" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0494-01,/a2d/781/1189-01">781 A.2d at 1193</a>. Once such custom or usage is established, the Court continued, it will be considered part of the contract, the presumption being that the contracting parties knew of such custom or usage and contracted with reference to it. <em>See <a href="/pa/566/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="781 A.2d 1189" data-case-ids="706245,9480706" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0494-01,/a2d/781/1189-01">id.</a> </em>Notably, the Court stressed that it was not necessary to demonstrate that the words of a contract were ambiguous before construing them according to industry custom or usage. <em>See <a href="/pa/566/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="781 A.2d 1189" data-case-ids="706245,9480706" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0494-01,/a2d/781/1189-01">id.</a> </em>(citing Restatement (Second) op Contracts § 220, cmt. d). Thus, where it is asserted that the terms of a policy possess a specialized meaning in the insurance industry, the threshold determination is not the existence <em>vel non </em>of ambiguity, as in <em>Madison, </em>but, rather, whether the assertion of specialized meaning is correct. If it is, the terms at issue are to be given that specialized meaning, and the question of ambiguity does not arise. In a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Mr. Justice Castille, this author expressed the view that the majority’s analysis was inconsistent with <em>Madison </em>and that extrinsic evidence is not relevant to the interpretation of a comprehensive general insurance policy unless it is first <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>determined that the language of the policy is ambiguous. <em>See Sunbeam, </em><a href="/pa/566/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="566 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="706245" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0494-01">566 Pa. at 504</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="781 A.2d 1189" data-case-ids="706245,9480706" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0494-01,/a2d/781/1189-01">781 A.2d at 1195</a> (Saylor, J., dissenting). While the full impact oí <em>Sunbeam </em>on <em>Madison </em>is not presently clear, Sunbeam’s effect on the present ease is, if anything, to enhance Appellants’ position.</p>
