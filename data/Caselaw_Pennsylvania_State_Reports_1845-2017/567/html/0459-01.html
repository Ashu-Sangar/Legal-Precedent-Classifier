The alleged misconduct involved Respondent’s obligations as a practicing attorney and was unrelated to her judicial office. On one matter, the Hearing Committee recommended that she be suspended from the practice of law for 2 years. On August 17, 2000, the ODC filed a second petition for discipline, alleging that Respondent failed to appear for a scheduled informal admonition relating to misconduct in a case involving a different private client.</p>

In her petition, Respondent contended that her resignation was made unknowingly due to the fact that she was suffering from severe depression and was unrepresented by counsel at the time. She further asserted that the underlying misconduct did not warrant disbarment. In a supplemental petition, Respondent contended that our Court lacked jurisdiction because the disbarment by consent was commenced by the ODC. She argued that the Court of Judicial Discipline has exclusive authority to seek disciplinary action against judicial officers for misconduct occurring during the judicial service. On March 8, 2001, we granted Respondent’s request for oral argument, limited to the issue of whether this Court has jurisdiction to disbar a sitting district justice.
