The Concurrence advocated overruling <em>Baker </em>in what it viewed as a “more limited manner” than the plurality. It noted that <em>Baker </em>involved a grant of suppression by the Court <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>of Common Pleas; a Commonwealth appeal to Superior Court which resulted in reversal of the suppression order; and a grant of a defense allocatur by this Court to review the suppression issue. Since <em>Baker </em>involved a discretionary appeal to this Court from the Superior Court’s jurisdictionally appropriate review of a Commonwealth suppression appeal, the Concurrence reasoned that the footnote in <em>Baker </em>rejecting the Commonwealth’s quashal argument “did no more than reassert our longstanding authority to review appellate reversals of orders suppressing evidence where they present ‘special’ or ‘important’ reasons for such review.” <em>Id. </em>at 408, <a href="/pa/538/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="648 A.2d 1172" data-case-ids="475533,475534,7882209,7882330" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0400-01,/pa/538/0399-01,/a2d/648/1172-01,/a2d/648/1172-02">648 A.2d at 1176</a>. The Concurrence thus emphasized that it “[did] not believe that <em>Baker </em>should be overruled so as to suggest that all appellate reversals of suppression orders are interlocutory, thus precluding this Court from its longstanding practice of reviewing such orders where special or important reasons are presented.” <em><a href="/pa/538/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="648 A.2d 1172" data-case-ids="475533,475534,7882209,7882330" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0400-01,/pa/538/0399-01,/a2d/648/1172-01,/a2d/648/1172-02">Id.</a> </em>Instead, the Concurrence agreed to overrule <em>Baker </em>only to the extent that <em>Baker </em>“suggests that appellate reversals of suppression orders are not interlocutory and [are] appealable as a matter of right to the Superior Court in cases such as [Rosario].” <em>Id. </em>at 409, <a href="/pa/538/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="648 A.2d 1172" data-case-ids="475533,475534,7882209,7882330" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0400-01,/pa/538/0399-01,/a2d/648/1172-01,/a2d/648/1172-02">648 A.2d at 1176</a>.</p>

Given this Court’s unique role, and the existence of the Superior Court and Commonwealth Court in our appellate review scheme, this Court generally does not grant discretionary appeals merely to review claims of error.</p>
    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[261,772,1156,669]]]'>The unique nature of a pre-trial appeal such as the matter here should generally counsel against the grant of allocatur except in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Unlike most parties aggrieved by an order of the Superior Court or the Commonwealth Court, the appellant in a case such as this is not without further remedy. He still may prevail at trial, which would make moot his suppression complaint. And, even if he does not prevail at trial, he has a right of direct appeal following his conviction. At that point, he may raise all of his claims in one appeal and, although his suppression claim would fail in Superior Court, he presumably could seek review of the claim, along with any other claim, in a single allocatur petition to this Court.</p>

Now that the matter has been fully briefed, it is clear to me that such review was improvidently granted. This case involves the supremely fact-bound question of the lawfulness of a particular traffic stop, which led to drug- and DUI-related charges. It resulted in an unpublished memorandum opinion in the Superior Court of no precedential value. There is no suggestion in the briefs, nor was there any suggestion in the allocatur petition, that there have been a rash of traffic stops in the Commonwealth based upon drivers crossing the “fog line” of the highway, such as to justify this Court’s expense of resources in discretionary review here. These considerations, weighing against review, exist independently of the very real restraint that the pre-trial posture of the case should pose.</p>

The garden variety claim presented here, however, does not present such a case.
