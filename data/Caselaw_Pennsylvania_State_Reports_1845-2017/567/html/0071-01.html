Perry was working during the early morning hours of May 31, 1992, when he got into an altercation with a customer, Edward Keyse Mace (“Mace”). Although the parties disagree about how the altercation actually evolved, it is undisputed that Perry severely beat Mace with an aluminum baseball bat in the A-Plus parking lot. Mace subsequently commenced a personal injury action against Perry, Barqawi and Atlantic for injuries resulting from the attack. In his complaint, Mace alleged that Perry committed assault and battery wThen he attacked him with the baseball bat. Mace further alleged that Barqawi was vicariously liable as Perry’s employer, and that Barqawi failed to provide a safe facility and negligently hired, supervised and trained Perry. Finally, Mace alleged that Atlantic was vicariously liable as the franchisor of A-Plus, and was negligent for failing to properly supervise the operations of the franchise. Atlantic filed cross-claims against Barqawi for contractual indemnity and breach <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>of contract, asserting that Barqawi had an obligation under the Agreement and Lease to defend Atlantic against the claims asserted by Mace.

Atlantic, however, continued to pursue its cross-claims against Barqawi for defense costs and legal fees that it expended in defending itself in the underlying personal injury action. On March 14, 1997, the trial court concluded as a matter of law that, under the Agreement and Lease, Barqawi had no obligation to defend Atlantic in the personal injury action instituted by Mace.

In finding that Barqawi was not obligated to defend Atlantic, the Superior Court majority relied on the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule, which provides that if a party seeks to indemnify itself against its own negligence, the language seeking to do so in the indemnification provision must be clear and unequivocal. <em>See Ruzzi v.

Judge Hester dissented, taking the position that the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule was not applicable to the instant case because Atlantic was not attempting to recover for its own negligence. Judge Hester concluded that, under the Agreement and Lease, At<a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>lantic was entitled to be reimbursed for Barqawi’s failure to defend Atlantic.</p>

The terms of the contract required Contractor to execute and deliver an indemnity bond, thereby indemnifying Owner for injuries or damages sustained by laborers or third parties during construction. Before Contractor completed construction of the building, Owner regained partial possession of the property and placed his employees in charge of the building, including the elevators. While an employee of Contractor’s subcontractor was painting a wall inside an elevator shaft, an employee of Owner negligently lowered the elevator, killing the employee inside the elevator shaft. The estate of the decedent recovered a judgment against Owner, who then tried to recover on Contractor’s bond for indemnity. On appeal, this Court held that the indemnity provision of the contract did not apply to injuries <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>resulting from the negligence of Owner or his employees while Owner was in possession of the building. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. at 556-57</a>.

Atlantic did not fail to perform any. of its obligations under the Agreement and Lease. Instead, Atlantic was merely <em>charged </em>with negligence based on the actions of Perry, one of Barqawi’s employees. As the Superior Court recognized, Atlantic was “loosed of all tort responsibility in the underlying case” when the trial court granted Atlantic’s motions for summary judgment, thereby dismissing with prejudice all claims and cross-claims against Atlantic. <em>Mace v.

In <em>Topp Copy, </em>the appellee maintained that the Superior Court properly applied the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule when interpreting the validity of an exculpatory clause in a commercial lease. We disagreed and explained that the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule is a rule of contract interpretation for clauses that relieve a party of responsibility for its own negligence, which is applied only in the unique circumstances of an indemnity arrangement. <em>Topp Copy, </em><a href="/pa/533/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="533 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="1837477" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0468-01">533 Pa. at 474</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="533 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="1837477" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0468-01">626 A.2d at 101</a>.

Parties simply charged with negligence, even though subsequently found not liable, would be precluded from recovering defense costs. In effect, expanding the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule to encompass situations where a party is merely alleged to have been negligent would render indemnification meaningless, as even a completely frivolous negligence action filed against an indem-nitee would automatically eradicate an otherwise valid indemnification provision. Thus, we reject Barqawi’s argument that the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule should be expanded and instead find that the rule should continue to be applied only in those instances where a party seeks indemnification for its own negligence.</p>

Atlantic is not seeking indemnification for its own negligence but rather, is only seeking reimbursement for Barqawi’s failure to defend it as required by the Agreement and Lease. , Applying basic contract principles, we find that Barqawi failed to perform its obligations under the Agreement and Lease and is therefore responsible for reimbursing Atlantic for the counsel fees that Atlantic was forced to expend in defending itself from the lawsuit initiated by Mace. Accordingly, the Order of the Superior Court is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for a determination of reasonable counsel fees for Atlantic. Jurisdiction relinquished.</p>

The controlling fact in the majority’s rejection of the <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>rule is the fortuity that, by the time Atlantic sought to enforce its indemnification right, a final legal determination had been made in the underlying tort action that Atlantic was not negligent. The fact that the third party plaintiff in the tort action alleged that Atlantic had been negligent became irrelevant once .Atlantic prevailed on its summary judgment motion.

But nothing in <em>Perry-Ruzzi </em>requires such a limitation. To the contrary, as this case well illustrates, the concerns that animated the <em>Perry-Ruzzi rule </em>— i.e., that provisions that purport to afford a party protection from claims premised upon its own negligence are so “unusual and extraordinary” that they should be found to exist only when the contract expressly requires it — exist the moment the would-be indemnitee is “merely alleged” to have been negligent, for that is -when the indemnitor’s obligation is triggered.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[236,1045,1156,952]]]'>On their face, the indemnification provisions at issue here, which were contained in “standard form documents regularly used by Atlantic in their business relationships” (trial court slip op., 5), purport to impose a duty upon Barqawi not only to “indemnify and hold harmless” Atlantic if it is not solely negligent, but also to defend Atlantic. That duty of defense, when it exists, obviously is triggered before any determination is made as to ultimate fault in the underlying action. For it is upon the mere allegation that legal consequences — to wit, the costs of defense that are at issue here — begin to arise. It is that duty of defense for which Atlantic now seeks compensation. Indeed, but for the Plaintiffs allegation that Atlantic was negligent, Atlantic would have no claim at all against Barqawi. Atlantic cannot have it both ways. Barqawi’s contractual obligation to defend Atlantic thus arose, if it arose at all, when Atlantic was jointly sued in negligence, along with Barqawi and Perry, in connection with the assault by Barqawi’s employee, Perry.</p>

In this case, the two provisions at issue are entitled “Indemnity and Insurance” and under that heading, the parties intentionally encompassed both indemnification and defense costs. Additionally, defense costs in many instances can be just as burdensome as indemnification costs; this court should be wary of presuming that the indemnitor intended to assume the responsibility for the costs of defending against claims alleging, the indemnitee’s own negligence without an express agreement. <em>See Perry, </em><a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. at 557</a> (“The liability on such indemnity is so hazardous, and the character of the indemnity so unusual and extraordinary, that there can be no presumption that the indemnitor intended to assume the responsibility unless the contract puts it beyond doubt by express stipulation.”).</p>

Allen, </em><a href="/pa/547/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="547 Pa. 693" data-case-ids="468736" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0693-01">547 Pa. 693</a>, 705, <a href="/a2d/692/1089-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="692 A.2d 1089" data-case-ids="11919873,468736" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1089-01,/pa/547/0693-01">692 A.2d 1089</a>, 1095 (1997). The indemnitor therefore may not escape the obligation to defend merely because the initial pleadings are broad and all-inclusive. Barqawi, however, sought for this rule to be applied in reverse, asking the Court to hold that so long as one theory of relief asserted against the indemnitee would not in and of itself require a defense, no duty would arise to defend against any of the several theories asserted. This position is inconsistent with the traditional precepts and should be rejected for that reason.</p>

    <blockquote id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.7",206,[302,1823,1113,313]]]'>An insurer’s obligation to defend is fixed solely by the allegations of the underlying complaint.

In plaintiffs Amended Complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant, Bobby Perry, assaulted, battered and beat plaintiff. Plaintiff also alleged that as a result of both Barqawi’s and Atlantic’s negligence, gross negligence, recklessness and carelessness in hiring, supervising and controlling defendant, Perry, plaintiff suffered his injuries.

In particular, the court indicated that, since Barqawi was not an insurance company but a small business proprietor “who was compelled to sign the agreement and lease if he wished to enter into a business relationship with Atlantic, ... [the] court will not treat Barqawi as an insurer and concludes that it had either no duty to defend Atlantic as of the filing or that its duty ceased as of the grant of Summary Judgment.” In a footnote, the trial court further indicated, “the Court reviewed the bills provided by Atlantic to defend its claim and found them to be at first blush, exorbitant in light of the fees of Barqawi, the primary defendant in the case.” Since the Superior Court affirmed on different grounds,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> the actual reasons provided by the trial court in support of its disposition have not been expressly <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>considered.

It may be that the Superior Court's decision to rely upon different grounds reflected some level of discomfort with the trial court's reasoning. Indeed, the trial court's own opinion in support of its order reflects some degree of uncertainly as to the propriety of the order denying counsel fees, as it indicates that Barqawi “either had no duty to defend Atlantic as of the filing or that its duty ceased as of the grant of Summary Judgment."</p>
