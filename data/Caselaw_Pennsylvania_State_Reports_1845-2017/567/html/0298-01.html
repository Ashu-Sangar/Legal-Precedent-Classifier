Five months after her graduation from nursing school, appellant was hired as a staff nurse at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) on October 20, 1997. In July or August of 1998, appellant made an error in patient care in the pediatric intensive care unit. As a result, she was placed under the supervision of a nurse preceptor, an experienced pediatric nurse, for approximately five weeks. Appellant was or should have been aware at that time that further errors could result in termination of her employment. After this five-week “reorientation” period ended, appellant once again worked without a preceptor until October 7, 1998, the date of her termination.</p>

My manager told me that I wasn’t the kind of the [sic] nurse that she wanted around.” Appellant’s supervisor then offered appellant the option of resigning in lieu of dismissal. Appellant then submitted her resignation.</p>

The unemployment compensation referee held a hearing at which appellant, her counsel and CHOP’S representative appeared. Appellant was the only witness to testify. On December 18, 1998, the referee affirmed the Job Center’s grant of benefits, finding that there was “no competent evidence to establish negligence by the claimant indicating an intentional disregard of the employer’s interest and of her duties and obligations to the employer.” The referee further found that the medication error was not made “deliberately or intentionally” and, thus, CHOP failed to prove willful misconduct disentitling appellant to compensation benefits.</p>

Implicit in this necessarily flexible approach to determining what constitutes willful misconduct on the part of an individual employee is a recognition of the myriad working conditions and work rules that apply throughout the Commonwealth. Thus, the conduct that rises to the level of willful misconduct may vary depending upon an individual employee’s specific occupation or work situation. Beyond recognizing that the specific circumstances governing a particular occupation or workplace may be relevant both in defining reasonable employer expectations and in assessing what amounts to willful misconduct in failing to meet them, however, this Court has not established or authorized specific sub-standards applicable to individual occupations, nor have we ever suggested that a stricter, or looser, standard than the willful misconduct standard provided in the statute itself governs any particular occupation.</p>
