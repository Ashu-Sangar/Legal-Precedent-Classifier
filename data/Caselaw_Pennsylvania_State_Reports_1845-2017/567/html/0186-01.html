In the opinion of the fire department expert, a plastic anti-freeze bottle found on the basement floor had been filled with gasoline and deliberately set ablaze.

This Court granted Mr. Siegel’s request to withdraw on September 10, 1998, and remanded for the PCRA court to appoint new counsel.

He stated that the man had a moustache and was approximately 5'10" tall and weighed 170 pounds. Espenshade testified that he witnessed the man for about ten to fifteen seconds. He and Zehnder told a nearby police officer that the house was on fire. The police detained Espenshade and Zehnder in a police car for over an hour. While in the police vehicle, Espenshade testified that he heard a description of the suspect the police were looking for in connection with the fire as a “white male wearing dark clothes.” After his release from the police vehicle, Espenshade saw the same individual he had previously witnessed running near the fire location walking near the scene. At the preliminary hearing and at trial, he identified Appellant as the man he had seen fleeing from the fire scene. Under these circumstances, we see nothing in this identification of Appellant or in the report that Espenshade heard over the police radio as unduly suggestive such that Espenshade’s identification of Appellant was unreliable.

Shanfield testified that he was driving very slowly near the fire scene when an individual ran in front of his car. Shanfield testified that the individual was a white male with shaggy hair, some facial hair, and was wearing dark clothing. That individual, whom Shanfield identified at the preliminary hearing, pretrial suppression hearing and at trial as Appellant, ran approximately fifteen feet in front of Shanfield’s vehicle. Shanfield was able to view Appellant for about five to ten seconds before Appellant ran away. Two and a half-hours after this incident, Shanfield reported to the homicide unit at the Philadelphia Police Administration Building to give a statement.

When questioned by the prosecutor concerning the manner of death, Dr. Preston testified that the victims had died in a homicide from an arson fire.

Appellant includes in his <em>pro se </em>brief a statement signed by one Pedro Cruz and dated October of 1990, in which Mr. Cruz asserts that he was held in the Detention Center when Appellant was arrested in July of 1989 and that he observed that Appellant’s left foot was swollen. There is no indication in this statement that Mr. Cruz would have been willing to testily on Appellant's behalf at his trial. Further, even if Mr. Cruz would have been willing to testify on Appellant's behalf, there is nothing in Mr. Cruz’s statement tha1 exonerates Appellant because it is undisputed that Appellant's foot was injured by the time he had been placed in custody subsequent to the commission of the crimes. <em>See Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/537/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="645 A.2d 189" data-case-ids="775506,7860965" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0514-01,/a2d/645/0189-01">645 A.2d at 193</a>.</p>

The sole basis for Appellant’s claim that the prosecutor committed misconduct in arguing to the jury that the fire had been deliberately set <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>by using gasoline contained in an antifreeze jug is the testimony from Joseph McBride, a civilian chemist for the Philadelphia Police Department, who stated that a five milliliter sample of liquid obtained from the victims' home tested negatively for the presence of gasoline. Appellant ignores other testimony from Mr. McBride that carpet debris from the victims' home tested positively for gasoline. N.T. 10/29/90 p. 643. Although this testimony upon which Appellant relies may weigh against the Commonwealth’s proof before the jury, we have already noted lhat other evidence that the fire was started by gasoline contained in an antifreeze jug supported the prosecutor's closing argument, which did not, therefore, constitute prosecutorial misconduct. Appellant repeats this meritless assertion in his ninth appellate issue, arguing that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making any references during the trial to the fire having been started by means of gasoline from an antifreeze jug. Brief of Appellant, pp. 48-50. We similarly reject this claim.</p>

In a related issue, Appellant claims prosecutorial misconduct and alleges that the Commonwealth knowingly used perjured testimony at trial. Brief of Appellant, pp. 37-40. PCRA counsel declined to raise this issue as being without merit, and Appellant presently challenges PCRA counsel's ineffectiveness for lailing to raise it. No relief is due. Again based on Mr. McBride's testimony that a liquid sample taken from the scene tested negatively for the presence of gasoline, Appellant contends that all trial testimony concerning the presence of gasoline odors was necessarily perjured. Appellant offers nothing to support this claim other than his own wild conjecture, and we will not find counsel ineffective for refusing to advance this claim.</p>

    <p id="b340-8" data-blocks='[["BL_340.9",340,[257,867,1156,1219]]]'>As the majority notes, appellant’s claims of trial court error, as well as his claims alleging that trial counsel was ineffective, are waived under the PCRA since appellant, who was represented by counsel other than trial counsel on post-verdict motions and direct appeal, could have raised these claims on that appeal. Thus, the only claims available to appellant on this <em>pro se </em>appeal are his “layered” claims sounding in ineffective assistance of direct appeal counsel, as well as his claims alleging that PCRA counsel was ineffective. In my recent concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d 517</a> (Pa.2001), I addressed at some length the “substantive contours of claims of appellate counsel ineffectiveness.” <em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">at 534-37</a> (Castille, J. concurring).
