The surveyor placed stakes along the boundary lines between the subdivided lots. Pursuant to a family settlement agreement signed in 1974, each heir received a specific lot. The parcel given to Siskos was adjacent to the land distributed to Mary Vrbanic Gaul and her husband Bernard Gaul (collectively, the Gauls).</p>
    <p id="b814-11" data-blocks='[["BL_814.11",814,[258,1783,1154,363]]]'>Bernard Gaul placed iron pins next to the survey stakes at the two ends of the property line to further delineate Siskos’ tract from his own. He also placed a stone monument somewhere along the boundary between the two pins. Presently, one of the pins and the stone monument remain. Although the second pin is now missing, a large square stone that had rested next to the pin is still in place.</p>

Currently, the four parcels are owned by: (1) the Britzes; (2) Cheryl Kay and Charles E. Boggs, III; (3) Marlene A. Vrbanic; and (4) Bernard Gaul (collectively, the Appellees). Each uses the private road.</p>
    <p id="b815-5" data-blocks='[["BL_815.6",815,[210,748,1154,368]]]'>In 1997, Siskos contracted for a survey of her property. The surveyor determined that the boundary of her land extended beyond what she had originally believed, and in fact included the entire mouth of the private roadway where it intersects Rock Springs Road (the disputed property). Prior to the survey, all of the parties believed that the mouth of the roadway was located on the Britzes’ property.</p>

The Appellees did not claim that they had possession of the disputed property; rather, they asserted that they had title, or alternatively, adverse possession. Siskos moved to amend her Complaint, seeking to strike paragraphs (b) through (g) from her prayer for relief. The court denied Siskos’ motion on March 28, 1998. On October 20, 1998, the-trial court, following a bench trial, which included a viewing of the premises, held that the disputed property belonged to.the Britzes, not to Siskos. The court determined that the crux of the disagreement centered on ownership, not possession. Consequently, the court refused to permit Siskos to block the Appéllees’ access to the private road.</p>

      <em>DISCUSSION</em>

    <p id="b817-7" data-blocks='[["BL_817.7",817,[214,1414,1156,624]],["BL_818.1",818,[257,338,1158,1066]]]'>Siskos’ sole argument on appeal is that the trial court should have resolved whether she was in current and actual possession of the disputed property because possession is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an Action to Quiet Title filed pursuant to Rule 1061(b)(1) or Rule 1061(b)(2). Rule 1061(b)(1) states that an Action to Quiet Title “may be brought to compel an adverse party to commence an action of ejectment.” (emphasis added). Rule 1061(b)(2) provides that such an action may alternatively “be brought where an action of ejectment will not lie, to determine any right, lien, title or interest in the land or determine the validity or discharge of any document, obligation or deed affecting any right, lien, title <a id="p698" href="#p698" data-label="698" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*698</a>or interest in land.” (emphasis added). Thus, Siskos argues, the trial court was required to determine whether either party could have commenced an Action in Ejectment before ruling on her Action to Quiet Title. “Ejectment is a possessory action only, and can succeed only if the plaintiff is out of possession, and he has a present right to immediate possession.” <em>Brennan v. Shore Brothers, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/380/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="380 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1255928" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0283-01">380 Pa. 283</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.2d%20401" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="110 A.2d 401">110 A.2d 401</a>, 402 (1955). A court only has jurisdiction over an Action in Ejectment if the defendant possesses the land and the plaintiff has the right to possess. <em>Girard Trust Co. v. Dixon, </em><a href="/pa/335/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="335 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1193085" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0253-01">335 Pa. 253</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20813" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 A.2d 813">6 A.2d 813</a> (1939). Moreover, a party is entitled to a jury trial in an Action in Ejectment. <em>Teacher v. Kijurina, </em><a href="/pa/365/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="365 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1225555" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0480-01">365 Pa. 480</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20197" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="76 A.2d 197">76 A.2d 197</a> (1950). Accordingly, because an Action to Quiet Title lies only when an Action in Ejectment does not, Siskos argues that resolution of who possesses the disputed property is a necessary prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the trial court over an Action to Quiet Title. Siskos maintains that she is entitled to a jury trial on the underlying Action in Ejectment issues because a party can request a jury in an Action in Ejectment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b818-5" data-blocks='[["BL_818.5",818,[256,1436,1154,635]]]'>Appellees argue that Siskos, in her Complaint, requested resolution of her action pursuant to either Rule 1061(b)(1) or (b)(2), thereby asking the trial court to resolve all issues regarding the disputed property, which conferred jurisdiction on the court by Siskos’ consent. Specifically, they assert that Rule 1061(b)(1) and Rule 1061(b)(2) provide exclusive alternative remedies, as an Action to Quiet Title brought pursuant to (b)(1) requires that Siskos has possession, while Siskos could not be in possession of the land to file an action under (b)(2). Therefore, Appellees contend that the issue of possession is immaterial to the dispute in the case <em>sub judice, </em>because the trial court would face an Action to Quiet Title either way.</p>

Ejectment is an action filed by a plaintiff who does not possess the land but has the right to possess it, against a defendant who has actual possession. <em>Soffer v.

A party will file a Rule 1061(b)(2) Action to Quiet Title when she is not in possession, does not have the right to possess the land, and wishes to determine all rights in the land. 22 Standard Pennsylvania Practice 2d § 120:145. “The purpose of an ejectment action as opposed to quiet title is not to determine the relative and respective rights of all potential title holders, but rather the immediate rights between plaintiff and defendant involved in that particular litigation.” <em>Burnett v.

If the trial court concluded that Siskos was not in possession, she would have had the opportunity to either file an Action in Ejectment or allow the court to entertain her (b)(2) Action to Quiet Title. If Siskos was in possession of the disputed property, an Action in Ejectment would lie, and, pursuant to (b)(2), an Action to Quiet Title would not be proper. Under the latter scenario, (b)(1) would control, requiring the trial court to compel the Appellees to commence an Action in Ejectment or lose all right, lien, title, or interest in the land. If Siskos or the Appellees had filed an Action in Ejectment, either party would have been entitled to ask for a jury trial. The right to a jury trial in a civil action is fundamental to our system of law. U.S. Const, amend. VII (“[i]n suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.....”); Pa. Const. Art. I, § 6 (“[t]rial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate.....”). Where a jury trial right inures to the benefit of the parties and a party requests a jury, a court may not properly determine issues that a jury would have had the right to consider.

A party invoking Rule 1061(b)(1) seeks a court order compelling an adverse party to commence an action in ejectment. This section generally applies where the complaining party has possession of the disputed property and seeks a resolution of any dispute with the adverse party' over title. Rule 1061(b)(2), on the other hand, applies where the complaining party does not have possession of the disputed property. In such an instance, the complaining party requests that the court “determine any right, lien, title or interest in the land or determine the validity or discharge of any document, obligation or deed affecting any right, lien, title or interest in land.” Of course, in any disputed matter, the determination of the technically proper form of the action may be unknowable at the outset: it may take resolution of the dispute itself to determine possession or ownership of the disputed property.</p>

This holding sets up needless procedural roadblocks for courts and litigants and will result in a waste of judicial effort. Appellant here brought her boundary dispute before the court seeking a determination of her rights in the property. She asked for relief under either Rule 1061(b)(1) or (b)(2) or both, and the trial court considered both remedies and rendered an appropriate decision.

Yet, the <a id="p706" href="#p706" data-label="706" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*706</a>majority’s decision has the opposite effect. It requires a trial court to make a preliminary determination as to possession prior to considering the merits of the property dispute in order to determine which of the subsections of the rule apply. The better approach is to allow trial courts to consider these matters in toto, without requiring procedural gymnastics, to timely resolve the substantive question of the litigants’ respective rights in a disputed property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In this regard, I note my agreement with the Superior Court’s approach in <em>Sutton v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa-super/405/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="405 Pa. Super. 213" data-case-ids="896691" data-case-paths="/pa-super/405/0213-01">405 Pa.Super. 213</a>, <a href="/pa-super/405/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="405 Pa.

In that case, the court recognized the need for a practical approach to these disputes in holding that, if a party files an action in ejectment under Rule 1061(b)(1) and the trial court determines that an action in ejectment will not lie, the trial court may <em>sua sponte </em>amend the pleading to conform to the requirement for an action under Rule 1061(b)(2).</p>
    <p id="b826-5" data-blocks='[["BL_826.5",826,[254,1236,1156,518]]]'>In my view, the approach employed by the trial court and the Superior Court in this case was proper. Appellant brought her property dispute to the trial court for resolution, and the trial court did as she requested by determining in a prompt fashion the relative rights of the parties to the property, which is the way our system of justice is intended to operate. I see no error in the trial court resolving this dispute expeditiously and efficiently. Accordingly, because I would affirm the Superior Court’s decision, I respectfully dissent.</p>

I do not dispute the majority's statement that “an Action in Ejectment entitles a litigant to a jury trial, while an Action to Quiet Title does not.” At 1006 n. 4. Moreover, I recognize that, in the case <em>sub juclice, </em>appellant requested, in the alternative, that the trial court require appellees to file an action in ejectment. But the court issued no such directive and, thus, no action for ejectment and no jury trial issue was before the court.</p>
