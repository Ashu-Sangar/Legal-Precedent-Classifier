In addition, we have noted that the <em>per se </em>provision incorporated in subsection (a)(4) reflects a legislative determination that an individual with a blood alcohol concentration (“BAC”) of .10 percent or greater is, as a matter of law, incapable of safe driving. <em>See Commonwealth v.

By so structuring the general statutes to include separate offenses, however, various state legislatures have effectively foreclosed a unitary analysis, relegating the courts to focus upon the substantial similarity to the Compact of the particular aspect of the general statute pursuant to which the licensee was convicted in each individual case. In addition to complicating judicial review, this legislative practice would appear to be inimical to the administrative interest in standardizing and streamlining reporting practices to achieve consistency, accuracy, and completeness in identification for purposes of license suspension.</blockquote>

According to Appellants, the "description” data field of the New Jersey conviction reports simply contains the description that is stored in a computer's "statute file” for the statutory provision appearing in the "New Jersey Statute” data field. Thus, Appellants claim that <em>'every </em>time a licensee violates <em>any </em>of the provisions of N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a), New Jersey’s report will automatically describe the violation as "oper-<a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>ale under influence liq/drugs.” Beyond ihis bald assertion, however, Appellants offer absolutely no evidence that the description for permitting anolher to drive drunk is the same as the description for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.</p>

Given that Appellants were not convicted of a permitting offense, the permitting provisions of N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a) are not at issue in this case. Nevertheless, we note that those offenses appear to be outside the scope of the Compact. The permitting provisions of the statute do not require that the person charged with those offenses be operating a vehicle, nor be impaired to <em>any </em>degree. Instead, the permitting provisions of N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a) are predicated on the offender permitting <em>another person </em>to drive a vehicle while impaired. While this Commonwealth also punishes vehicle owners who permit others to drive their motor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1575, the Compact contains no similar restrictions.</p>

If PennDOT presents <em>prima facie </em>evidence that a Pennsylvania driver was convicted of violating an operating offense under N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a), however, it is the licensee’s burden to come forward with evidence to show that he was convicted of a permitting offense.</p>

If we were to find that every conviction under N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a) is dissimilar to the Compact based solely on the fact that the statute contains permitting provisions, as Appellants argue, it would render invalid all Pennsylvania license suspensions based on convictions for violating N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a). This construction of N.J.S.A. § 39:4-50(a) would not only be completely contrary to the policies and purpose of tire Compact, <em>see 75 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1581, art. I, but would permit Pennsylvania licensees convicted of drunk driving in New Jersey to avoid reciprocal license suspensions merely because New Jersey has chosen to incorporate more than one offense into its DWI statute.</p>
