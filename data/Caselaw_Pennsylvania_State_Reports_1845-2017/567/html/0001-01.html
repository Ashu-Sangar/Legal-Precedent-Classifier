Following trial, the jury rendered a verdict finding that all three parties were negligent, apportioning the fault twenty percent to Allen and forty percent each to Mellinger and the Department, and awarding total monetary damages of $2,883,366. Allen filed a motion seeking $1,430,077.07 in delay damages pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 238 for the approximately seven-year period commencing with the filing of the complaint and ending on March 16, 1996, the date on which the verdict was rendered. Subsequently, Allen entered into a written agreement with Mellinger providing that, in exchange for payment of the limits of Mellinger’s automobile liability insurance policy ($300,000), Allen would not undertake to execute against Mellinger’s personal assets to satisfy the judgment. The agreement further specified that its terms were not intended either to reduce the amount of the verdict for which the Department would be liable, or to release Mellinger from liability to the Department for contribution with respect to either the verdict or delay damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Since with respect to amounts in excess of the statutory cap, the Commonwealth party is a defendant “against whom the plaintiff is barred from recovery,” under the terms of 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102(b) the plaintiff is not permitted to “recover the full amount of the allowed recovery from” the Commonwealth party. In other words, the Sovereign Immunity Act serves to limit the Commonwealth party’s exposure to joint and several liability.

First, the analysis of the language of the Rule proceeded from a misleading paraphrase of the text. The actual language of the rule states “damages for delay shall be added to the amount of compensatory damages awarded against each defendant or additional defendant found liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of a jury, in the decision of the court ... or in the award of arbitrators ... and <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>shall become part of the verdict, decision or award.” (Emphasis added.) The <em>Woods </em>opinion, however, ignored the emphasized language and declared that the Rule “provides that delay damages shall be added to the ‘verdict of the jury ... decision of the court ... or award of arbitrators....’” <a href="/pa/531/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="531 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1834405" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0295-01">612 A.2d at 971</a>. When the text is read in full, delay damages are added to the compensatory damages awarded against each defendant and then become part of the verdict. According to the <em>Woods </em>paraphrase, delay damages are simply added to the verdict. The difference in meaning is readily apparent and all the more critical because the next step of the <em>Woods </em>analysis characterized the “verdict or award” as representing the factfinder’s assessment of the plaintiffs damage and contrasted it with the amount the plaintiff is legally entitled to recover.</p>
    <p id="b131-5" data-blocks='[["BL_131.5",131,[228,1084,1155,900]]]'>The <em>Woods </em>opinion is similarly inadequate in its analysis of the purposes underlying Rule 238. With respect to the rule’s purpose of compensating the plaintiff for delay in receiving his or her recovery, it defies reason to suggest that the basis for calculating such compensation could be anything other than the amount the Commonwealth party could actually be responsible for paying to the plaintiff. Since a plaintiffs compensatory damages can never exceed the statutory cap, there can be no delay in receiving amounts in excess of that cap. And if there is no delay, the stated justification for compensating the plaintiff with delay damages is illusory. Simply put, the hardships which may befall plaintiffs who seek damages against Commonwealth parties occur as a direct consequence of the statutory limitations upon damages, which have been upheld against constitutional challenge as within the province of the General Assembly. <em>See, e.g., Lyles v.

Magee. </em>Instead of recognizing that the Sovereign Immunity Act creates a unique relationship of rights and duties between plaintiffs and Commonwealth parties, and then analyzing whether the application of Rule 238 in that setting still has only a collateral effect on substantive rights and duties, the Court simply treated the Commonwealth party the same as any other party. The Court reasoned that if delay damages were computed on the statutory cap “there would then be no unknown which would motivate the Commonwealth to discuss settlement,” <em>Woods, </em><a href="/pa/531/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="531 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1834405" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0295-01">612 A.2d at 972</a>. In doing so, the Court failed to perceive that the absence of an “unknown” originates in and cannot be separated from the statutory cap. The <em>Woods </em>rationale allows the Court to <em>create </em>an uncertainty of outcome to motivate settlement where no uncertainty otherwise exists. This is far different from channeling the uncertainty of outcome that exists in the case of private litigants not subject to limitations on liability. In the latter situation, the procedural rule may be said to have only a collateral effect on substantive rights and duties. In the former situation, the effect is plainly more than collateral and thus exceeds the bounds of our rulemaking authority.</p>

I also conclude, however, that Rule 238 restricts a plaintiffs ability to do so by distinguishing between defendants who comply with the Rule by tendering qualifying offers and defendants who do not. This is consistent with the Rule’s interest in advancing meaningful negotiation and settlement. Thus, I would hold that Rule 238 allows a plaintiff to collect his entire delay award from any noncomplying defendant; allows a non-complying defendant who pays to the plaintiff more than his assessed share of the total delay damages award to seek recoupment from those defendants whose delay damages assessment he is called upon to cover; and does not allow a plaintiff to collect from a complying defendant any delay damages attributable to other defendants from the date the offer which tolled Rule 238 was tendered.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.6",142,[262,874,1159,1369]]]'>The majority begins by taking issue with this court’s prior interpretation of Rule 238’s language. In Woods, we focused on the phrase which provides that “delay damages shall be added to the ‘verdict of the jury, ... the decision of the court in a nonjury trial or ... the award of arbitrators ... and shall become part of the verdict, decision or award....’”, Pa. R.Civ.P. 238(a)(1), and determined that the Rule “is indicative of the intent to have damages apply to the verdict or award itself, which represents the actual factfinder’s assessment of the plaintiffs damage, as opposed to the amount the plaintiff is legally entitled to recover.” <em>Woods, </em><a href="/pa/531/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="531 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1834405" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0295-01">612 A.2d at 972</a>. The majority states that our interpretation ignored that part of the Rule which states that “ ‘damages for delay shall be added to the amount of compensatory damages awarded against each defendant or additional defendant’ ”, and thus, failed to realize that the Rule actually refers to the “amount the plaintiff is legally entitled to recover.” (Majority Opinion at 767-768) (quoting Pa.R.Civ.P. 238(a)(1)). I am at a loss to understand the majority’s position. In my view, the phrase from Rule 238 upon which the majority presently relies to point out the error in our prior reasoning — “compensatory damages awarded” — is not synonymous with a “plaintiffs recovery”. Indeed, in the overwhelming majority of Pennsylvania opinions I have read, “compensatory damages awarded” referred to the amount the factfinder determined a plaintiff should receive from a defendant, not to the amount the plaintiff ultimately recovered.</p>
    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.7",142,[261,2267,1155,95]],["BL_143.1",143,[217,328,1158,1008]]]'>Next, the majority determines that <em>Woods </em>was inadequate in its analysis of the Rule’s compensatory purpose. According <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>to the majority, it was illogical for this court to suggest that the basis for calculating delay damages can be anything other than the $250,000 that the Commonwealth is actually responsible for paying since the amount a plaintiff ultimately recovers in compensatory damages can never exceed that cap. The majority, however, unfairly characterizes the observation we made in <em>Woods </em>when we stated: “[TJhe plaintiff who statutorily has already been denied the full compensation due him or her would be <em>once again </em>deprived of money to which he or she would be <em>otherwise </em>entitled, with only a minimum sanction being imposed on the defendant.” <a href="/pa/531/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="531 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1834405" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0295-01">612 A.2d at 972</a> (emphasis added). In so stating, we did not voice an intent, as the majority claims, to compensate the plaintiff for delay on amounts he can never receive. Rather, we sought to avoid the imposition of a <em>second </em>deprivation. By calculating delay damages on the actual amount awarded, instead of $250,000, we saw to it that a plaintiff is not denied <em>both </em>the amount in compensatory damages and the amount in delay damages to which he would be entitled but for the statutory cap.</p>

(Majority Opinion at 768). According to the majority, we impermissibly affected substantive rights by <em>“creat[ing] </em>an uncertainty of outcome to motivate settlement where no uncertainty of outcome otherwise exists”, (Majority Opinion at 768) (emphasis in original), when we reasoned that if delay damages were computed on the statutory cap “ ‘there would be no unknown which would motivate the Commonwealth to discuss settlement.’ ” (Majority Opinion at 768) (quoting <em>Woods, </em><a href="/pa/531/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="531 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1834405" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0295-01">612 A.2d at 972</a>). In this regard, the majority opinion contains a familiar and fatal flaw of logic — it begs the question. That is to say, the majority assumes the truth of the proposition it seeks to prove by concluding in the first instance that the “uncertainty of outcome” Rule 238 creates is substantive. It is settled; delay damages and Rule 238 are procedur<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>al. <em>See, e.g., Laudenberger, </em><a href="/pa/496/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="496 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1772909" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0052-01">436 A.2d at 147</a>.

My agreement with the majority that the delay damages that any particular defendant owes the plaintiff should be calculated in light of the defendant’s apportioned fault is based on the words in Rule 238 which provide that "damages for delay shall be added to the compensatory damages awarded against each defendant or additional defendant found to be liable to the plaintiff in the verdict of a jury, in the decision of the court in a nonjury trial or in the award of arbitrators ....” Pa.R.Civ.P. 238(a)(1), and on our interpretation of the Rule in <em>Woods </em>that delay damages are to apply to the "actual factfinder’s assessment <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>of the plaintiff’s damage.” <a href="/pa/531/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="531 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1834405" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0295-01">612 A.2d at 972</a>. My agreement that delay damages assessed against multiple defendants are aggregated in the verdict is based on the words in the Rule which provide that “all damages for delay ... .shall become part of the verdict, decision or award.” Pa.R.Civ.P. 238(a)(1). I add that in my view, whether the amount of a defendant's olfer satisfies the Rule should also be measured by taking into account that defendant’s assessed fault. Pa. R.Civ.P. 238(b)(l)(ii). By way of example, an offer by a defendant who was found to have been 10% negligent would satisfy the Rule if the offer came within 125% of 10% of the verdict.</p>

Section 7102(b) of the Comparative Negligence Act provides in part that a "plaintiff may recover the full amount of the allowed recovery from any defendant against whom the plaintiff is not barred from recovery.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102(b). Section § 8522(a) of the Sovereign Immunity Act waives sovereign immunity “as a bar to an action against Commonwealth parties” in certain instances and "within the limits set forth in section 8528 (relating to limitations on damages)....” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(a).</p>
