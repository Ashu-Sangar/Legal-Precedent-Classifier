(“St.Paul”) appeals from an Order of the Superior Court that reversed the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (“trial court”), which granted St. Paul’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The jury found, by clear and convincing evidence, that St. Paul acted in bad faith when it refused to settle a civil action<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> against The Birth Center (“Birth Center”), and that St. Paul’s bad faith conduct was a substantial factor in causing The Birth Center to incur compensatpry damages in the amount of $700,000.00.</p>

Where an insurer refuses to settle a claim that could have been resolved within policy limits without “a bona fide belief ... that it has a good possibility of winning,” it breaches its contractual duty to act in good faith and its fiduciary duty to its insured. <em>Cowden v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, </em><a href="/pa/389/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="389 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1274043" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0459-01">389 Pa. 459</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.2d%20223" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="134 A.2d 223">134 A.2d 223</a>, 229 (1957). Therefore, the insurer is liable for the known and/or foreseeable compensatory damages of its insured that reasonably flow from the bad faith conduct of the insurer. The fact that the insurer’s intransigent failure to engage in settlement negotiations forced it to pay damages far in excess of the policy limits so as to avoid a punitive damages award, does not insulate the insurer from liability for its insured’s compensatory damages where the insured can prove that the insurer’s bad faith conduct caused the damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The Birth Center notified St. Paul that it was making a firm demand to settle the case within its policy limits. On August 7, 1991, St. Paul refused to settle or to even make an offer of settlement.</p>

In her report to St. Paul, defense counsel for The Birth Center stated that The Birth Center had, at best, a fifty-percent chance of successfully defending the lawsuit at trial. Furthermore, she advised that the jury verdict could range from $1,250,000.00 to $1,500,000.00. The doctor’s defense counsel advised St. Paul that he believed that The Birth Center had a thirty-five percent chance of winning at trial and predicted a jury verdict of $5,000,000.00 to $6,000,000.00.</p>

She explained that such a verdict would have devastating effects upon The Birth Center and could risk its continued existence. When expressing the same concerns to the St. Paul claims representative assigned to the case, the claims representative informed her that St. Paul tries <em>“all of these bad baby cases, and we’re going to trial.” </em>(N.T. 5/6/96 at 16) (emphasis added).</p>

Then, on February 12,1993, the Parents made a high/low offer of settlement, in which St. Paul would pay a non-refundable $300,000.00 amount regardless of the verdict. If, however, the jury returned a verdict in excess of Birth Center’s policy limits, the Parents agreed to accept the policy limits as total satisfaction of the verdict. Finally, the settlement offer provided that if the jury returned a verdict lower than The Birth Center’s maximum coverage, but higher than the low figure of $300,000.00, then the Parents would accept such verdict as full <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>satisfaction of The Birth Center’s liability.

At this time, the Parents reasserted their high/low offer of settlement. The Birth Center expressed its desire that St. Paul agree to the Parents’ proposal; but, a representative of St. Paul, present during the discussion in the robing room, rejected the high/low offer of settlement on the record. Following St. Paul’s rejection, the judge stated that he believed that St. Paul’s actions were in bad faith and that it was putting its interests ahead of those of its insured.

The final verdict was molded to include delay damages and interest and totaled $7,196,238. The Birth Center’s ultimate liability amounted to $4,317,743.00. St. Paul agreed to indemnify The Birth Center for the entire verdict and the parties settled the case for $5,000,000. Before St. Paul paid the excess verdict, it requested that The Birth Center sign a release in exchange for the payment, but The Birth Center refused to sign the release.

The trial court concluded that St. Paul’s payment of the excess verdict nullified Birth Center’s bad faith claim, that compensatory damages are not available pursuant to 42 Pa.

    </p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.7",515,[227,665,1156,964]]]'>St. Paul sets forth four reasons why it is not liable for Birth Center’s compensatory damages. First, it asserts that its payment of the excess verdict barred Birth Center’s bad faith claim. St. Paul argues that allowing bad faith claims despite an insurer’s “voluntary” excess payment would discourage insurance companies from satisfying future excess verdicts. Second, St. Paul contends that <em>D’Ambrosio v. Pennsylvania National Mut. Ins., </em><a href="/pa/494/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="494 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1769147" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0501-01">494 Pa. 501</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="494 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1769147" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0501-01">431 A.2d 966</a> (1981) bars The Birth Center’s claim. Third, St. Paul points to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8371, which authorizes the award of punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs when an insurer is found to have acted in bad faith, and asserts that because the statute does not mention compensatory damages, none are available. Fourth, St. Paul argues that the trial court did not charge the jury on The Birth Center’s breach of contract claim and that, as a result, The Birth Center may not recover compensatory damages based on that claim. In turn, we address and reject St. Paul’s arguments.</p>

    <p id="b515-8" data-blocks='[["BL_515.9",515,[230,1730,1157,527]]]'>Although this is St. Paul’s final argument, we address it first because if the trial court did not charge the jury on breach of contract, The Birth Center could only recover compensatory damages from St. Paul if some other theory provided a basis for recovery. As we discuss in this opinion, neither 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8371 nor any other relevant cause of action provide a basis for recovery. Thus, Birth Center’s compensatory damage award depends on whether The Birth Center asserted a contract cause of action and whether the trial court charged the jury regarding that claim.</p>

However, we respond to point out that the characterization of the claim by the dissent has no bearing on the outcome of this particular case. Whether Birth Center’s cause of action sounds in contract or in tort, the jury found by clear and convincing evidence that St. Paul acted in bad faith and that its actions were a substantial factor in bringing about harm to the Birth Center totaling $700,000.00 in compensatory damages. In appropriate circumstances, compensatory damages are available in both contract and tort causes of action. Indeed, generally, compensatory damages are easier to recover in tort actions than in contract actions. Consequently, in this case, which does not involve a statute of limitations issue, the dissent’s assertion that the claim should sound in tort instead of contract is irrelevant.</p>

Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, </em><a href="/pa/389/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="389 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1274043" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0459-01">389 Pa. at 468</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.2d%20223" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="134 A.2d 223">134 A.2d 223</a>, the late Mr. Chief Justice Charles Alvin Jones stated: “It is established by the greatly preponderant weight of authority in this country, that an insurer against public liability for personal injury may be liable for the entire amount of a judgment secured by a. third party against the insured, regardless of any limitation in the policy, if the insurer’s handling of the claim, including a failure to accept a proffered settlement, was done in such a manner as to evidence bad faith on the part of the insurer <em>in the discharge of its contractual duty.” </em>(Emphasis added). Giving the reason for this rule, Mr. Chief Justice Jones continued: “And, in <em>Weiner v. Targan, </em><a href="/pa-super/100/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="100 Pa.

(Emphasis added). “Thirdly, by asserting in the policy the right to handle all claims against the insured, including the right to make a binding settlement, the insurer assumes a fiduciary position towards the insured and <em>becomes obligated </em>to act in good faith and with due care in representing the interests of the insured.” <a href="/pa/410/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="410 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="1884625" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0055-01">410 Pa. at 59</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.2d%20320" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="188 A.2d 320">188 A.2d 320</a>.

The Superior Court observed that when a casualty company assumes the defense of an action pursuant to the terms of its policy, it is held to a strict rule of good faith in conducting the defense, and therefore, where a casualty company commits fraud in the course of conducting the defense, it should be held liable for the damages naturally resulting therefrom.</p>
