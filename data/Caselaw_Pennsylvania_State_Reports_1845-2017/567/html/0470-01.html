Lamb, Inc. (“Lamb”) and D.N.B. Mechanical Systems, Inc. (“DNB”), raised on appeal, and the Superior Court’s decision to overturn the award of delay damages made to the Cross Appellant, Geraldine McCutcheon. We have determined, however, that the trial court’s order which the parties appealed to the Superior Court is not a final order within the meaning of Pa.R.A.P. 341. Therefore, the Superior Court did not have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 742, and the order it issued is void. As a consequence, this court is also without jurisdiction, there being no final order from the Superior Court, as 42 Pa.C.S. § 724 requires. Accordingly, the Superior Court’s order must be vacated and this appeal must be quashed.</p>

The Appellee, Philadelphia Electric Co. (“PECO”), hired <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>Lamb as a general contractor to build an addition to the Training Center at the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant. PECO and Lamb entered into a contract in which Lamb agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to indemnify PECO against all claims and liability arising out of Lamb’s acts or omissions and those of its subcontractors, in connection with the addition, irrespective of whether PECO was concurrently negligent. Under the contract’s indemnity provision, Lamb was not obligated to cover claims caused by PECO’s sole negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.5",594,[255,910,1155,471]]]'>A forced main sewer line connecting the addition to the power plant’s existing sewer lines was needed. Lamb subcontracted with DNB to construct needed plumbing and DNB subcontracted with Sutch Construction Co. (“Sutch”) for excavation. On May 21, 1992, James McCutcheon, a heavy equipment operator employed by United Engineers and Catalytic, an independent contractor on a separate project at the power plant, fell on a concrete slab that covered a sewer pipe and suffered bodily injuries.</p>
    <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.6",594,[254,1423,1155,418]]]'>On July 26, 1993, James McCutcheon and his wife, Geraldine McCutcheon, (collectively, the “McCutcheons”), filed a complaint in negligence against PECO. Later, on July 19, 1995, they filed an amended complaint to include Lamb, DNB and Sutch as defendants. In their amended complaint, the McCutcheons alleged that the defendants were negligent in permitting a dangerous and defective condition to exist on the power plant property.</p>
    <p id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.7",594,[253,1882,1155,416]]]'>Lamb, DNB and Sutch raised the statute of limitations as a defense. In an Answer With New Matter To Plaintiffs’ Complaint And Crossclaims Pursuant To Pa.R.Civ.P. 2252(d), PECO asserted cross-claims against its co-defendants, alleging that Lamb, DNB and/or Sutch “are solely liable to the plaintiffs, and/or are jointly or severally liable to the plaintiffs and/or liable to answering defendant [PECO] by way of indemnification and/or contribution.” (R. 1635a).</p>

Viewing PECO’s contractual indemnity cross-claim as a matter of law which raised a question of contract interpretation for the court to decide, the trial court determined that the cross-claim would be argued orally following the jury’s verdict and that the verdict would be molded appropriately.</p>
    <p id="b595-4" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[229,829,1154,420]]]'>The jury returned a verdict in favor of James McCutcheon for the injuries he sustained and in favor of Geraldine McCut-cheon for loss of consortium, and against all of the defendants severally and jointly. The jury found PECO 48% negligent, Lamb, 42% negligent, DNB 9% negligent, and Sutch, 1% negligent. The jury also found that James McCutcheon was negligent, but declined to find that his negligence was a contributing cause of his injuries.</p>
    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.6",595,[229,1279,1156,465]]]'>After dismissing the jury, Judge Ribner informed the parties that he was about to retire from the bench and that he would not be presiding over post-trial matters. PECO’s counsel reminded the trial court of PECO’s contractual claim for indemnification. When asked whether proceedings on the cross-claim were needed immediately, PECO’s counsel stated that they were not. The trial court advised the parties to pursue all outstanding issues by filing the appropriate motions.</p>
    <p id="b595-6" data-blocks='[["BL_595.7",595,[232,1782,1155,257]]]'>The MeCutcheons filed a motion for delay damages.

As to the latter, the trial court concluded that summary judgment was improper because there exist genuine issues of material fact regarding the interpretation of the indemnity provision in the parties’ contract. On March 11, 1999, judgment was entered on the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[261,710,1148,93]]]'>PECO, Lamb, and DNB appealed to the Superior Court from the trial court’s March 9,1999 order.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.6",596,[259,829,1151,465]]]'>In their respective appeals, Lamb and DNB contended that the trial court erred in denying them post-trial relief based on the statute of limitations. In an unpublished memorandum opinion, the Superior Court agreed, concluding that the trial court mistakenly applied the concealment doctrine to toll the statute. Accordingly, the court ruled that the McCutcheons’ claims against Lamb and DNB were time-barred, and held that the trial court erred in not dismissing Lamb and DNB from the McCutcheons’ action.</p>
    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.7",596,[254,1328,1155,688]]]'>At the same time the Superior Court determined that the McCutcheons’ claims against Lamb and DNB were time-barred, the court observed that the bar had no effect on PECO’s right to enforce claims for contribution and indemnification against its co-defendants. In this regard, the Superior Court discussed the “separate proceedings” it believed PECO had already initiated to collect for contribution and/or indemnification from Lamb and DNB and announced its intention to quash as interlocutory that portion of PECO’s appeal which raised the trial court’s denial of its motion for summary judgment on the claim for indemnity it had asserted against Lamb in the “separate action”.

      <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>Based on its statute of limitations ruling, the Superior Court declined to address the other issues Lamb and DNB had raised, which included whether they owed a duty of care to James McCutcheon because they did not control the area where he fell, and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict apportioning fault against them.</p>
    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.7",597,[225,662,1154,688]]]'>Last, the Superior Court turned to the matter of delay damages. The court concluded that since the statute of limitations prevented the McCutcheons from directly suing Lamb and DNB, delay damages could not be levied against them. The court also stated that if PECO continued to maintain its action for contribution and indemnity against Lamb and DNB, PECO may seek compensation for having paid their portion of the delay damages award. The court then applied our decision in <em>Anchorstar v.

Lamb and DNB contended that the Superior Court’s failure to address these matters, which have a direct bearing on the continued viability on the cross-claims for contribution and indemnification that PECO has against them, was erroneous because it denied them the greatest, available relief.

By denying PECO’s motion for summary judgment, and thereby leaving for further litigation a cross-claim between co-defendants, it is not open to question that the order did not “dispose of all claims and of all parties” as Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(1) mandates.
