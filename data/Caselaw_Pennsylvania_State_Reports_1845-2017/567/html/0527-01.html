In November 1979, Claimant sustained an injury to his back and was totally disabled. He began receiving workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to a Notice of Compensation Payable (“NCP”) filed by Employer. At an unspecified time prior to the back injury, a flood in one of Employer’s mines killed a number of Claimant’s co-workers. Claimant was part of the team that recovered the bodies of the drowned miners. P’ollowing this incident, Claimant began having nightmares and flashbacks, and as a result, he sought psychological care. Although the 1979 NCP only listed the back injury, Employer also began paying the medical bills for Claimant’s psychological care.</p>

On January 26, 1996, Claimant filed a “Petition to Review Notice of Compensation Payable”, alleging that Claimant had experienced psychiatric and emotional problems, but erroneously attributing the psychological injury to the November 1979 incident. Employer filed an answer raising, <em>inter alia, </em>the defense of the three-year limitations period contained in section 315, a limitations period which may be tolled if payments of compensation were made “in lieu of workmen’s compensation”. 77 P.S. § 602.</p>

The WCJ bifurcated proceedings to determine first, whether the claim for the psychological injury was time-barred and if not time-barred, to consider the underlying merits. At the hearing on April 1, 1996, the only evidence presented was Claimant’s testimony, which the WCJ assumed as fact for the limited purpose of determining the applicability of section 315. While characterizing Claimant’s testimony as “vague regarding the [flood] incident” (WCJ Opin. at 5, ¶ 6), the WCJ made no specific credibility findings, nor was Employer given the opportunity to present any rebuttal evidence. The WCJ concluded that the claim petition was time-barred by section 315; that Claimant’s estoppel theory failed; that <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>the payment of medical expenses did not toll the limitations period; and that Employer would be prejudiced if the claim proceeded after fifteen years of delay.

The employer may rebut the claimant’s evidence by demonstrating, for example, that the injury was not work-related, or' that the payments were not made in lieu of workers’ compensation.

Claimant continued to work between the time of the flood incident and his back injury (WCJ Opin. at 4, ¶ 4), and he testified that he sought psychiatric care upon the advice of the physician treating him for his back injury. N.T. 4/1/96 at 12.

WCAB affirmed, finding that Claimant had presented insufficient evidence to meet his burden, despite the lack of credibility findings. The Commonwealth Court reversed, concluding that Claimant established a presumption of the purpose of the medical payments, and that Employer, by failing to present any evidence, did not rebut or attempt to answer that presumption. However, it is patently clear that Employer was never permitted to present rebuttal evidence in light of the unique procedural scenario; indeed, the WCJ specifically preserved Employer’s right to present <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>such evidence if the WCJ’s order was reversed on appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, on remand, in light of the standard enunciated above, Claimant should be permitted to present any additional evidence in support of his claim, and Employer should be allowed to present its rebuttal evidence.

As noted by the lead, the WCJ bifurcated the case to resolve the statute of repose issue as a threshold matter and also permitted only the Claimant to present evidence on such question. <em>See </em>R.R. at 52a-53a. The WCJ reasoned that, since it was undisputed that the petition on its face was barred by Section 315, it would be efficacious to test the legal sufficiency of the Claimant’s contention that an exception (tolling) was implicated. In dismissing the claim petition, then, the WCJ effectively entered a nonsuit against Claimant, concluding that Claimant had failed to make out a <em>prima faeie </em>case for tolling.</p>

For this reason alone, the WCJ’s decision to dismiss the claim petition cannot be sustained on its own terms. I believe, nonetheless, that it is also appropriate for the Court to evaluate whether the WCJ’s decision to dismiss the claim petition based upon the failure to adduce sufficient evidence to implicate Section 315’s “in lieu of payment” exception may be sustained for other reasons deriving from the record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

The intent component does not contemplate the acknowledgment of actual liability or other similar element of involuntariness — indeed, the overall standard by its express terms contemplates instances of voluntary payments. As I believe that the above-quoted formulation provides an appropriate, workable standard consistent with the statutory framework, I would adopt it here and, correspondingly, reject Employer’s assertion that the voluntariness of its payments should be viewed as negating the effect of Section 315’s tolling clause.

While I do not necessarily disfavor use of a rebuttable presumption in the Section 315 context, I am not as certain as the majority that a distinction between cases involving total and partial disability would need to be drawn where the presumption is deemed to arise by virtue of the voluntary payment of medical expenses. As the lead opinion acknowledges, the line of Commonwealth Court decisions from which it draws the presumption concern disability policy and wage payments rather than medical expenses. It appears to me that the inference/presumption language was utilized in' such cases because it is often difficult to distinguish whether payments to an employee reflect the employer's contractual obligation to provide compensation for continuing services rendered, or whether all or some component represents compensation for a work-related loss of earning capacity sustained. This problem is particularly troublesome in instances in which the employee remains working, for example, in a light duty capacity. <em>Compare Cotton v. John Wood Mfg. Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/126/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="126 Pa.

Like the lead, I would note that employers whose benefit plans compensate for non-occupational injuries ordinarily have the ability under the statute to prevent the tolling effect merely by designating the payments at issue as other than compensation. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 602 (providing, <em>inter alia, </em>that "any payment made under an established plan or policy of insurance for the payment of benefits on account of non-occupational illness or injury and which payment is identified as not being workmen's compensation shall not be considered to be payment in lieu of workmen’s compensation, and such payment shall not loll the running of the statute of limitations"). I support the Commonwealth Court’s emphasis on this provision as a general matter, <em>see Schreffler, </em><a href="/a2d/745/0697-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="745 A.2d 697" data-case-ids="11480519" data-case-paths="/a2d/745/0697-01">745 A.2d at 700</a>; however, I find such emphasis inapplicable where, as here, the claimant fails to establish, at a minimum, sufficient actual or constructive notice to the employer of the specific work-related injury from which the medical bills arise.</p>
