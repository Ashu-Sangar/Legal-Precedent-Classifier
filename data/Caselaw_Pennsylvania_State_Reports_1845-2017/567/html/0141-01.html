This Court granted allocatur to review the Commonwealth Court’s invalidation of the Pennsylvania agency custody requirement.

Due to medical problems, he remained in the hospital for a period of time and, having been abandoned by his mother, was committed to the care and custody of appellant City of Philadelphia, Department of Human Services (DHS). Upon release from the hospital, R.R.M. was immediately placed in foster care with a family which is unidentified in the record. At this time, DHS’s stated goal was to reunite R.R.M. with his biological mother. DHS’s efforts at reunification failed, however, and DHS changed its goal for the child to adoption.</p>
    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[264,865,1155,574]]]'>On August 6, 1989, DHS placed R.R.M. in the foster care of appellees under the supervision of DHS’s Counseling and Care Services. Shortly after placement, R.R.M. had an episode where he stopped breathing and, as a result, he was hospitalized for nine days. R.R.M. returned to appellees’ home on an apneá monitor for which appellees received training. After approximately one month with appellees, DHS returned R.R.M. to the original foster parents but then, in May of 1990, returned the child to appellees’ care. At that time, R.R.M. was two weeks shy of his first birthday but could not walk, crawl, hold a bottle or feed himself, and he lacked muscle tone.</p>

In the course of its investigation. DHS’s adoption division located R.R.M.’s biological father who expressed an interest in caring for the child. Consequently, DHS again changed its goal to reunification. Ultimately, the efforts to reunite R.R.M. with his biological father failed.</p>

Appellees were concerned that DHS might move R.R.M. from one foster home to another, which might compromise his health and development in light of his special medical needs. Accordingly, appellees notified DHS' that they were interested in adopting R.R.M. DHS informed <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>appellees that the child was ineligible for adoption because his biological father was involved in his life.</p>
    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[224,452,1155,963]]]'>DHS and appellees then explored the possibility of DHS awarding legal custody or temporary legal custody to appel-lees in lieu of adoption. The benefit of some form of legal custody, according to DHS, was that appellees would no longer need the approval of DHS and R.R.M.’s biological father to make needed medical decisions. Appellees did not have legal counsel at this point in the proceedings, and DHS did not inform appellees of the availability of adoption assistance subsidies or that accepting legal custody of R.R.M. would end any entitlement they might have to such subsidies. Furthermore, at the time appellees accepted temporary legal custody of R.R.M., they understood that he was not eligible for adoption because his biological father still maintained parental rights. DHS’s stated goal for R.R.M. at the time of the discussions about legal custody was reunification with the biological father. Meanwhile, DHS has admitted that awarding temporary legal custody of a child to foster parents makes reunification less likely.</p>

The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas issued a Dependency Review Order on September 2, 1992, memorializing the agreement and discharging the child’s formal commitment to DHS. The order stated that appellees were awarded “temporary legal custody” and that the matter could be relisted “upon application.” However, no further review of the child’s status was conducted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Accordingly, DHS apparently considered appellees’ proposed adoption of R.R.M. to be the equivalent of a private adoption, notwithstanding that R.R.M. was initially placed in the care and custody of DHS, that he was then placed with appellees as a foster family under the auspices of DHS, and that appellees sought temporary legal custody, thus changing R.R.M.’s status, precisely because DHS had informed them that R.R.M. was not at that time eligible to be adopted.</p>

This statement of purpose does not limit adoption assistance to special needs children in the legal custody of a county agency or other state-approved agency.

The state is not directed to enter into adoption assistance agreements only with adoptive parents of special needs children in the legal custody of a county agency or other state-approved agency. Therefore, we conclude that our state adoption assistance law conflicts with the Federal Law to the extent that it withholds adoption assistance payments from special needs children who are not in the legal custody of a county agency or other state-approved agency.</blockquote>

The references in the federal Act to “placement” of a foster child, as well as the references in the legislative history to a desire to encourage adoption over foster care, strongly suggest that the federal Act was intended to benefit children in the foster care system by making it easier for them to be placed in permanent homes. Furthermore, it is apparent that Congress contemplated agency custody as a proper measure of eligibility for adoption assistance, even if it did not expressly require such custody under the Act. Equally compelling is the fact that Congress expressly allowed the states participating in the federal program leeway to determine themselves, within certain broad parameters, which children have special needs and are therefore eligible for adoption assistance subsidies; the granting of such leeway hardly reveals an intent to restrict the states in the procrustean fashion that the Commonwealth Court panel majority concluded.</p>

That definition ensures that federal subsidies will be available where the need is greatest <em>i.e., </em>to children who are the most difficult to place in adoptive homes. It was entirely reasonable for the General Assembly to conclude that those children actually involved in the state foster care system, and who also have designated special needs, are the most difficult to place. It was equally as reasonable for the General Assembly to conclude that private adoption agencies placing children are less likely to face a shortage of prospective parents ready, willing and financially able to adopt children, including special needs children. Nothing in the federal Act or its legislative history suggests that it was intended to require states to provide assistance to facilitate adoptions in the latter situation, yet that is what the Commonwealth Court panel majority’s conclusion below would logically entail. Accordingly, for all of these reasons, we hold that the Pennsylvania Act’s requirement of agency custody does not conflict with the federal Act and, therefore, the requirement is not preempted.</p>

While appellees here were not technically designated as foster parents during the period when they had temporary legal custody of the child, neither did the placement with them permanently resolve the question of legal custody of R.R.M. Appellees had no permanent custody rights, the child’s biological father maintained his parental rights and, therefore, had the right to seek reunification with his child until those rights were terminated by the court in 1998, and DHS presumably had the power to seek to remove the child from appellees’ custody to effect such a reunification. The September 2,1992, order, like a foster placement, placed R.R.M. with appellees for a limited time only, not permanently, and that custody presumably was subordinate to the right of the agency and the child’s biological father. Indeed, DHS still considered reunification with the biological father as the long-term goal for the child when temporary legal custody was awarded to appellees. Implicit in a grant of temporary custody is a recognition that some other entity possesses residual control over the child. Furthermore, the parties agree that the grant of temporary legal custody in this case was a matter of convenience intended to allow appellees to make decisions regarding R.R.M.’s continuing medical treatment needs, without having to first obtain the consent of DHS and the biological father. Appel-lees were never advised that a consequence of this designation arranged solely to better meet the child’s special needs would be to forever disentitle them to adoption assistance based upon a strict definition of “custody.” In sum, under appellants’ own understanding of the proper purposes of the federal <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>and state acts, this is precisely the sort of adoption those statutes were designed to encourage and support.
