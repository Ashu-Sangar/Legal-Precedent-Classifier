    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[259,723,1157,1647]]]'>The common pleas court conducted a hearing concerning the availability of preliminary injunctive relief, at which the sole evidence presented was an affidavit from Sidney M. Zilber, the president of Commonwealth Surety, the company that provides surety bonding services to IBE through both Commonwealth Insurance Company and American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company. In the affidavit, Mr. Zilber attested that neither company charges IBE for the issuance of bid bonds, and that the premium charged once a contract is awarded is the same for both companies (1.75 percent of the contract price); the Zilber affidavit was entered into evidence without objection. In denying injunctive relief, the common pleas court cited <em>Rainey v. Borough of Derry, </em>163 Pa.Cmwlth. 606, <a href="/a2d/641/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="641 A.2d 698" data-case-ids="11294326,1459897" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/0698-01,/pa-commw/163/0606-01">641 A.2d 698</a> (1994), for the principle that a governmental body may waive bid defects where the omission or noncompliance did not confer a competitive advantage upon the bidder. The court concluded that IBE did not enjoy such an advantage. It reasoned that, once the contract was signed, the bid bond, which merely exists to ensure that a successful bidder will execute a contract, would have been replaced by a performance bond; IBE immediately submitted a new bid bond at the request of the District; and the bidding instructions provided notice that the District reserved authority to waive bid irregularities. Thus, the court held, Gaeta had not demonstrated that the District’s alleged wrongful conduct was manifest or that his right to relief was clear. Moreover, the common pleas court reasoned, a grant of injunctive relief would cause greater taxpayer injury in light of the nearly $100,000 difference between the amounts of IBE’s and Almond’s bids, and would detrimentally delay construction of the new school.</p>

At the outset of its discussion, the court referenced the legislative scheme requiring public, competitive bidding on school construction projects and mandating the award of contracts to low bidders. <em><a href="/a2d/757/1011-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="757 A.2d 1011" data-case-ids="11243973" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/1011-01">Id.</a> </em>at 1013 (citing 24 P.S. § 7-751(a)).

The Commonwealth Court then emphasized the general requirement of bid “responsiveness” imposed by the judiciary to effectuate these legislative policies, embodying a general rule that the specifications set forth in bidding documents are to be considered mandatory and must be strictly followed by bidders for their submissions to be deemed valid. <em>See <a href="/a2d/757/1011-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="757 A.2d 1011" data-case-ids="11243973" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/1011-01">id.</a></em>

The District highlights the embodiment of these principles in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Rainey. </em>Acknowledging that <em>Harris </em>adds that a <em>per se </em>determination of non-responsiveness attaches in circumstances in which a defect pertains to bid requirements grounded in legislative pronouncements, the District emphasizes that there is no legislative predicate for a surety rating requirement for bid bonds. According to the District, its express reservation of the right to waive irregularities in its bid instructions constituted adequate notice to bidders concerning minor post-submission changes or corrections, and therefore, ameliorated any unfairness to bidders that might otherwise have arisen by virtue of IBE’s post-submission cure. Regarding the Commonwealth Court’s conclusions concerning materiality and competitive advantage, the District argues that they are unsupported by the record. Gaeta, on the other hand, argues that <em>Harris </em>stands for the proposition that materiality is established on the face of bid documents to the extent that they employ mandatory language. Since the bid instructions here contained the imperative “shall” in indicating that a bid bond was to be provided by a surety maintaining a Best rating of “A-” or better, <em>see supra </em>note 2, Gaeta asserts that the quality of surety provision must be deemed material and mandatory. He further maintains that the materiality of the quality of surety requirement is evident from the diminution in protection provided to the District, and from the District’s directive to IBE to correct the irregularity. According to Gaeta, the bid bond irregularity <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>also afforded a cost advantage to IBE, as well as an option to withdraw its bid without relinquishment of a penal sum.</p>

Such limitations have been couched in terms of the requirement of bid responsiveness, which the Commonwealth Court found controlling in the present case.

With regard to the assurance factor, as Gaeta contends, review of the language of the bid documents can provide insight into the degree of importance attached to the condition by the District. Upon review of the language employed, however, we find Gaeta’s emphasis upon the District’s use of the word “shall” to be overstated, as imperatives run throughout the bid instructions and pertain to virtually all requirements of substance and form, and as the District expressly reserved the entitlement to waive irregularities. <em>See supra </em>note 3.

    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[218,1097,1156,1110]]]'>Concerning the competitive advantage factor, the trial court’s finding that any impact of the “B’’-rated security was negligible is supported by the only available record evidence, the affidavit presented by IBE. This attestation suggests that the surety company’s rating had little or no bearing upon the cost of IBE’s bid, and that IBE could have obtained the required bond from another surety with which it deals at like cost. In addition to being unsupported in the record, Gaeta’s claim of a significant cost advantage seems unlikely in the circumstances and particularly in light of the substantial disparity between IBE’s and Almond’s bids.' Finally, Gaeta’s assertion that the bid bond irregularity afforded IBE an opportunity to retract its bid and undermined the security presented is meritless, since both IBE and its original surety made clear and unequivocal commitments to the District, and Pennsylvania’s requirements concerning bid withdrawal are exacting for much the same reasons as are those concerning bid acceptance. <em>See generally Modany v.
