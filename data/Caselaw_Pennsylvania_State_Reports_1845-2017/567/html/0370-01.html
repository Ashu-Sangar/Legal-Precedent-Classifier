The lead Justices decline to address such issues, concluding that they are inadequately developed within Appellant’s brief. While I acknowledge that Appellant’s brief is deficient in this respect, the Court has only recently addressed counsel’s obligation to develop, to the extent possible, the nature of the claim asserted with respect to each individual facet of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="566 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="706331" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01">566 Pa. 553</a>, 566, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d 517</a>, 525 (2001). Particularly, since Appellant’s brief in this case was filed before the decision in <em>Williams, </em>I would not treat the failure to more fully develop the ineffectiveness claims as fatal to appellate review. In my view, however, Appellant’s guilt phase claims would not entitle him to relief, particularly in light of trial counsel’s testimony during the post-conviction hearing that Appellant admitted to having committed the crime, which, obviously, limited the avenues for presentation of the defense case. Accordingly, I concur in the result with respect to those claims.</p>

      <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>The Court inexplicably remands this matter, which has already been the subject of a PCRA hearing at which appellant’s trial counsel testified in response to the claim that he was ineffective in failing to develop and present mitigation evidence, for a further PCRA hearing at which appellant will be permitted to attempt to prove what is alleged in affidavits he has attached to his brief. I disagree with the remand for two reasons. First, the claim that trial counsel was ineffective in this regard is waived under the PCRA since appellant could have raised the claim on direct appeal, but did not. Second, in remanding, the Court simply ignores the fact that the PCRA court passed upon the merits of a non-waived, layered version of this ineffectiveness claim. The PCRA court concluded that the claim lacked merit because trial counsel’s PCRA testimony revealed that counsel’s consultations with appellant and his family revealed no basis for him to pursue a mental health-based defense at the penalty phase; accordingly, appellant “has failed to prove that his trial counsel was ineffective or that his subsequent counsel was ineffective for failing to bring a meritless claim” on direct appeal. PCRA op. at 8. In disposing of the layered claim, the PCRA court apparently accepted appellant’s affidavits at face value, noting that trial counsel’s testimony “does not conflict with the testimony as proposed in the affidavits.” <em>Id. </em>at 4. Given this posture of the case, a further hearing- would be required only if this Court concluded that the PCRA court erred in finding that counsel were not ineffective for failing to pursue a childhood trauma/mental health mitigation claim, the basis for which was never revealed to counsel by appellant or his family members. Because I cannot agree with the Court’s unexplained and apparently arbitrary grant of a remand here, I respectfully dissent.</p>

I see none. Trial counsel’s credited testimony that his consultations with appellant and his family gave him no reason to inquire into this area established that his conduct was objectively reasonable. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in <em>Strickland:</em>

    <blockquote id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[301,1153,1110,630]]]'>strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments.</blockquote>

Counsel’s actions are usually based, quite properly, on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant. In particular, what investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such information. For example, when the facts that' support a certain potential line of defense are generally known to counsel because of what the defendant has said, the need for further investigation may be considerably diminished or eliminated altogether. And when a <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel’s failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable. In short, inquiry into counsel’s conversations with the defendant may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel’s investigation decisions, just as it may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel’s other litigation decisions.</blockquote>

That version of the claims fails, however, because it is mere boilerplate. I also write separately on this point to address the suggestion in the Concurring Opinion by Mr. Justice Saylor that a dismissal of appellant’s remaining claims based upon their inadequate development is erroneous because the brief in this case was filed before this Court’s decision in <em>Williauis. </em>The <em>dicta </em>in <em>Williams </em>upon which the concurrence relies did not announce or establish the substantive standards governing Sixth Amendment claims of counsel ineffectiveness; those standards have existed all along. Appellant’s failure even to address the constitutional standards governing his claims is a perfectly appropriate ground for disposition.</p>
