The Court of Common Pleas of Northhampton County found that such a writ was not the proper procedural tool for enforcing the judgment. The Commonwealth Court reversed, finding that the common law of Pennsylvania now incorporates the Act of April 2, 1860, P.L. 589, as <em>amended, </em>53 P.S. § 49271, even though the court acknowledged that act had been repealed by the Act of April 28, 1978, 42 P.S. § 20001 <em>et </em>

This judgment was the result of a grievance brought by the Union on behalf of Union member Marc Decker, under the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Borough. The Borough adopted a resolution on August 4, 1997, with the purpose of satisfying the judgment. That resolution imposed a per-capita tax which would pay the judgment over five years, in roughly equal annual installments. When the Borough did not satisfy the judgment by the end of 1997, the Union filed a praecipe for a writ of execution on January 8,1998.</p>

The interpretive note to the section from which 42 Pa.C.S § 1722(a)(1) was derived provides that, if no general rules are in effect with respect to the repealed statutes on the effective date of repeal, the practice and procedure provided in the repealed statutes shall continue in full force and effect as part of the common law until such general rules are promulgated. Because no rules or procedures for collecting on money judgments against third class cities have been promulgated since the repeal of section 8802, Ryon maintains that this section remains in effect and was properly the method Ryon used to enforce It judgments against the City. <em>(See </em>Ryon’s brief at 13-16.)
