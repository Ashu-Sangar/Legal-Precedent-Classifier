The facts established at trial are that appellant was smoking cocaine on the night of the murder two blocks from the victim’s house, ran out of money to buy cocaine, left the crack house and reappeared a short time later spattered with blood, in the possession of a large knife, her shirt stuffed with fifty dollar bills, claiming that she had stabbed and robbed someone and asking for persons present to testify that she had been there all day and night, when the victim, an invalid in the care of appellant, had been stabbed ánd robbed during this period of time and no other persons were stabbed and robbed in this <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>part of the city during this period of time.

The fear was that in cutting off petitions for post-conviction relief, injustice might be done.

That is why the requirements of discussing ineffectiveness claims in the context of the circumstances of the case, demonstrating that the claim is not finally litigated or waived, and demonstrating that counsel can have had no rational strategic or tactical reason for failing to raise the claim at an earlier stage of the proceedings are so important. These requirements are devices to ensure that the claims being made are the claims of an innocent person. If counsel may have been ineffective in some particular, but the facts of the case independent of the alleged ineffectiveness establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the ineffectiveness cannot have affected the truth determining process so that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could be made. And that is what the petitioner must demonstrate in order to be eligible for relief under the PCRA. If the claim has been finally litigated, petitioner has received the review he is entitled to. If the claim is waived, petitioner may still be eligible for review, but only if he complies with the pleading and proof requirements of ineffectiveness claims. And once again, pleading and proof requirements for ineffectiveness claims will involve, at least, a statement of the facts established at trial by independent evidence, and that, in turn, implicates the petitioner’s innocence. Finally, if the claim was not raised earlier, petitioner is entitled to a review of that claim only if he establishes that there can have been no rational tactical or strategic reason for not raising it earlier. If those extraordinary facts are established, we will review the claim because of a concern that petitioner may actually be innocent.</p>

That evening Rivers rarr out of money to buy cocaine and left the home of her friend about 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. A neighbor was with the victim until 9:00 p.rtr. Rivers returned to the crack house about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. that evening with a large number of fifty dollar bills stuffed in her shirt.

The Commonwealth established that for the geographic area near the crack house and the victim, there were no reported beatings or stabbings on the night of the murder from 4:00 p.m. through midnight of the next day.

Mr. Justice Saylor, in dissent, would hold that Rivers is entitled to an additional post conviction hearing because defense counsel was ineffective in failing to present evidence of the defendant’s past mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, and unfortunate childhood. In effect, he would create what amounts to a per se rule that whenever the defendant is able to present evidence of mental disturbance and an unfortunate life, counsel will be ineffective if he fails to introduce this evidence in support of the claim that the defendant was unable to conform her conduct to the law because of extreme mental or' emotional disturbance. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2),(3). Because so many intangibles'are involved, our law has always been that we will not second-guess trial counsel's trial tactics, so long as there is a reasonable basis for what trial counsel did or did not do. While Mr. Justice Saylor cites two federal cases and one state case in which psychiatric evidence is treated as exceptionally important, the federal courts and Illinois notwithstanding, it is not a scientific certainty that persons who may have suffered mental illness are incapable of conforming their conduct to the law. In fact, it is equally plausible that there are many people with personal histories equivalent to Rivers' who spend their entire lives in conformity with the law. It may be that upon hearing evidence of Rivers’ appalling background, jurors might decide that she is incapable of rehabilitation, and deserving of the harshest punishment available. On the other hand, jurors might also feel that a person who has made efforts to help herself is deserving of another chance. In any event, the lynchpin of Mr. Justice Saylor's view, that the history of mental disturbance, on this record, is, in and of itself, a passport to a mitigated penalty, is by no means a certainty, and we are in no position to substitute our judgment for that of trial counsel as to what is most likely to promote his client’s best interest.</p>

Counsel is always presumed effective; the unshifting burden to prove ineffectiveness always rests upon the defendant; and the defendant must always plead and prove both that counsel’s performance was deficient (the arguable merit and lack of reasonable basis prongs of our test), and that actual prejudice resulted from the deficient performance.

In <em>Marrero, </em>this Court rejected layered, boilerplate claims of appellate counsel ineffectiveness because it deemed the underlying claims of counsel ineffectiveness to be meritless, rather than focusing on the failure of the appellant to address other, equally necessary elements of the ineffectiveness standards. I view the <em>Marrero </em>disposition as an available and appropriate, but not a required and exclusive, approach to the merits of a reviewable ineffectiveness claim. This is so because both the U.S. Supreme Court and this Court have made clear that a court is not required to analyze the elements of an ineffectiveness claim in any particular order of priority; instead, if a claim fails under any necessary element of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the court may proceed to that element first. <em>See Smith v.

Appellant’s arguments in this case, like the non-argument forwarded in <em>Marrero, </em>at best may be construed as attempting to establish the arguable merit of her underlying waived claims while she then simply assumes that the failure to pursue such claims renders counsel <em>per se </em>ineffective. This <em>per </em>se approach to ineffectiveness fails to establish either the performance prong <em>(i.e., </em>lack of reasonable basis) or the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Accordingly, the claims must, inevitably, fail. The advantage of discussing the fatal deficiency in such an argument on the merits is that it reinforces for PCRA petitioners and practitioners alike the necessity that they address all necessary substantive elements of a claim in order to actually obtain relief on it, as opposed to the decidedly Pyrrhic victory that will result when a claim is undeveloped and survives waiver only as a matter of this Court’s grace. At least in cases where the substantive deficiency in the argument is pervasive, as in this case, I think we better serve by focusing on those substantive deficiencies, as the majority has done here.</p>

The only exception to this manner of presentation is Claim number X, alleging that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigation evidence at the penalty phase. Unlike the other claims, this claim focuses on perceived inadequacies of counsel.

A separate question, of course, is whether appellant's boilerplate ineffectiveness claims should be deemed waived under this Court's Rules of Appellate Procedure and principles of appellale jurisprudence concerning what is necessary to adequately present a claim for review. As I understand the lead opinion, it does not deem appellant’s inelfec-<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>liveness claims to be waived, notwithstanding that they are stated in boilerplate fashion, but instead treats the failure to develop relevant arguments as a failure on the merits of tire claims.

Since petitioners are subject to a final judgment of sentence and have had the benefit of an available direct appeal process, they face substantial hurdles; ultimately, the availability of post-conviction relief will often depend upon factual and legal findings by a post-conviction court entailing credibility assessments and judgments concerning the weight of the evidence presented. <em>See generally Basemore, </em>560 Pa. at 293-94, 744 A.2d at 737 <em>(remanding to a </em>post-conviction court <em>for </em>the performance of such credibility assessments and judgments concerning alleged mitigating evidence).
