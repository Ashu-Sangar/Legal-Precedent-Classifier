Approximately six cars were halted because the geese were obstructing the road. <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>Sgt. Traeger stopped his police cruiser and approached the driver of one of the stopped vehicles who was attempting to clear the geese from the road. Once Sgt. Traeger and the driver had successfully herded the geese from the road, the officer noticed appellant’s vehicle leave the road, enter an adjacent parking lot and pass the stopped vehicles on the right as appellant drove through the parking lot. Appellant almost hit some of the geese as he drove through the parking lot. Appellant did not slow down or stop at any point in the parking lot.

Traeger was concerned that appellant would cause an accident as he attempted to return to the road from the parking lot. Therefore, as appellant was starting back into the traffic on Pearce Mill Road, Sgt. Trae-ger pulled him over to cite him for passing on the right in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3304. When Sgt. Traeger approached appellant’s vehicle, he noticed that appellant’s breath had a moderate odor of alcohol, his eyes were bloodshot, his upper torso was weaving as he sat in his vehicle, his speech was slurred, and he had difficulty producing his driver’s license and registration card. Appellant admitted to drinking at a picnic nearby and offered to park and wait a couple of hours before driving again. Sgt. Traeger and a second officer administered field sobriety tests, which appellant failed. The officers transported appellant to North Hills Passavant Hospital where blood was drawn revealing that appellant’s blood alcohol content was .28 percent, i.e., almost three times the legal limit.</p>

A divided Superior Court affirmed in a published opinion. <em>Commonwealth v.

Judge Stevens, in an opinion joined by retired Justice Montemuro, reasoned that appellant’s vehicle was part of the flow of traffic on Pearce Mill Road rather than part of a separate traffic pattern in the parking lot. Judge Stevens further reasoned that appellant’s maneuver into the parking lot in “an obvious attempt to improve his position on Pearce Mill Road” occurred while “the orientation of appellant’s vehicle remained at all times with the flow of traffic on Pearce Mill Road,” thus making Sgt. Traeger’s conclusion that he was overtaking on the right in violation of § 3304(a) a reasonable one. <em><a href="/a2d/750/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="750 A.2d 349" data-case-ids="11525827" data-case-paths="/a2d/750/0349-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/750/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="750 A.2d 349" data-case-ids="11525827" data-case-paths="/a2d/750/0349-01">at 351</a>. Judge Stevens further found that the facts supported a finding that appellant’s actions were taken in disregard of a potential traffic hazard and therefore constituted an unsafe and unlawful pass on the right in violation of § 3304(b). Thus, the Superior Court panel majority affirmed that Sgt. Traeger had reasonable and articulable grounds under the Motor Vehicle Code for stopping appellant’s vehicle. Judge Cercone dissented, opining that appellant was not passing on a roadway in violation of § 3304 but rather on a separate trafficway — the parking lot. Judge Cercone did not address whether, in his view, appellant had violated § 3304(b).</p>

Traeger had reasonable and articula-ble grounds for stopping his vehicle because the stop was based upon an error of law. Appellant asserts that he did not violate § 3304 because he left the roadway before overtaking the stopped vehicles on Pearce Mill Road; thus, Sgt. Traeger made a mistake of law thereby invalidating the stop. The Commonwealth counters that Sgt. Traeger had a reasonable belief that appellant had violated § 3304(a) as well as a valid <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>safety concern regarding appellant’s maneuver under § 3304(b).</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[221,474,1154,694]]]'>Appellant was charged with a violation of § 3304 because he overtook vehicles by passing on the right in a manner not covered by either of the approved conditions provided in the statute. Sgt. Traeger’s testimony makes it abundantly clear that he had at least reasonable grounds to believe that appellant did, in fact, violate the no passing on the right provision. Sgt. Traeger observed appellant leaving the traffic lane, entering a parking lot on the right which was separated from the roadway only by a solid white line, passing the vehicles stopped on the road, and, without making any stops in the parking lot, attempting to reenter the flow of traffic over the solid white line. At that point, Sgt. Traeger pulled appellant over.</p>
    <p id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.6",175,[220,1219,1159,471]]]'>Appellant urges upon this Court an unwarrantedly narrow interpretation of the statute. He contends that § 3304’s prohibition against a motorist overtaking vehicles on the right if the motorist drives “off the roadway” to do so applies only if the motorist drives on the berm, shoulder or sidewalk of the road to pass on the right. Because the parking lot in question was not the berm, shoulder or sidewalk to Pearce Mill Road, appellant argues that his overtaking of traffic was not in violation of the statute.</p>

Nevertheless, it is apparent that appellant’s narrow definition of “off the roadway” to include only driving on the berm, shoulder or sidewalk, is untenable. The plain language of the statute does not restrict “off the roadway” in the fashion appellant advocates; there is no basis for this Court to imply a restriction where the General Assembly did not do so explicitly.' Construing the language of the statute according to its plain meaning, appellant clearly drove “off the roadway” that was Pearce Mill Road when he entered the parking lot which was adjacent to the roadway. It became immediately apparent that he did not do so in order to employ the parking lot as a parking lot. Instead, he immediately overtook vehicles that had been ahead of him on Pearce Mill Road by passing them upon the right, and attempted to re-enter the roadway. This was a clear violation of § 3304(a). Moreover, appellant passed the vehicles in such a manner that Sgt. Traeger reasonably determined that it was unsafe in violation of § 3304(b). Appellant’s conduct was exactly what the statute, by its plain terms, prohibits.</p>
    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[267,1511,1154,854]]]'>Appellant’s “interpretation” of § 3304 poses more of an argumentative question for a factfinder than a legal basis for suppression. Appellant was free to present this version of the event — i.e., that he simply entered a parking lot, proceeded through it, and then later tried to reenter the flow of traffic, rather than attempting to use the parking lot as a right-hand passing lane — as a substantive defense to the charges at trial. As a suppression matter, however, his version of the events is not binding. Appellant’s after-the-fact interpretation of the statute and his conduct is decidedly not the only, or even the most logical, interpretation of his conduct for purposes of determining whether Sgt. Traeger had reasonable grounds to stop him. Sgt. Traeger needed only objective, reasonable grounds to believe that appellant had violated either § 3304(a) or § 3304(b) or both sections. Those reasonable grounds existed here.</p>

The majority points out that the Vehicle Code does not define the term “off the roadway” for purposes of Section 3304. The majority rejects Appellant’s assertion that Section 3304’s prohibition against a motorist overtaking vehicles on the right if the motorist drives “off the roadway” only applies where the motorist drives on the berm, shoulder or sidewalk of the road. The majority concludes that Appellant’s interpre<a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>tation is “unwarranted^ narrow” and is not restricted by the plain language of the statute.

It became immediately apparent that he did not do so in order to employ the parking lot as a parking lot. Instead, he immediately overtook vehicles that had been ahead of him on Pearce Mill Road by passing them upon the right, and attempted to re-enter the roadway. This was a clear violation of § 3304(a). Moreover, appellant passed the vehicles in such a manner that Sgt. Traeger reasonably determined that it was unsafe in violation of § 3304(b). Appellant’s conduct was exactly what the statute, by its plain terms, prohibits.</blockquote>
