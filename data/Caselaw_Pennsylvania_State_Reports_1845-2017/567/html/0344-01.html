Initially, he argues that the PCRA court erred in failing to grant him relief in the form of a new trial where, as here, the jury returned verdicts of guilt on the charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder and third-degree murder, verdicts which are mutually exclusive and which, he argues, operate to nullify his first-degree murder conviction. In conjunction with his initial argument, Appellant maintains that because the verdicts of first, secohd and third degree murder are mutually exclusive, the trial court improperly molded the verdicts of guilt on the charges of first, second, and third degree murder to a conviction on the charge of first degree murder alone. Along this same vein, Appellant asserts that the trial court further erred by failing to poll the jury regarding all three verdicts rather than on first degree murder oniy.</p>

We recently addressed the exact issue raised by Appellant in <em>Commonwealth v. Young, </em><a href="/pa/561/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="561 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="93396" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0034-01">561 Pa. 34</a>, <a href="/a2d/748/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="748 A.2d 166" data-case-ids="11453899,93396" data-case-paths="/a2d/748/0166-01,/pa/561/0034-01">748 A.2d 166</a> (1999). There, the appellant alleged that the jury’s verdicts of guilt for both first degree murder and third degree murder were legally inconsistent since a conviction for first degree murder requires a finding that a defendant had a specific intent to kill, while the <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>conviction for third degree murder requires the opposite finding, that the defendant did not have a specific intent to kill.</p>

Instead, it is a homicide that the Commonwealth must prove was committed with malice, but one with respect to which the Commonwealth need not prove, nor even address, the presence or absence of a specific intent to kill. Indeed, to convict a defendant for third degree murder, the jury need not consider whether the defendant had a specific intent to kill, nor make any finding with respect thereto.

Likewise, Appellant’s claim that it was error for the trial court to mold the verdicts of guilt on the charges of first, second, and third degree murder to a conviction on the charge of first degree murder alone lacks merit as this claim was also raised by the appellant in <em>Young </em>and we rejected such claim based upon our conclusion that the verdicts are not mutually exclusive.</p>

The majority opinion gives the perhaps-unintentional impression that appellant has raised claims of trial court error and trial counsel ineffectiveness which are reviewable on the merits in this PCRA proceeding. Those particular claims, however, were available to appellant on direct appeal and, thus, they are waived under the PCRA. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/567/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="786 A.2d 203" data-case-ids="404536,404591,9454337,9454361" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0186-01,/pa/567/0185-01,/a2d/786/0203-01,/a2d/786/0203-02">786 A.2d 203</a>, 212 (Pa.2001). The only claims reviewable on the merits here are appellant’s constitutionally distinct contentions that his direct appeal counsel, who was different from trial counsel, was ineffective for failing to raise these claims of trial court error and trial counsel ineffectiveness. Because the majority opinion ignores the statutory waiver provisions of the PCRA and appears to review non-cognizable and indisputably waived claims on the merits, I cannot join it.</p>

Any other version of appellant’s claims is waived since it could have been raised on direct appeal. The question of the proper manner in which to analyze claims under the PCRA is not simply elevation of form over substance. Capital cases rarely end in this Court, but are subject to further review on federal habeas corpus. That review often involves complex issues of issue preservation and fair presentation, <em>i.e., </em>exhaustion and procedural default. At that point, what might appear to be form now quite often becomes as important, if not more important, than substance. In recognition of this continuum of review in capital cases, I think it essential that this Court (1) be consistent in its application of the PCRA, and (2) be precise as to what claim it is that this Court deems reviewable under Pennsylvania law, and why. <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>Because the majority opinion gives the mistaken impression that appellant’s .waived claims of trial court error and trial counsel ineffectiveness are reviewable on the merits under the PCRA, and thereby ignores the express language of the PCRA and the import of this Court’s holding regarding relaxed waiver in <em>Albrecht, </em>I cannot join in its approach.</p>
