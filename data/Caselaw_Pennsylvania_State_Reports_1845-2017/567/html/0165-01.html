Her boyfriend, Gary Risinger, also lived in the house. The house was insured for $80,000.00, which was more than the purchase price. Blystone was having serious financial difficulties and the utility company had shut off the natural gas service to the residence. The house was heated by a coal and wood-burning stove.</p>

The Pennsylvania State Police Fire Marshall’s Office investigated the fire and determined that it was arson. Appellant, Blystone, and Risinger were interviewed as part of the investigation. Each claimed that the <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>fire was accidental. A polygraph examination was scheduled for all three<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> individuals regarding their knowledge of the crime.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[260,501,1153,837]]]'>Following the fire, they moved into another house in Butler County, where Blystone’s grandmother, Mary Boofer (Boofer), was living. On the night of March 7, 1992, Blystone and Risinger were staying in the upstairs bedroom. Blystone’s cousin, Judith Ealy (Ealy) and her boyfriend, David Pisor were also sleeping on the second floor. Boofer and her boyfriend, James Shever, were in a downstairs bedroom. Appellant was staying in the living room, where it was his job to tend the fireplace, which was the only source of heat in the entire house. At approximately 4:00 a.m., a fire destroyed the home, resulting in the death of Blystone and Ealy. The survivors, who were either naked or partially dressed when they escaped the fire, noticed that Appellant was fully dressed and was wearing his lace-up boots. ítisinger and Shever testified that Appellant usually removed his shirt and shoes when sleeping on the living room couch.</p>
    <p id="b288-6" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[260,1363,1150,785]]]'>Michelle Goodman, who was Boofer’s granddaughter, lived next door to the house where the fire took place. She awoke at approximately 4:00 a.m. when she heard her dogs barking. She looked outside the window, and saw that the porch of the house next door was on fire. After asking her boyfriend to call 9-1-1 to report the fire, she saw Appellant walk across the yard at a normal pace. He knocked on her door and told her that everyone was out of the house. According to Appellant, he cleaned out the fireplace at 7:80 p.m. the evening of the fire and he placed the ashes in a bucket that he set on the porch to cool. At 2:30 a.m., he transferred the ashes to a paper bag, and placed the bag of ashes on the couch on the porch. He claimed that he saved the ashes because his mother wanted to use them for kitty litter. Appellant went to sleep' at 3:30 a.m. and was awakened by the fire at 4:00 a.m.</p>

Areas of the living room tested positive for hydrocarbons, indicating that a petroleum based product had been used to accelerate the fire. According to the Allegheny County Fire Marshall, even if the fire had been started by the ashes on the couch, as Appellant claimed, it would have taken three to four hours of smoldering before the couch burst into flames.</p>

Appellant’s acquittal of the first arson charge <em>after </em>his conviction for the second arson where the trial court allowed the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of his participation in the first arson to prove his motive for committing the second arson does not <em>-per se </em>invalidate the decision of the trial court.

However, to the extent that the majority’s further expression concerning the merits of the underlying claim can be read to suggest that a subsequent acquittal may never be offered as a basis for supporting a claim that evidence of prior conduct should not have been admitted and/or that prejudice resulted from the erroneous admission of such evidence, I would respectfully disassociate myself from such suggestion. Notably, other jurisdictions are divided concerning whether, and under what circumstances, evidence may be admitted of another crime for which the defendant has been acquitted. <em>See generally </em>2 McCormick, Evidence § 190, at 671 &amp; n. 64 (5th ed. 1999) (collecting <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>cases); Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence as to Other Offense as Affected by Defendant’s Acquittal of That Offense, </em><a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.L.R.%204th%20934" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="25 A.L.R. 4th 934">25 A.L.R.4th 934</a> (2000) (same). Given the competing views and the rather complex nature of the questions involved, and particularly in light of the overtones of an after-discovered evidence paradigm arising where the other-crime acquittal occurs subsequent to the conviction under review, I view these questions as best left for a cáse (or cases) in which their resolution is necessary to the disposition.</p>

The cases were severed for trial upon Appellant’s motion, and the Commonwealth chose to prosecute the homicide/arson case first, which is the case before the Court here. At trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence of the alleged prior crime of arson to prove motive and intent in the instant case. On January 21, 1993, a jury convicted Appellant of two counts of second-degree murder and one count each of arson, <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>intimidation of witnesses, recklessly endangering another person and failure to prevent a catastrophe.

The crux of the evidentiary issue raised on direct appeal, however, was that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a crime for which Appellant had been charged but not yet convicted, thereby allowing the Commonwealth to assert Appellant’s guilt in the first arson case without having to prove that charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The crux of the issue here, on the other hand, is the effect of the subsequent acquittal rather than the admission of evidence of a crime for which the charges were still pending. The distinction between the two claims is, in my view, most clearly highlighted by the simple fact that Appellant had merely been charged with, and not yet acquitted of, the first arson at the time the trial court made its evidentiary ruling. Thus, it would have been impossible for Appellant to argue the effect of the acquittal at that point, when such an event had not yet occurred. Given these circumstances, I believe it is unfair to conclude, as the majority does, that the “ultimate question” in the two proceedings is the same. <em>See Commonwealth v.
