First, he asserts that governmental officials interfered with the' preparation of his appeals. Appellant contends that there were two separate instances of governmental interference. He initially focuses on the first PCRA court’s denial of his request for funds to hire a private investigator to gather data regarding Appellant’s childhood in Georgia. Essentially, Appellant is claiming that the first PCRA court’s failure to disburse these funds hampered Appellant’s efforts to develop a claim that prior counsel was ineffective for failing to raise mental health claims.</p>

      <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>Next, Appellant claims that there was governmental interference in this matter when the District Attorney’s office did not divulge evidence to Appellant’s present counsel. Appellant alleges that when present counsel received Appellant’s file from Appellant’s former counsel in May of 1999, Appellant discovered that the file did not contain police reports or trial discovery. At that juncture, Appellant attempted to obtain the missing documents from the District Attorney. Appellant alleges that the District Attorney did not turn over the requested documents until November of 1999. He baldly asserts that without these documents, he was unable to properly investigate and ascertain what claims he had available; thus, he concludes, the District Attorney’s interference prevented Appellant from being able to identify and litigate claims.</p>
    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[221,1172,1157,633]]]'>This claim must also be rejected. We have previously stated that where a petitioner alleges that a District Attorney’s failure to produce documents amounts to governmental interference, then that petitioner must identify a specific claim that he was unable to discover or develop due to the District Attorney’s conduct. <em>Commonwealth v. Yarris, </em><a href="/pa/557/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="557 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="56747" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0012-01">557 Pa. 12</a>, <a href="/a2d/731/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="731 A.2d 581" data-case-ids="11666446,56747" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0581-01,/pa/557/0012-01">731 A.2d 581</a>, 588 (1999). Appellant, however, has failed to explain how the District Attorney’s conduct hobbled his development or prevented his discovery of any particular claim. Thus, he has not established the existence of governmental interference such that this PCRA petition is excused from the timeliness requirements.</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[222,1856,1153,518]]]'>Appellant also claims that the facts upon which his claims were predicated were unknown to him and could not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence. Thus, he contends that he qualifies for the after-discovered evidence exception to the timeliness requirements. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l )(ii). In support of this claim, Appellant alleges that until his present counsel received his file and also had time to review that file, he could not have discovered the facts and circumstances that would establish ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>

      <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>This argument fails. We have stated that “attempt[s] to interweave concepts of ineffective assistance of counsel and after-discovered evidence as a means of establishing jurisdiction [are] unconvincing.” <em>Commonwealth v. Gamboa-Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/562/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="562 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="225976" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0070-01">562 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="753 A.2d 780" data-case-ids="11212841,225976" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0780-01,/pa/562/0070-01">753 A.2d 780</a>, 785 (2000). A petitioner cannot establish the after-discovered evidence exception merely by alleging that possible ineffective assistance of counsel claims were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been discovered until after present counsel reviewed the petitioner’s file. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pursell, </em><a href="/pa/561/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="561 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="93220" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0214-01">561 Pa. 214</a>, <a href="/a2d/749/0911-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="749 A.2d 911" data-case-ids="11532653,93220" data-case-paths="/a2d/749/0911-01,/pa/561/0214-01">749 A.2d 911</a>, 916-917 (2000).</p>

He counters that if this court failed to adopt his position, potentially meritorious ineffectiveness claims will essentially be insulated from review. Appellant asserts that such a situation should not be countenanced. Rather, it is his opinion that whenever new counsel believes he has uncovered a colorable claim of ineffectiveness on the part of prior counsel, then such a claim should be reviewed, regardless of how many previous collateral attacks have been litigated and how many years have, elapsed since the petitioner’s judgment has become final.</p>
