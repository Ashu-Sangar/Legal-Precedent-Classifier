Brown, Phillips’ boyfriend, had resided with them since early July of 1993. At approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 3, 1993, <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>Phillips went to the house of a friend and left Rafael asleep at home with Brown.

However, at approximately 9:00 p.m., after unsuccessfully attempting to locate both Rafael and Brown, she called the police. On August 5 and 6, 1993, the police searched her home and the surrounding neighborhood. At approximately 6:00 p.m. on August 6, 1993, while searching the nearby abandoned Rosen Housing Projects at 23rd and Diamond Streets, the police found Rafael’s body in an elevator shaft sixteen to twenty feet under a heavy metal grate. Dr. Bennett Preston (coroner), an Assistant Medical Examiner for the City of Philadelphia, examined Rafael’s body at the scene and later conducted an autopsy. He noted bruises on the forehead of Rafael, the back of his head, the left upper abdomen, the right outer abdomen, the left lower abdomen, the side of the liver, abrasions on the left upper back and back of the right thigh, a lacerated spleen, and evidence of bleeding in the abdominal cavity. The skin on Rafael’s rectum was completely torn away from his anus, showing that someone forcibly placed a hard, blunt object into his rectum. Rafael had also suffered massive injuries to his colon. All tests for sperm and acid phosphatase, an enzyme found in semen, yielded negative results. The coroner explained that Rafael’s injuries and massive bleeding, coupled with the estimated sixty-hour time period that the body was left to rot under the grate, rendered D.N.A.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> testing impossible.</p>

He opined that the child was alive during the infliction of these wounds and finally fell out of consciousness because of massive blood loss. According to the coroner, the object that was forced into the boy’s rectum could have been a broomstick, a penis, or both. A pillow with bloodstains found in Phillips’ apartment suggested to the coroner that the boy’s face had been shoved into the pillow to stifle his screams.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[217,825,1152,573]]]'>The police immediately began a search for Brown. From various interviews, they discovered from a neighbor that Brown had been seen knocking on the door of his mother’s residence. The neighbor had a brief conversation with Brown, during which the latter cried and told her that he loved his mother and that he would be going to jail. Brown also called his sister and told her that he hurt Rafael but did not want to go to jail. That same morning, he visited his employer and told him that he got himself in trouble and would miss a few days of work. He also asked for his paycheck for the week; the employer denied this request.</p>

At the time of his arrest, Brown provided the police with two aliases and a false address and social security number. After Brown and other inmates in the Atlantic County prison saw a news story about Rafael’s murder that showed a picture of Brown’s face, Brown asked prison officials to separate him from the other inmates because he was afraid they would harm him. Brown asked the prison to contact Philadelphia authorities; he eventually waived extradition and was returned to Philadelphia.</p>

Detective Ivan Pitt took a statement from Brown, in which Brown admitted that he hit Rafael and might have played a bit too rough with him, but denied any sexual contact with the boy.

The trial court’s charge to the jury on torture was as follows:</p>

What is torture? Any time’ a person is killed it’s natural to assume that pain, even substantial pain accompanies the act. The legislature, in providing that a killing by means of torture is an aggravating circumstance certainly contemplates something more than the expected pain which accompanies every homicide. Torture may be defined as an act of inflicting excruciating pain especially from extreme cruelty or in hatred, revenge, or the like.</blockquote>

It is the intentional infliction of gratuitous violence on the victim or needless mutilation of the victim. It’s difficult to precisely define what constitutes torture.</blockquote>

We disagree.' The instruction given by the trial court on torture clearly, adequately, and accurately reflected the law. The court stated that “[tjorture may be defined as an act of inflicting excruciating pain especially from extreme cruelty or in hatred, revenge, or the like.” (N.T. April 9, 1999, page 6.) Further, the court informed the jury that “[tjorture is the infliction of a considerable amount of pain and suffering on a victim which is unnecessarily heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting an exceptional depravity or conscious hatred and ill will. It is the intentional infliction of gratuitous violence on the victim or needless mutilation of the victim.” (N.T. April 9, 1999, page 7.)
