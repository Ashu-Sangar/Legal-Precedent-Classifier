Pleasant Hills and Hartman asked the court to enjoin SEA from contracting with any other entity for the plumbing work. In response, SEA argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plain language of Section 22 makes clear that the CPDEA sets forth the sole bidding procedures applicable to RACPs and that other laws regulating bidding on publicly funded projects, with the express exception of the Steel Products Procurement Act, do not apply. SEA therefore took the position that in completing the bidding on the Stadium Project, it was only required to obtain a minimum of three written bids for all general contracted work and comply with the Steel Products Procurement Act, both of which it had done.</p>

      <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>As the foregoing makes clear, this appeal turns on the meaning of a single statutory phrase: “Notwithstanding any other lavy to the contrary, the requirements of section 318 of the [CFDEA] shall provide the sole and exclusive requirements for bidding for the construction or renovation of a[n RACP].” In interpreting this provision, our goal “is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). “When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[268,915,1157,1465]]]'>Here, the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous: In spite of what other laws or statutes provide regarding bidding, the sole and exclusive bidding requirements on RACPs are those set forth in Section 318 of the CFDEA, <em>i.e., </em>solicitation of a minimum of three bids for general contract work and compliance with the Steel Products Procurement Act. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Court, under the guise of “statutory interpretation,” took it upon itself to rewrite the statute, essentially replacing the word “bidding” with the phrase “the solicitation of bids.” It then “interpreted” Section 22 to state that Section 318 provides the sole and exclusive requirements for only the <em>solicitation of bids, </em>not the whole bidding process, which begins with bid solicitation, but also includes bid acceptance and evaluation, and culminates in the awarding of contracts to successful bidders. We simply cannot agree with this conclusion. Had the General Assembly intended to communicate that Section 318 provides the “sole and exclusive” requirements for <em>soliciting </em>bids, it seems logical that it would have used some form of the word “solicit” in Section 22. In drafting Section 22 and cross-referencing Section 318, the General Assembly was undoubtedly aware of the distinction between Section 318(f)’s reference to the “solicitation of ... bids” and the term “bidding” in Section 22, and intentionally omitted any reference to “solicitation” in Section 22. Accordingly, we conclude that the General Assembly did not intend “bidding” to mean only bid solicitation, but rather meant for the word to encompass the whole bidding process.</p>
    <p id="b165-3" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[220,342,1154,866]]]'>
      <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>This interpretation is consistent with the General Assembly’s use of the word “bidding” in the Commonwealth Procurement Code. 62 Pa.C.S. §§ 101, <em>et seq. </em>Among other things, the Procurement Code sets forth “competitive sealed bidding” procedures by which Commonwealth agency contracts are to be awarded. <em>See </em>62 Pa.C.S. § 511. Those procedures, contained in a section specifically entitled “Competitive Sealed Bidding,” cover not only the solicitation of bids, including the “invitation for bids” and public notice, but also the physical opening of bids, bid evaluation, and perhaps most notably, the award of contracts to the “lowest responsible and responsive bidder.” 62 Pa.C.S. § 512. Given this broad use of “bidding” in the Procurement Code to mean the whole bidding process, we cannot conclude, as the Commonwealth Court did, that a more narrow definition of “bid” controls the construction of the word “bidding” in Section 22.</p>

Steel Products Procurement Act.” Importantly, the Steel Products Procurement Act applies to the procurement of steel, but contains no requirements regarding the <em>solicitation </em>of bids. <em>See </em>58 P.S. § 1003. Consequently, if, as the Commonwealth Court held, Section 22 in no way affected the application of laws regarding topics other than the solicitation of bids, then there was absolutely no reason for the General Assembly to expressly retain the applicability of the Steel Products Procurement Act to RACPs.

As the Commonwealth Court pointed out, an earlier draft of Act 35 contained not only the current Section 22, but also a section specific to sports facility construction projects, which stated that with the exception of Section 318 and the Steel Products Procurement Act, “[n]o other law, code or regulation relating to bidding, procurement, preparation of bid specifications or contracting for construction or renovation shall apply.” According to the Commonwealth Court, “the General Assembly’s decision to delete this language from the final version of the Act lends additional support to our view that the Legislature did not intend to repeal or exempt redevelopment assistance projects from other laws relating to public contracts.” <a href="/a2d/782/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="782 A.2d 68" data-case-ids="9467231" data-case-paths="/a2d/782/0068-01">782 A.2d at 79</a>.

Thus, under that Act, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of awarding separate contracts for plumbing, heating, ventilating and electrical work, the General Assembly set forth specific directives regarding the solicitation of bids, <em>ie., </em>how bid specifications shall be prepared and how bids shall be submitted. Accordingly, construing Section 318 to provide the “sole and exclusive” requirement for the “solicitation of bids” would nullify certain necessary portions of the Separations Act, leaving the requirement that separate contracts be awarded, but providing no procedures pursuant to which that goal is to be accomplished. This result is obviously illogical and cannot be what the General Assembly intended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In addition, the Separations Act specifically requires compliance with the Steel Products Procurement Act. <em>See </em>53 Pa. C.S. § 1003 ("Every contract for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of public works shall comply with the provisions of the ...' 'Steel Products Procurement Act.' ") Accordingly, unless Section 22 renders the Separations Act’s bidding requirements no longer applicable to RACPs, the requirements of the Steel Products Procurement Act would have been applicable to RACPs by virtue of the Separations Act and, again, it would have been superfluous to reaffirm its application in Section 22.</p>

The Commonwealth Court may have recognized the difficulty of parsing out pre-existing laws regarding bid solicitation front those regarding other aspects of the bidding process. Although it interpreted "bidding” in Section 22 to mean the "solicitation of bids,” it seemed to disavow the natural consequence of this construction, <em>i.e., </em>that Section 318(f) then provides the "sole and exclusive” requirement regarding the "solicitation of bids.” Instead, the Commonwealth Court stated that it "agree[s] ... with the analysis” of the trial court, <a href="/a2d/782/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="782 A.2d 68" data-case-ids="9467231" data-case-paths="/a2d/782/0068-01">782 A.2d at 78</a>, that “the apparent meaning of section 22 and section 318(f) is that the usual bidding process has been modified to <em>add </em>a requirement that minimum number of written bids be solicited for ‘all general contract work’ in [RACPs].” <em>Pleasant Hills Constr.
