During Appellants’ bench trial in municipal court, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of three witnesses. Two of the witnesses testified that the altercation took place on December 12, 1997, while one witness testified that it took place on March 12, 1997. After the Commonwealth rested, Appellants moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1124(a)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellants argued that the Commonwealth had failed to meet its burden of proof because the complaint charged Appellants with acts committed on December 27, 1997, but the Commonwealth’s witnesses had only testified to acts occurring on either December 12, 1997 or on March 12, 1997. In response to Appellants’ motion, the assistant district attorney asserted that she made a mistake as to the date of the altercation when eliciting the Commonwealth’s witnesses’ testimony and requested permission to amend the transcript. The municipal court refused this request and granted Appellants’ motion. Subsequently, the Commonwealth filed a petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>with the <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>trial court, seeking a new trial. Following oral argument on September 24, 1998, the trial court granted the Commonwealth’s petition, reversing the judgment of acquittal and remanding for a new trial.

The question presented here, as posed by the Commonwealth, is whether the trial court’s ruling concerned a factual element of its case or represented a legal determination. According to the Commonwealth, the date is not an essential element as to the offenses here charged (criminal conspiracy, simple assault, and reckless endangerment); the trial court’s conclusion to the contrary merely represented an erroneous legal ruling; and, therefore, double jeopardy precepts pose no bar to its appeal. In making such argument, the Commonwealth characterizes the issue as one involving a variance between the complaint and the proof at trial, and maintains that the municipal court abused its discretion in denying the prosecutor leave to amend the compláint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

In the present case, in response to Appellee’s motion for a judgment of acquittal, the prosecutor did not seek to amend the complaint to conform with the trial proofs; rather, she contended that the date in the complaint was correct but a defect existed in the Commonwealth’s proof. Indeed, the Commonwealth’s proofs as concerned the date of the offense not only varied from that asserted in the complaint, they were also internally inconsistent to a substantial degree. The prosecutor therefore took the very unusual step of requesting leave to amend the notes of testimony or, in the alternative, to reopen the case and re-call the witnesses to rectify her case.</p>

In general, the charging document (criminal complaint or information) must advise the defendant, <em>inter alia, </em>of the date when the offense is alleged to have been committed. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 504(4), (b) (providing, <em>inter alia, </em>that a complaint shall set forth the;date of the offense, and the date or day of the week if it is an essential element of the offense charged); Pa.R.Crim.P. 560(A)(3) (setting forth a similar requirement for a criminal information). The purpose of such requirement is to provide the defendant with sufficient notice to meet the charges and prepare a defense. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Alston, </em><a href="/pa/539/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="539 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="474143" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0202-01">539 Pa. 202</a>, 209-10, <a href="/a2d/651/1092-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="651 A.2d 1092" data-case-ids="12257595,474143" data-case-paths="/a2d/651/1092-01,/pa/539/0202-01">651 A.2d 1092</a>, 1095 (1994). Variance issues typically arise in the context of a mistake or error in the charging document. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

In such circumstances, a defendant is entitled to relief only if the discrepancy misled him at trial, involved an element of surprise prejudicial to his defense, precluded him from anticipating the prosecution's proof, or impaired a substantial right. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pope, </em><a href="/pa/455/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="455 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="582168" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0384-01">455 Pa. 384</a>, 391, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20887" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="317 A.2d 887">317 A.2d 887</a>, 890 (1974). Parenthetically, a variance should be differentiated from the situation in which the Commonwealth seeks to prosecute a <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>defendant without alleging or proving a specific date the offense was committed. <em>Cf.
