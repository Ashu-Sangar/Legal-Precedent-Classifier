Angela lives with her adult sister, Beth A. Humphreys (Humphreys), who is the Appellee in this matter. DeRoss receives $858.00 in Workers’ Compensation benefits, twenty percent of which he owes to his attorney. He also receives $355.00 in social security disability payments per month. In 1997, DeRoss’ mother died, leaving him as the sole <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>beneficiary of her estate. On August 25, 1999, the estate sold his mother’s house, and realized $83,696.50, which it distributed to DeRoss. From the proceeds, DeRoss purchased a home and other items for his current family. On August 28, 1997, Humphreys filed a petition for modification of an existing support order asserting a change in DeRoss’ circumstances because of the inheritance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Thus, he imputed to DeRoss an additional $4,525.00 per month in income.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Based on the Support Guidelines, DeRoss’ obligation was $723.45 per month minus $108.00, which Social Security paid to Angela on behalf of DeRoss. On November 24, 1997, the trial court adopted the hearing officer’s recommendation and set the support obligation at $615.45 per month, retroactive to August 31, 1997. With an adjustment for arrears, the court ordered him to pay $700.00 per month for Angela’s support. DeRoss sought a <em>de novo </em>hearing, following which the trial court issued an Order on May 20, 1998, reducing the support obligation of DeRoss to $609.45 per month due to an increase in the amount Angela was receiving from Social Security. Appellant filed an appeal to the Superior Court, which affirmed the Order of the trial court.</p>

The plain meaning of the statute provides that <em>including, but not limited to </em>refers solely to types of compensation for services. The statute does not provide that <em>income </em>includes, but is not limited to various types of compensation for services. Accordingly, in order to be included in the statutory definition of income, a resource must reasonably fit within one of the categories enumerated in Section 4302.</p>

However, the distributions that Mr. Ford received <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>from a trust fund established under his mother’s will more closely resemble “income from an interest in an estate” than a lump sum inheritance.

The provision does not read “interest income” from the “corpus” of an estate or trust. Rather, it speaks broadly of any “income” which arises “from an interest” in an estate or trust. Appellant’s “interest” in his mother’s estate derived from his status as her sole beneficiary. That interest resulted in a cash distribution to appellant of over $83,000.

Initially, I would dispute the premise that inheritances are “common sources of income.” Nowhere in the record below is this premise supported. Were I called upon to take judicial notice of this proposition, I would conclude just the opposite. Even so, not all inheritances — and hence not all interests in an estate-involve income or income — generating bequests.

Under this approach, the “corpus” presumably would be appellant’s mother’s house. But appellant did not simply pass into ownership of the house and live in it or retain it; instead, the house was converted into ready cash as part of the estate and the proceeds were distributed to appellant. Under the majority’s reading of the statute, these proceeds should be deemed “income” to appellant derived from his interest in the “corpus” house that passed through his mother’s estate and, ’thus, should be available for his support obligation.</p>
    <p id="b748-6" data-blocks='[["BL_748.6",748,[258,1668,1153,696]]]'>Although I believe that the “interest in an estate” provision controls here, I also write to note my view that, even if it did not, I still could not agree with the majority opinion. As I have noted above, there are two broader definitions of income in the Code, either one of which plainly captures the cash distribution to appellant. These provisions speak of entitlements or payments due “regardless of source,” which obviously is broad enough to include inheritances. Whether the inheritance distributed to appellant in this case is deemed “an entitlement to money or lump sum award” or “any form of payment due to and collectible by an individual” it falls squarely within the General Assembly’s conception of income from all other sources.</p>

      <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>The majority rather casually dismisses these two provisions in a single sentence, again focusing on the absence of the apparently talismanic word “inheritance.” However, legislative intent can not be clearer in this area. As to each of these provisions, the General Assembly specifically designated that the definition applied regardless of source. Inheritances are merely one of innumerable potential sources of entitlement to money or forms of payment due and collectible. To find controlling significance in a perceived omission, where the General Assembly speaks in broad terms which encompass all sources, turns statutory construction on its head. I cannot join in the majority’s unilateral creation of an “inheritance exception” to the broad, plain statutory language.</p>
    <p id="b749-4" data-blocks='[["BL_749.5",749,[224,1083,1148,154]]]'>The majority further justifies its creation of an inheritance exception by noting its understanding of how “intact” families allegedly “treat inheritances.” According to the majority:</p>
    <blockquote id="b749-5" data-blocks='[["BL_749.6",749,[263,1271,1111,370]]]'>Including an inheritance in income available for support does not reflect how families in which parents live together treat inheritances. In an intact family, the receipt of a lump sum is likely to be used for purchases, investments or savings, and not for meeting living expenses. Therefore, considering the entire inheritance as income available for support is contrary to the purposes of the guidelines.</blockquote>

I do not purport to know how intact families generally put inheritances to use nor does the record here illuminate such a sweeping conclusion; but I suspect that, to the extent there is any discernible “likelihood” in this area at all, it has more to do with the relative prosperity and needs of the particular family, and not whether the family is “intact” or not. I also suspect, again <em>de hors </em>this record, that there are plenty of families who spend inheritances on basic needs such as housing, automobiles, and education, rather than investing the money. In point of fact, appellant here illustrates the latter proposition where he spent his inheritance on a house, a basic living expense. I do not see how the majority’s unsupported assumptions about inheritances illus<a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>trate any conclusion about the proper interpretation of the Code.</p>
    <p id="b750-4" data-blocks='[["BL_750.5",750,[265,466,1155,637]]]'>Finally, I would also note that the majority’s ultimate holding is problematic in its own right. The majority essentially holds that appellant’s cash inheritance is not “income” under the Code, but nevertheless may qualify as an “asset” under the support guidelines, which would warrant an upward deviation. The majority’s conclusion in this regard raises a question of whether this Court’s procedural rules can, or should, establish a substantive support consequence where the Code itself, under the majority’s construction, has not. By ignoring the plain meaning of the statute, the majority creates an unnecessary discrepancy between the statute and this Court’s procedural rules.</p>

There is also an issue as to the propriety of trial court’s calculation of the support order, which allocated the lump sum over the period of the child’s minority, as opposed to the year following the receipt of the lump sum. The allocation of a lump sum inheritance is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>See </em>Note to Pa.R.Civ.Pro. 1910.16 — 2(a)(8) ("The trial court has discretion to determine the most appropriate method for imputing the lump-sum awards as income for purposes of establishing or modifying the party’s support obligation’’). At the time of the allocation, the child was 18 months from reaching majority. In my view, allocating the award over 18 months rather than 12 months was not an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.</p>
