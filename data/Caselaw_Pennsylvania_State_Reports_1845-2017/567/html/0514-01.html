They accurately point out that in this case the statutory cap caused the “limits of available .... self-insurance [to be] insufficient.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702. The question for us is whether the reason for the insufficiency is of importance.</p>
    <p id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.6",644,[263,887,1152,518]]]'>To resolve this issue, we return to the words of the MVFRL. An underinsured vehicle is one for which the “limits of available ... self-insurance are insufficient.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702. Here, it is clear that: the “limits of available ... self-insurance are insufficient” to satisfy the damages of Insureds; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and, the statute does not limit the circumstances or reasons why the available limits may be made so. Consequently, where the damages cap causes the available limits of underinsurance to be insufficient, the requirements of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702 are met.</p>

The Superior Court correctly observed that “the legislature expressly made the MVFRL applicable to all motor vehicles required by state law to be registered (75 Pa.C.S. § 1712) knowing that Commonwealth agency vehicles are required to be registered by statute. 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1301 &amp; 1302.” <em>Kmonk-Sullivan, </em><a href="/a2d/746/1118-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="746 A.2d 1118" data-case-ids="11479913" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/1118-01">746 A.2d at 1122</a>.
