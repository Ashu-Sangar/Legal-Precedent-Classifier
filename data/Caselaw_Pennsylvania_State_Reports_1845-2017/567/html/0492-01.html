In 1999, the state Department of Transportation (the “Department”) filed a complaint in equity and petition for a preliminary injunction, alleging that Beam was operating an airport without a license in violation of Section 471.3 of Title 67 of the Pennsylvania Code, 67 Pa.Code § 471.3, and after refusing the Department’s invitation to apply for a license.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In response, Beam denied that he maintained or operated an airport and asserted further that the Department lacked the authority to seek an injunction against him.</p>

In their reasoning, the reviewing courts focused on the Department’s capacity to seek injunctive relief in a judicial forum.

One such aspect of implied authority, the Department asserts, is the capacity to institute judicial proceedings where necessary to the execution of its statutory responsibilities. The Department also maintains that a violation of the law is tantamount to a public nuisance, which is enjoinable at common law regardless of whether such an injunction is statutorily authorized. Beam contends that, to the contrary, the courts cannot ignore the Legislature’s omission of a mechanism for enforcing the prohibition against operation of an unlicensed airport from the Aviation Code. As the General Assembly has elected to provide such mechanisms in other statutes and in <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>other provisions ol‘ the Aviation Code, Beam argues, it must be presumed that the omission at issue was intentional; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> thus, it would be an inapftropriate expansion of the courts’ equitable jurisdiction to seek to remedy that omission. Nor, in Beam’s view, is his airport enjoinable as a public nuisance, as it poses no danger to the public.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Beam also argues that we may affirm the Commonwealth Court on grounds that that court did not reach, namely, that his airfield is not an airport which, under the applicable statute and regulations, must be licensed. However, Section 471.5 of the pertinent regulations includes, as a category of airports to be licensed, a private, individual airport, that is, "[a] private airport used exclusively by the licensee." 67 Pa.Code § 471.5(a)(2)(f). Further, while some other jurisdictions exempt certain personal use airports from licensing requirements, <em>see, e.g., </em>Neb.Rev.Stat. § 3-136 (providing licensing exemption for restricted landing areas designed for personal use); <em>cf. </em>ORS 830.080 (delegating to a state administrative agency the authority to waive statutory licensing requirements based upon a finding of undue burden and consistency with the public safety), Pennsylvania law contains no statutory analogue.</p>

In furtherance of the legislative directives, the Department has promulgated the regulations codified in Chapter 471 of Title 67 of the Pennsylvania Code. Principally, Section 471.3(a), as noted earlier, <em>see supra </em>note 1, declares that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, “[n]o person may establish, maintain or operate an airport, nor conduct flight operations at an airport, unless authorized to do so by the Bureau [of Aviation].” 67 Pa.Code § 471.3(a). Section 471.3 provides further that the authorization granted by the Bureau may be suspended or revoked for reasonable cause, such as failure to correct deficiencies or to cease unauthorized activities. <em>See </em>67 Pa.Code § 471.3(g). The regulations also specify fees for on-site inspections and licensing, <em>see </em>67 Pa.Code § 471.4; establish rating categories for airports and heliports, <em>see </em>67 Pa.Code §§ 471.5, 471.6; list requirements applicable to licensed airports and heliports, such as operating the facility safely and notifying the Bureau of hazardous conditions, <em>see </em>67 Pa.Code § 471.7; provide a schedule of penalties, consisting of warnings, suspensions, and revocations, for specified violations, <em>see </em>67 Pa.Code § 471.8; and, finally, provide for appeals from the Bureau’s decisions granting, denying, or revoking licenses, <em>see </em>67 Pa.Code § 471.9.

Further, while <em>St. Joe Minerals </em>and <em>United Artists', </em>invoked by the Commonwealth Court, both did concern agency authority, neither is controlling. In <em>St. Joe Minerals </em>the Court considered whether the capacity to enforce a request for answers to written interrogatories should be read into a specific statutory enumeration of the PHRC's investigatory powers (including the authority to conduct hearings, subpoena witnesses, take testimony, and secure production of documents). <em>See St. Joe Minerals, </em>476 Pa. at 309, 382 A.2d at 735. The Court concluded that it should not, emphasizing that the General Assembly’s omission of broad discovery provisions may have been intentional, particularly in light of its focus upon a direct role of the PITRC in the gathering of evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 310-11, 382 A.2d at 736. In the present situation, however, the General Assembly’s intent to delegate broad enforcement authority to the Department can be gleaned from the Aviation Code, and, relative to such authority, there is no statutory analogue to the PHRA’s specific listing of investigatory powers. <em>Untied Artists’ </em>held that the Philadelphia Historical Commission lacked legislative authorization to designate the interior of a building as historic, given the enabling ordinance’s focus upon building exteriors. <em>See United Artists', </em><a href="/pa/535/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="535 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1841544" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0370-01">535 Pa. at 386-90</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="635 A.2d 612" data-case-ids="1841544,7368836" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0370-01,/a2d/635/0612-01">635 A.2d at 621-22</a>.
