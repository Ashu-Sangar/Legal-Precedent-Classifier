We specifically state that we do not adopt the rationale of the Commonwealth Court. See Commonwealth v. Tilghman, 543 Pa. 578, 673 A.2d 898, 904 (1996). Furthermore, we note that it appears that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7319(3), read in conjunction with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7304(a), dictates that venue for appeals from arbitration awards lies with the trial court that initially ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration. However, the issue of the applicability of \u00a7 7319(3) to this matter was waived via a concession made by Appellees before the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. See Allegheny County CCP, tr. dated 1/25/1999, at 12. Thus, we are unable to explore the parameters of \u00a7 7319(3) by way of a full opinion.\nFormer Chief Justice FLAHERTY did not participate in the decision of this case.",
