To determine whether a product with more than one intended use had a design defect that rendered it defective as a matter of law, should a court undertake a risk-utility analysis relating only to the use that allegedly resulted in harm, or should it consider the risks and benefits of all intended uses?\nb. On appeal from a trial court\u2019s legal determination regarding whether a product suffered from a design defect that rendered it defective, is the appellate court bound by the trial court\u2019s weight and credibility determinations, and may the appellate court only consider evidence that the trial court took into consideration in rendering its decision?",
