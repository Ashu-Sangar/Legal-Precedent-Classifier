See Supreme Court IOP \u00a7 5C. Thus, I continue to believe that the use of per curiam orders effectuating reversals on the merits at this stage should be reserved for a very narrow set of clear-cut cases, in which there is directly relevant authority that indisputably controls the point in question. Accord Supreme Court IOP \u00a7 3B(5); County of Berks v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters Local Union No. 429, 600 Pa. 128, 963 A.2d 1272, 1272-73 (2009) (Saylor, J., dissenting). In my view, the majority\u2019s citation to Kvaerner Metals Division of Kvaerner U.S., Inc. v. Commercial Union Insurance Company, 589 Pa. 317, 908 A.2d 888, 897 (2006), does not satisfy the above standard, since that case is not directly on point. Moreover, the accompanying parenthetical that generally discusses the dichotomy of ambiguous and unambiguous insurance policy language falls far short of the necessary explanation of the decision\u2019s controlling significance here.\nChief Justice CASTILLE joins this Dissenting Statement.",
