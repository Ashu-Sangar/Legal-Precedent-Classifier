Kentucky, \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), the distinction in Pennsylvania between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u201creasonable professional assistance\u201d required under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) is appropriate?\n(2) If so, whether the forfeiture of a pension that stems from a public school teacher\u2019s negotiated plea to crimes committed in the scope of his employment is a collateral consequence of a criminal conviction which relieves counsel from any affirmative duty to investigate and advise?\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
