The issues, as stated by petitioner are:\n(1) Does Pennsylvania law require that a party suffering damages be made whole before an insurer is entitled to subrogation?\n(2) Does the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner have the authority to promulgate a regulation regarding allocation of subrogation proceeds between an insurance company and its insured following subrogation recovery?\n(3) Is the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner\u2019s regulation allowing insurers to allocate subrogation proceeds on a pro rata basis void because it violates Pennsylvania substantive common law, the \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine?",
