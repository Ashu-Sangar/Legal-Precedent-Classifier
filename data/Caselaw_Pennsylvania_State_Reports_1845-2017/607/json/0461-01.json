        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE\nThe Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision below reversed an order by appellant, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d), which dismissed a charge of unfair labor practices as moot. We now hold that the Commonwealth Court erred, and reinstate the Board\u2019s order.\nOn June 25, 2007, during negotiations for a successor collective bargaining agreement with the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (\u201cPASSHE\u201d), appellee Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties (the \u201cAssociation\u201d) filed a charge of unfair practices against PASSHE with the Board. The Association alleged that PASSHE had violated subsections 1201(a)(1), (3), and (5) of the Public Employe Relations Act (\u201cPERA\u201d) when it notified employees: 1) that it would terminate health care and other benefits to employees with summer school assignments if they went on strike; 2) that faculty members who failed to report for a summer school class would be \u201cconsidered to be on strike\u201d and have their classes canceled and pay and benefits stopped; and 3) that faculty members who failed to report for a summer school class would forfeit pay for the entire summer school course, including pay for classes already taught. The Association claimed that under the collective bargaining agreement between the parties, summer benefits are earned by working the nine-month academic year (not by working summer school), and PASSHE\u2019s threats unilaterally changed the terms and conditions of employment by abrogating the sick leave and other leave provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, as well as the right to be paid for work performed. The Association sought a restraining order against PASSHE, claiming an unfair practice.\nOn July 2, 2007, before the Board could respond to the Association\u2019s charge, the parties reached tentative agreement on the successor contract they had been negotiating. Nonetheless, on August 23, 2007, the Association wrote to the Board and asked that it continue to process the charge against PASSHE because \u201cthe employer conduct complained of in the unfair practice charge is likely to recur in subsequent negotiations\u201d and \u201cthere will be value to the parties in litigating the issues raised in the charge.\u201d On October 26, 2007, the Association again wrote to the Board and requested that it issue a complaint and set a hearing date on the alleged illegal employer conduct, because that conduct \u201cis likely to recur in subsequent negotiations.\u201d\nOn November 2, 2007, the Board informed the Association that no complaint would be issued and that the unfair practice charge would be dismissed. The Board indicated that the Association failed to state a cause of action under Section 1201(a)(3) of PERA, and that its claims under Sections 1201(a)(1) and (5) were moot because the parties had ratified a successor agreement. The Association filed a timely statement of exceptions, specifically complaining about the Board\u2019s decision to dismiss the charges under subsections (1) and (5) as moot.\nUpon consideration of the Association\u2019s exceptions, the Board issued its final order on December 18, 2007. The Board adverted to prior decisions where it had dismissed unfair practices charges as moot, where the parties had resolved the issues forming the basis for the charge through bargaining and a subsequent contract. Final Order dated December 18, 2007, at 2 (citing AFSCME Dist. Council 33 v. City of Philadelphia, 36 PPER 95 (2005); Temple Ass\u2019n of Univ. Professionals, Local AFT v. Temple Univ., 25 PPER 25121 (1994)). The Board stated further that the Association had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that its Charge raises an issue of public importance,\u201d or that \u201cthe underlying situation presented here is one that is capable of repetition but likely to evade review.\u201d The Board refused to \u201cspeculate as to whether [PASSHE] will make the same alleged threats\u201d in the future, and opined that \u201c \u2018continued litigation over past allegations of misconduct which have no present effects unwisely focuses the parties\u2019 attention on a divisive past rather than a cooperative future.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting from Medical Rescue Team S. Auth. v. Ass\u2019n of Prof'l Emergency Med. Technicians, 30 PPER 30063 (Final Order 1999)).\nThe Association appealed to the Commonwealth Court, arguing that the Board erred as a matter of law and acted \u201carbitrarily or capriciously\u201d in dismissing the unfair practices charge as moot. The Association claimed that the issues involved herein were \u201cof great public importance and likely to recur, yet evade review,\u201d adverting to well-established exceptions to the general rule that moot matters should not be decided. In response, the Board insisted that it did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the moot charge against PASSHE, and that no exception to the mootness doctrine applied.\nIn its opinion, the Commonwealth Court acknowledged that it was \u201cacutely aware of the discretionary nature of the Board\u2019s decision regarding issuance of a complaint on an unfair labor practices charge and the correspondingly limited nature of [its own] review.\u201d Association of Pa. State College & Univ. Faculties v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 962 A.2d 709, 714-15 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (citing Pennsylvania Soc. Servs. Union, Local 668 v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, 481 Pa. 81, 392 A.2d 256 (1978)). But, the court concluded that \u201cthe Board\u2019s refusal to issue a complaint, to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction and to decide the Union\u2019s unfair labor practice charge is manifestly unreasonable and consequently must be deemed an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at 717-18. The court determined that the Board has an improper, \u201cacknowledged policy to effectively eliminate long-recognized exceptions to the ordinary rules of mootness, thereby allowing the complained of conduct to continue indefinitely.\u201d Id. at 717. The court held that the parties\u2019 dispute \u2014 though moot \u2014 was capable of repetition yet likely to evade review, reversed the Board\u2019s Final Order and remanded the matter to the Board for further proceedings. Id. at 718.\nThe Board filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which this Court granted, limited to the following rephrased issue:\nWhether settlement of collective bargaining negotiations renders charges raised by Union members against [an employer] prior to the settlement automatically moot.\nAssociation of Pa. State College & Univ. Faculties v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 602 Pa. 195, 979 A.2d 839 (2009).\nIn its brief to this Court, the Board argues that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision is contrary to well-established law that issuance of a PERA complaint is within the Board\u2019s discretion, and that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s scope and standard of review of its decision is very narrow. The Board asserts that the Commonwealth Court improperly substituted its own judgment for that of the Board, and \u201cusurped the discretionary authority of the Board in deciding that the Board must issue a complaint on an unfair practice charge that the charging party itself concedes is moot.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 16. According to the Board, the Commonwealth Court itself has previously declared that the Board \u201ccannot be found to have abused its discretion by relying upon its own established precedent.\u201d Id. at 17 (quoting from Pennsylvania State Park Officers Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 854 A.2d 674, 688 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004)).\nThe Board further claims that the Association \u201cfailed to allege in this case that the employes were subject to any present effects from [PASSHE\u2019s] alleged threat to withhold pay and benefits if employes participated in a strike.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18. Thus, the Board concludes, it would not serve the parties\u2019 or the public interest to issue a complaint in this case. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court improperly rejected the Board\u2019s policy determination that parties who have resolved their differences through negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement should focus on the future, rather than on past differences that have no present effects. Finally, the Board acknowledges that it may \u2014 in appropriate circumstances \u2014 decide to issue a complaint in a moot matter, but that decision falls within its discretion. In this case, where the Association has failed to demonstrate that relevant exceptions to the mootness doctrine existed, the Board argues that it did not abuse its discretion in declining to issue a complaint, citing Commonwealth v. Joint Bargaining Comm., 484 Pa. 175, 398 A.2d 1001 (1979) (parties\u2019 subsequent negotiation of new collective bargaining agreement mooted unfair practices charge and this Court refused to speculate about whether issue would be raised in future and, unless decided now, escape appellate review).\nIn response, the Association argues that the Board improperly applies a \u201cmootness policy\u201d such that settlement of the parties\u2019 dispute through negotiation of a new agreement always \u201crenders charges raised prior to settlement automatically moot.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 6. According to the Association, this \u201cblanket rule\u201d ignores well-established law that even moot cases may be decided if the issue is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet apt to evade review.\u201d Id. at 6-7. The Association argues that the Board\u2019s \u201cadoption of such a general rule permitting no exceptions is not in the public interest and will not advance the purposes\u201d of PERA. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 9. According to the Association, PASSHE\u2019s conduct in this case was clearly illegal, and the Board\u2019s role under PERA includes addressing and preventing such illegal conduct. By applying an automatic policy of dismissing moot charges, the Association argues, the Board fails in its mission to prevent unfair practices, and those practices will always \u201cevade review.\u201d\nThe Association further claims that only \u201ca legal adjudication that the employer acted illegally in conveying a threat is likely to assuage the fear\u201d that employees will be punished if they strike. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 18. Finally, the Association insists that the Board is not vested with \u201cthe authority to decide what is and is not sound public policy.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 17. Instead, the Board must effect the procedures in PERA to protect the rights of the public employee, the public employer and the public at large.\nThis Court has repeatedly held that the decision of whether or not to issue a complaint regarding alleged violations of PERA is within the sound discretion of the Board, and is reviewable only for an abuse of that discretion. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Soc. Servs. Union, 392 A.2d at 259-60.\n\u201c[CJourts will not review the actions of governmental bodies or administrative tribunals involving acts of discretion, in the absence of bad faith, fraud, capricious action or abuse of power; they will not inquire into the wisdom of such actions or into the details of the manner adopted to carry them into execution ... [T]he mere possession of discretionary power by an administrative body does not make it wholly immune from judicial review, but the scope of that review is limited to the determination of whether there has been a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion or a purely arbitrary execution of the agency\u2019s duties or functions. That the court might have a different opinion or judgment in regard to the action of the agency is not a sufficient ground for interference; judicial discretion may not be substituted for administrative discretion.\u201d\nId. (quoting from In re Petition of Acchione, 425 Pa. 23, 227 A.2d 816, 820 (1967)). The Board\u2019s determination in discharging its duty under PERA is entitled to a measure of deference from reviewing courts. See Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd. v. Butz, 411 Pa. 360, 192 A.2d 707, 716 (1963) (this Court \u201cwill not lightly substitute its judgment for that of a body ... whose experience and expertise make it better qualified than a court of law to weigh facts within its field\u201d).\nIn this case, the Board was presented with a plainly moot dispute between parties who had settled their differences with a new bargaining agreement. Although courts generally will not decide a moot case because the law requires the existence of an actual controversy, In re Gross, 476 Pa. 203, 382 A.2d 116, 119 (1978), this Court has recognized two \u201cwell-organized exceptions to the mootness doctrine.\u201d Id. at 122-23. We have reviewed moot matters, in our discretion, when the issue presented is one of great public importance or is one that is capable of repetition yet evading review. See, e.g., Rendell v. Pa. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 603 Pa. 292, 983 A.2d 708, 719 (2009); Gross, supra. The Board rejected the Association\u2019s claim that \u201cthe factual situation presented here falls within an exception to the mootness doctrine,\u201d and dismissed the charge without issuing a complaint.\nThe controlling premise underlying the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision and the Association\u2019s argument in this appeal \u2014 that the Board \u201cautomatically\u201d dismisses charges without issuing a complaint in moot disputes \u2014 is completely undermined by the Board\u2019s Final Order in this case. The Board stated that it \u201cwill dismiss as moot any unfair practice charge involving alleged bad faith bargaining where the parties have resolved the issues forming the basis for the charge through bargaining and a subsequent contract.\u201d Final Order dated December 18, 2007, at 2. However, the Board went on to consider the exceptions to the mootness doctrine, and explained that the Association had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that its Charge raises an issue of great public importance.\u201d Id. The Board further stated that the Association had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the underlying factual situation presented here is one that is capable of repetition but likely to evade review,\u201d and it would \u201cnot speculate as to whether [PASSHE] will make the same alleged threats to the [Association\u2019s] members in the future.\u201d Id.\nDespite the Board\u2019s discussion of mootness principles, and its explanation that it would dismiss moot charges where the party requesting review did not establish that the matter satisfied an exception to the mootness doctrine, the Commonwealth Court nonetheless held that \u201cPASSHE\u2019s conduct clearly is capable of repetition yet likely to evade review if the Board is permitted through its acknowledged policy to effectively eliminate long-recognized exceptions to ordinary rules of mootness, thereby allowing the complained of conduct to continue indefinitely.\u201d 962 A.2d at 717. To the extent the Commonwealth Court believed that the Board \u201celiminated\u201d mootness exceptions, the court\u2019s analysis is not supported by the record.\nEqually troubling is the fact that the Commonwealth Court essentially held as a matter of law that the Board should have issued a complaint in this case, despite its concession that it is \u201cacutely aware of the discretionary nature of the Board\u2019s decision,\u201d and its express finding that the Board did not exhibit bad faith or fraud. Id. at 714-15. The Commonwealth Court apparently relied on the Association\u2019s representation that \u201cits agreements with PASSHE always have expired at the end of June and that this makes a strike possible over the summer if one is to occur.... In the absence of a ruling on the question, PASSHE\u2019s conduct clearly is capable of repetition in a similar situation.\u201d Id. at 715. The Commonwealth Court reached this conclusion in the absence of any allegation or proof that PASSHE in fact has engaged in similar conduct in the past, even though the parties\u2019 agreements have \u201calways\u201d expired at the same time of year.\nTherefore, we hold that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination cannot be sustained in light of the record and the review standard. As noted, the record reveals that the Board recognized and considered the exceptions to the mootness doctrine, and there is no basis to conclude that it abused its discretion in rejecting the mootness exception argument forwarded to it by the Association, and declining to pursue the moot charges in this instance. The Board, which is expert in this area, explained its approach to this particular class of moot cases, where charges are rendered moot by the parties\u2019 later voluntary execution of a new collective bargaining agreement. Final Order dated December 18, 2007, at 2 (citing AFSCME Dist. Council 33, supra; Temple Ass\u2019n of Univ. Prof., supra). The Board\u2019s general policy in this regard is intended to move beyond \u201cpast allegations of misconduct which have no present effects\u201d and focus instead on \u201ca cooperative future,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19 (citing Medical Rescue Team S. Auth., supra). This policy appears to be sensible and the Board\u2019s reliance on the policy in evaluating mootness exceptions is entitled to deference. Absent some particularized showing otherwise by the complaining party in a particular dispute, there is nothing unreasonable in the Board\u2019s deeming the moot issue to be \u201cevading review\u201d only because the parties reached a voluntary agreement \u2014 a salutary end to the conflict. And, it is not at all apparent that the Association\u2019s bald allegation that \u201conly a legal adjudication that the employer acted illegally ... is likely to assuage\u201d the fear that it might so act again, Appellee\u2019s Brief at 18, was sufficient to defeat that policy.\nThe Board concluded that the interests of the parties and the public are best served by avoiding continued litigation over conduct during negotiations that obviously did not prevent the parties from reaching a mutually agreeable contract. The Association did not identify any record evidence that would make this case different from the myriad of other situations where the parties to a labor dispute have resolved their differences and reached a new, long-term accord. See Joint Bargaining Comm., supra at 1003 (parties executed agreement which resolved controversy and rendered appeal moot; Court refused to \u201cspeculate that the issue in this ease will be raised in the future and unless decided today will escape appellate review.\u201d). We conclude that the Board\u2019s decision was not \u201cautomatic,\u201d and that the Commonwealth Court erred when it held the decision was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d under the circumstances. We therefore reverse the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order and remand for reinstatement of the Board\u2019s decision.\nOrder reversed and matter remanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice GREENSPAN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustices SAYLOR and EAKIN and TODD join the opinion.\nJustice McCAFFERY files a dissenting opinion in which Justice BAER joins.\nThis matter was re-assigned to this author.\n. Public Employe Relations Act, Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.101-1101.2301. Section 1201(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part:\n(a) Public employers, their agents or representatives are prohibited from:\n(1) Interfering, restraining or coercing employes in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Article IV of this act [relating to employe rights to organize and engage in lawful concerted activities];\n(3) Discriminating in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any employe organization;\n(5) Refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with an employe representative which is the exclusive representative of employes in an appropriate unit, including but not limited to the discussing of grievances with the exclusive representative.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1201(a).\n. The new contract apparently has a four-year term. Appellant's Brief at 7.\n. The Dissent objects that we have not answered the question as rephrased in our grant of review. Dissenting Op. at 308. But, the issue actually in dispute is more nuanced. There can be no question that the Association\u2019s complaint was moot; the actual dispute concerns whether an exception to the mootness doctrine was proved, and the propriety of the Board's response to the Association's claim that a mootness exception applied. In resolving this actual dispute, we have fully considered the record and the parties' positions (both here and below), including the Association\u2019s \"automatically moot\u201d argument, which is better understood as a claim that the Board's response to its claimed exception effectively amounted to \"a blanket\u201d or \"automatic\u201d rule that moot issues remain moot in cases where the parties have reached a new labor agreement.\n. In this appeal, the Association no longer argues that its moot charge against PASSHE should have been pursued by the Board because it was also a matter of great public importance. As noted above, the Association did make this additional argument before the Commonwealth Court, but the Commonwealth Court's decision was clearly based only on the theory that the matter was capable of repetition yet evading review. 962 A.2d at 717. However, in its brief to this Court, the Association nonetheless cites to Jersey Shore Area Sch. Dist. v. Jersey Shore Educ. Ass'n, 519 Pa. 398, 548 A.2d 1202 (1988), as support for its position that the Board should have issued a complaint. In Jersey Shore, this Court considered a moot labor matter in part because it was one of \u201cimportant public interest.\u201d Id. at 1204. Even if we assume that the citation to Jersey Shore was intended to place the \"public importance\" exception before us in the absence of developed argumentation, we note that the teachers\u2019 strike at issue in Jersey Shore had allegedly imperiled the school district's ability to meet a state-mandated minimum of 180 days of instruction for public kindergarten, elementary and secondary school pupils. That circumstance is distinguishable from the instant case where the dispute, though important to the parties, does not appear necessarily to have the same broad public import and immediacy.\n. The cases addressing mootness exceptions generally speak to mootness in the judicial realm. The Board, the Commonwealth Court and the parties each advert to judicial mootness principles in their discussion of this case. For purposes of review here, we will accept that review of a mootness determination of an administrative agency like the Board should proceed under pertinent, settled judicial doctrines.\n. The Dissent takes issue with the Board\u2019s refusal to speculate, and states \"the proper standard is whether the challenged conduct is capable of repetition and likely to evade review.\u201d Dissenting Op. at 477, 8 A.3d at 309 (emphasis in original). The Dissent considers the timing of the contract's expiration \u2014 at the end of the regular school year \u2014 to be sufficient showing that the moot dispute in this case is both \"capable\u201d of repetition and \"likely\u201d to evade review. Respectfully, the Dissent's broad interpretation of the mootness exception would allow it to swallow the general rule that only actual controversies may be decided; in practice, the cases indicate that something more than a theoretical possibility of repetition must be shown. Contrast Super Tire Eng'g Co. v. McCorkle, 416 U.S. 115, 125, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (where employer was engaged in cyclically recurring bargaining with union representing its employees, and state welfare officials continued to follow \"an immediate and definite governmental action or policy that has adversely affected and continues to affect a present interest,\u201d i.e., providing unemployment compensation benefits to strikers, parties' dispute was capable of repetition). See also Commonwealth v. Buehl, 316 Pa.Super. 215, 462 A.2d 1316, 1319 (1983) (case is capable of repetition yet evading review when \"(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again\u201d), quoting from Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975) (per curiam) (dispute over parole was moot upon petitioner\u2019s release from prison because there was no \"reasonable expectation\u201d or \"demonstrated probability\u201d that he would again be subject to prison administration's policies). The Board\u2019s reluctance to draw the conclusion proposed by the Association was not an abuse of discretion under the circumstances of this case. See Joint Bargaining Committee, supra at 1003 (matter was moot and court refused to speculate that issue will be raised in the future); Gross, supra at 120 (\u201c... this Court will not decide moot questions. We will do so only in rare instances where exceptional circumstances exist or where questions of great public importance are involved.\u201d).\n. The Commonwealth Court also opined that the issue is \"likely and even fated to evade review if,\u201d presumably in some future year, \"the Board again waits until the parties reach a new agreement, then pronounces the unfair labor practice charge to be moot and refuses to issue a complaint.\u201d 962 A.2d at 717. Obviously, a repetition of PASSHE's conduct at some future time would present a very different factual context for the Board\u2019s consideration of a mootness exception argument, and might lend better support to a charge by the Association of unfair practices which are capable of repetition yet likely to evade review, given the labor history between the particular parties. But that is not the case before us today.\n. However, just as we recognize that a different factual record might require a different response to moot charges, see supra n. 7, we also caution that the Board\u2019s general policy in this regard should not be an exclusive one. For example, if it were shown that the employer had used illegal practices to gain concessions in negotiations, the Board might wish to consider the propriety of allowing the employer to seek refuge in a claim that the prior conduct was rendered moot by a subsequent agreement.",

The issue we accepted for review in this matter was \u201c[wjhether settlement of collective bargaining negotiations renders charges raised by a Union against an employer prior to the settlement automatically moot.\u201d Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, 602 Pa. 195, 979 A.2d 839 (2009). I remain unclear as to the Majority\u2019s answer to this question. I would expressly address the question, and I would hold that the answer is no.\nThe majority concludes, based on its review of the record, and most particularly the Board\u2019s final order, that the Board\u2019s decision was \u201cnot \u2018automatic,\u2019 \u201d in that the Board \u201crecognized and considered the exceptions to the mootness doctrine.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 472, 8 A.3d at 306. The majority also appears to conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion when it relied on its policy to \u201cdismiss as moot any unfair practice charge involving alleged bad faith bargaining where the parties have resolved the issues forming the basis for the charge through bargaining and a subsequent contract.\u201d Id. at 470, 8 A.3d at 305 (quoting Final Order of the Board, dated 12/18/07, at 2); see also id. at 307 (\u201c[The Board\u2019s] policy appears to be sensible and the Board\u2019s reliance on the policy in evaluating mootness exceptions is entitled to deference.\u201d) Finally, the majority does caution that \u201cthe Board\u2019s general policy in this regard should not be an exclusive one.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 473 n. 8, 8 A.3d at 307 n. 8. As an example of a situation in which application of the policy may be inappropriate, the majority suggests the following: \u201cif it were shown that the employer had used illegal practices to gain concessions in negotiations, the Board may wish to consider the propriety of allowing the employer to seek refuge in a claim that the prior conduct was rendered moot by a subsequent agreement.\u201d Id.\nMy first disagreement with the majority stems from its conclusion that the Board \u201crecognized and considered the exceptions to the mootness doctrine.\u201d I do not believe that the record supports this conclusion. Rather, based on my review of the record, I must conclude that the Board did not address in a meaningful way the mootness exceptions, but instead relied on its general policy to dismiss as moot any unfair practice charge where the parties have successfully negotiated a new contract. In so doing, the Board, in my view, abused its discretion, as explained below.\nThis Court has repeatedly recognized two exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) for matters of great public importance and (2) for matters capable of repetition, which are apt or likely to elude review. See Rendell v. State Ethics Commission, 603 Pa. 292, 983 A.2d 708, 719 (2009); In re Gross, 476 Pa. 203, 382 A.2d 116, 122-23 (1978). Only the second is asserted by the Association in this appeal. See Majority Opinion, at 468 n. 4, 8 A.3d at 304 n. 4. Although the Board did, indeed, mention the exceptions to the mootness doctrine in its Final Order, it engaged in no meaningful analysis of these exceptions in the context of the circumstances presented in this case. The entirety of the Board\u2019s recognition and consideration of the exceptions is found in the following excerpts of the Board\u2019s Final Order:\nThe Board will dismiss as moot any unfair practice charge involving alleged bad faith bargaining where the parties have resolved the issues forming the basis for the charge through bargaining and a subsequent contract. However, the Board, within its discretion, may hear a moot charge if the charge presents an issue of great public importance that is capable of repetition but likely to evade review.\nAdditionally, the Board has previously stated that \u201ccontinued litigation over past allegations of misconduct which have no present effects unwisely focuses the parties\u2019 attention on a divisive past rather than a cooperative future.\u201d Clearly, to continue this litigation over alleged past misconduct that no longer affects the parties cannot be said to be in the public interest. Thus, [the Association] has failed to demonstrate that its Charge raises an issue of great public importance.\nFurther, the Board will not speculate as to whether [PA]SSHE will make the same alleged threats to the bargaining unit members in the future. As such, [the Association] has failed to demonstrate that the underlying factual situation presented here is one that is capable of repetition but likely to evade review. Therefore, [the Association\u2019s] allegations of violations of Section 1201(a)(1) and (5) of [the Public Employe Relations Act] PERA are moot. Accordingly, the Secretary did not err in declining to issue a complaint and dismissing the Charge. After a thorough review of the exceptions and all matters of record, the Board concurs with the Secretary\u2019s decision to dismiss [the Association\u2019s] Charge of Unfair Practice.\nFinal Order of the Board, dated 12/18/07, at 2-8 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\nContrary to the Board\u2019s implication, in evaluating the applicability of the mootness exception for matters capable of repetition that are likely to elude review, the Board was not called upon to \u201cspeculate\u201d as to whether PASSHE would repeat the challenged conduct, nor was the Association required to prove that PASSHE would indeed do so. Rather, the proper standard is whether the challenged conduct is capable of repetition and likely to evade review. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Sloan, 589 Pa. 15, 907 A.2d 460, 464-65 (2006); In re Gross, supra at 122-23. The Board did not address the Association\u2019s argument that the matter was capable of repetition because contract agreements between the Association and PASSHE consistently expire at the end of the school year, i.e., at the end of June; hence, if a strike occurs, it is likely to be in the summer, when summer benefits for striking faculty could very well again become an issue. See Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, 962 A.2d 709, 713, 717 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008). Similarly, the Board did not address the Association\u2019s argument that, if the matter did arise again, it would likely escape judicial review, because adjudication takes at least several months, but under Section 1003 of the PERA, public employee strikes, including teacher strikes, are generally of short duration. Id. at 713, 717. In fact, the Board made absolutely no comment or determination as to the likelihood that, in the event PASSHE\u2019s alleged conduct is repeated, a subsequent Association challenge would again evade review. Thus, I am unable to agree with the majority that the Board \u201crecognized and considered\u201d the exceptions to the mootness doctrine because I discern nothing in the record to suggest that the Board either recognized the proper standard or considered the exceptions in the context of the circumstances presented in this case and of the allegations raised by the Association.\nInstead, in my view, the Board relied on its general policy of dismissing as moot any unfair practice charge where the parties have successfully negotiated a new contract. I have no disagreement with the majority insofar as it asserts that the Board, in the exercise of its discretion, may properly take into account the fact that the parties have reached agreement on their contract. However, I believe that the Board abuses its discretion when it declines to issue a complaint based exclusively on this factor, without also undertaking a thorough consideration of the applicability of the mootness exceptions to the facts and allegations in the case. As the Commonwealth Court pointed out, if the Board exclusively and repeatedly declines to issue a complaint merely because the parties have reached agreement on their contract, meritorious charges may evade review. See Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties, 962 A.2d at 717.\nI cannot determine how to interpret the majority\u2019s opinion, particularly its statement that \u201cthe Board\u2019s reliance on the policy [of dismissing charges rendered moot by a new contract] in evaluating mootness exceptions is entitled to deference.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 473, 8 A.3d at 307. I would agree that the Board has discretion as to whether to invoke a mootness exception and accordingly hear a moot charge. Furthermore, as mentioned above, in the exercise of this discretion, the Board is entitled to consider, as one factor, the wisdom of proceeding with the litigation if the parties have already reached agreement on their contract. If, however, the majority is suggesting that the Board may decline to issue a complaint based solely on its policy of dismissing charges rendered moot by a new contract, without explicit consideration and explanation of the potential applicability of the mootness exceptions, then I must strenuously disagree with the majority. I would not excuse the Board from a thorough evaluation of the mootness exceptions in the context of the circumstances and allegations of each case, and I would require the Board to set forth its analysis in sufficient detail for review, under the abuse of discretion standard, by this Court. general policy of dismissing charges rendered moot by a new contract should not be \u201cexclusive.\u201d However, the majority seems here to suggest that the policy may be applied in an exclusive manner unless, e.g., \u201cit were shown\u201d that the employer had engaged in illegal practices to gain employee concessions. Expecting the employees to show as a prerequisite for issuance of a complaint that their employer had engaged in illegal practices is too high a barrier at this stage in the litigation. As the Board stated in its decision, \u201c[i]n determining whether to issue a complaint, the Board assumes that all the facts alleged are true.\u201d Final Order of the Board, dated 12/18/07, at 1.\nFinally, I have reservations about footnote 8, in which the majority \u201ccaution[s] that the Board\u2019s general policy in this regard should not be an exclusive one. For example, if it were shown that the employer had used illegal practices to gain concessions in negotiations, the Board might wish to consider the propriety of allowing the employer to seek refuge in a claim that the prior conduct was rendered moot by a subsequent agreement.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 473, 8 A.3d at 307 (emphasis added). There is no question that the Board\u2019s\nHere, the Association alleged that PASSHE had violated several subsections of the Public Employe Relations Act by threatening employees who went on strike with the loss of already-earned pay and benefits. These are serious allegations, but I am aware of no precedent, and the majority cites none, to suggest that the Association should be required to prove them prior to the Board\u2019s issuance of a complaint, even a complaint issued pursuant to application of a mootness exception.\nFor the above reasons, I am unable to join the majority. I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand to the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board to consider the Association\u2019s charge, including whether an exception to the mootness doctrine is applicable.\nJustice BAER joins this dissenting opinion.\n. I limit my discussion to this exception as it is the only one argued by the Association in this appeal.\n. Section 1003 provides that a strike by public employee can be enjoined \"if the court finds that the strike creates a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public.\u201d 43 P.S. 1101.1003.",
