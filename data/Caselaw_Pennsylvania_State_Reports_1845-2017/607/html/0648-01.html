On January 24, 1998, she was involved in an automobile accident in Virginia and sustained severe injuries resulting in paraplegia. Two days later, on January 26, 1998, Appellant suffered a stroke that left her with right side weakness and global aphasia, a condition that rendered her unable to speak or comprehend. She did not respond to family members who visited her several weeks after the accident, and she has no memory of the time following the accident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellant’s signature on the POA consisted of an “x” marked on the appropriate line, accompanied by the notation, “her mark.” A nurse at the hospital in Virginia signed as a witness, and the document was notarized. According to the testimony of Appellant’s physician in Pennsylvania, who reviewed the medical records from her hospitalization in Virginia, at the time Appellant supposedly executed the POA she: was suffering from a traumatic brain injury; was intubated (meaning that a machine was breathing for her); was being treated with sedatives which affected her reasoning and judgment; and was unable to make important life decisions due to her aphasia. Appellant has now recovered mentally, but remains a paraplegic. <em>See In re Account of Theresa M. Vine, </em>SERS No.2004-21, at 2-3 (Opinion of Hearing Examiner, Sept. 20, 2006) (“Proposed Report”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The counselor, who knew that Appellant had been involved in an automobile accident but was unaware of Appellant’s particular health condition, reviewed the POA and discussed various retirement options available to Appellant. Robert selected Retirement Option 4, which allowed him to withdraw an amount equal to Appellant’s total accumulated deductions, rolling over the taxable contributions and receiving payment of Appellant’s non-taxable contributions. Although the terms of the disability retirement option were explained to Robert, he did not select that option on Appellant’s behalf. If he had done so, Appellant’s monthly payments would have been greater, but her accumulated deductions would not have been available for Robert to withdraw. As to survivor benefits, Robert selected Option 2, which entitled him to receive the same monthly payment as Appellant if she predeceased him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

She therefore wrote to SERS, asking to change her election to disability retirement based on her permanent physical disability. SERS denied the request, noting that, while Appellant could select another survivor option in view of her divorce, she could not change to disability retirement. Appellant’s request ultimately reached the SERS Board (the “Board”), which scheduled an administrative hearing before a hearing examiner. At the hearing, Appellant asserted that she was incapacitated at the time she allegedly placed an ‘x’ on the POA, thereby rendering the document invalid. In support of her <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>allegation of incapacity, Appellant testified and also presented numerous medical records, a physician’s deposition testimony interpreting those records, and testimony from a relative.

    <p id="b697-4" data-blocks='[["BL_697.5",697,[175,596,1155,1367]]]'>The hearing examiner filed his proposed report, <em>see supra </em>note 2, reflecting a finding that Appellant was incapacitated at the time she allegedly signed the POA. He explained, in this regard, that an incapacitated person is “an adult whose ability to receive and evaluate information effectively and communicate decisions in any way is impaired to such a significant extent that he is partially or totally unable to manage his financial resources or to meet essential requirements for his physical health and safety.” Proposed Report at 6 (quoting 20 Pa.C.S. § 5501). In light of Appellant’s incapacity, the examiner concluded that the POA was invalid, thereby rendering ineffective any retirement selection made by Robert. <em>See id. </em>at 7 (citing <em>Wilhelm v.

That being the case, the hearing examiner stated that SERS must now return Appellant to the position she occupied prior to Robert’s use of the invalid POA, thus allowing her to make her own retirement elections. He elaborated, however, that such relief should be conditioned on Appellant returning all withdrawals taken since her accident, so that SERS would not incur any liability as a result of its reliance on the POA. <em>See id. </em>at 8.</p>

SERS proffered that the imposition of such an investigatory duty would place it in an untenable position, as the undertaking of any inquiry into the circumstances of the POA’s execution could cause it to risk incurring liability under Section 5608(a) of the Code, a provision that requires third parties to follow the instructions of an agent designated in a POA. <em>See id. </em>§ 5608(a). Finally, SERS noted its disagreement with the hearing examiner’s suggestion that returning the parties to the <em>status quo ante </em>would not result in SERS suffering any liability, as granting such relief might cause administrative difficulties. <em>See </em>SERS’ Brief on Exceptions to the Opinion of the Hearing Examiner at 4.</p>

Vine, </em>No.2004-21 (SERS Board Sept. 21, 2007) (“Adjudication”). The Board observed, preliminarily, that retirement applications are contracts with SERS, which are generally binding and irrevocable. The Board noted that SERS was provided with a facially valid POA that designated Robert as Appellant’s attorney-in-fact and authorized him to conduct retirement transactions on her behalf. In light of this circumstance, the Board stated:</p>

Thus, the Board considered the POA’s facial validity to be unassailable and determined, accordingly, that Section 5608(b) prevented it from granting Appellant’s request regardless of hardship or possible inequities, as that statutory provision immunized SERS from liability. <em>See id. </em>at 8. The Board did acknowledge that, as a general proposition, it retained the power to retroactively alter retirement benefits, and that it has considered doing so in prior cases where the retiree was alleged to have lacked the capacity to form a contract at the time he or she applied for benefits. It distinguished those cases, however, on the basis that the retiree was the individual who signed the application in person; thus, the Board stated that, in such circumstances, “SERS is a direct party to the contract involving pension benefits and probably can agree to release the other party (the member) from his or her putative contract obligations” based upon a finding of incapacity. <em>Id. </em>at 9.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The court indicated that, under Pennsylvania common law, the POA and transactions undertaken pursuant to it were voidable. It placed substantial emphasis on the distinction between void and voidable transactions, developing that void acts have no significance and are nullities, whereas voidable acts are valid until annulled. <em>See <a href="/a2d/956/1088-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="956 A.2d 1088" data-case-ids="8210404" data-case-paths="/a2d/956/1088-01">id.</a> </em>at 1094 (citing <em>Der Hagopian v.

The court found this distinction significant because here, a third party (SERS) became involved before an attempt at avoidance was made, and, according to the court, Pennsylvania’s adoption of the Uniform <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>Durable Power of Attorney Act (the “UDPAA”) was intended to modify the common law to limit avoidance of the acts of an apparent agent under such circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 1094-95.</p>
    <p id="b700-4" data-blocks='[["BL_700.5",700,[273,505,1150,892]]]'>The Commonwealth Court explained that this construction of the UDPAA is consistent with the modern trend among Pennsylvania statutes that seek to reduce risks for third parties who transact business in good faith with an agent or an apparent agent. <em>See id. </em>at 1095 (referencing the Uniform Commercial Code and the Uniform Partnership Act). Accordingly, the court suggested that the only avenue available to Appellant at the administrative level to nullify the retirement selections made by Robert was to demonstrate that SERS had “reasonable cause” not to comply with Robert’s instructions made under his apparent authority, <em>see </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 5608(a), or that SERS did not act in good faith reliance on the POA, <em>see id. </em>§ 5608(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Because the Board found that neither condition was proven, and Appellant did not challenge these findings as unsupported by substantial evidence, the court deemed them binding, and, ultimately, fatal to Appellant’s claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

On this point, he stressed that SERS’ own regulations provide that, when a member makes a retirement selection, she must ordinarily execute the application herself; if she is not mentally competent to do so, the application can only be executed by a court-appointed guardian. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20249.7" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Pa.

In light of this provision, and the manner in which the POA was signed— with the mark of an “x” for a signature — he found it “impossible ... to believe” that the POA “would not raise a red flag and mandate closer scrutiny” by SERS employees or by the Board. <em>Vine, </em><a href="/a2d/956/1088-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="956 A.2d 1088" data-case-ids="8210404" data-case-paths="/a2d/956/1088-01">956 A.2d at 1099</a> (McCloskey, S.J., concurring).

In this respect, the Board indicates that the critical factor is not whether Appellant had the mental capacity to execute a valid POA, but whether Section 5608 supplied the Board with statutory immunity. If it did, the Board notes, then to surmount the presumption of validity attaching to Robert’s actions, Appellant bore the burden of proving that SERS acted in bad faith or lacked reasonable cause to comply with his instructions. The Board concludes that the Commonwealth Court was right in determining that Section <em>5608 </em>immunized it, as one of the Legislature’s objectives in enacting this statute was to make it more difficult to nullify transactions accomplished pursuant to a POA by requiring the party seeking avoidance to show, not only incapacity, but that the third party did not properly rely upon a facially valid POA. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 21.</p>

As she readily agrees, however, Section 5601(c) did not exist at the time of the underlying events. Even if it did, as an interpretive matter we differ with her conclusions grounded on that provision. Most notably, to the degree subsection (c) establishes a burden-allocation scheme based on the presence or absence of the notice, such a scheme does not confirm a broad construction of Section 5608 in the manner suggested by the dissent. In its official comment regarding this subsection, the Legislature specified that a primary purpose of the notice requirement is to protect the principal; it was not evidently <a id="p669" href="#p669" data-label="669" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*669</a>aimed at protecting third parties. <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, Jt. St. Govt. Comm. Comment — 1999. The comment also implies that the burden-shifting scheme is meant to incentivize the principal to include the notice and agents to request the notice; there is no indication that it was intended to restrict the remedies available to incapacitated persons when litigation ensues pertaining to false agents who are resourceful enough to include such a notice in a falsified power of attorney. Indeed, it would be just as easy for an unscrupulous “agent” to forge an alleged principal’s signature underneath a Section 5601(c) notice as it would to forge the same signature on the main document itself. Finally, and again, the comment refers expressly to an “agent’s impropriety in exercising a power,” which only makes sense in the context of an actual agent exercising an actual power. Therefore, unlike the dissent, we do not view the 1999 addition of subsection 5601(c) as somehow supporting a conclusion that Section 5608(b) was originally intended to apply to situations involving an invalid power of attorney.</p>

As explained, it found that distinction significant based upon its interpretation of Section 5608 of the Code, which we have now determined to be erroneous.

This does not conflict with the expression in <em>Wilhelm </em>that a power of attorney is invalid if the principal lacked capacity at execution; further, both cases are in alignment with <em>Moser </em>on the question: in all three decisions, the court recognized that, upon a showing that the principal lacked capacity at the time he or she executed the document in question, any transactions undertaken pursuant to that document could potentially be nullified.

We do not agree with the Board that this interpretation renders Section 5608 meaningless, as there are circumstances where the statute would continue to apply notwithstanding a valid POA.

More generally, it protects third parties in many circumstances where the principal contends that the agent acted in a manner designed to serve his own interests rather than those of the principal. Indeed, agents engage in self-dealing behavior with some frequency, and this is often hidden from the third party. <em>See, e.g., Empire Trust Co. v. Cahan, </em><a href="/us/274/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="274 U.S. 473" data-case-ids="81159" data-case-paths="/us/274/0473-01">274 U.S. 473</a>, 479, <a href="/us/274/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="47 S.

At a minimum, it is not always clear whether the third party in any given situation should be aware that self-dealing might be occurring. <em>See generally Am. Realty Co. v. Amey, </em><a href="/me/121/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="121 Me. 545" data-case-ids="655327" data-case-paths="/me/121/0545-01">121 Me. 545</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.%20475" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="118 A. 475">118 A. 475</a>, 478 (1922) ("As to what would be a sufficiency of facts to excite inquiry no rule can very well establish; each case depends upon its own facts. There is a great inconsistency in the cases upon this point.”). Accordingly, predicating third-party immunity solely on good-faith reliance on a power of attorney is a reasonable legislative objective, as it avoids such difficulties even in cases where actual authority exists. For this reason, we differ with Mr. Justice Eakin's suggestion that Section 5608's protections are "irrelevant” to any state of affairs involving actual authority and, concomitantly, that there is "no need” for express third-party immunity under such circumstances. Dissenting Opinion, at 679, 9 A.3d at 1169 (Eakin, J.). Indeed, Justice Eakin's position seems incompatible with the express clarification provided by the General Assembly in 1999 that, for purposes of <em>(inter </em>alia) Section 5608, "the term 'agent' means a person designated by a principal in a power of attorney to act on behalf of that principal." 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601(f); <em>see supra </em>note 11.</p>

In such circumstances, I find that a third party, like SERS herein, is immune from liability for those acts under Section 5608(b).

Indeed, a third party is made hable for resulting damages where the party, absent reasonable cause, fails to comply with such instructions. <em>Id. </em>(“Any person who without reasonable cause fails to comply with those instructions shall be subject to civil liability for any damages resulting from noncompliance.”). I conclude subsection (a) and (b) are most naturally read in tandem, and as coextensive: subsection (a) imposes lability for noncompliance absent reasonable cause, and subsection (b) reheves a party of habihty where there is good faith reliance. Although “good faith relance” is not defined, “reasonable cause” is defined to “include, but not be limited to, a good faith report having been made by the third party to the local protective services agency regarding abuse, neglect, exploitation or abandonment pursuant to section 302 of the ...

As detailed within, my analysis is based on the language of the statute, and related statutes, which I interpret using accepted statutory construction tools to discern the legislature's intent, including the avoidance of absurd results. My interpretation is not, therefore, "policy-based". Further, I no more seek to "extend[]” Section 5608(a)'s immunity provision by my interpretation than the majority seeks to restrict its operation by theirs. We both, in the end, pursue an interpretation most in accord with the statutory language and legislative intent as expressed in that language, albeit there is disagreement, to be sure, concerning that interpretation.</p>
