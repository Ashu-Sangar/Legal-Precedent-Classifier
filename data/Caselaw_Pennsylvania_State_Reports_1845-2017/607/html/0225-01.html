Therein, we addressed whether, as a matter of law, a nurse may testify in a negligence action that a breach of the nursing standard of care caused a plaintiffs medical condition. Ultimately, we held that an otherwise competent and properly qualified nurse is not prohibited by the Professional Nursing Law, 63 P.S. §§ 211 et seq., from giving expert testimony at trial regarding medical causation. In so holding, we overruled <em>sua sponte </em>our prior decision in <em>Flanagan v. Labe, </em><a href="/pa/547/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="547 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="468692" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0254-01">547 Pa. 254</a>, <a href="/a2d/690/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="690 A.2d 183" data-case-ids="11922685,468692" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/0183-01,/pa/547/0254-01">690 A.2d 183</a> (1997), wherein this Court had held a nurse was precluded from offering opinion testimony regarding the specific identity and cause of a medical condition because such testimony constituted a medical diagnosis, which a nurse is precluded from making under the Professional Nursing Law. In our original opinion, we concluded that <em>Flanagan </em>was inherently flawed because it applied a statute — the Professional Nursing Law — governing the specific practice of nursing to the distinct area of expert testimony in a court of law, which is governed by rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, and common law rules regarding expert witnesses. We further <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>determined that our decision applied retroactively to the parties in the instant case, and, therefore, that the trial court should, on remand, assess the competency of plaintiff Rodger Freed’s witness, a registered nurse, to testify regarding the relevant nursing standard of care and medical causation under the common law standards set forth in <em>Miller v.

Geisinger further argued that, because Freed did not challenge the validity of <em>Flanagan </em>at trial or on appeal, or request that it be overruled, he waived any challenge to the validity of <em>Flanagan. </em>This Court recognized that, prior to overruling decisional law <em>sua sponte, </em>the interests of all parties are best served by allowing the participants an opportunity to present argument. Accordingly, we granted reargument to allow both parties to address the continued viability of <em>Flanagan, </em>as well as the question of any waiver of this issue.

Specifically, Geisinger argues that this Court erred in concluding in our original opinion that <em>Flanagan </em>had applied the Professional Nursing Law as a rule of evidence, instead of recognizing that <em>Flanagan </em>simply “held that the Professional Nursing Law defines the scope of competency of nurses in practice and, therefore, defines the scope of the competency of nurses to provide expert testimony.” Appellants’ Supplemental Brief on Reargument at 8. Geisinger further argues that <em>Flanagan </em>does not conflict with the normal liberal standard <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>for competency, as we concluded in our original opinion, because <em>Flanagan </em>merely recognizes that, because a nurse is prohibited from making a medical diagnosis in practice, he or she would be unable to obtain the specialized knowledge necessary to allow her to testify in a court of law.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[316,642,986,41]]]'>As we explained in our original opinion, however,</p>
    <blockquote id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.6",276,[310,717,1111,747]]]'>in the context of legal proceedings, if a witness has any reasonable pretension to specialized knowledge on the relevant subject, he may be offered as an expert witness, and the weight to be given his testimony is for the trier of fact to determine. Rule 702 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence also provides that “a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify.” Pa.R.E. 702. Under Flanagan, however, a nurse duly qualified under Rule 702, but licensed under 63 P.S. § 216, is precluded from offering expert testimony on medical causation, while presumably a non-licensed nurse, <em>or any other individual, </em>with the same knowledge or experience would be permitted, under the broad common law standard for expert testimony, to offer such testimony.</blockquote>

Thus, <em>Flanagan </em>clearly operates as a rule of evidence in that it precludes an otherwise qualified nurse from offering expert testimony. In this regard, <em>Flanagan </em>arguably runs afoul of Rule 702. <em>See Albrecht, </em><a href="/pa/554/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="554 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="765988" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0031-01">554 Pa. at 45</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">720 A.2d at 700</a>. Moreover, to the extent Geisinger suggests that a nurse would be unable to obtain legally the specialized knowledge or expertise necessary to qualify as an expert witness, we note that the Professional Nursing Law does not prohibit a nurse from attending medical school, reading medical textbooks, or working along side a physician. Thus, there are any number of ways a nurse might obtain expertise that is beyond the ordinary range of training, knowledge, intelligence, or expertise, and it remains the duty of the party proffering the expert witness to establish that the witness meets these requirements.</p>

However, we specifically recognized in our opinion the limited impact of our decision in light of the more stringent requirements for expert testimony established by the MCARE Act, which became effective on May 19, 2002, and resulted in substantial changes in the requirements for qualifying an expert witness in medical professional liability actions. We also noted that there are situations in which the MCARE Act arguably might not apply.</p>

Appellants’ Joint Supplemental Brief at 10, 12. In our original opinion, we explained that, in determining whether to apply a new rule of law retroactively, there are two primary considerations: (1) whether the holding involves an interpretation of a statute or some other source of law; and (2) whether the issue is substantive or procedural. <em>Freed, </em><a href="/pa/601/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="601 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="4194952" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0233-01">601 Pa. at 253</a>, <a href="/pa/601/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="971 A.2d 1202" data-case-ids="4194952,7299192" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0233-01,/a2d/971/1202-01">971 A.2d at 1213</a>.

More importantly, and despite the panel’s nomenclature, it is apparent that the nurse’s testimony here was proffered to show what caused appellee’s wounds, and to provide the causal link between that injury and the nursing care provided by Geisinger. Under our common law standards for expert witness qualification, a nurse with appropriate experience could be qualified to provide “expert opinion testimony in a court of law regarding medical causation” in such circumstances. <em><a href="/pa/601/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="971 A.2d 1202" data-case-ids="4194952,7299192" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0233-01,/a2d/971/1202-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/601/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="971 A.2d 1202" data-case-ids="4194952,7299192" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0233-01,/a2d/971/1202-01">at 1208</a>.

In <em>Flanagan, </em>expert testimony was required to show the underlying cause of the plaintiffs medical condition, “progressively worsening subcutaneous emphysema,” arising from allegedly inadequate nursing care for a patient with a collapsed lung. Flanagan planned to present the testimony of a nurse as his only expert, on both the standard of nursing care and the “ultimate effect of that care.” The trial court ruled that the nurse was precluded by the Professional Nursing Law from rendering the causation testimony, and this Court ultimately agreed. <a href="/a2d/690/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="690 A.2d 183" data-case-ids="11922685,468692" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/0183-01,/pa/547/0254-01">690 A.2d at 184-86</a>.</p>
