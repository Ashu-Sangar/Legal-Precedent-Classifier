At the Department of Labor and Industry hearing, the Township argued local conditions or circumstances warranted the Ordinance’s sprinkler mandate and thus justified an exception to the UCC pursuant to § 7210.503(j)(2)(i). The local conditions it named were: population growth, which places a strain on its volunteer fire department; mountainous topography and traffic congestion, which delays firefighter response time; and modern construction, which utilizes rapidly-burning wooden trusses.</p>

He indicated the fire department responded to 292 calls in 2004, and less than ten responses were to family homes. The Secretary noted all new subdivisions or land development plans in the Township were required to have fire hydrants served by a public water supply. Further, the fire department determined where to place the hydrants and visited each new development to oversee hydrant installation. The Secretary acknowledged the Township was dependent on a volunteer fire department while concurrently dealing with population growth and increased traffic congestion; however, none of the Township’s evidence suggested the traffic congestion caused a significant impediment to firefighter response. Topographical evidence indicated no roadways had an incline of greater than 25%. The Secretary opined “these conditions are not atypical!,]” and “standing alone, do not justify an exception to the general rule of uniformity.” Department of Labor and Industry Adjudication and Order, 11/15/05, at 19. He concluded: “The Township has failed to establish <em>clear and convincing </em>local climatic, geologic, topographic or public health and safety circumstances and conditions in the Township to justify the enactment of Ordinance 2005-01.” <em>Id., </em>at 9 (emphasis in original).

Department of Labor and Industry Hearing, 10/20/05, at 340-41. Marcus Hook enacted an ordinance requiring automatic sprinklers in all residences, with the exception of single-family homes.

      <em>Id., </em>at 897-98, 402 (citations omitted). Beyond the examples of Marcus Hook and Carroll Valley Borough and consistent with the PCCA’s purpose, uniformity and public health are underlying principles which must guide the question of whether an exception is warranted. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 7210.102(a)(2)-(4), (b)(8). The standards in 35 P.S. § 7210.503(j)(2) ensure any ordinance equaling or exceeding the UCC’s minimum requirements nevertheless furthers these principles.</p>
    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.7",431,[166,1464,1152,785]]]'>Here, the Commonwealth Court notably perceived: “[The Secretary] simply required the Township to show that conditions there were so different from the statewide norm that the uniform standards were not appropriate to use in the Township. This was an appropriate inquiry in determining whether local circumstances and conditions justify an exception.” <em>Schuylkill Township, </em>at 583. Evidence showed adherence to the UCC would have been unsafe in Marcus Hook and Carroll Valley Borough, but the Township has failed to show the same potential risk here; it presented no clear and convincing evidence of local conditions jeopardizing public safety such as would justify an exception to the UCC. The Township offers the same evidence it presented to the Secretary, which the trial court and Commonwealth Court reviewed and held substantially supported the Secretary’s factual findings.</p>

The first definition — “characterized by or relating to position in space: having a definite spatial form or location” — does not foreclose the possibility that a township’s “local” circumstances or conditions may potentially satisfy the second definition — “characterized by, relating to, or occupying a particular place: characteristic of or confined to a particular place: not general or widespread.” <em>Id., </em>at 582 (quoting Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1327 (2002)).

The Township’s argument that the UCC was merely intended to set a floor, which municipalities may surpass when local conditions warrant it, is meritless. By adopting the UCC, the Legislature intended for uniformity to be the standard, not the exception. The Township’s position conflicts with the UCC, and the facts here stand in great contrast to the facts which justified successful sprinkler ordinances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
