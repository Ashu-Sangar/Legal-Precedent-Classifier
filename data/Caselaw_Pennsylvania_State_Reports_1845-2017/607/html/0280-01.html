Indeed, as Appellee argues, the Legislature seems to have recently bolstered the Act’s purpose of providing relief to a landlocked landowner. After the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Kelo v. City of New London, </em><a href="/us/545/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="545 U.S. 469" data-case-ids="8209431" data-case-paths="/us/545/0469-01">545 U.S. 469</a>, <a href="/us/545/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="545 U.S. 469" data-case-ids="8209431" data-case-paths="/us/545/0469-01">125 S.Ct. 2655</a>, <a href="/us/545/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="545 U.S. 469" data-case-ids="8209431" data-case-paths="/us/545/0469-01">162 L.Ed.2d 439</a> (2005), which generated much debate regarding eminent domain and private property rights, the Legislature specifically permitted the use of eminent domain proceedings to create access to a landlocked property. <em>See </em>26 Pa.C.S. § 204(b)(9) (stating power of eminent domain may be used to take private property where “The property is used ... for any road ... to provide access to a public thoroughfare for a property which would be otherwise inaccessible as the result of the use of eminent domain.... ”). While this is not an eminent domain case, § 204(b)(9) suggests the Legislature clearly intends to ensure landlocked landowners will have a continuing remedy to gain access to a public thoroughfare.</p>
    <p id="b346-4" data-blocks='[["BL_346.6",346,[255,1412,1153,632]]]'>By simply granting a private right of action to an otherwise landlocked landowner, the Act is akin to the common law doctrine of easement by necessity, which has long been used to allow a landlocked landowner to access a public highway over another’s private land when no other relief is available. Although an easement by necessity is typically the result of land which has been severed by its original owner, here, Appellee’s land was severed by the Commonwealth in order to facilitate construction of Interstate 79. Therefore, without the Act, Appellee would have no other relief to gain access to the property, leaving it unproductive — a result which is not in the public’s interest.</p>
