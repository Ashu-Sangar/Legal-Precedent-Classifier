It relies on the language of 18 Pa.C.S. § 6318(b), arguing that grading is not contingent upon whether a defendant is actually convicted of the substantive offense. The Commonwealth further contends that the statute does not require application of the default provision where a defendant is charged with, but later <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>acquitted of, the underlying sexual offenses.

Appellee suggests that to find otherwise permits the trial court to substitute its judgment for that of the jury. Additionally, Appellee submits that the converse also holds true, <em>i.e., </em>where a jury makes a specific finding that a defendant was intentionally in contact with a minor for the purpose of a certain prohibited Chapter 31 offense, the grading of that offense controls the grading for the attempted unlawful contact with a minor conviction at sentencing. “[I]n the absence of any specific finding by the jury that Appellee had been intentionally in contact with the minor for the purpose of engaging in a specific,[sic] prohibited Chapter 31 offense,” however, the default grading of 18 Pa.

There are kernels of accuracy in both the trial court’s and Superior Court’s analyses, but each court focused upon isolated aspects of interpretation and thereby misapprehended the essential controversy. The trial court reasoned that, despite Appellee’s acquittal of the first-degree felony crimes, grading of 18 Pa.C.S. § 6318 was “not contingent upon whether a defendant is ultimately convicted of the substantive offense for which he contacted the minor.” Trial Court Opinion, 6/10/08, at 13. The accuracy therein is that 18 Pa.C.S. § 6318 does not require that a defendant be convicted of the substantive offense for which he contacted the minor, let alone be charged with it. Focusing simply on this one aspect, the trial court concluded that since the first-degree felony crimes were the most serious offenses for which Appellee contacted Taylorgirll992, Appellee’s conviction for attempted unlawful contact with a minor must be graded commensurately.</p>

Thus, it concluded that Appellee’s acquittal of the first-degree felony offenses compelled his conviction for attempted unlawful contact with a minor to be graded as a first-degree misdemeanor under 18 Pa.C.S. § 6318(b)(2). While logic certainly is rooted in the evaluative process, we are disinclined to rely solely on logic in deciding this issue. Moreover, the Superior Court’s conclusion that “the grading under § 6318(b)(1) must depend upon whether Reed was actually convicted of the underlying offenses,” <em>Commonwealth v.

As we previously emphasized, the Chapter 31 offenses are not predicate offenses for 18 Pa.C.S. § 6318. In other words, a defendant need not be successful in completing the purpose of his communication with a minor in order to be found guilty of § 6318(a). For example, the actual rape of a child is not an element of the crime under § 6318(a); rather a defendant is guilty if he <em>contacts </em>a minor for the purpose of engaging in that prohibited behavior. <em>See e.g., Commonwealth v. Morgan, </em><a href="/a2d/913/0906-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="913 A.2d 906" data-case-ids="8440469" data-case-paths="/a2d/913/0906-01">913 A.2d 906</a>, 910 (Pa.Super.2006)(emphasis in original) (“[O]nce Appellant contacts or communicates with the minor <em>for the purpose of </em>engaging in the prohibited activity, the crime of unlawful contact with a minor has been completed.”), <em>appeal denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=592%20Pa.%20788" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="592 Pa. 788">592 Pa. 788</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20623" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="927 A.2d 623">927 A.2d 623</a> (2007); <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, contrary to the Superior Court’s representation, a defendant need <em>not </em>be convicted of the substantive offense for which he contacted the minor.

Although that case involved predicate offenses and the instant case does not, both cases share one common feature: to secure a conviction of the offense under review, <em>i.e., </em>terroristic threats in <em>Magliocco </em>and the Chapter 31 offenses herein, the Commonwealth was not required to charge the defendant with the other crimes.

Nothing requires the underlying offense to be charged, and there need be no proof that it was committed or even attempted. Appellee clearly contacted the party he thought to be a minor with the intent to commit the offense of rape. He gave instructions to skip school, and drove to a pre-determined location “to meet <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>[her] and have physical contact that could have led to sex.” Majority op., at 634, 9 A.3d at 1141. Appellant was interrupted in his purpose, resulting in counts of attempt to rape rather than accomplishment of rape, but he nonetheless attempted the contact for the purpose of rape.</p>
    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[172,600,1154,729]]]'>The jury was given two crimes relevant here, which I will abbreviatedly call attempted contact and attempted rape. Acquittal of the latter certainly does not preclude conviction of the former, for they are distinct offenses. The latter required proof of a substantial step toward accomplishing the actual rape. The former, however, required only proof that he took a substantial step toward <em>contacting </em>the minor for the purpose of rape, not a step toward the rape itself. As there was no actual minor, and as actual attempt at sex was interrupted by appellee’s arrest, it is not difficult to understand the finding he did not take a substantial step toward actual commission of rape. Such a result does not matter to the attempted contact count, as the contact with relevant intent was already attempted and complete by this time.</p>
    <p id="b691-6" data-blocks='[["BL_691.6",691,[169,1351,1154,517]]]'>Acquittal of attempted rape does not mean the jury found appellee’s purpose in contacting her was not rape — indeed, that is exactly what it <em>did </em>find his purpose to have been. The jury never found he attempted contact without the intent to have sex with her — it only means the prosecution did not prove he took a further step toward accomplishing the rape. He unquestionably took a substantial step toward contacting her for purposes of rape, even though he did not take a substantial step toward actually raping her — for purposes of determining the grade of crime, this is all that is required.</p>
