(“Hidden Valley”). Lori was a season pass holder at Hidden Valley and an experienced skier. After the family had been skiing for several hours, Lori’s six-year-old nephew Nicholas had to return to the condominium where the family was staying because he was cold. Lori volunteered to return with Nicholas while the rest of the family continued skiing.</p>

Because Lori was concerned that Nicholas would have difficulty boarding the chair lift due to his small size and inexperience, she asked the lift operator to slow the lift before it reached them so she could ensure that Nicholas boarded safely. The operator replied that this lift had only one speed and could not be slowed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> According to Lori, the operator then agreed to stop the lift two times to allow them to board: first, when the chair was behind the bull wheel, to allow Lori and Nicholas to move out of the line of skiers waiting to board and position themselves in the path of the chair; then, a second time, just before the chair reached them, to allow them to board. After the lift was stopped the first time, Lori and Nicholas moved from the line and into the path of the chair. However, as the lift came around, the operator did not stop it again. Nevertheless, Lori safely boarded the lift, and the operator attempted to help Nicholas onto the moving seat by grabbing his shoulder and hoisting him up. Unfortunately, Nicholas was not properly seated, and he began to slip off the chair. Lori, who was seated, reached over and attempted to pull Nicholas onto the seat while shouting for the operator to stop the lift. The lift continued moving, and Lori and Nicholas fell. Nicholas was not seriously injured. Lori, however, suffered a dislocated shoulder and a fractured hip.</p>

Appellees maintained that, although the risk of falling off a ski lift may be inherent to the sport, the risk that a lift operator would expressly agree to stop the lift twice to enable a small child to board and then fail to do so, is not. Further, appellees argued that the trial court erred by failing to hold, in the alternative, that even if the Release had been otherwise applicable, the lift operator’s alleged agreement to stop the lift a second time to allow Lori and Nicholas to board “superseded” the Release and rendered Hidden Valley liable for its employee’s negligent “breach of an express promise.”</p>

Hidden Valley argued that the trial court’s construction of the Act was in conflict with our decision in <em>Hughes, supra, </em>which cautioned against a narrow and hypertechnical interpretation of what constitutes an inherent risk under the Act. Hidden Valley explained that the risk in <em>Hughes </em>— a collision with another skier at the base of the slope — was “common, frequent, and expected,” and thus was properly held to have been assumed by the plaintiff skier. <a href="/a2d/762/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="762 A.2d 339" data-case-ids="11151566,1366991" data-case-paths="/a2d/762/0339-01,/pa/563/0501-01">762 A.2d at 344-45</a>.

Because the release language was located above a dotted line where the ticket was to be folded over a wicket, the <em>Beck-Hummel </em>panel held that summary judgment was improper because it could not conclude as a matter of law that the ticket language was sufficiently conspicuous to convey to the plaintiff that she had given up any legal rights. <a href="/a2d/902/1266-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="902 A.2d 1266" data-case-ids="8418218" data-case-paths="/a2d/902/1266-01">902 A.2d at 1275</a>.

Hidden Valley notes that injuries frequently occur on chair lifts when users, among other things, fail to board properly or fall off due to unexpected movements or weather conditions. Because the sort of injury at issue here is so common, Hidden Valley maintains, the risk of such an injury must be anticipated and expected by the lift’s users. Based upon the frequency of such injuries, Hidden Valley contends that this common and anticipated risk is inherent to the sport of skiing and Lori therefore assumed that risk when she decided to use the lift.</p>

Appellees posit that when a risk arises that is not inherent to the sport (or when a ski resort’s negligence gives rise to an unexpected risk), the skier has not assumed that particular risk, and therefore retains the right to sue for resulting damages notwithstanding the Act’s bar. Applying the standard articulated by the Superior Court in <em>Crews, </em>appellees argue that “inherent” risks are only those few risks that cannot be removed without altering “the fundamental nature of skiing.” <em>Crews, </em><a href="/a2d/874/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="874 A.2d 100" data-case-ids="8951036" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0100-01">874 A.2d at 105</a>.

Appellees also submit that <em>Crews </em>is more germane to the facts here than <em>Hughes. </em>Specifically, according to appellees, <em>Crews </em>held that, while the risk of colliding with another person on the slopes is an inherent risk under <em>Hughes, </em>the risk of being struck from behind by an intoxicated minor is not. Appellees reason that, just as the Superior Court defined “inherent risks” in <em>Crews </em>narrowly, so too the risks assumed by Lori should be defined not as the general risks of using the ski lift, but as the specific risk of lift operator negligence.

      <em>Hughes, </em>that boarding and riding a ski lift are inherent to the sport of downhill skiing and inherently dangerous activities, the most obvious danger of which — a risk that is common, frequent and expected — is undoubtedly falling from the lift. Clearly, it is this very obvious and common risk that prompted Lori to ask the operator to stop the lift. But the lift operator had no duty to comply with Lori’s request; boarding a moving ski lift is simply how this aspect of the sport is done. <em>See Jones, <a href="/pa/483/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="483 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="1751280" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0075-01">supra</a> </em>(where defendant did not deviate in some relevant respect from established custom plaintiff may not recover in “inherent risk case”).

Further, Lori voluntarily chose to engage in the sport of downhill skiing solely for recreational purposes, and was under no compulsion to sign the Release. The mere fact that Lori would not have been permitted to ski at Hidden Valley had she not signed the Release does not render it an adhesion contract; the Release related to a purely recreational activity, and Lori was free to ski or not.

Instead they claim that, because the Release listed certain types of risks it covered, its effect is limited to those enumerated risks. Specifically, appellees argue that the Release exempted Hidden Valley from liability only when its negligence gave rise to a risk otherwise inherent to the sport of skiing. Appellees’ argument on this issue purports to be a textual one: they first point to the language of the Release listing risks involved in skiing, which “include but are not limited to variations in snow and terrain, ice and icy conditions, moguls, rocks, debris ..., bare spots, lift towers [and] poles,” and stress that all of these <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>examples are risks inherent to the sport of skiing. Appellees then claim that, by enumerating risks inherent to downhill skiing and then requiring the skier to accept those risks, the Release only bars suits that arise out of the listed risks. Appellees emphasize that the word “negligence” is grammatically tied to the enumerated risks, as the Release states that the signer agrees to accept “all these risks and agree[s] not to sue Hidden Valley Resort ... regardless of any negligence on their part.” Because the term “negligence” appears in the same sentence as the clause stating that the skier agrees to accept “these” risks, appellees argue that the Release only bars suits arising out of negligence that causes a risk inherent to skiing as defined in the Release, and not negligence giving rise to other unexpected risks not inherent to the sport. Appellees thus posit that the Release essentially did define and give examples of covered “negligence,” but that the negligence alleged here lies outside what was contemplated.</p>

Lori herself subjectively recognized and anticipated that falling off the lift was an inherent danger of its use, as she attempted to reduce the risk by speaking with the operator in advance. The fact that the operator allegedly was negligent in failing to stop the lift — and that ultimately there could be no real assurance of safety in such activities — underlines the inherent risk involved. Thus, the allegation of negligent behavior on the part of Hidden Valley does not alter the fact that Lori, in deciding to use the ski lift after expressly signing away her right to sue for injuries caused by the use of that lift “regardless of any negligence,” assumed the risk of such negligence.</p>

The Release also clearly spelled out the parties’ intention to release Hidden Valley from liability for injuries arising from the risk accompanying the use of a ski lift, regardless of any negligence on the part of the ski lift operator.

First, as noted, appellees did not make this allegation in their complaint. Appellees nonetheless argue here that the lift operator had apparent authority to modify the Release, and that the lift operator’s alleged agreement to stop the lift was a modification of the clause of the Release barring suits against Hidden Valley for the negligence of their employees. Even assuming that the lift operator had the authority to modify the Release, the agreement to stop the lift did not purport to do so. Moreover, the promise was directed to assisting Nicholas (not a party to this action) rather than Lori, an experienced skier. In any event, whether or not the lift operator agreed to stop the lift, there is no allegation that he somehow told Lori that he was thereby bestowing upon her the right to sue Hidden Valley should she be injured while boarding or riding it.</p>

Such an approach fails to account for the "no-duty” rule and is contrary to the legislative intent to preserve the assumption of risk defense for downhill skiing. Neither the common law assumption of the risk doctrine, nor our decision in <em>Hughes, </em>suggested such an interpretation of inherent risks.

However, I believe that the case law to this effect is not well grounded, and that the manner in which it has developed has added unnecessary confusion to the issue because, by definition, an adhesion contract is simply one that the customer must accept or reject, with little or no opportunity to bargain over its terms, regardless of its subject matter. <em>See id. </em>at 27, 2 A.3d at 1190 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary to the effect that an adhesion contract is a “standard-form contract prepared by one party, to be signed by the party in a weaker position, usu[ally] a consumer, who adheres to the contract with little choice about the terms”). In other words, as a general proposition an adhesion contract is a take-it-or-leave-it agreement that the customer must sign in order to purchase the goods or services in question, regardless of the <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>nature of those goods or services — that is, irrespective of whether they pertain to the essentials of life or mere recreational activities. <em>See generally Carnival Cruise Lines v.

    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[269,651,1154,1708]]]'>Unfortunately, in my view, the case law pertaining specifically to liability releases has applied a specialized definition for adhesion agreements whereby an agreement to immunize a seller from liability for negligence only constitutes a contract of adhesion if the customer is under a substantial economic compulsion to consummate the transaction, which presumably is not true of voluntary recreational activities. As noted, this specialized use of terminology is not well grounded. It can be traced to a decision of this Court from the 1960s involving a residential lease. <em>See Galligan v. Arovitch, </em><a href="/pa/421/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="421 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1900435" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0301-01">421 Pa. 301</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=219%20A.2d%20463" class="citation" data-index="139" data-cite="219 A.2d 463">219 A.2d 463</a> (1966). The Court in <em>Galligan </em>refused to apply a release clause to the tenant’s suit because the clause did not cover the area of the premises where she was injured. <em>See id. </em>at 303, <a href="/citations/?q=219%20A.2d%20463" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="219 A.2d 463">219 A.2d at 465</a>. After the Court reached this holding, the authoring Justice — Mr. Justice Cohen — writing only for himself, proceeded to opine that, because a residential tenant lacks bargaining power concerning a prospective lease agreement with the property owner, there can be no meeting of the minds as to the specific provisions of the lease, including any release from liability in favor of the landlord. Justice Cohen did not reference any authority for this proposition, and ultimately only cited to a passage in a law review note to support his conclusion that such clauses need not always be enforced. <em>See id. </em>at 304, <a href="/citations/?q=219%20A.2d%20463" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="219 A.2d 463">219 A.2d at </a>465 (citing Note, <em>The Form 50 Lease: Judicial Treatment of an Adhesion Contract, </em><a href="/citations/?q=111%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%201197" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="111 U.

In my view, it would be better to recognize that such terminology is anomalous because, as noted, it is inconsistent with the terms employed relative to adhesion contracts in other settings, and, just as important, it does not reflect the reality that take-or-leave contracts are, by definition, adhesion contracts whether or not they pertain only to voluntary recreational activities or amusements. Accordingly, in the future, I would recast the relevant prong of the exculpatory clause validity analysis as pertaining to whether the contract as a whole is unconscionable, and determine unconscionability based on general principles.</p>

These costs, of which probably the largest is the cost of supervising the employees and agents who engage in the actual contract negotiations on the company's behalf, are likely to be high for a large company that has many contracts.

Specifically, we stated that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[310,1289,1114,348]]]'>It is generally accepted that an exculpatory clause is valid where three conditions are met. First, the clause must not contravene public policy. Secondly, the contract must be between persons relating entirely to their own private affairs, and, thirdly, each party must be a free bargaining agent to the agreement so that the contract is not one of adhesion.</blockquote>

      <em>Id. </em>at 99. We further noted that exculpatory language is not favored in the law and must be strictly construed against the drafter of the clause. <em>Id. </em>The majority concludes that the Release meets the necessary requirements for allowing an exculpatory clause to be enforced and holds that the Release is, therefore, valid. As to the first prong, regarding public <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>policy, the majority notes that this requirement is met because, “the clear policy of this Commonwealth, as embodied by the [Skier’s Responsibility] Act, is to encourage the sport and to place the risks of skiing squarely on the skier.” Maj.

The release employed by Appellant Hidden Valley in this case, which Lori signed, not only recognizes and insulates the resort from liability related to risks inherent to “[S]kiing, Snowboarding, and Snowblading, including the use of lifts,” but also purports to insulate the resort from “other risks” associated therewith.</p>

Op. at 34, 2 A.3d at 1194.
