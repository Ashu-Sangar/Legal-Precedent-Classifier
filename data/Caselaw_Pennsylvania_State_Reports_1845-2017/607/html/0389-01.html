Upon seeing Ybarra, they neither recognized him as a person with a criminal history nor had any particular reason to believe that he might be inclined to assault them. Moreover, as Police Agent Johnson later testified, Ybarra, whose hands were empty, gave no indication of possessing a weapon, made no gestures or other actions indicative of an intent to commit an assault, and acted generally in a manner that was not threatening. At the suppression hearing, the most Agent Johnson could point to was that Ybarra was wearing a 3/4-length lumber jacket, clothing which the State admits could be expected on almost any tavern patron in Illinois in early March.

When a recurrent event gains a sobriquet such as "high crime area” or "drugs follow guns," arguments tend to give insufficient attention to the actuality justifying that shorthand, touting instead the fact it is not universally true.

      <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>Initially, I note that the Majority sets forth an incomplete recitation of the investigative stop standard as articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.Ct. 1868</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">20 L.Ed.2d 889</a> (1968) and its progeny. Specifically, the Majority offers that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Teiry </em>held that “a law enforcement officer who approaches a citizen in the course of an investigation may conduct a pat-down search for weapons if the officer reasonably believes that the person is ‘armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others.’ ” Majority Opinion at 396, 7 A.3d at 814 (quoting <em>Terry, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. at 23-24</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.Ct. 1868</a>). This rendition of the <em>Terry </em>standard, however, is incomplete, as the investigatory stop must initially be lawful <em>before </em>a pat-down search for weapons may be conducted. As more fully developed by the high Court, “[t]he Court [in Terry] upheld ‘stop and frisk’ as constitutionally permissible if two conditions are met. First, the investigatory stop must be lawful. That requirement is met in an on-the-street encounter, <em>Terry </em>determined, when the police officer reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a criminal offense. Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.” <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>— U.S. -, <a href="/us/555/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="129 S.

    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[182,783,1152,1122]]]'>Specifically, the Majority observes that no one “from the task force knew if Appellant had a criminal record,” Majority Opinion at 401, 7 A.3d at 817, a factor that, without more, such as a criminal history of violence, is unrelated to an individualized basis for perceiving a threat of being armed and dangerous. Similarly, the Majority states as a permissible consideration that “there was no indication that D.W. and Appellant were involved in a common enterprise,” Majority Opinion at 401, 7 A.3d at 817, again, a factor irrelevant to the issue of whether the individual was potentially violent. Finally, the Majority opines that Appellant’s presence “during the drug transaction or D.W.’s subsequent arrest” were factors that could inform the question of whether one was potentially threatening to a police officer’s safety. Majority Opinion at 401 n. 9, 7 A.3d at 817 n. 9. Curiously, these factors set forth by the Majority all share a strong likeness to the “guns follow drugs” presumption that the Majority properly rejects. Contrary to the Majority, I would limit the analysis under <em>Terry </em>to those factors which are indicative of whether a police officer reasonably believes an individual is armed and presently dangerous.</p>
