    <p id="b360-3" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[269,320,1152,842]]]'>
      <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>Appellants argue that a new trial is not warranted, despite trial court error, where the error did not cause prejudice. According to Appellants, Appellees failed to make a showing that any alleged error was prejudicial, and the Superior Court on appeal did not find, or even mention, prejudice. Rather, Appellants contend that the Superior Court improperly focused solely upon the lack of evidence to allow submission of the issue of comparative negligence to the jury. As an aside, Appellants vigorously disagree with this conclusion, contending that Frank Fatiga, Jr. testified that “Someone would have to hit [the backrest] to knock it over. They don’t just fall.” N.T., 6/12/07, at 55. This testimony, coupled with Anthony Boyle’s testimony that he was the only one near the backrest, according to Appellants, was sufficient evidence to submit the issue of Anthony Boyle’s negligence to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[266,1187,1154,1169]]]'>Nevertheless, Appellants assert that, even if the special verdict sheet introduced to the jury a legal concept unsubstantiated by the evidence, Appellees are not entitled to a new trial because such error was harmless, as Appellees suffered no prejudice by the error. Specifically, Appellants submit that the jury never reached the question of Anthony Boyle’s negligence because the jury determined that Appellants were not negligent; thus, no prejudice resulted from the presence of the comparative negligence question on the special verdict sheet. Appellants offer various Pennsylvania cases which support the principle that allegations of error are rendered moot or harmless where the jury did not deliberate over issues of alleged error in order to reach its verdict. <em>See, e.g., Whitton v. H.A. Gable Co., </em><a href="/pa/331/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="331 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1184282" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0429-01">331 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%20644" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="200 A. 644">200 A. 644</a> (1938); <em>Jewelcor Jewelers &amp; Distrib., Inc. v.

Related thereto, Appellants stress that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying Appellees’ request for a new trial as any alleged error in the verdict slip was harmless as a matter of law. Finally, Appellants maintain that, if the Superior Court’s decision were to stand, the appellate court system would be flooded with appeals of trial court error, even in the absence of prejudice.</p>

      <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>Appellees counter that Appellants presented insufficient evidence to the jury that Anthony Boyle was negligent in any action or omission concerning his injuries to justify inserting a section on the special verdict sheet on comparative negligence. According to Appellees, the only evidence presented at trial was that Frank Fatiga, Jr. was climbing on shelves in the parts department and caused the backrest of the forklift to fall on Anthony Boyle; that Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations required that a forklift must have its backrest on at all times; and that the backrest could have been secured. As such, Appellees claim that the Superior Court properly found that there was not conflicting evidence as to how the accident occurred, and, thus, no evidence for the jury to consider comparative negligence. Therefore, Appellees reason that the Superior Court properly determined that the trial court erred in submitting the question regarding comparative negligence to the jury, and that a new trial was required.</p>

Appellants certainly cannot assume that the jurors didn’t read and review the entire special verdict sheet as the trial court instructed them to do before rendering a verdict[.]” Appellees’ Brief at 18.

While the lower tribunals, and Appellees in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>speak of the doctrines of "comparative negligence” and "contributory negligence” interchangeably, we note that, in 1978, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted the Comparative Negligence Act, 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 7102(a), to ameliorate the harshness of the common law doctrine of contributory negligence, which served as an absolute bar to recovery by plaintiffs who may have been only minimally responsible for their loss:</p>
      <blockquote id="b357-10" data-blocks='[["BL_357.11",357,[249,1560,1085,318]]]'>(a) GENERAL RULE. — In all actions brought to recover damages for negligence resulting in death or injury to person or property, the fact that the plaintiff may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery by the plaintiff or his legal representative where such negligence was not greater than the causal negligence of the defendant or defendants against whom recovery is sought, but any damages sustained by the plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributed to the plaintiff.</blockquote>

Thus, in situations involving negligence which results in death or injury to person or property, the doctrine of comparative negligence is employed to apportion the costs of an accident grounded upon the relative fault of both the plaintiff and the defendant. Pursuant to this statutory construct, where the factfinder finds the defendant is negligent, it then determines if the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, and, if so, the factfinder assesses the relative percentages of fault. The Comparative Negligence Act permits a plaintiff to recover damages where the plaintiff's contributory negligence is equal to or less than the defendant's negligence. <em><a href="/pa-commw/115/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="540 A.2d 1370" data-case-ids="1371497" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/115/0512-01">Id.</a> </em>Thus, the doctrine of contributory negligence still endures within a comparative negligence framework, but as modified by the statute. <em>Id.; Krentz v.
