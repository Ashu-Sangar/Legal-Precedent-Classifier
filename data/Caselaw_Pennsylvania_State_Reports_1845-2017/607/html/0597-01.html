Although he <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>concedes that he had no right to enter the jury room, Appellant argues that the procedure employed by the trial court violated Rule 602 because the review constituted a stage of the trial, and, therefore, the court should have afforded Appellant an opportunity to witness the event by ordering that the tape be played in open court. Consistent with this view, Appellant suggests that counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to object and maintains that the unsupervised examination of the recorded testimony was inherently prejudicial because the jury had control of both the tape and an unknown audio technician whose “body language and facial expressions could well have conveyed his opinion to the jury.” Appellant’s brief at 22.</p>

The Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure are to be construed in accordance with the rules of statutory construction, where the goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the drafters. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 101(C); 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). In the case at bar, the parties and the trial court all agree that the playback of the audiotaped testimony constituted a stage of the trial, and, as a result, Rule 602 was violated. We concur with this assessment. The rule plainly states that the defendant has the right to observe every phase of the trial, including the impaneling of the jury and the reading of the verdict, and that right unquestionably applies when a deliberating jury is permitted to re-examine a witness’s trial testimony. Accordingly, we find that Appellant’s first issue has arguable merit.</p>

In its common usage and in legal parlance, the word “transcript” denotes a “written, typewritten, or printed copy, especially of a legal record or a student’s school record.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1362 (New college ed.1976). <em>See also </em>Black’s Law Dictionary 1503 (7th ed.1999) (“A handwritten, <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>printed, or typed copy of testimony given orally; esp., the official record of proceedings in a trial or hearing, as taken down by a court reporter.”).

As to the latter claim, we observe that <em>Oleynik, Karaffa, Peterman, </em>and <em>Small </em>all deal exclusively with written documents, which are materially different from audiotapes. The use of transcripts during deliberations creates potential problems because they can influence the verdict in several ways. For example, if transcripts are provided to assist jurors in reviewing an audiotaped conversation, there is an inherent danger that the jurors will rely solely on the documents if the conversation is difficult to comprehend, thus abandoning their role as fact-finder and construing the transcripts as independent evidence of the recorded statements. <em>See United States v. Holton, </em><a href="/f3d/116/1536-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="116 F.3d 1536" data-case-ids="11988930,3706230" data-case-paths="/f3d/116/1536-01,/us-app-dc/325/0360-01">116 F.3d 1536</a>, 1540 (D.C.Cir.1997). There is also a possibility that deliberating jurors will read the transcripts without simultaneously reviewing the audiotape to verify the accuracy of the transcripts. <em><a href="/f3d/116/1536-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="116 F.3d 1536" data-case-ids="11988930,3706230" data-case-paths="/f3d/116/1536-01,/us-app-dc/325/0360-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/116/1536-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="116 F.3d 1536" data-case-ids="11988930,3706230" data-case-paths="/f3d/116/1536-01,/us-app-dc/325/0360-01">at 1541</a>. Finally, some jurists contend that <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>providing transcripts of recorded conversations that contain inculpatory statements made by the defendant is tantamount to allowing jurors to examine a recorded confession during their deliberations. <em>See Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[270,603,1149,584]]]'>None of these considerations was an issue at Appellant’s trial because the jury never reviewed any transcripts. Furthermore, the audiotaped testimony should have been relatively easy to understand because it was recorded in a controlled environment where the witness and counsel were encouraged to speak loudly and clearly without interrupting each other. <em>Cf. United States v. Howard, <a href="/f3d/80/1194-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="80 F.3d 1194" data-case-ids="7642509" data-case-paths="/f3d/80/1194-01">80 F.3d 1194</a> </em>(7th Cir.1996) (transcripts were deemed necessary to review audio-recorded conversations that featured multiple individuals who often spoke simultaneously).

The trial court, in its discretion, granted the request and attempted to insulate the jury from external influences by conducting the review in the privacy of the deliberation room. As an additional precaution, the court instructed the technician who operated the tape machine to retain possession of the tape and refrain from playing any additional testimony for the jury. Appellant’s concerns about the reliability of the verdict are purely speculative, as there is no indication that the technician ignored the trial court’s directives, discussed the case with any members of the jury, or engaged in any other type of inappropriate behavior inside the deliberation room. Thus, Appellant cannot establish actual prejudice stemming from trial counsel’s failure to raise a Rule 646 objection, and no relief is due.</p>

While I have no doubt that it would be extremely difficult for Appellant to carry his burden of demonstrating actual prejudice under the circumstances (and, indeed, the majority had already found that no prejudice was proved in the context of the Rule 602 claim, <em>see id. </em>at 621), my concern lies with the possibility that the Court may be understood as suggesting that permitting a jury to listen to taped testimony during its deliberations is less inherently problematic than allowing it to review trial transcripts.
