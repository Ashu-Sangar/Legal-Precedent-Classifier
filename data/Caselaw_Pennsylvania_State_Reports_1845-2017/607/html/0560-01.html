The Commonwealth Court affirmed the grant of the restaurant liquor licenses, holding that the PLCB acted within its discretion in approving the interior connection and that these restaurants, like any other that comply with the applicable provisions of the Liquor Code and the PLCB’s regulations, were proper licensees.

The regulation further states that “[licensed premises may not have an inside passage or communication to or with any business conducted by the licensee or other persons <em>except as approved by the Board.” Id. </em>at § 3.52(b) (emphasis added). Regulation 3.54 addresses such “interior connection,” and states that “[w]here the Board has approved the operation of another business which has an inside passage or communication to or with the licensed premises, the extent of the licensed area shall be clearly indicated by a permanent partition at least 4 feet in height.” <em>Id. </em>at § 3.54.

The evidence presented at each hearing applied generally to all Wegmans’ restaurants, with the exception of certain site-specific information. Relevant to these appeals, evidence was presented regarding the propriety of the interior connections, and the propriety of “other business” conducted on the licensed premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Argument was also presented as to whether the grant of these licenses served as <em>de facto </em>authorization for supermarkets, as opposed to restaurants, to sell beer. Finally, the parties contested the relevance of the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Malt Beverage Distributors Ass’n v.

Wegmans established that its restaurants range from 6,000 to 9,000 square feet, and typically seat 150-200 patrons, with the State College restaurant having accommodations for as many as 276 patrons. The restaurants serve a wide assortment of soups, salads, and entree items in a cafeteria-style setting. Wegmans further demonstrated that the restaurant area in each facility would be clearly marked by four-foot walls. Entry to the restaurants would be obtained <em>via </em>passages in the divider walls, and also from a separate exterior doorway. Wegmans asserted that the beer will be stored in coolers placed within the restaurant demarcated by the four-foot divider walls, and that beer purchases will be restricted to dedicated cash registers located in these areas. The licensed restaurants will have restricted hours, as compared to the rest of the store.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[265,1349,1152,680]]]'>Wegmans also presented evidence that it planned to sell the beer for consumption on the premises as an accompaniment to the food served in the restaurant, and to sell beer for takeout in legally permissible quantities of a maximum of two six-packs per sale. Wegmans established that none of the restaurants were located within 200 feet of any other licensees or within 800 feet of any restrictive institutions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Additionally, evidence was presented that the PLCB has previously issued restaurant liquor licenses to restaurants that were interconnected to department stores, such as Boscov’s and John Wanamaker’s, and issued an eating place malt beverage license to a Wawa convenience store that satisfied the statutory requisites.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.6",610,[266,2054,1149,201]],["BL_611.1",611,[172,328,1152,724]]]'>MBDA did not contest the evidence presented by Wegmans regarding the physical characteristics of the restaurants and their connections to the grocery stores. However, MBDA did assert that beer distributors would be economically impacted <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>if the PLCB granted Wegmans’ restaurant liquor licenses, and the parties presented conflicting evidence on this issue. MBDA presented testimony of its chief counsel and of owners of neighboring beer distributors, which established their concern that the grant of licenses will directly result in unfair competition in the beer sale market, causing a number of Pennsylvania beer distributors to go out of business. They asserted that there is a difference between Wegmans and a typical restaurant licensee because customers who patronize Wegmans are there to buy grocery items, which beer distributors cannot sell. MBDA further presented testimony suggesting that Wegmans would attract customers who desired to purchase beer solely for takeout purposes, thus infringing on their market share of beer sales.</p>
    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[171,1084,1152,685]]]'>To the contrary, Wegmans presented the testimony of an economist who opined that beer distributors would not suffer a negative economic impact if Wegmans began selling beer in its restaurants. With Wegmans being limited to selling two six-packs per takeout purchase, the economist asserted that such sales would not impact distributors’ sale of larger quantities, as there are different customer bases for the sale of beer in six-packs and sales by the case. The economist further testified that distributors may actually benefit from Wegmans’ licensure because Wegmans, as a “destination retailer,” attracts a large number of customers, which is an advantage to nearby businesses based on the economic benefit of “clustering” retailers.</p>

Consistent with the hearing examiner’s recommendation, the PLCB subsequently approved Wegmans’ restaurant liquor license applications, and issued extensive opinions in support thereof. Germane to the issues presented, the PLCB carefully considered the propriety, under Regulation 3.52(b), of the “interior connection” between the restaurant and supermarket. The PLCB found that its determination in this regard is entirely discretionary, and that it has historically exercised its discretion by permitting interior connections <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>between restaurants or eating place licensees and unlicensed commercial establishments.

    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[276,546,1154,669]]]'>Once the discretionary decision to approve an interior connection had been made, the PLCB noted that the requisites of Regulations 3.53 and 3.54 must also be satisfied; these regulations restrict beer storage and sales to licensed areas delineated by a permanent partition of at least four feet. The PLCB ruled that the evidence presented by Wegmans satisfied these regulations, as the proposed licensed restaurant will be clearly marked by four-foot walls with interior and exterior passageways, and all beer storage and sales will be limited to the restaurant. <em>Id. </em>at 117.

The PLCB went on to conclude that “[t]here was no evidence that the storage and preparation of food items for the unlicensed grocery store and/or items for sale in the grocery store would in some way compromise the integrity of [Wegmans’] control over the <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>licensed premises or over the sale and or storage of alcoholic beverages.” <em>Id.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[178,438,1152,830]]]'>Additionally, the PLCB made a specific finding that Wegmans decided consciously in the early nineties to offer prepared foods for its target customers who lacked the time to cook meals, and that “it certainly does not appear that [Wegmans] built its restaurants in a veiled attempt to have the opportunity to sell takeout beer.” <em>Id. </em>at 134. The Board rejected as speculative and unsupported by the record MBDA’s contention that Wegmans is technically complying with the PLCB requirements, but intends, for all practical purposes, to act as a distributor. <em>Id. </em>at 139. Finally, the PLCB discussed the application of the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Sheetz, </em><a href="/a2d/918/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="918 A.2d 171" data-case-ids="8325891" data-case-paths="/a2d/918/0171-01">918 A.2d 171</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2007), and concluded that such decision did not preclude the approval of an interior connection or passageway, but rather interpreted the statutory definition of “retail dispenser,” which is not at issue in the instant cases.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[173,1300,1155,680]]]'>MBDA appealed to the Commonwealth Court, contending that the real seller of beer was Wegmans’ supermarket, and that the notion that the restaurant is the retailer is merely legal fiction. It further argued that the interior connection between the grocery store and restaurant did not sufficiently separate the two businesses as the licensed space was fundamentally an integral part of the supermarket. MBDA further argued that permitting Wegmans to sell beer for takeout in its restaurant, under the same roof as its supermarket, contravenes the PLCB’s goal of regulating and restricting the sale of alcohol, and, instead promotes the sale of beer. Finally, MBDA argued that the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Sheetz, supra, </em>supported its position herein.</p>

It concluded that the present action involved the sale of malt liquor in a restaurant, as authorized by the legislature, and the fact that the restaurant was within the grocery store did not disqualify it from receipt of a restaurant license.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.6",614,[264,1045,1149,622]]]'>The court then specifically addressed the interior connection between the restaurant-licensed premises and the grocery store.

Finally, the Commonwealth Court rejected MBDA’s contention that its previous decision in <em>Sheetz </em>compelled a contrary result, finding that <em>Sheetz </em>focused on the proper statutory construction of a “retail dispenser,” and did not involve the issue of whether the PLCB could approve an interior connection.</p>

MBDA urges this Court to “place reality ahead of legal form,” and recognize that the economic reality of the situation is that the purchase of beer from a Wegmans’ restaurant is, in fact, a purchase of beer from Wegmans’ supermarket. <em><a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20331" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="109 A.2d 331">Id.</a></em>

Moreover, these restaurants will be separated from the grocery stores by four foot walls, and all storage and sales of malt beverages will occur solely within them, and not in the discrete grocery stores.

      <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>Upon careful review, we agree with Appellees that the PLCB did not err as a matter of law or fact when it authorized the sale of beer by Wegmans’ restaurants. Although not in the chronology presented by MBDA, we first consider whether the PLCB abused its discretion when it approved the interior connection between the restaurant and the grocery store. The parties agree that PLCB regulations contemplate the possibility of the approval of such interior connection between a licensed entity and another business if Regulation 3.52, entitled, “Connection with other business,” is satisfied. This regulation provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[309,930,1104,96]]]'>(a) A licensee may not permit other persons to operate another business on the licensed premises.</blockquote>

Thus, Regulation 3.52 provides that licensees are permitted to operate another business (the grocery store) on the licensed premises (the restaurant), if the PLCB approves through proper exercise of its discretion. This regulation is facially satisfied as Wegmans is operating both the supermarket and restaurant, and the PLCB approved the interior connection between the two businesses. Thus, the only issue before us regarding approval of the interior connection is whether the PLCB abused its discretion when it decided in Wegmans’ favor. Given that the restaurants predate the applications for the liquor license, are vastly larger and more sophisticated than the minimum statutory requirements for restaurants, and easily satisfy every other applicable statutory and regulatory criterion, we are at a loss to discern how the PLCB abused its discretion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

As alluded to <em>supra, </em>the issue in <em>Sheetz </em>was whether the PLCB erred by finding that a convenience store with an area for dining qualified as a “retail dispenser” under Section 102 of the Liquor Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> when it proposed to sell beer exclusively for takeout and prohibited consumption of beer on the premises. The applicant in <em>Sheetz </em>contended that the Liquor Code did not require it to sell beer for consumption on the premises, but merely afforded retail licensees the right to do so. <em>Sheetz </em>did not involve whether the PLCB abused its discretion by granting an interior connection between the convenience store <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>and the purported “eating place.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> In fact, we expressly acknowledged that the propriety of the conditions imposed by the PLCB, which required a permanent partition between the convenience store and the eating place, was not at issue; rather the dispositive fact was that the applicant prohibited on-site consumption of beer and intended to sell beer solely for carry-out purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 1147, n. 4.</p>
    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[274,706,1149,463]]]'>After finding the statutory definition of “retail dispenser” to be ambiguous, we were guided by the canons of statutory construction, and ultimately held that a retail dispenser must sell beer for consumption on the premises for it to be authorized to sell beer for takeout. <em>Id. </em>at 1153.

We further found that such a “momentous transformation” of the beer distribution system should be accomplished by the Legislature, rather than the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 1154.

Of course, this argument requires us to ignore that Wegmans, as we have already concluded, is operating legitimate, fully-functioning restaurants within their grocery stores. This we cannot do. Refusing to acknowledge the validity of these restaurants would violate, rather than vindicate, legislative intent. The legislature has stated clearly that restaurants are entitled to obtain liquor licenses if they satisfy certain criteria, and those criteria are met here. Moreover, we do not view this decision as effectuating a “sea change” in the beer distribution system. Without addressing specific factors, <em>e.g., </em>the type of liquor licenses, or whether they were contested, we observe that licenses have been previously issued to restaurants in shopping malls and department stores, such as Boscov’s, and John Wanamaker’s. While, as stated above, this may foreshadow an expansion of the practice of large businesses opening restaurants within their facilities and seeking liquor licenses for them, given that the present state of the law permits this, it is for the legislature, not this Court, to determine whether to curtail such practice.</p>
