The statutory distinction is intended to more severely punish a burglary which involves an occupied structure or one that could be occupied. The reason for the increased punishment is that burglary of occupied structures increases the risk of injury or death to persons involved. The structure in the instant case was a home under construction.

Moreover, the actual maximum term of incarceration for burglary reflected in Appellant’s judgment of sentence (five years) was well below the statutory maximum for both first- and second-degree felonies.

If the majority acknowledges a building without necessary utilities can be adapted for overnight accommodation, how is it that a fully-enclosed building with water, heat, and electricity cannot be found to be so? While a bright-line rule is inappropriate in this situation, it is not unreasonable for a fact-finder to conclude a building with four walls, a roof, windows, doors, and utilities is adapted for overnight accommodation, even though no one has yet moved in.</p>
