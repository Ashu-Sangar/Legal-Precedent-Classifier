Nevertheless, it finds a fundamental difference between driving while intoxicated prosecutions under the Vehicle Code, where the Commonwealth may be required to establish a specific blood alcohol content, and underage drinking proceedings under the Crimes Code, in which the prosecution merely needs to establish the fact of consumption.

Initially, such equipment is not regulated by Section 1547(c) of the Vehicle Code at all, since the statute carefully distinguishes between evidential quality testing and pre-arrest testing, and Section 1547(c) pertains to the former. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(c). Pre-arrest breath testing is separately governed by Section 1547(k), under which the use of approved equipment expressly is limited to field screening, as an aid to determine probable cause. <em>See id. </em>§ 1547(k) (“The sole purpose of this preliminary breath test is to assist the officer in determining whether or not the person should be placed under arrest.”).</p>

Consequently, the notice indicates that the sole purpose of the device approval is to assist officers in determining probable cause. <em>See </em>Notice, 35 Pa.B. 2694.

Presumably, the common pleas court relied on the arresting officer’s testimony that, to his knowledge, calibration was not required.

Nevertheless — and although we agree with the Commonwealth that the evidential requirements of Section 1547(c) are not directly relevant — it is worth repeating that the Commonwealth’s own position that the Alco-Sensor is an approved device derives from Section 1547. For purposes of responding to the question presented here on the terms on which it is framed, we find that the Commonwealth cannot invoke Section 1547 as support for admissibility (even indirectly) while simultaneously disavowing any obligation of adherence to the requirements of that section.</p>

The Commonwealth may also pursue additional legislative and/or administrative approvals, and these may be respected in the courts to the degree they comport with constitutional norms. What the Commonwealth may not do, however, is to suggest that an expressly limited scheme of statutory and administrative approval extends beyond its own carefully delineated boundaries.</p>

Indeed, the <em>Brigidi </em>panel accepted <em>Allen’s </em>central premise that pre-arrest breath testing is presumptively reliable to discern the presence or absence of alcohol in a suspect’s blood (albeit the panel implemented a calibration requirement). <em>See Brigidi, </em><a href="/a2d/977/1177-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="977 A.2d 1177" data-case-ids="7297720" data-case-paths="/a2d/977/1177-01">977 A.2d at 1182</a>.
