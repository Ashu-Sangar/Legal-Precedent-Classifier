The BRT’s functions would be divided between the new entities: the Office of Property Assessment, which would make initial and revised property assessments, and the Board of Property Assessment Appeals (“Board of Appeals”), which would hear appeals from assessments.

Petitioners claim that the Reorganization Ordinance is invalid, particularly to the extent that the City transferred the BRT’s appellate function to a body appointed by the Mayor and dissolved the BRT in its entirety. According to petitioners, the City’s action has immediate public importance because it “subject[s] the public to the jeopardy of voiding all appeals to [the] replacement Board” and, in the future, would expose the public to “multiple appeals, delay and expense once the [BRT] is restored to its rightful role free from the <em>ultra vires </em>interference of the City.” Petitioners further argue that, unless we act, the new appellate entity will be tainted by legal infirmities, “thereby engendering public confusion and uncertainty, ... denying the due process of law to which the public is entitled, and ultimately eroding the public’s confidence in the processes of government.” Petitioners insist that “the general public’s great interest in mandating the obedience of the City to the supreme statutory and Constitutional law of the Commonwealth” should compel this Court to act now.</p>

The crux of petitioners’ argument is that the BRT’s authority to entertain assessment appeals is recognized in the governing Pennsylvania legislation as a quasi-judicial function separate from the BRT’s administrative or ministerial function of assessing the value of real property in Philadelphia. Citing 53 P.S. <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>§ 13132,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> petitioners contend that the General Assembly delegated to the City the power to reorganize, abolish, or transfer the BRT’s ministerial function of assessing property values but not its authority to review appeals from those assessments.

      <em>Truscott </em>involved a prior attempt by the City to abolish the BRT. This Court invalidated that effort based on a statutory provision which did not specifically address the BRT. The relevant provision — now codified at 53 P.S. § 13132(a) — vested in City Council the power to abolish “the Coroner, Recorder of Deeds, City Treasurer, Clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions, Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery and the Board of Inspectors of the Philadelphia County Prison.” The City viewed this list as non-exclusive and passed an ordinance in August 1954 purporting to abolish the BRT. The Commonwealth, through the Attorney General, filed a complaint in equity in this Court to enjoin the ordinance as a usurpation of the General Assembly’s power, and this Court held that the City’s ordinance indeed was unconstitutional and void. <a href="/citations/?q=111%20A.2d%20136" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="111 A.2d 136">111 A.2d at 141</a>. Similar to the Commonwealth in <em>Truscott, </em>petitioners argue here that, in plain language, the City has no power under Section 13132(c) to abolish the BRT completely or to reassign its appellate function. Petitioners claim that the City’s action to that effect was <em>ultra vires </em>and, therefore, the Reorganization Ordinance is void in that respect. Petitioners further assert that the legislative history of Section 13132(c), including floor debate between the proponent of a BRT-specific amendment to the provision and an opponent of the amendment, fully supports this position.</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[168,1730,1156,523]],["BL_162.1",162,[267,322,1151,616]]]'>Finally, according to petitioners, the City’s action is not a mere violation of governing legislation but also usurps the statutory power of the Judiciary to make appointments to the BRT. Pursuant to 72 P.S. § 5341.2, “all appointments of members of the [BRT] shall be made by a majority of the judges of the courts of common pleas of [Philadelphia C]ounty.” The Reorganization Ordinance eliminates the appointment power of the Judiciary and transfers that power to the City’s executive branch. <em>See </em>Reorganization Ordinance § 2-302(3).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In addition, the Ordinance voids the judicial six-year <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>appointments of the present BRT members. Petitioners argue that both actions infringe on the power of the Judiciary and impugn its legislatively-ordained role, in this instance, as a co-equal branch. Furthermore, petitioners claim that the General Assembly expressed its clear intent that judicial involvement in the appointment of BRT members was warranted. According to petitioners, the transfer of the appointment power is a departure from that express intent and undermines the “element of independence” which the Legislature sought to ensure respecting the BRT’s appellate role by providing for judicial, rather than political, appointment of its members.</p>

The first objection amounts to a procedural matter. The City asserts that the BRT and its members acting in their official capacities must be stricken as parties to this lawsuit because, as a city agency and city officials, they are prohibited (1) from filing a legal action with private representation, pursuant to the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, 351 Pa.Code §§ 4.4-400 and 8.8-410, and/or (2) from filing a legal action without adequate ratification under the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S. § 708.

    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.6",163,[160,1148,1154,1220]],["BL_164.1",164,[273,315,1151,572]]]'>The second objection is in the nature of a demurrer. The City argues that the General Assembly authorized Philadelphia’s City Council to abolish the BRT completely, without any reservation of authority over the BRT’s “appellate function.” The City claims that the reference in Section 13132(c) to the “making of assessments” is a description of the BRT’s entire role, from its initial valuation process to its appellate review of assessments. In support of this argument, the City finds evidence in 72 P.S. § 5020-518.1 that the General Assembly uses the term “assessments” as a generic term for the entire administrative process, including the appeal function of the BRT. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 5020-518.1 (provision titled “Appeal to court from assessments” allows property owner to appeal BRT’s appellate decision to court of common pleas). The City also adverts to other legislation and court decisions that likewise utilize the term “assessment” to mean both the initial valuation stage and the appellate stage of the BRT’s function. <em>See, e.g., </em>72 P.S. § 5341.14 (describing procedure for administrative appeal to BRT); 53 P.S. § 13133(a)(9) (city shall not enlarge or limit powers granted by acts of General Assembly that provide “for the assessment of real or personal property and persons for taxation purposes”); <em>Appeals of Mathies Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/435/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="435 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1924223" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0129-01">435 Pa. 129</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=255%20A.2d%20906" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="255 A.2d 906">255 A.2d 906</a> (1969) (referring to BRT’s <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>appellate decision as “a tax-assessment”); <em>Appeal of Rieck Ice Cream Co., </em><a href="/pa/417/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="417 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="1893957" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0249-01">417 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=209%20A.2d%20383" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="209 A.2d 383">209 A.2d 383</a> (1965) (same). Indeed, the City argues, when a court wishes to distinguish between an initial assessment and the BRT’s final assessment after administrative appeal, it refers to the two stages in those terms, recognizing that “assessment” refers to the entire process. <em>See, e.g., Deitch Co. v. Bd. of Prop. Assessment, </em><a href="/pa/417/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="417 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1893987" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0213-01">417 Pa. 213</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=209%20A.2d%20397" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="209 A.2d 397">209 A.2d 397</a> (1965). As a final argument, the City postulates that, given its power to abolish the BRT, it would be “an odd choice” if the City were only authorized to “abolish” the BRT in part.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[268,912,1154,787]]]'>The City also responds to petitioners’ claim that the General Assembly deliberately intended to preserve the appellate function of the BRT because of its kinship with the judicial process. According to the City, the BRT’s appellate role “is not particularly judicial in nature” given that its factual findings are subject to review <em>de novo </em>by the court of common pleas. Further, the City argues that judicial appointment of BRT’s members is not a prerequisite to preserving any quasi-judicial nature of the BRT, given that other boards, like zoning boards for example, are appointed by local city councils. According to the City, petitioners have not demonstrated “any particularly important” non-textual reason “to preserve the court appointment aspect of the BRT’s appellate function, while simultaneously allowing the elimination of the court appointment function of the BRT’s initial valuation function.”</p>

This is not a garden variety dispute, but a case having its genesis in the City’s decision to revamp the existing agency performing property assessments. It is of interest not only to the BRT’s members, who face elimination of their roles, but also to the City, to all City property tax payers, and to the Judiciary, whose appointment power is alleged to have been eliminated. It is in the public’s interest that a prompt and final determination be rendered on the issue of whether the BRT (or the new Board of Appeals) will perform the BRT’s current appellate function so as to maintain continuity and a working system of local taxation and revenue collection in the City. A clear final ruling before the Reorganization Ordinance would come into effect in October 2010 will insulate the decisions of the local agency performing the appeal function from collateral attack and provide a surer prospect of finality to parties in appeals from assessments.

The City responds that it has authority pursuant to subsection (c) to reassign all of the BRT’s present tasks to the newly-created entities and to abolish the BRT in its entirety. The City’s view is based on the proposition that the term “making of assessments,” as used in Section 13132(c), includes both the BRT’s ministerial and adjudicative duties. After review, we conclude that the City’s interpretation is not supported by the plain language of the statute and we find that the Reorganization Ordinance is invalid in part. Pursuant to the plain language of Section 13132(c), Philadelphia City Council has unqualified authority over the local offices of Sheriff, City Commissioner, and Registration Commission, including the power to abolish them. In contrast, the General Assembly singles out one entity, the BRT, and qualifies the delegation of power to City Council. The power conveyed is only “with respect to the making of assessments of real and personal property as provided by act of Assembly.” Petitioners’ interpretation reflects this significant, but curtailed, grant of power and gives effect to the actual language of the entire provision. By comparison, the City’s interpretation and construction of Section 13132(c) is that the qualifier comprises the entirety of the BRT’s function. But if that were so, the qualifier would be entirely superfluous. In limiting the delegated power only to that part of the BRT’s function which involves “the making of real and personal property assessments,” the General Assembly obviously contemplated that it was preserving some other part of the BRT’s function.</p>

Via the Home Rule Act, the General Assembly empowered the City to adopt a home rule charter and delegated certain of its legislative powers to City Council. <em>See generally </em>53 P.S. § 13132(a)-(d).

    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[265,741,1152,1440]]]'>The scope of the permanent injunction is limited, as we agree with the City that the offending portions of the Reorganization Ordinance are severable. Although petitioners do not address the issue of severability directly, they do concede that the Reorganization Ordinance is valid insofar as it reassigns the function of making assessments to the newly-formed Office of Property Assessment. “[T]he severance principle has its roots in a jurisprudential doctrine ... and the standard itself reflects the experience of the common law.” <em>Stilp, </em><a href="/pa/588/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="905 A.2d 918" data-case-ids="3787763,8472059" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0539-01,/a2d/905/0918-01">905 A.2d at 972</a>. Generally, if the provision of a statute — or, as here, an ordinance — is found invalid, the remainder of the legislative act will not be affected by the invalidity unless we find that the valid provisions “are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision” that it cannot be presumed that the legislating body “would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.” <em><a href="/pa/588/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="905 A.2d 918" data-case-ids="3787763,8472059" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0539-01,/a2d/905/0918-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/588/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="905 A.2d 918" data-case-ids="3787763,8472059" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0539-01,/a2d/905/0918-01">at 970</a> (quoting 1 Pa.C.S. § 1925). Here, the provisions creating the Office of Property Assessment and separating its functions from the BRT stand independently, are complete, and are capable of being placed into effect in accordance with the intent of City Council and the Philadelphia electorate, which ratified them.

They also claim that the City’s action flouted the Pennsylvania Constitution and this Court’s recent decision prohibiting municipalities from diminishing the “salary or emoluments” of public officials after their appointment. <em>See </em>Pa.

Petitioners also insist that no <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>action at law for damages exists that would remedy the City’s unconstitutional conduct and remove the stigma placed on the City by its unconstitutional ordinance.

In the City’s view, the Salary Ordinance dispute is individual to petitioners and should proceed in the normal course, beginning with factual and legal determinations by the court of common pleas. The City notes that it may raise fact-bound issues in response to petitioners’ claim, serve discovery, and file a counterclaim, all of which are “more appropriate for resolution in a trial court.”</p>
    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.6",180,[273,1087,1150,944]]]'>We agree with the City that this matter is more properly relegated to the court of common pleas in the first instance. The parties’ dispute over the propriety of reducing BRT members’ salaries, while important, does not require accelerated review by this Court out of the ordinary course, nor are petitioners’ arguments regarding the public importance of the issue they present particularly compelling, such that exercise of this Court’s extraordinary jurisdiction would be appropriate. <em>See Vaccone v.

Quoting <em>McCormick, </em><a href="/pa/522/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="522 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="1818927" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0520-01">564 A.2d at </a>910 n. 1, the City argues that "what is said in debate, the remarks and understanding of individual legislators, is not relevant in ascertaining the meaning of a statute.” The Statutory Construction Act, however, specifically authorizes consideration of legislative history when construction of a statute, beyond its plain language, is required. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(7). Notably, the observation in <em>McCormick </em>was not offered in the course of statutory construction following a finding of ambiguity, but instead, in the course of what appears to have been a plain language analysis. In that analysis, the Court merely rejected the appellants’ reliance on "the remarks of one member of the House of Representatives speaking in support of the Act [under review].” <em>McCormick, supra. </em>Although lawmakers’ statements during debate are generally not dispositive of legislative intent, especially where they serve to challenge the plain language of the statute as enacted, <em>see, e.g., Martin v.

Respecting the BRT's additional claim that the City’s action was in violation of separation of powers principles, we note that, although the more common scenario involving separation of powers involves tension between an Act of the General Assembly or an action of the Commonwealth executive branch and the powers of the Judiciary, this Court has recognized that separation of powers tension may also arise in disputes involving county authorities and the local judiciary. <em>See, e.g., Jefferson County Court Appointed Employees Ass’n v. Pa. Labor Rels. Bd., </em><a href="/pa/603/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="603 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="4196076" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0482-01">603 Pa. 482</a>, <a href="/pa/603/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="985 A.2d 697" data-case-ids="4196076,7292464" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0482-01,/a2d/985/0697-01">985 A.2d 697</a>, 701 n. 3, 706 (2009) (county commissioners' board, acting in its legislative capacity, encroached on Judiciary's authority to hire, fire, and supervise its employees in directing Judiciary to eliminate five trial court employee positions). The tension implicated here, however, is further removed in that the judicial power implicated was delegated by the General Assembly to the local judiciary and is not inherently a judicial function. Indeed, the local judiciary retains a <em>de novo </em>appellate function following the completion of the assessment process. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 5020-518.1; 42 Pa.C.S. § 933(a)(2) (relating to appeals from local government agencies). Thus, the primary tension is not so much separation of powers as a tension between the local legislative action and the state legislative delegation of power. We offer these observations merely to provide context to the BRT’s argument. We need not reach the merits of the separation of powers claim in light of our disposition premised upon the statute itself.</p>
