In 1963, Crown Cork paid $7 million to purchase a majority of stock in rival bottle-cap manufacturer, Mundet Cork Corporation. Prior to Crown Cork’s purchase of Mundet, a small division of Mundet had manufactured products containing asbestos. While the division had ceased manufacturing asbestos products prior to Crown Cork gaining majority control of Mundet, the division still existed at the time of purchase. Ninety days after Crown Cork’s acquisition of Mundet, the prior asbestos producing division was sold. Subsequently, and for reasons immaterial <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>to this appeal, Crown Cork merged Mundet into itself, thus creating a single corporate entity.

Ken R. filed suit on his daughter’s behalf, seeking a visitation order allowing C.R. to spend time with her half-sisters. The lower courts determined that C.R. did not have standing to seek visitation with her siblings, and this Court agreed. Specifically, the Court determined that the public policy of visitation, as stated in 23 Pa.C.S. § 5301, is the assurance of reasonable and continued contact between children and their parents and grandparents after a separation and divorce of a marriage. <em>Ken.

Thus, the invocation of Section 1929.1 by Crown Cork has aggrieved them, such that standing is present. Moreover, the ability of Plaintiffs to recover from other manufacturers is of no concern within the instant analysis. We thus reverse the order of the Superior Court, which had affirmed the trial courts’ grants of summary judgment.
