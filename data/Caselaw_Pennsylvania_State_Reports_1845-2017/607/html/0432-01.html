Payday lending is a consumer lending practice in which a lender offers consumers high-rate, short-term loans secured by either a post-dated check or a debit authorization from a bank. These post-dated checks or debit authorizations become payable to the lender at the end of the loan term, usually set at two weeks to coincide with the borrower’s payday. <em>Pa. Dep’t of Banking v. NCAS of Del., LLC, </em><a href="/pa/596/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="596 Pa. 638" data-case-ids="4088824" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0638-01">596 Pa. 638</a>, <a href="/pa/596/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="948 A.2d 752" data-case-ids="4088824,8245742" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0638-01,/a2d/948/0752-01">948 A.2d 752</a>, 754 (2008).

Indeed, Cash America earned approximately $10 million annually by making payday loans over the Internet to Pennsylvania residents in amounts of the lesser of 25% of the borrower’s gross monthly income or $750. Cash America assesses a finance charge of 25% of the amount borrowed. The annual percentage rate (APR) of the loans offered by Cash America are as follows: for an eight day term, 1140.63%; for a fourteen day term, 651.79%; for a thirty-five day term, 260.71%. Cash America has not obtained a license from the Department for its lending to Pennsylvania residents. If Cash America were licensed, it would not be permitted under Pennsylvania law to charge residents such high interest rates.</p>

If it is not licensed, it is bound by the 6% cap imposed by the LIPL. The issue presented herein is how Cash America, which is not licensed under the CDCA and does not wish to be licensed, fits into this scheme. Cash America argues that it is exempt because it operates outside without personnel in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[261,706,1150,1366]]]'>The Secretary of Banking (Secretary) and the Department had, until recently, agreed with Cash America. Until July 26, 2008, the Department did not impose the LIPL’s general 6% interest rate or the CDCA to out-of-state lenders. Before then, the Department had interpreted the phrase “in this Commonwealth” in Section 3.A of the CDCA not to apply to entities without any offices or employees physically present in the Commonwealth, such as Cash America. Under the prior interpretation, articulated in a series of interpretive letters, such an entity would not be required to obtain a license under the CDCA to originate consumer loans by means of the Internet or mail to residents of the Commonwealth with charges exceeding 6% simple interest per annum, provided that the entity was licensed or otherwise authorized under its home state law to engage in this type of lending activity. With the rise of Internet-based lending activity, however, it became clear to the Department that its prior position had “resulted in Pennsylvania consumers being exposed to the very lending practices that the CDCA was enacted to protect them from,” <em>ie., </em>lending at high interest rates by non-licensed entities. <a href="/citations/?q=38%20Pa.%20Bull.%203986" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="38 Pa.

It sought to have the Notice declared unlawful and to enjoin Appellees from implementing or enforcing it. It averred that it is a limited liability company existing under the laws of Delaware and qualified to do business in Nevada; it has no personnel or office physically located in Pennsylvania; and licensure under the CDCA was not possible for Cash America because Pennsylvania law requires that a licensed lender be a Pennsylvania business corporation. <em>See 7 </em>P.S. § 6203.A; 7 P.S. § 6207 (“A license under the provisions of this act shall be issued only to a corporation organized <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>under the Business Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”).</p>

Additionally, Cash America sought a declaration that the implementation and enforcement of the Notice constituted unpromulgated rulemaking in violation of Pennsylvania law, entitling Cash America to an injunction against enforcement until the Department complied with requirements for promulgating a new regulation.

In its counterclaim, the Department asserted that because Cash America was not <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>licensed under the CDCA, it was prohibited from charging interest and fees that aggregate in excess of 6%, pursuant to Section 201 of the LIPL, 41 P.S. § 201, and that its lending practices violated both the LIPL and the CDCA.

In resolving the issues presented, we are guided by the settled principles set forth in the Statutory Construction Act, including the primary maxim that the object of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). In pursuing that end, we are mindful that “when the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). As a general rule, therefore, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain language of a statute. <em>Malt Beverages, </em><a href="/pa/601/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="974 A.2d 1144" data-case-ids="4195611,4195672,4195704,7297630,7297654,7297702" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0448-01,/pa/601/0448-02,/pa/601/0449-01,/a2d/974/1144-01,/a2d/974/1144-02,/a2d/974/1144-03">974 A.2d at 1149</a>; <em>Shiffler, </em><a href="/pa/583/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="879 A.2d 185" data-case-ids="687746,8933265" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0478-01,/a2d/879/0185-01">879 A.2d at 189</a>. Reading the plain statutory language, “words and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage,” while any words or phrases that have acquired a “peculiar and appropriate meaning” must be construed according to that meaning. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). It is only when “the words of the statute are not explicit” on the point at issue that resort to statutory construction is appropriate. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c); <em>Malt Beverages, </em><a href="/pa/601/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="974 A.2d 1144" data-case-ids="4195611,4195672,4195704,7297630,7297654,7297702" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0448-01,/pa/601/0448-02,/pa/601/0449-01,/a2d/974/1144-01,/a2d/974/1144-02,/a2d/974/1144-03">974 A.2d at 1149</a>.

Moreover, Cash America observes that if the General Assembly intended to extend the CDCA to lenders without a physical presence in Pennsylvania, it knew how to accomplish this result, as it has demonstrated in other, unrelated statutes. <em>See, e.g., </em>the Pennsylvania Goods and Services Installment Sales Act, 69 P.S. § 1103 (applying the act to offers or agreements made in Pennsylvania to Pennsylvania buyers, “regardless of the situs of the contract as specified therein”).</p>

Given this jurisprudence, Cash America maintains that the General Assembly properly limited the scope of the CDCA to intrastate commerce. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3) (“the General Assembly does not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States”). Although Cash America acknowledges that Commerce Clause jurisprudence has evolved since 1937 to permit the General Assembly to require licensure of lenders located outside of the state, it asserts that this evolving jurisprudence is not relevant to our consideration of the General Assembly’s intent in 1937. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The Department argues that the rules of grammar support the Commonwealth Court’s construction of Section 3.A. Specifically, the Department argues that a plain reading of Section 3.A reveals- that it is unlawful for any unlicensed person to engage in the Commonwealth in the business of making loans of $25,000 or less and charge interest and fees that exceed the 6% interest cap imposed by the LIPL, and Section 3.A includes those who may not engage in the Commonwealth in the proscribed lending practice to include per<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>sonnel, specifically, a “principal, employe, agent, or broker.” The Department asserts that by explaining that a person cannot lawfully operate under the CDCA as a principal, employee, agent or broker, the statute specifies that it is applicable to more than simply a principal. According to this argument, the fact that the phrase “either as principal, employe, agent or broker” is set off by commas indicates that it is nonrestrictive in nature, <em>i.e., </em>it contains non-essential information and can be removed without changing the sentence’s basic meaning.</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[169,867,1152,845]]]'>The Department also points to Sections 3.B and 11 of the CDCA, which each define when a person is engaged in business covered by the Act. 7 P.S. § 6203.B (providing that a person “shall be deemed to be engaged in the business contemplated by this act” where that person either “hold[s] himself out as willing or able to arrange for or negotiate” loans of $25,000 or less for which interest and other consideration aggregates in excess of 6% annual simple interest or “solicits prospective borrowers of such loans.”); 7 P.S. § 6211 (“[a] person, who is not licensed under this act, shall be presumed to be engaged in business contemplated by this act if he advertises or solicits business as principal, agent or broker for which a license is required by the provisions of this act.”).

Specifically, the Department argues that the remedial purpose of the CDCA is to protect Pennsylvanians from extortionist interest rates, <em>see Equitable Credit &amp; Disc. Co. v.

As a remedial statute, according to the Department, the CDCA should be construed against the lender. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(c) (providing that “provisions of a statute shall be liberally construed to effect their objects and to promote justice”).

Specifically, the 1937 Report of the Secretary of Banking (1937 Report) that became the basis for the CDCA discussed the hazards of solicitations from lenders by newspaper advertisements, which the Department analogizes to Internet solicitations. Moreover, the Department argues it is not clear, as Cash America would have it, that the Commerce Clause as interpreted when the CDCA was originally enacted would have prohibited the General Assembly from requiring licensure of out-of-state lenders.

The Department argues that it does not enforce either of these requirements in a manner violative of the Commerce Clause. According to the Department, it interprets the requirement that a licensee be a domestic business corporation in a manner that avoids a conflict with the Commerce Clause by granting licenses to both domestic and foreign business corporations and limited liability companies. Similarly, “it is the position of the Department that [a foreign entity] is not required to maintain a principal place of business or any other physical location in <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>Pennsylvania in order to become licensed under the CDCA.” R.R. 184a (Interpretive letter of the Department dated December 18, 2008); Department’s brief at 43.</p>

This argument was based on the Department’s application of the CDCA to out-of-state lenders with no personnel or office in Pennsylvania in conjunction with its position, set forth in an interpretive letter, that a CDCA licensee must maintain its principal place of business in Pennsylvania. The Department rescinded the latter position by interpretive letter, which the parties agree effectively mooted Cash America's Commerce Clause argument.</p>

Cash America relies on the Statutory Construction Act to argue that we cannot rely on the placement of commas because the CDCA was originally enacted in 1937. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1923(b) ("In no case shall the punctuation of a statute control or affect the intention of the General Assembly in the enactment thereof but punctuation may be used to aid in the construction thereof if the statute was finally enacted after December 31, 1964.”). Section 3.A has, however, been amended five times since December 31, 1964. <em>See </em>Act of Dec. 30, 1970, P.L. 959, No. 301, § 2; Act of March 3, 1976, P.L. 36, No. 17, § 1; Act of Dec. 18, 1984, P.L. 1083, No. 216, § 2; Act of Dec. 12, 1994, P.L. 1060, No. 144, § 1; Act of July 12, 1996, P.L. 490, No. 80, § 1.

That Cash America is not interested in doing business in Pennsylvania on a level playing field with Pennsylvania corporations is born out by the record before us. For example, in its brief, it states that "payday lending is not economically viable under the interest rate restrictions imposed by the CDCA.” Appellant's brief at 14. Additionally, it explained to the Commonwealth Court that the company will lose money if it makes loans that comply with the CDCA, and it would rather stop making loans in Pennsylvania than try to obtain a license.

In a circular, nebulous argument, Cash America argues that, based on its interpretation of the CDCA, it is exempt it from licensing requirements and regulation because it is not located in Pennsylvania. Because of this purported exemption, according to Cash America, the LIPL’s 6% simple interest cap, <em>see </em>41 P.S. § 201, does not apply to it. In support of this argument, Cash America relies on Section 604 of the LIPL, which provides that the simple interest cap does not apply where it is inconsistent with the interest permitted by any other act, including the CDCA. 41 P.S. § 604. According to Cash America, therefore, it is entitled to originate consumer loans over the Internet to Pennsylvania residents with no limit on the maximum interest rate it may charge.</p>
      <p id="b499-8" data-blocks='[["BL_499.9",499,[200,1978,1117,390]]]'>Cash America’s interpretation of the LIPL is premised on its flawed interpretation of the CDCA. Therefore, for the same reasons that we reject Cash America’s interpretation of the CDCA, we likewise reject this argument. Section 201 of the LIPL provides that the maximum interest rate that a lender may lawfully charge for a loan in the amount of $50,000 or less is 6% per year unless another Pennsylvania law, such as the CDCA, authorizes a higher interest rate. Because no Pennsylvania or federal law authorizes Cash America to charge Pennsylvania residents the rates of interest connected to its loans, it is violating the default maximum interest rate provided by the LIPL.</p>
