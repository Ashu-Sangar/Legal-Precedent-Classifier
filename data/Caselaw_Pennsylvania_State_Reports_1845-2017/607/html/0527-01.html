A regulation promulgated by Appellee, Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (the “Department”), defines “domestic services” as “[w]ork in or about a private dwelling for an employer in his capacity as a householder, as distinguished from work in or about a private dwelling for such employer in the employer’s pursuit of a trade, occupation, profession, enterprise or vocation.” <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20231.1" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="34 Pa. Code § 231.1">34 Pa. Code § 231.1</a>(b). In this direct appeal, we consider initially the doctrines of ripeness and exhaustion of administrative remedies to determine whether this matter is justiciable. We then address the issues of whether the Department’s application of its regulation is reasonable and whether a third-party agency employer may benefit from the “domestic services” exemption from the Act’s overtime requirements. For the reasons that follow, we determine this matter is justiciable, uphold the Department’s regulation, and conclude that a third-party agency employer does not qualify for the domestic services exemption, and, therefore, must pay its employees overtime. Thus, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

(“Bayada”) is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal office located in Moorestown, <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>New Jersey. Bayada has approximately 38 offices and employs over 1,000 individuals in the Commonwealth. It offers home care services, ranging from skilled nursing and personal care to rehabilitation and therapy for pediatric, adult, and geriatric clients. In order to provide these services, Bayada employs licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, and home health care aides (“aides”). Bayada’s aides, who are the focus of this litigation, assist their clients in performing activities associated with daily living and provide general companionship. Bayada pays these aides an hourly rate, with each hour of service billed to the client. Bayada, however, does not pay its aides overtime.</p>
    <p id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[259,970,1150,1060]]]'>On September 27, 2005, the Department notified Bayada that an audit of its payroll records would be conducted based on information “that possible discrepancies <em>may </em>exist in the manner payment is made to [Bayada’s] employees "with regard to the Minimum Wage and Overtime Law.” Letter, 9/27/2005 (Exhibit B to Petition for Review) (emphasis in original). The Department requested Bayada to examine payroll records for a period of two years with regard to compliance with the Act, and to compile any information in audit format. <em><a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20231.1" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 Pa. Code § 231.1">Id.</a> </em>The focus of the Department’s inquiry related to Bayada’s payment of overtime to its aides. The Department took the position that, pursuant to its regulation, Bayada was not entitled to the domestic services exemption from overtime requirements. In January 2006, Bayada responded to the Department’s request, claiming that it was entitled to the domestic services exemption, and, after additional meetings, and further correspondence between the parties, the Department notified Bayada on March 22, 2007 that the audit would proceed. Evidently, to date, however, the Department has not audited Bayada.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.6",578,[258,2054,1150,308]],["BL_579.1",579,[172,325,1150,880]]]'>On October 2, 2007, Bayada filed a petition for review in the nature of a complaint for declaratory judgment in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. In its petition, Bayada challenged the validity of the Department’s regulation which, according to Bayada, improperly limited the application of the domestic services exemption set forth in the Act. <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>Specifically, Bayada maintained that the Act makes no distinction between domestic services provided to a householder by a direct and sole employee of the householder and domestic services provided to a householder by employees of a home health care agency (or third party) at the request of the householder. According to Bayada, the language of the Act is consistent with the same exemption provided in the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which does not prohibit an exemption for agency employment. Bayada contended the two statutes should be interpreted <em>in pari materia, </em>and that the federal approach should govern, permitting agency employers to benefit from the domestic services exemption. Therefore, Bayada asserted that the Department’s regulation does not reflect a reasonable interpretation of the Act and that it is void to the extent it denies third party agency employers, such as Bayada, the benefit of the domestic services exemption.</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[169,1237,1154,728]]]'>Furthermore, Bayada argued the Department’s regulation prohibits recognition of a joint employer relationship. Specifically, Bayada submits that its clients control its aides. As its aides are “under the total discretion and control of the client while performing services in the client’s home,” the client is a joint employer with Bayada. Petition for Review at 17, ¶ 73. As a joint employer, Bayada asserted it should enjoy the benefit of the exemption. Moreover, Bayada offered the policy concern that, if the regulation is enforced, thus denying agency employers the domestic services exemption, the cost of such services will increase and clients will be forced either to reduce the number of hours of service the clients will receive or use additional aides “in their homes at great inconvenience, hardship and burden.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20231.1" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="34 Pa.

    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[277,459,1150,741]]]'>On November 2, 2007, the Department filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, based upon the legal insufficiency of the pleading. Pa.R.Civ.P. 1028(a)(4). Specifically, the Department contended Bayada’s petition contained no specific allegation that the Department’s regulation was illegal, that the Department lacked the authority to issue the regulation, or that any illegality existed in the regulatory promulgation process. Moreover, the Department urged that its regulation was consistent with, and a reasonable and proper interpretation of, the Act; and that the Pennsylvania legislature and the Department are not bound by the FLSA and may impose stricter requirements than those found under the federal statute. Thus, the Department requested the Commonwealth Court to grant its demurrer.</p>

Applying principles of statutory construction, the court found that the regulation tracked the meaning of the Act’s domestic services exemption and was reasonable. The court also rejected Bayada’s argument that the domestic services exemption in the Act should be construed <em>in pan materia </em>with the FLSA, which would allow third-party agency employers to benefit from the exemption for employees, finding the domestic services exemptions under the Act and the FLSA to be substantially different, and that the FLSA did not preempt state regulation of wages and overtime if the state’s standards are more beneficial to workers. Finally, the court rebuffed Bayada’s assertion that its household clients were “joint employers,” reasoning that, even taking as true all of Bayada’s allegations regarding its clients’ right to control the aides, Bayada failed to demonstrate the requisite control necessary to find a joint employer situation. Thus, the Commonwealth Court sustained the Department’s preliminary ob<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>jections in the nature of a demurrer and dismissed Bayada’s petition for review.</p>

More specifically, the dissenters opined that Bayada had suffered no injury, as no audit has taken place, and no fees have been assessed against it. Thus, the dissenters concluded the matter was not ripe for review. Related thereto, according to the dissenters, an administrative remedy was available, and, because Bayada failed to utilize such remedy, they believed the proper disposition of the matter was the dismissal of Bayada’s petition for review. The dissenters acknowledged the exception to the requirement of the exhaustion of administrative remedies articulated in <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>noting a preenforcement challenge to a regulation was approved therein because the effect of the challenged regulation was direct and immediate and a lengthy administrative process would result in ongoing uncertainty in the day-to-day business operations of the industry. Yet, finding the regulation challenged by Bayada was adopted in 1977, the dissenters reasoned a regulation of such vintage could not cause the requisite “ongoing uncertainty in the day to day business operations” required for the exception to apply. <em>Arsenal Coal, </em><a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">505 Pa. at 210</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">477 A.2d at 1340</a>.

Specifically, Bayada refutes the dissenting judges’ reasoning by first pointing to the Declaratory Judgment Act and noting that it extends to the Commonwealth Court the authority to “declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7532. Bayada offers that it initiated its action in the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction without advancing its challenge through an administrative proceeding, two years after the Department’s initial notice of its intent to audit Bayada’s payroll records and its then-recent change in its interpretation and application of the regulation. As the Department had not commenced enforcement proceedings in the ensuing two years, and apparently has not instituted proceedings against Bayada to date, Bayada asserts that it had no other choice but to bring a pre-enforcement challenge in the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Furthermore, Bayada asserts the uncertainty of the Department’s new interpretation, by which it has taken the position that agency employers, such as Bayada, must pay overtime to aides, is direct and immediate. Bayada emphasizes it had only two options: (1) continue operations ignoring the Department’s new interpretation and risk penalties and fines; or (2) comply with what it believed to be the Department’s erroneous interpretation and await judicial determination in subsequent litigation.

    <p id="b589-6" data-blocks='[["BL_589.7",589,[172,1517,1152,843]],["BL_590.1",590,[264,326,1150,420]]]'>Bayada argues that the Act exempts from its minimum wage and overtime regulations employment for domestic services in or about the private home of the employer. 43 P.S. § 333.105(a)(2). Bayada notes that, in 1977, the Department promulgated a regulation defining domestic services as work in and about a private dwelling for an employer in his capacity as a householder, as distinguished from work in or about a private dwelling for such employer in the employer’s pursuit of a trade, occupation, profession, enterprise or vocation. Bayada asserts the identity of the employer is not relevant under the Act, contending the domestic services exemption is occupational in nature. According to Bayada, the exemption is applicable so long as the domestic services are performed for an employer in or about his or her private home in such employer’s capacity as a householder. Bayada maintains the Department’s opposition to the application of the domestic <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>services exemption is premised upon its contention that Bayada, and not its householder client, is the sole employer for purposes of the Act. According to Bayada, the Department’s position ignores the possibility of joint employment which, Bayada contends, is in direct conflict with the broad definition of employer under the Act, the Department’s own regulation, and the common law of Pennsylvania, which contemplates joint employment.</p>
    <p id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[262,786,1151,788]]]'>More specifically, Bayada argues that its householder clients share the key attributes of an employer within the statutory definition of the Act and under the common law economic realities test. Bayada offers that its householder clients (1) select and approve the individual employee who will be allowed into the client’s home; (2) set the employee’s hours of work; (3) control all aspects of the services provided in the home; and (4) retain the right to terminate the relationship. Thus, Bayada argues, its aides are jointly employed by Bayada and its householder clients. While Bayada submits the economic realities test, used to determine employer status, was satisfied in this matter, it suggests it is not the appropriate test. Rather, Bayada advocates that the borrowed servant doctrine is applicable to the circumstances in the present matter.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.6",590,[262,1625,1150,742]]]'>From this, Bayada extrapolates that, having established that the domestic services are provided in the home of Bayada’s householder clients, as employers, the householder clients may benefit from the domestic services exemption, and, that the exemption applies to Bayada as well. Again, Bayada urges that the domestic services exemption is an occupational-based exemption, not dependent upon the identity of the employer. Likewise, due to the broad definition of employer, which includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to the employee, 43 P.S. § 333.103(g), Bayada contends it qualifies as an employer of the aides because it acts directly or indirectly in the interests of Bayada’s householder clients in relation to the aides as employees.</p>

      <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>Related thereto, Bayada also argues that the Department concluded erroneously that only a householder employer is entitled to an exemption. According to Bayada, the Department’s approach would deny Bayada, as a joint employer, the exemption, which would conflict with the definition of employer, which includes those acting directly or indirectly in relation to any employee. Moreover, Bayada argues that no deference should be given to the Department’s interpretation of the Act, because, here, the regulation is inconsistent with the statute itself. Finally, Bayada maintains that not permitting the exemption will harm those whom least can afford it. Bayada’s householder clients are billed for each hour of service provided by an aide. The rate includes the aide’s hourly rate of pay, and an additional amount to cover workers’ compensation, insurance, taxes, and Bayada’s overhead. According to Bayada, paying its aides overtime will directly impact (and increase) the amount Bayada charges its clients and may make the use of aides cost prohibitive. Bayada concludes that an increase in costs due to paying its aides overtime would “lead to less services being provided for Bayada’s clients in financial distress and, in some cases, could lead to institutional care.” Bayada Brief at 52.</p>

Specifically, Bayada avers the FLSA exempts from federal minimum wage and overtime provisions employment in domestic services in the homes of clients employed by third-party agencies. Section 213(a)(15) of the FLSA exempts “any employee ... employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals who (because of age or infirmity) are unable to care for themselves (as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Secretary).” <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 213">29 U.S.C. § 213</a>(a)(15).

Furthermore, Bayada offers <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>the DOL concluded that agency employment satisfies the exemption, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20552.109" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="29 C.F.R. § 552.109">29 C.F.R. § 552.109</a>(a), and that this regulation was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.</p>

Bayada concludes that the Department should interpret the language in the Act consistently with this occupation-based focus. Further, Bayada rejects the Department’s position that the Act’s “domestic services exemption” may be more stringent than the FLSA’s exemption.</p>

Specifically, Bayada develops that they presented two related arguments before the court: (1) whether the regulation was unreasonable as applied, such that agency employers, like Bayada, were excluded from the exemption’s benefits and protections in circumstances where the agency employer was jointly employing aides in concert with its householder clients; and (2) whether Bayada was in fact entitled to the exemption under a plain reading of the Act and the regulation to the extent it was jointly employing the aides in concert with its householder clients. Thus, Bayada maintains there is a controlling factual issue and the Commonwealth Court inappropriately made the factual determination that Bayada failed to demonstrate control by its household clients over the work of the aides. This, according to Bayada, is in spite of its allegation in its petition that “[Bayada’s] clients have the right to select their [aides]; control the [aides’] hours of employment; direct and supervise the [aides’] tasks and activities during the workday; as well as to request the services of a new or alternative [aide]. In sum, the [aide] is under the total direction and control of the client while performing services in the client’s home.” Petition for Review at 17, ¶ 78. Therefore, Bayada asserts it was inappropriate for the Commonwealth Court to conclude that the allegations failed to demonstrate the requisite control by the <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>householder clients over the work performance of the aides. Rather, it contends its assertion regarding the control exercised by the clients is an issue of fact which should not have been addressed by the court at this stage. Bayada contends that “it appears” the Commonwealth Court concluded Bayada would be entitled to the domestic services exemption if it could establish control on the part of the householder client sufficient to give rise to a joint employment relationship.

Moreover, the Department argues that Bayada could not proffer any facts that would change its status to that of a joint employer. According to the Department, even taking all of Bayada’s averments as true — that Bayada is responsible for paying the wages to its employees who perform services for its clients who are aged and infirm; pays its aides an hourly rate with each hour of service being billed to its client; screens the aides, conducts criminal background and reference checks; bills its clients for the aides’ hourly rate of pay; and adds amounts in the billing for workers’ compensation, insurance, taxes, as well as Bayada’s overhead — Bayada cannot fall within the statutory or regulatory meaning of domestic services, regardless of whether or not a “joint employment” relationship exists.</p>

According to Amici, the current shortage of such workers is exacerbated by the lack of competitive wages and the demanding nature of the work.

As noted above, since Bayada makes no factual allegation that it employs its aides in its capacity as a householder, Bayada cannot fall within the plain meaning of the statute or the regulation, regardless of whether a joint-employer relationship can be established. Thus, because Bayada failed to set forth a legally cognizable claim for relief, remand for factual development would be inappropriate. Likewise, a court is not required to permit amendment of a pleading if a party is unable to state a claim on which relief could be granted. <em>Werner v.

This is also why Bayada's argument that, because it falls within the broad definition of "employer” as defined in the Act, it is entitled to the domestic services exemption as a joint employer with its householder clients, misses the mark. While the Act’s definition of "employer” is broad, 43 P.S. § 333.103(g) (defining employer as including "any individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, or any person or group of persons, acting, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer in relations to an employee”), for an individual to qualify for the limited domestic services exemption, and for an employer to be exempted from complying with the otherwise mandatory overtime provisions of the Act, the individual must be working about the private home of the employer, i.e., the employer must be the householder in whose house the individual works. The issue before us is the scope of the domestic services exemption, and, by its terms, Bayada does not fall therein.</p>
