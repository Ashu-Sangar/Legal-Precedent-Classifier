First, Appellants contend that they complied with “the express terms of the trial judge’s abbreviated Rule 1925(b) Order,” Appellants’ Brief at 20, which instructed them to “file with the Court, and a copy with the trial judge,” a 1925(b) Statement.</p>
    <p id="b392-13" data-blocks='[["BL_392.14",392,[268,1874,1149,256]],["BL_393.1",393,[191,316,1150,411]]]'>Second, Appellants aver they complied with Rule 1925(b)(l)’s requirement that the 1925(b) statement be served on the trial judge because Rule 1925(b)(1) provides that service shall be “in person,” and Pa.R.A.P. 121(c) indicates that service may be made “by personal service, which includes <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>delivery of the copy to a clerk or other responsible person at the office of the person served.” Appellants maintain that, because the only address available for Judge Stallone was the address of the Berks County Courthouse at 633 Court Street, and because the prothonotary’s office is a part of the courthouse, they properly served Judge Stallone by delivering a copy of their 1925(b) Statement to the prothonotary, “a responsible person.” Appellants’ Brief at 19.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[190,751,1152,730]]]'>Third, Appellants argue that, even if their compliance with Rule 1925(b) was “imperfect,” Appellants’ Brief at 15, they should not be subjected to the harsh penalty of waiver when the true purpose of Rule 1925(b) was satisfied because Judge Stallone obviously had received their 1925(b) statement, as evidenced by his attachment of the same as an exhibit to his Statement in Lieu of Memorandum Opinion, and because the trial court itself failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 1925(b). In this regard, Appellants point out that Judge Stallone’s order (1) failed to specify that the 1925(b) statement must be <em>served </em>on the trial judge, as required under Rule 1925(b)(3)(iii); and (2) failed to provide notice that any issues not included in the 1925(b) statement are waived, as required under Rule 1925(b)(3)(vii).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Nationwide claims that Appellants relied, at their peril, on the prothonotary’s assurances that their original 1925(b) Statement would be delivered to the trial judge, and notes that Appellants could have avoided any such reliance by serving the trial judge by mail. Nationwide urges this Court to apply the bright-line, automatic waiver rule set forth in <em>Commonwealth v.

Upon review, we find merit to Appellants’ first and third arguments, and, therefore, hold that the issues raised in their 1925(b) Statement are not waived.

Despite any suggestion to the contrary, the express language of his order <em>did not </em>instruct Appellants to <em>serve </em>a copy of their 1925(b) Statement on the trial judge; rather, it directed Appellants to <em>file </em>copies of their 1925(b) Statement with the court and with the trial judge.

While we do not find it necessary to rely on Appellants' second argument as a basis for disposition, we are compelled to address the position espoused by Justice Eakin in his Concurring Opinion, namely, that Appellants <em>served </em>the trial judge by <em>filing </em>a copy of their Rule 1925(b) statement with the prothonotary. Concurring Opinion at 360, 6 A.3d at 1014. Although Rule 1925(b)(1) provides that "[f]iling of record and service on the judge shall be in person or by mail as provided in Pa.R.A.P. 121(a),” Rule 121(a) states that papers required to be <em>filed </em>in an appellate court shall be filed with the prothonotary; Rule 121(a) does not suggest that <em>personal service </em>upon a trial judge may be accomplished in the same manner. Rather, it is Rule 121(c) that addresses the manner of service. To the extent Justice Eakin suggests that, in leaving a copy of their Rule 1925(b) statement with the prothonotary, Appellants complied with Rule 121(c), we strongly question whether the prothonotary constitutes the equivalent of a "clerk or other responsible person at the office of the person [i.e., judge] served.” Indeed, if Rule 1925(b) contemplated that service upon a trial judge could be achieved by filing a copy of a Rule 1925(b) statement with the prothonotary, its requirement that an appellant "file of record the Statement and concurrently ... serve the judge,” Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(1), would be superfluous. Rather, Rule 1925(b) contemplates two distinct obligations: filing <em>and </em>service.</p>

    <p id="b411-4" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[179,445,1153,1056]]]'>Thus, while I recognize the OAJC’s cogent point that “it is the trial court’s order which triggers Rule 1925 in the first instance,” OAJC Op. at 1011, upon receipt of that order, it is incumbent upon the litigants, and no one else, to ensure proper perfection of an appeal, including filing and service, through the mandates of the rule. <em>Accord Schofield; see also Castillo, </em><a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="888 A.2d 775" data-case-ids="2472599,8998737" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01,/a2d/888/0775-01">888 A.2d at </a>779 n. 5 (“It is incumbent upon all lawyers to follow court rules without judicial oversight.”). The effect, however, of the OAJC appears to be an edict that when a trial judge’s order is in arguable tension with a rule of procedure, the order should control. Specific to this case, the OAJC holds that, regardless of the mandates of Rule 1925(b)(1) that an “[ajppellant shall file of record the [sjtatement and concurrently shall serve the judge,” when the trial judge instantly instructed the Bergs to “file with the Court, and a copy with the trial judge,” a Rule 1925(b) statement, OAJC Op. at 1008 (quoting Order of Jan. 3, 2008), the Bergs’ substantial compliance with the order by filing the Rule 1925(b) statement with the Berks County Prothonotary was sufficient to perfect the appeal.</p>

In my view, however, where an order and rule are in tension, the careful practitioner either should comply with both, or if that is not clearly possible, comply with the rule and seek clarification from the issuing judge of the order. Absent such prudence, waiver should result, not because it is harsh on the litigant or counsel, but because it ensures uniform justice to the tens of thousands of litigants proceeding through Pennsylvania courts each year. On the other hand, should a litigant comply with the rules of court and take the relatively simplistic step of seeking clarification of the trial judge’s order, and the judge for whatever reason refuses to issue clarification (thus causing prejudice to that litigant), I would characterize this as a breakdown in the administration of justice mandating equitable relief. <em>See Union Elec.

First, they simply did not serve the trial judge with the Rule 1925(b) statement as required by subsection (b)(1) of the rule. Second, when faced with an order of court and an instruction from a clerk in the prothonotary’s office, which were both in tension with (if not completely contrary to) the explicit mandates of Rule 1925(b), the Bergs did not seek any clarification or assistance from the trial judge. Moreover, the equities of this case are not as draconian as the OAJC would make them out to be. The Bergs were not under any <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>filing deadline; they still had a full week to serve the trial judge with the Rule 1925(b) statement. As made perfectly clear by Rule 1925(b)(1), the Bergs could have left the Berks County Courthouse, gone to the local post office, and sent the statement via certified mail to the trial judge. Even without any order of clarification, such actions would have perfected service to the trial judge and been in full compliance with both Rule 1925(b) and the trial judge’s deficient order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_5" id="ref_footnote_5_5">5</a> As in <em>Schofield, </em>the Bergs simply did not follow the filing and service requirements of the new Rule 1925(b), and, accordingly, for the good of all should face the consequence of waiver.</p>

Like the OAJC, very respectfully, I find the trial judge’s failure to follow the mandates of Rule 1925(b)(3) troublesome. Had the judge included within the order the components found in subsection (b)(3), this appeal would have been unnecessary. To avoid any confusion concerning Rule 1925(b) statements in the future, I suggest that the Appellate Rules Committee undertake the necessary steps to create and promulgate a simple form order for trial judges to use when ordering the submission of a Rule 1925(b) statement by an appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_6" id="ref_footnote_5_6">6</a>
