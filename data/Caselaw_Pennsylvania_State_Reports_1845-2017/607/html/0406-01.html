      <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>On January 17, 2008, OGC filed a complaint against Janssen in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, raising statutory and common law tort claims related to Risperdal, a prescription antipsychotic medication marketed by Janssen. Although Risperdal had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), OGC alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Janssen improperly marketed and promoted Risperdal for non-FDA approved uses, commonly known as “off-label” uses. OGC contended that the Commonwealth has expended millions of dollars for Risperdal prescriptions through Medicaid and the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (“PACE”). In filing the action, OGC was not represented by government-employed lawyers. Instead, OGC retained Bailey Perrin, a private law firm based in Houston, Texas, to prosecute the action on a contingent fee basis.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[256,1120,1150,775]],["BL_455.1",455,[168,321,1151,516]]]'>On June 9, 2008, Janssen filed a motion in the trial court seeking to disqualify Bailey Perrin as OGC’s counsel in the litigation. Janssen alleged that, while OGC filed the complaint against Janssen on behalf of the Commonwealth, no attorney from OGC entered an appearance, the complaint was signed by local Philadelphia counsel for Bailey Perrin, and a Bailey Perrin attorney verified the complaint. Janssen contended that the contingent fee agreement restricts OGC’s ability to consent to a non-monetary settlement of the Risperdal action because it requires that any settlement include reasonable compensation for Bailey Perrin; contains a provision waiving conflicts of interests arising out of Bailey Perrin representing other states in similar actions that varies from the usual conflict of interest provisions included in contingent fee agreements executed by the Attorney General; and does not pro<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>vide for OGC’s control and management of the litigation as is generally the case with the Attorney General’s contingent fee agreements. Janssen argued that the contingent fee agreement violates the separation of powers doctrine by usurping the General Assembly’s exclusive spending powers. Finally, Janssen claimed that the agreement deprives it of its due process rights because those who exercise the government’s powers in adjudicative proceedings must have no financial interest in the outcome, must be impartial, and must maintain the appearance of impartiality.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[167,861,1153,677]]]'>OGC responded that Janssen misrepresented the terms of the contingent fee agreement regarding the scope of OGC’s control over the litigation. OGC stated that the agreement relegates Bailey Perrin to advising, counseling and recommending actions to OGC and carrying out OGC’s directives to the best of its ability and further provides that Bailey Perrin is directly responsible to OGC on all matters of strategy and tactics. In addition, according to OGC, the agreement provides that, at the time of settlement or'judgment, OGC will consult with Bailey Perrin and agree to appropriate legal fees. OGC noted that the agreement provides that Bailey Perrin must advance all costs of litigation and, if there is no recovery, could expend millions of dollars with no remuneration.</p>
    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[166,1563,1150,416]],["BL_456.1",456,[269,316,1148,412]]]'>Regarding alleged restrictions on the ability to reach a non-monetary settlement, OGC argued that, because the Risperdal complaint seeks monetary damages, the likelihood of an acceptable non-monetary settlement is extremely remote, and Janssen had not proposed any non-monetary settlement. On the issue of the alleged conflict of interest, OGC responded that Janssen failed to point to any such conflict or establish how Bailey Perrin’s representation of other states against <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>Janssen presents a conflict. OGC added that the contingent fee agreement does not violate the separation of powers doctrine because any fees paid to Bailey Perrin would issue from Janssen and not from the state treasury. Finally, OGC countered Janssen’s due process argument by noting that all of the caselaw on that issue involves criminal matters and the impartiality of judges, not counsel representing a governmental entity.</p>
    <p id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[268,752,1151,949]]]'>The Honorable Howland W. Abramson denied the motion to disqualify counsel on December 8, 2008, without filing an opinion or otherwise stating the reasons for denial on the record. Janssen then filed an application for extraordinary relief with this Court, asking this Court to exercise jurisdiction to review the denial of its motion to disqualify. Janssen renewed the arguments it had forwarded below, <em>i.e., </em>that the contingent fee contract restricted OGC’s authority to settle the litigation for non-monetary relief, and that the contract did not vest control of the litigation with OGC but rather provided that Bailey Perrin need only consult with OGC; that the process by which Bailey Perrin was retained was irregular because the contingent fee contract was not the subject of competitive bidding or legislative authorization; and that the contract violated the separation of powers doctrine and Janssen’s due process rights. Finally, Janssen noted that if OGC prevailed in this litigation, Bailey Perrin would be paid fees of as much as fifteen percent of the actual recovery.</p>

Further, OGC claimed that Janssen lacked standing to move to disqualify Bailey Perrin under Section 103 of the Attorneys Act, which explicitly states that no party other than a Commonwealth agency has standing to challenge the authority of the legal representation of the agency. 71 P.S. § 732-103. As to Janssen’s separation of powers argument, OGC renewed its position that Bailey Perrin’s compensation would come from Janssen, not from the state treasury, <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>because any fee would be paid directly to Bailey Perrin prior to any recovery from Janssen being deposited into the treasury. In any event, according to OGC, the majority of other jurisdictions that have considered such a separation of powers argument have rejected it. Regarding Janssen’s due process claim, OGC noted that it appears that Janssen would not object if OGC were represented by government-employed attorneys or private counsel working on an hourly basis; therefore, OGC characterized Janssen’s true objection as being a strategic one, reflecting its concern with Bailey Perrin’s level of skill, experience and special expertise in pharmaceutical reimbursement claims. OGC posits that due process principles cannot be construed to deny the Commonwealth the ability to retain superior legal representation.</p>

    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.7",458,[257,1916,1149,256]],["BL_459.1",459,[171,321,1151,591]]]'>Janssen’s statutory arguments are based on the Act’s legislative history and also on the text of Section 103. First, viewing Section 103 from a historical perspective, Janssen notes that it was enacted after the 1978 amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution that provided for the election of the <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>Attorney General rather than executive appointment of that position.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> According to Janssen, the Act implements the constitutional amendment by establishing the position of Governor’s General Counsel and splitting the duties of the prior appointed Attorney General between the elected Attorney General and OGC. Section 204(c) of the Act thus authorizes the Attorney General to “represent the Commonwealth and all Commonwealth agencies” in most civil litigation, 71 P.S. § 732-204(c),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> while Section 301(6) allows OGC to represent Commonwealth agencies in limited circumstances.

It is undisputed that the Attorney General declined to file the Risperdal action against Janssen and that OGC was authorized to do so. Viewed in light of this history, Janssen argues, Section 103’s express limitation on standing was intended only to restrict challenges to the division of responsibility between the Attorney General and OGC; in that instance, only a Commonwealth agency has standing to “question the authority” of the legal representation of the agency.</p>
    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[269,1383,1150,626]]]'>In any event, Janssen argues, it is not challenging Bailey Perrin’s statutory “authority” to represent the Commonwealth because it recognizes that OGC has the authority to initiate the action and to hire private counsel to prosecute the matter. Instead, Janssen claims, it seeks disqualification of Bailey Perrin as counsel because the contingent fee arrangement violates constitutional principles of separation of powers and due process. Because Section 103 focuses only on statutory “authority,” Janssen argues that Section 103 does not forbid or limit a party’s right to assert a violation of constitutional guarantees, via the vehicle of a motion to disqualify contingent fee counsel.</p>
    <p id="b460-7" data-blocks='[["BL_460.8",460,[270,2045,1148,311]],["BL_461.1",461,[181,319,1151,511]]]'>Finally, Janssen claims that Section 103 does not limit Janssen’s standing to seek disqualification of Bailey Perrin as counsel because Section 103 applies on its face only to “the legal representation of the agency” where a Commonwealth agency is a party to the action. According to Janssen, the Commonwealth itself is the sole plaintiff in this action, and <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>representation of the Commonwealth is distinct from representation of a Commonwealth agency. Janssen says that the distinction it draws is implicit in the General Assembly’s use in Section 204(c) of the language, “[t]he Attorney General shall represent the Commonwealth and all Commonwealth agencies .... ” Thus, Janssen argues, Section 103’s specific limitation on standing to challenge representation of an agency cannot be read, as a matter of basic statutory construction, to impose a similar limitation on standing to challenge representation of the Commonwealth as a whole.</p>
    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[181,863,1150,685]]]'>OGC counters that a private litigant lacks standing to usurp the role of elected officials in establishing and carrying out the Commonwealth’s policies. OGC argues that Janssen’s “lofty rhetoric of separation of powers and due process rights” aside, Janssen’s motion to disqualify counsel is nothing more than “an attempt by an alleged corporate malfeasor to avoid the consequences of its wrongdoing by re-debating the policy choices of the Governor, Attorney General, and General Counsel.” Br. of Appellee at 11. OGC contends that the policy decisions of whether to pursue a particular avenue of litigation, which attorneys to use in the litigation, and how to compensate the attorneys are properly made by public officials, and not by private parties or the courts.</p>

Shiffler, </em><a href="/pa/583/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="583 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="687746" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0478-01">583 Pa. 478</a>, <a href="/pa/583/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="879 A.2d 185" data-case-ids="687746,8933265" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0478-01,/a2d/879/0185-01">879 A.2d 185</a>, 189 (2005) (“As a general rule, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain language of a statute.”). OGC argues that this unequivocal restriction does not support the distinction Janssen attempts to draw between the statutory and constitutional authority of Bailey Perrin’s representation. Instead, according to OGC, Section 103 prevents all such challenges to the legal authority of a Commonwealth party’s representation. Because Section 103 is clear and free from ambiguity, OGC posits that Janssen’s argument is foreclosed by basic rules of <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>statutory construction. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) (“When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”). OGC concludes that Section 103 means what it plainly says: no party to an action — and Janssen is a party to this action — may challenge an agency’s legal representation. As for Janssen’s argument that the Commonwealth, and not a Commonwealth agency, is the plaintiff in this action, OGC responds that the complaint it filed clearly states that the action was brought on behalf of the Department of Public Welfare and the Department of Aging, both of which are Commonwealth agencies. Finally, OGC observes that Janssen “claims to champion the interests of the legislature against the executive, in the absence of any indication that the legislature believes that its rights have been infringed or that it needs a private champion.” Br. of Appellee at 18.</p>

The General Assembly has frequently enacted statutes conferring standing on particular individuals or entities in specific situations. <em>See, e.g., </em>13 Pa.C.S. § 2A531 (lessor and lessee have standing to sue third party whose conduct toward goods subject to lease causes actionable injury to party to lease); 23 Pa.C.S. § 4341 (granting standing to any person caring for child to commence or continue action for child support regardless of whether court order grants that person custody); 23 Pa.C.S. § 4378 (recipient of public assistance has standing to commence action for support for any child for whom recipient claims assistance); 24 P.S. § 13-1311-A (student victim of act of violence involving weapon on school property has standing to seek expulsion of aggressor not expelled by school); 35 P.S. § 780-152 (tenant organization has standing to initiate eviction proceedings for drug-related criminal activity on or in immediate vicinity of leased residential premises). The General Assembly also has adopted legislation denying standing in particular circumstances. <em>See, e.g., </em>15 Pa.C.S. §§ 517 (corpo<a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>rations generally), 1717 (domestic business corporations), 5717 (domestic non-profit corporations) (limiting standing of different types of corporations’ individual directors, board of directors and committees of board to sue board of directors, committees or individual directors). Similarly, the Crimes Code provides that persons charged with certain offenses lack standing to challenge the authority of the Attorney General to institute criminal proceedings anywhere in the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2716 (weapons of mass destruction), 4107 (deceptive or fraudulent business practices), 4120 (identity theft), 5111 (dealing in proceeds of unlawful activities), 6318 (unlawful contact with minor). <em>Accord </em>70 P.S. § 1-511 (same restriction as to criminal penalties under Securities Act); 73 P.S. § 517.8 (same as to home improvement fraud); 74 P.S. § 202 (same as to confidentiality of social security numbers); 77 P.S. § 1039.9 (same as to criminal prosecution of workers’ compensation insurance fraud). Thus, Section 103 is not unique.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[168,1340,1155,1029]]]'>Although Section 103 addresses but one narrow issue of standing to challenge a Commonwealth agency’s legal representation, where applicable, the Section is absolute and not subject to a weighing of factors, much less does it purport to incorporate the various factors that guide traditional judicial standing doctrine. <em>See, e.g., In re Hickson, </em><a href="/pa/573/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="573 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="197205" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0127-01">573 Pa. 127</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="821 A.2d 1238" data-case-ids="197205,9141182" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0127-01,/a2d/821/1238-01">821 A.2d 1238</a> (2003). Thus, it appears that a private party, who otherwise might be able to establish standing to disqualify the Commonwealth agency’s counsel under traditional standing doctrine, will not succeed under the terms of the Attorneys Act. We note that Janssen does not dispute the general power of the General Assembly to act to curtail standing in this regard. Rather, Janssen appears to accept the legitimacy of the statute but maintains that the provision should be deemed inapplicable for the various reasons it forwards. Similarly, OGC does not argue that, even if Janssen’s motion to disqualify was not barred under Section 103, Janssen lacks standing under traditional standing doctrine to challenge OGC’s arrangement with private contingent fee counsel.</p>

The obvious interpretation of Section 103 is that no party to an action, other than the Commonwealth agency involved in the action itself, may challenge the authority of the agency’s legal representation. Looking for the occasion of the Attorneys Act, Janssen has constructed a cogent argument that Section 103 could be read as intending only to preclude parties involved in litigation against the Commonwealth from challenging whether the Attorney General or OGC properly should represent the Commonwealth agency, but does not extend to challenges against outside counsel representing the Commonwealth agency. But, to credit Janssen’s extra-textual argument would require a policy and statutory construction analysis of Section 103 that is not fairly invited by the clear and unambiguous statutory language actually employed in the legislation. And, in any event, if we were to indulge in a digression into the purpose of the provision, we note that it is perfectly logical to conclude that the General Assembly fully intended the broad effect of the actual words chosen: <em>i.e., </em>that, in addressing the authority of Commonwealth attorneys, it intended that no party but the affected agency should be heard to complain about so fundamental an executive matter as the identity of the lawyers representing Commonwealth entities.</p>

For example, the contract entered into by Bailey Perrin and the Office of General Counsel expressly precludes any compensation or indemnification of costs if no money is recovered from Janssen, <em>see </em>R.R. 80a, which would incentivize Bailey Perrin to disfavor settlements lacking a monetary component that would nonetheless be in the best interests of the citizens of Pennsylvania. In this regard, one commentator has explained, “Contingency fee lawyers’ incentives to maximize monetary settlements are more problematic in parens patriae litigation than in traditional private tort litigation.... For example, when the litigation process reveals that the state’s theory of liability is factually weak or incorrect, the public interest would seem to dictate that the state should drop its case rather than waste more social resources on the litigation and potentially secure an unjustified recovery.” David Dana, <em>Public Interest and Private Lawyers: Toward a Normative Evaluation of Parens Patriae Litigation by Contingency Fee, </em><a href="/citations/?q=51%20DePaul%20L.%20Rev.%20315" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="51 DePaul L.

Since Janssen alone stands to incur additional costs due to the contract under which Bailey Perrin was hired, its interest in the relief it seeks is substantial because it surpasses that of citizens generally in procuring obedience to the law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> As well, the causal relationship between the complained-of arrangement and Janssen’s alleged harm is sufficient to render the interest direct and immediate. <em>See generally Pittsburgh Palisades Park v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/585/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="585 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="2471785" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0196-01">585 Pa. 196</a>, 204, <a href="/pa/585/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="888 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="2471785,8997954" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0196-01,/a2d/888/0655-01">888 A.2d 655</a>, 659 (2005) (reciting that an interest is “direct” if the matter complained of caused harm to the party’s interests, and it is “immediate” if the causal connection is not remote or speculative). Indeed, not only does Janssen aver that the Commonwealth’s strategic litigation decisions are likely to be distorted to Janssen’s detriment by Bailey Perrin’s pecuniary interest in the outcome, but its allegations include a suggestion that this particular litigation might not have occurred at all but for the aggressive efforts of Bailey Perrin in seeking to convince state officials to initiate it under a contingent-fee arrangement whereby the firm could expect to receive a substantial portion of any monetary payout. <em>See </em>Motion to Disqualify Plaintiffs Counsel ¶ ¶ 5-6, 9-12, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 61a-64a; <em>cf. </em>Brief for Appellant at 43 (recounting allegations regarding Bailey Perrin’s involvement <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>in commencing the present lawsuit, as well as Risperdal litigation in other jurisdictions).</p>

Although the majority indicates that Janssen does not advance any constitutional challenge to Section 103’s limitation on standing, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 422 n. 7, 8 A.3d at 276 n. 7, Janssen does argue that its due process rights are infringed by the contingency-fee arrangement, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant at 27-41; <em>see also id. </em>at 13 ("By giving Bailey Perrin ... a direct financial interest in the outcome of the litigation, the Governor’s General Counsel violated Janssen’s state and federal constitutional rights to due process."), and states further that "Section 103[can] not constitutionally be read to prohibit a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the contingent fee arrangement.” <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 15 ("[N]othing in the Act stands in the way of Janssen's due process challenge to the Commonwealth’s retention of private contingent fee counsel.”); <em>id. </em>at 16 ("Indeed, the General Assembly could.not, by limiting standing, preclude such challenges to constitutional violations.”). These arguments, moreover, echo averments forwarded in the underlying petition. <em>See </em>Motion to Disqualify Plaintiff’s Counsel ¶¶ 15-19, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 65a-66a. In this <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>regard, it bears noting that reviewing courts have a duty to construe statutory enactments in a limited fashion where reasonably possible if a broader interpretation would render them constitutionally unsound. <em>See Commonwealth v. Mastrangelo, </em><a href="/pa/489/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="489 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1762413" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0254-01">489 Pa. 254</a>, 260, <a href="/pa/489/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="489 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1762413" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0254-01">414 A.2d 54</a>, 57 (1980); <em>see also </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3). Thus, unlike the majority, I believe that the present discussion is fairly implicated by the substance of Janssen’s challenge and salient legal principles.</p>

Other commentators have also expressed concerns about partiality regarding the terms on which a private contingently-paid law firm may be willing to settle the case on behalf of its governmental client. See, e.g., Dale Dahlquist, <em>Inherent Conflict: A Case Against the Use of Contingency Fees by Special Assistants in Quasi-Governmental Prosecutorial Roles, </em><a href="/citations/?q=50%20DePaul%20L.%20Rev.%20743" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="50 DePaul L. Rev. 743">50 DePaul L.Rev. 743</a>, 783-84 (2000) (“When a Special Assistant is bestowed with all the power and authority of the Attorney General, he has a corresponding duty to represent the state as would the Attorney General himself.... Those members of the plaintiffs' bar who serve as Special Assistants are now hopelessly conflicted, serving as government contractors with financial incentives proportionate to their hoped-for conquest.... How could such lawyers possibly evaluate with impartiality the prospect of a settlement, say, or the tradeoff between injunctive and monetary relief?” (brackets, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted)); Robert Levy, <em>The New Business of Government Sponsored Litigation, 9 </em>Kan. J.L. &amp; Pub. Policy 592, 598 (2001) (approving of hourly-fee contracts with outside counsel, but <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>asserting that contingent-fee contracts are a "sure-fire catalyst for the abuse of power,” and that it is difficult to "condone private lawyers enforcing public law with an incentive kicker to increase the penalties”).</p>
      <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.3",473,[213,1894,1118,465]]]'>Bailey Perrin attempts to deflect these criticisms by observing that outside counsel paid on an hourly basis could also abuse their position by inflating their hours. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 54. I find this argument flawed in at least two respects: first, it does not ameliorate the due process concerns identified above; second, although a possibility of overbilling may exist — as indeed it may in purely private litigation — this type of difficulty appears more readily subject to control via well-established criteria for determining reasonableness of hourly fees. <em>See In re LaRocca's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/431/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="431 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1917393" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0542-01">431 Pa. 542</a>, 546, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20A.2d%20337" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="246 A.2d 337">246 A.2d 337</a>, 339 (1968). It is also worth noting that the justification for allowing contingent-fee contracts for private plaintiffs lacking the resources to bring a meritorious action is absent when the plaintiff-client is the government.</p>
