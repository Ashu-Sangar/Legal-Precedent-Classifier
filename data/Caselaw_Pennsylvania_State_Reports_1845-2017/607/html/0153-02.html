Under this interpretation, the court explained, there are several other third-class school districts that could conceivably meet Section 1607.1’s criteria. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied upon the presumption that the Legislature does not intend to violate the Constitution, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3),. and the principle that, where a statute is reasonably susceptible of two constructions, one of which would render it unconstitutional, the court must adopt the interpretation that will allow the statute to be upheld. <em>See Zahorchak, </em><a href="/a2d/956/1040-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="956 A.2d 1040" data-case-ids="8209924" data-case-paths="/a2d/956/1040-01">956 A.2d at </a>1050 (citing <em>Ramsey v.

The court further found that Section 1607.1 does not violate the non-delegation doctrine <em>(see supra </em>note 5), because the General Assembly made the basic policy choices regarding the dispersal of students to nearby districts and simply granted the Secretary <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>the authority to make choices concerning the placement of particular students.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[266,432,1157,1699]]]'>Judge Cohn Jubelirer authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Judge Pellegrini, in which she concluded that Sections 1607.1 and 1113(b.2) amount to unconstitutional special legislation. Initially, the dissent disagreed with the majority’s interpretation that, “has been placed on the education empowerment list,” does not require continuing presence on the list. The dissent reasoned that, given Section 1607.1’s express purpose to aid distressed school districts, where a district improves its academic performance and is removed from the empowerment list, its past inclusion on the list is irrelevant to determining whether it presently warrants attention under Section 1607.1. Thus, the dissent opined that the “has been placed” phraseology requires a district’s presence on the list contemporaneous with its meeting all of the other Section 1607.1 criteria. As Duquesne is the only third-class school district on the empowerment list, and as the Empowerment Act, which provides for list placement, expires on June 30, 2010, the dissent observed that no other third-class district could simultaneously meet the requirements of presence on the list and supervision by a board of control for five consecutive years. Hence, the dissent expressed that Section 1607.1 creates a closed class of one school district — namely, Duquesne — rendering it <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. Further, because Section 1113(b.2) only applies to a Section 1607.1 district, the dissent opined that it, too, comprises unconstitutional special legislation. The dissent lastly noted that Sections 1607.1 and 1113(b.2) were clearly intended to address Duquesne’s specific situation, and suggested that such particularized treatment, which leaves undisturbed existing procedures applicable to all other school districts in the Commonwealth, represents exactly the type of legislation prohibited by Article III, Section 32. <em>See Zahorchak, </em><a href="/a2d/956/1040-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="956 A.2d 1040" data-case-ids="8209924" data-case-paths="/a2d/956/1040-01">956 A.2d at 1050-52</a> (Cohn Jubelirer, J., dissenting).</p>

They argue that Section 1607.1 is unconstitutional <em>per se </em>because it creates a class of one member that is substantially closed to future membership. <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>They claim that a school district must currently be on the empowerment list to qualify under Section 1607.1, and proffer that the statutory phrases, “has operated,” and “has been placed,” reflect a legislative objective to address conditions that subsist in the present timeframe. According to Appellants, it follows that Duquesne is alone in the class created by Section 1607.1 because, not only is Duquesne the only third-class school district presently on the empowerment list, but the list was effectively closed to new members as of June 1, 2004 — which preceded the enactment of Act 45.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

They state that “the confluence of events necessary to allow any other school district beside Duquesne to qualify as a section 1607.1(a)(1) school district is so improbable that, even if not logically closed, the class created by section 1607.1(a)(1) is, in fact, ‘substantially’ closed to other school districts, and is therefore <em>per se </em>unconstitutional pursuant to the <em>Turnpike Commission </em>decision.” Brief for Appellants at 33.

The Department disputes Appellants’ claim that a district must currently be on the empowerment list to qualify under that section, reasoning that the Legislature would have explicitly required present placement on the list if it had intended such a restriction. <em>See </em>Brief for Department at 29-30. With this in mind, the Department applies a broader construction of the statutory language, pursuant to which five other third-class school districts meet the empowerment-list criterion, as they “have been placed” on the list in the past (albeit they are no longer on the list). <em>See id. </em>at 16 (“Here, the statute being challenged ... resulted in the immediate identification of a single school district, and would allow at least five other school districts to join the class at some point in the future.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Department further contends that Section 1113(b.2) serves a legitimate state purpose, and, lastly, denies that Section 1607.1 unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority, noting that the General Assembly established the relevant policy and provided the Secretary with adequate standards to guide the exercise of his discretion in identifying neighboring districts to receive students. <em>See Casino Free Phila. v.

First, the parties do not dispute that there are only five other potential school districts that could ever become members of the class created by Section 1607.1(a), by virtue of their status as third-class districts that had been placed on the empowerment list prior to its closure on June 1, 2004. <em>See </em>Stipulation <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>at 7 ¶ 51, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 19a.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Additionally, they agree that, during the relevant timeframe, none of the other five third-class districts operated under a special board of control. <em>See id. </em>at 6 ¶ 44, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 18a. Thus, to enter the class, one of those districts would have to return to control-board governance, remain under such governance for five consecutive years, and eliminate its high school without assigning its pupils to other schools. Not only is such a series of occurrences unlikely, but given that the Secretary’s assignment of students to neighboring school districts would have had to occur “no later than fifteen (15) days after the effective date of this section,” 24 P.S. § 16-1607.1(a)(1) — that is, by August 14, 2007 — any such third-class district that ultimately met all of these conditions could not benefit from the remedial provisions of Section 1607.1.</p>

In contending that the empowerment list was closed to new members as of June 1, 2004, Appellants reference Section 1714.1-B of the School Code, which precludes any new additions to the list under Section 1703-B on or after June 1, 2004 — with the sole exception of entities designated as Commonwealth Partnership School Districts ("CPSDs”). <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1714.1-B. According to Appellants, this latter category is functionally limited to the Pittsburgh Public Schools because, to be considered a CPSD, the district must experience the loss of a revenue source available only to first-class-A school districts. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellants at 32-33 (citing 24 P.S. §§ 17-1702-B, 6-652.1). Assuming Appellants are correct in suggesting that CPSDs are limited to first-class-A school districts, any addition to the empowerment list on or after June 1, 2004, could not possibly implicate Section 1607.l's procedures, as those procedures only apply to third-class school districts, and not first-class-A districts. Of course, Appellants’ argument that these factors result in a closed class of one depends on their narrow interpretation of "has been placed" to include only districts currently on the empowerment list.
