The Association claimed that under the collective bargaining agreement between the parties, summer benefits are earned by working the nine-month academic year (not by working summer school), and PASSHE’s threats unilaterally changed the terms and conditions of employment by abrogating the sick leave and other leave provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, as well as the right to be paid for work performed. The Association sought a restraining order against PASSHE, claiming an unfair practice.</p>

The Board indicated that the Association failed to state a cause of action under Section 1201(a)(3) of PERA, and that its claims under Sections 1201(a)(1) and (5) were moot because the parties had ratified a successor agreement.

      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>In its brief to this Court, the Board argues that the Commonwealth Court’s decision is contrary to well-established law that issuance of a PERA complaint is within the Board’s discretion, and that the Commonwealth Court’s scope and standard of review of its decision is very narrow. The Board asserts that the Commonwealth Court improperly substituted its own judgment for that of the Board, and “usurped the discretionary authority of the Board in deciding that the Board must issue a complaint on an unfair practice charge that the charging party itself concedes is moot.” Appellant’s Brief at 16. According to the Board, the Commonwealth Court itself has previously declared that the Board “cannot be found to have abused its discretion by relying upon its own established precedent.” <em>Id. </em>at 17 (quoting from <em>Pennsylvania State Park Officers Ass’n v.

Thus, the Board concludes, it would not serve the parties’ or the public interest to issue a complaint in this case. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court improperly rejected the Board’s policy determination that parties who have resolved their differences through negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement should focus on the future, rather than on past differences that have no present effects. Finally, the Board acknowledges that it may — in appropriate circumstances — decide to issue a complaint in a moot matter, but that decision falls within its discretion. In this case, where the Association has failed to demonstrate that relevant exceptions to the mootness doctrine existed, the Board argues that it did not abuse its discretion in declining to issue a complaint, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Joint Bargaining Comm., </em><a href="/pa/484/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="484 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1753744" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0175-01">484 Pa. 175</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="484 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1753744" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0175-01">398 A.2d 1001</a> (1979) (parties’ subsequent negotia<a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>tion of new collective bargaining agreement mooted unfair practices charge and this Court refused to speculate about whether issue would be raised in future and, unless decided now, escape appellate review).</p>

According to the Association, this “blanket rule” ignores well-established law that even moot cases may be decided if the issue is “capable of repetition, yet apt to evade review.” <em>Id. </em>at 6-7.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a> The Association argues that the Board’s “adoption of such a general rule permitting no exceptions is not in the public interest and will not advance the purposes” of PERA. Appellee’s Brief at 9. According to the Association, PASSHE’s conduct in this case was clearly illegal, and the Board’s role under PERA includes addressing and preventing such illegal conduct. By applying an automatic policy of dismissing moot charges, the Association argues, the Board fails in its mission to prevent unfair practices, and those practices will always “evade review.”</p>

Instead, the Board must effect the procedures in PERA to protect the rights of the public employee, the public employer and the public at large.</p>

Although the Board did, indeed, mention the exceptions to the mootness doctrine in its Final Order, it engaged in no meaningful analysis of these exceptions in the context of the circumstances presented in this case. The entirety of the Board’s recognition and consideration of the exceptions is found in the following excerpts of the Board’s Final Order:</p>

Thus, [the Association] has failed to demonstrate that its Charge raises an issue of great public importance.</blockquote>

Therefore, [the Association’s] allegations of violations of Section 1201(a)(1) and (5) of [the Public Employe Relations Act] PERA are moot. Accordingly, the Secretary did not err in declining to issue a complaint and dismissing the Charge. After a thorough review of the exceptions and all matters of record, the Board concurs with the Secretary’s decision to dismiss [the Association’s] Charge of Unfair Practice.</blockquote>

The Board did not address the Association’s argument that the matter was capable of repetition because contract agreements between the Association and PASSHE consistently expire at the end of the school year, <em>i.e., </em>at the end of June; hence, if a strike occurs, it is likely to be in the summer, when summer benefits for striking faculty could very well again become an issue. <em>See Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, </em><a href="/a2d/962/0709-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="962 A.2d 709" data-case-ids="8187692" data-case-paths="/a2d/962/0709-01">962 A.2d 709</a>, 713, 717 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008). Similarly, the Board did not address the Association’s argument that, if the matter did arise again, it would likely escape judicial review, because adjudication takes at least several months, but under Section 1003 of the PERA, public employee strikes, including teacher strikes, are generally of short duration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

In fact, the Board made absolutely no comment or determination as to the likelihood that, in the event PASSHE’s alleged conduct is repeated, a subsequent Association challenge would again evade review. Thus, I am unable to agree with the majority that the Board “recognized and considered” the exceptions to the mootness doctrine because I discern nothing in the record to suggest that the Board either recognized the proper standard or considered the exceptions in the context of the circumstances presented in this case and of the allegations raised by the Association.</p>

I would agree that the Board has discretion as to whether to invoke a mootness exception and accordingly hear a moot charge. Furthermore, as mentioned above, in the exercise of this discretion, the Board is entitled to consider, as one factor, the wisdom of proceeding with the litigation if the parties have already reached agreement on their contract. If, however, the majority is suggesting that the Board may decline to issue a complaint based solely on its policy of dismissing charges rendered moot by a new contract, without explicit consideration and explanation of the potential applicability of the mootness exceptions, then I must strenuously disagree with the majority. I would not excuse the Board from a thorough evaluation of the mootness exceptions in the context of the circumstances and allegations of each case, and I would require the Board to set forth its analysis in sufficient detail for review, under the abuse of discretion standard, by this Court. <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>general policy of dismissing charges rendered moot by a new contract should not be “exclusive.” However, the majority seems here to suggest that the policy <em>may </em>be applied in an exclusive manner unless, <em>e.g., </em>“it were shown” that the employer had engaged in illegal practices to gain employee concessions. Expecting the employees to show as a prerequisite for issuance of a complaint that their employer had engaged in illegal practices is too high a barrier at this stage in the litigation. As the Board stated in its decision, “[i]n determining whether to issue a complaint, the Board assumes that all the facts alleged are true.” Final Order of the Board, dated 12/18/07, at 1.</p>
