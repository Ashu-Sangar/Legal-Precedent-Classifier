In 2007, when Appellant was 14-years-old, Appellant’s grandmother was attempting to deal with the challenges of Appellant’s regular drug use, stealing, truancy from school, and his running away from home. Unable to maintain control of her grandson, and in an attempt to address this situation, on May 30, 2007, C.K. filed a petition pursuant to Act 53 to compel Appellant to receive drug and alcohol abuse treatment on an involuntary basis. That same day, the Honorable Guido A. DeAngelis of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Juvenile Court, entered a preliminary order appointing counsel for Appellant and ordered him to undergo a drug and alcohol assessment by a licensed drug addiction counselor. The juvenile court also directed Appellant to appear for a hearing scheduled for June 12, 2007, and required C.K. to provide Appellant with a copy of the petition and the order of the court.</p>

On June 12, 2007, Allegheny County Sheriffs deputies took custody of Appellant at his home and transported him to juvenile court for attendance at the hearing. The sheriffs deputies delivered Appellant to a secured area within the juvenile court facility, where he was held in an area which was not occupied by adults or other juveniles who were charged with delinquent activities. Appellant was interviewed by Josie Morgaño, a certified addiction counselor, and was then taken to the courtroom.</p>

After discussion of these preliminary matters, Morgano testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellant told her that he smoked marijuana every day and sometimes used alcohol, and had been doing so for one year. Furthermore, Morgano offered that the 14-year-old had a history of outpatient mental health treatment, had been truant at school, had run away from home, had stolen money from his grandmother, and had been very difficult to contain in the home environment. This testimony was based upon Morgano’s interview with Appellant as well as information provided by Appellant’s grandmother. According to Morgano, Appellant’s diagnosis was cannabis dependence, and she did not believe it was possible to contain Appellant in the home environment and have outpatient assistance. She therefore recommended inpatient therapy for Appellant’s drug dependence. Appellant’s counsel cross-examined Morgano during the hearing.</p>

Thereafter, Appellant was taken to an inpatient drug treatment facility. On July 10, 2007, Appellant filed a notice of appeal challenging the constitutionality of Act 53 and a motion for an evidentiary hearing, which was denied. Two weeks later, on July 24, 2007, the court conducted a hearing to review Appellant’s commitment. After receiving evidence re<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>garding the positive progress of Appellant’s inpatient treatment, the juvenile court determined that it was in Appellant’s best interest to remain committed to the same inpatient program for an additional two to three weeks.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[163,549,1152,884]]]'>On December 21, 2007, the juvenile court rendered an opinion supporting its prior decision to require Appellant to receive inpatient drug treatment and upholding the constitutionality of Act 53. Specifically, after recognizing the strong presumption that legislative actions do not offend the Constitution, the court noted that, while children share many constitutional protections afforded adults, it is the court’s mandate to act in the best interest of the child. The court also noted that there is a difference between civil and criminal proceedings. In light of the dearth of caselaw analyzing Act 53, the juvenile court looked to the Mental Health Procedures Act (“MHPA”), 50 P.S. §§ 7101-7503. The court explained that, consistent with the purposes behind both statutes to immediately treat those suffering from medical maladies, both statutes provided sufficient due process protections. Based upon this reasoning, the court rejected Appellant’s challenges to Act 53 and his treatment.</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[163,1465,1153,676]]]'>On appeal, a unanimous panel of the Superior Court, in an opinion authored by the Honorable Robert Colville, upheld the constitutionality of Act 53. <em>In the Interest of: F.C., </em><a href="/a2d/966/1131-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="966 A.2d 1131" data-case-ids="8167762" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/1131-01">966 A.2d 1131</a>, 1137-38 (Pa.Super.2009). The court addressed Appellant’s contentions that he was denied due process and his right to counsel when, based solely on the Act 53 petition, he was detained, subjected to an assessment in which, in order to test the allegations in the petition, he was compelled to divulge private information without being given notice and an opportunity to be heard; he was assessed without counsel present; he was denied due process by virtue of his restraint in shackles; and his right to counsel was infringed because, held in restraints, he could not communicate with counsel. <em><a href="/a2d/966/1131-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="966 A.2d 1131" data-case-ids="8167762" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/1131-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/966/1131-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="966 A.2d 1131" data-case-ids="8167762" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/1131-01">at 1133</a>.</p>

The court first examined Section 7302 of the MHPA, which allows a county administrator to issue a <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>warrant requiring a person to undergo an involuntary emergency examination at a treatment facility and directing a peace officer to take such person to the facility specified in the warrant. The court observed the warrant may issue under Section 7302 upon reasonable grounds that the person is severely mentally disabled<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and in need of immediate treatment. The court further referenced that, after he is transported to the specified facility, the person is subject to an examination by a physician. Depending on the results of the examination, the person is either discharged or treated. If treated, the person may not be held involuntarily for more than 120 hours unless, upon application, the trial court orders extended involuntary treatment. The Superior Court further detailed that, if an application for extended involuntary treatment is filed, the trial court then appoints counsel for the person, and, within 24 hours of the filing of the application, an informal hearing is held. The informal hearing may result in extended treatment which, at that point, may not exceed 20 days.</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[279,1340,1153,469]]]'>The Superior Court noted that the initial infringement of liberty, when the person is transported to a treatment facility, subjected to an involuntary assessment, and, then, a possible informal hearing for a 20-day period, takes place with minimal due process protections. Nevertheless, the Superior Court recognized that the process has been found to be constitutionally sound pursuant to our decision in <em>In Re: J.M., </em><a href="/pa/556/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="556 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="607216" data-case-paths="/pa/556/0063-01">556 Pa. 63</a>, <a href="/a2d/726/1041-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="726 A.2d 1041" data-case-ids="11594282,11594296,11594326,607173,607186,607216" data-case-paths="/a2d/726/1041-01,/a2d/726/1041-02,/a2d/726/1041-03,/pa/556/0062-01,/pa/556/0062-02,/pa/556/0063-01">726 A.2d 1041</a> (Pa.1999), in light of the therapeutic/non-punitive intent and short duration of the Section 7302 procedures.</p>

Among other things, the court referred to the likeness between the provision in Section 7302, calling for a warrant to be issued after reasonable grounds are presented to a court, and Act 53’s provision calling for an order to be issued after “sufficient facts and good reason” are presented <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>by petition to the court. 71 P.S. § 1690.112a(a). Additionally, the court explained, just as the MHPA provides increasing constitutional protections as the person is subjected to continuing and increased periods of commitment, Act 53 provides for ongoing hearings if the court wishes to recommit the minor to treatment.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[168,650,1154,1221]]]'>In light of the foregoing, the Superior Court was persuaded that the MHPA and Act 53 “serve similar purposes through similar steps with similar constitutional protections.” <em>In the Interest of: F.C., </em><a href="/a2d/966/1131-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="966 A.2d 1131" data-case-ids="8167762" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/1131-01">966 A.2d at 1137</a>. The court reasoned that, just as the MHPA survived constitutional scrutiny, so did Act 53. While recognizing that the legislative enactments were not mirror images, the Superior Court nevertheless found them to be sufficiently analogous to conclude that Act 53 was constitutional. <em><a href="/a2d/966/1131-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="966 A.2d 1131" data-case-ids="8167762" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/1131-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/966/1131-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="966 A.2d 1131" data-case-ids="8167762" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/1131-01">at 1137-38</a>. The court explained that the procedures under Act 53 were fundamentally fair and provided constitutionally adequate protections for minors subject thereto, particularly given Act 53’s important goal of facilitating treatment for drug-dependent minors, and given the dangers posed to minors and those around them when those minors abuse drugs. The prerequisite of a court-ordered assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or certified addiction counselor; the appointment of counsel; an in-court hearing requiring clear and convincing evidence prior to involuntary commitment; and the provision of ongoing review prior to recommitment all underscored the protections afforded to minors under Act 53. Thus, the Superior Court rejected Appellant’s claim that he was denied due process or his right to counsel.</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[169,1896,1152,466]],["BL_102.1",102,[271,321,1152,889]]]'>The Superior Court also denied Appellant’s contention that he was denied due process by virtue of his restraint prior to and during his hearing, specifically, claiming that the visible restraints rendered his hearing unfair and that the restraints were improper as the proceedings are civil in nature. The court offered that, while, generally, due process guarantees defendants the 'right to appear in court free of restraints, defendants may be restrained to prevent escape and to protect others and maintain order in the courtroom. Here, the Supe<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>rior Court reasoned, the proceedings did not involve a jury, but a judge. Furthermore, the court believed that the hearing would only last five to ten minutes, and it was in fact relatively brief. Therefore, the Superior Court concluded that Appellant did not establish that his constitutional rights were violated by his wearing restraints before the judge. Moreover, the court expressed its concern that Appellant was a flight risk, and Appellant was known to run away from home. In light of these circumstances, the Superior Court found that keeping Appellant restrained did not infringe his due process rights. Related thereto, the Superior Court rejected Appellant’s assertion that his restraints impeded his ability to communicate with counsel, as the record disclosed that Appellant and counsel were able to freely communicate. Based upon the foregoing, the Superior Court affirmed the juvenile court’s order and denied Appellant’s challenges thereto. Appellant appealed to our Court.</p>
    <p id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[270,1234,1152,203]]]'>On July 13, 2009, we granted allocatur on the issue of whether Act 53 violates due process protections provided by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article I, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Appellant raises facial challenges to Act 53, asserting that the statute is void on due process grounds. Specifically, Appellant initially argues that the lower tribunals’ reliance on an analysis of the involuntary commitment provisions under the MHPA is misplaced and cannot serve as a substitute for a due process analysis of the specific statute challenged. Moreover, Appellant maintains that, while the MHPA and Act 53 share a purpose of providing treatment to individuals in need, the MHPA permits forced confinement and treatment not of mentally ill persons, but of mentally ill persons that pose a clear danger to themselves or others. He claims that, at its core, it is the threat of harm that justifies the involuntary confinement, not simply the mental illness. Act 53 does not require the threat of harm to others or self as a <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>core prerequisite for involuntary treatment. Appellant asserts that less evidence of necessity is required to justify involuntary treatment under Act 53 than the MHPA, yet fewer procedural protections are provided to children subject to Act 53 than to individuals subjected to involuntary treatment under the MHPA.</p>
    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[162,684,1153,1685]],["BL_104.1",104,[282,318,1146,96]]]'>According to Appellant, the MHPA provides checks at each stage of the examination and commitment process that make it constitutionally sound, but which are absent from Act 53. Specifically, while an emergency examination may be made under the MHPA only upon a showing of immediate need for treatment, under Act 53, initiation of proceedings requires only “sufficient facts and good reason for the commitment.” 71 P.S. § 1690.112a(a). Likewise, Appellant advances the position that, under Act 53, minors may be involuntarily committed without any evidence of specific conduct within the preceding 30 days indicating the need for involuntary treatment; minors may be involuntarily committed for up to 45 days even though not all of the criteria for commitment have been established by clear and convincing evidence; and, while the court is required to find that the minor will benefit from involuntary treatment services, there is no standard of proof by which the court is to make this finding. Moreover, Appellant maintains that minors may be committed for unlimited successive 45-day periods with few procedural safeguards; minors have no right to be released by the facility or treatment program as soon as the director determines that treatment is no longer necessary; minors have no right to the assistance of an independent medical expert; and minors have no right to be committed only on the basis of a medical determination regarding the need for involuntary treatment. Related thereto, Appellant avers Act 53 is unconstitutional insofar as it fails to require that minors be committed to the least restrictive placement setting that also meets their treatment needs. At a minimum, he claims that, where, in the view of qualified professionals, the best means of meeting an individual’s need for treatment dictates community placement, <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>institutionalization contrary to that professional judgment violates that individual’s due process rights.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[278,438,1153,1525]]]'>Next, Appellant contends that Act 53 fails to provide the process which is due under the Constitution. Specifically, Appellant stresses the individual’s interests and casts the assessment as extremely intrusive. As, under Act 53, the assessment is ordered upon the filing of a petition by the minor’s parent or guardian alleging drug dependence, Appellant asserts that the statute on its face deprives the child of fundamental rights and that, at a minimum, the minor is entitled to notice and an initial hearing to test the sufficiency of the petition prior to the initial assessment. Additionally, Appellant maintains that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Parham v. J.R., </em><a href="/us/442/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="442 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1532102" data-case-paths="/us/442/0584-01">442 U.S. 584</a>, <a href="/us/442/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="442 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1532102" data-case-paths="/us/442/0584-01">99 S.Ct. 2493</a>, <a href="/us/442/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="442 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1532102" data-case-paths="/us/442/0584-01">61 L.Ed.2d 101</a> (1979), requires the commitment decision to involve a careful analysis of the youth’s background and treatment history, as well as an examination, in order to comport with due process. Appellant argues the full and comprehensive inquiry required in <em>Parham </em>is not provided by Act 53, which allows the commitment decision to rest on an assessment triggered by a petition of untested allegations. Moreover, Appellant contends that Act 53 fails to require notice when the petition is filed, when the court orders an assessment, and when the court schedules a hearing. Related thereto, while Appellant acknowledges that Act 53 requires the appointment of counsel at the same time an assessment is ordered, it does not specifically provide for counsel to be present at the assessment or the ability to challenge the administration of the assessment. Thus, Appellant focuses upon the need for full due process protection before the assessment of the minor is ordered.</p>
    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.6",104,[276,1995,1150,363]],["BL_105.1",105,[173,318,1153,1018]]]'>Additionally, Appellant asserts that Act 53 infringes upon an individual’s right to privacy. Appellant details that the right to privacy is a fundamental right protected under both constitutions, and that the assessment constitutes a substantial invasion of privacy. Moreover, Appellant also submits, <em>inter alia, </em>that Act 53’s definition of “drug dependent” is unconstitutionally vague. According to Appellant, Act 53’s definition <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>of “drug dependent person” does not correspond to the definition of substance dependence set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (“DSM-IV”), which is a classification of mental disorders developed and published under the auspices of the American Psychiatric Association. Appellant argues that, by failing to track the DSM-IV, Act 53 allows a minor to be involuntarily committed without an appropriate medical diagnosis. Furthermore, Appellant offers that the procedures adopted by Allegheny County highlight the facial deficiencies of Act 53. Specifically, Appellant points to procedures requiring questioning of the petitioner at the time the petition is filed, the requirement that a parent or guardian serve a copy of the order upon the minor, and the prohibition against attachments being issued prior to the hearing. Appellant also contends that the judge’s role as a neutral arbitrator during the hearing on the petition is compromised by Act 53’s statutory scheme because the presiding judge performs both prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions at the hearing on the petition.</p>
    <p id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[173,1378,1153,796]]]'>Finally, Appellant alleges that Act 53 was unconstitutionally applied to him with respect to the manner in which he was taken into custody, his detention in a holding cell and, subsequently, at a facility for delinquent minors, and by how he was kept in leg irons and shackles throughout the proceedings. Appellant maintains the record does not reflect that a warrant or any other such document was issued justifying his custody.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Appellant stresses his detention was therefore illegal, and any statements he made during that detention should have been suppressed. With respect to having been shackled during the proceedings, Appellant avers the trial court should have made an independent determination as to whether the restraints were necessary instead of blindly deferring to the sheriffs office, which indicated unrestrained subjects were contrary to its policy.</p>

According to the Commonwealth, Act 53 represents an effort to ensure parents’ ability to act in their child’s best interests when confronted with a situation in which they require the assistance of the state. Thus, the constitutional rights of the parent and the child are in tension.</p>
    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[270,1346,1149,576]]]'>The Commonwealth advocates that Act 53 properly balances the constitutional rights of the parents and the child. It argues that Act 53 is explicitly civil in nature with a focus on treatment and recovery. Thus, in the situation where evading treatment may be harmful, therapeutic concerns are ill-served by a process that is animated by the restrictive approach to due process that is characterized by criminal procedure. The Commonwealth, in asserting the constitutionality of Act 53, points to the procedure for providing involuntary mental health treatment of a minor under the MHPA and urges our adoption of the approach taken by the Superior Court.</p>

Concerning the argument that Appellant did not have the benefit of counsel during the pre-hearing assessment, the Commonwealth highlights that a medical assessment is not a <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>police interrogation as in a criminal case. In essence, the Commonwealth submits that Appellant’s grandmother enabled Appellant, her grandchild, “to ‘see someone,’ so to speak, who was a qualified professional, about his drug problem, in order to see if he indeed had a serious problem, needed treatment for it and needed to go to [a] facility to get it.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 24. As an assessment is essentially a medical proceeding, the Commonwealth maintains that counsel had no role to play at that preliminary stage.</p>
    <p id="b107-4" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[160,817,1154,847]]]'>Finally, the Commonwealth asserts the Superior Court properly determined Appellant was not deprived of substantive due process rights by virtue of having been handcuffed and shackled during the Act 53 hearing. This treatment, in and of itself, did not violate the Constitution, nor did it interfere with Appellant’s right to counsel, according to the Commonwealth. As the Superior Court explained, Appellant was not before a jury and there is no reason to presume that a seasoned and well-regarded juvenile court trial judge was prejudiced by seeing Appellant in restraints. Moreover, Appellant was confined by these restraints for a relatively brief period of time and the trial judge specifically considered whether the restraints prevented Appellant from communicating with counsel, and concluded they did not interfere with that relationship. Thus, the Commonwealth asks that we affirm the unanimous decision of the Superior Court.</p>

For purposes of this appeal, it is not contested by the parties that involuntarily requiring a minor to receive drug therapy implicates to some degree the child’s liberty interest. Therefore, we find that Appellant, as a minor, enjoys a liberty interest protected by due process concerns that are implicated by Act 53. We note, however, that a minor’s constitutional rights are generally limited by the state’s special interests in guiding children’s lives, and by traditional state deference to parental autonomy in child rearing. Thus, constitutional protections do not necessarily apply with equal force to children and adults. <em>See, e.g., Bellotti v.

It is civil in nature, and its purpose is the treatment of drug or alcohol dependent children, not their punishment. As the <em>Parham </em>Court recognized, the issues of civil commitment “are essentially medical in character.” <em><a href="/us/442/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="442 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1532102" data-case-paths="/us/442/0584-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/442/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="442 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1532102" data-case-paths="/us/442/0584-01">at 609</a>, <a href="/us/442/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="442 U.S. 584" data-case-ids="1532102" data-case-paths="/us/442/0584-01">99 S.Ct. 2493</a>. Thus, we offer as a general proposition that involuntary commitment for therapeutic purposes does not need to mirror the procedures for a criminal trial to pass constitutional challenge. Related thereto, we are mindful that the process to be accorded to minors needs to be flexible and based upon common sense and the needs of a particular situation. <em>See Morrissey, </em><a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">408 U.S. at 481</a>, <a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">92 S.Ct. 2593</a>.</p>

Yet, consistent with <em>Parham, </em>the rights of a minor are limited by traditional state deference to parental autonomy in childrearing, as well as the state’s special interest in guiding children’s lives. Even more precisely, at least in this context, the fundamental right of a parent or guardian to care for his or her child, as well as the state’s <em>parens patriae </em>power to care for its citizens, are implicated. Indeed, guided by the <em>Parham </em>Court’s focus on the right of the parent in this context, and its presumption that a parent will act in the best interest of his or her child, we find the right of the parent to make decisions for the care, custody, and control of his or her child is paramount.</p>

The <em>Parham </em>Court emphasized that, while a minor enjoyed certain protections, the significant right of the parent or guardian to make decisions regarding care is paramount. Moreover, it is presumed, in the absence of neglect or abuse, that a parent or guardian acts in the best interest of his or her child. Therefore, the filing of a petition to initiate the Act 53 process, signed by a parent or guardian setting forth facts and good reason for treatment, and subject to penalty of unsworn falsification to authorities, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4904, renders sufficient protection to the minor with respect to this simple triggering of the assessment process. As we noted in the context of involuntary treatment under the MHPA, such a petition is “a warrant to take [a child] to the doctor, not to take [a child] to jail.” <em>J.M., </em><a href="/pa/556/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="556 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="607216" data-case-paths="/pa/556/0063-01">556 Pa. at 75</a>, <a href="/a2d/726/1041-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="726 A.2d 1041" data-case-ids="11594282,11594296,11594326,607173,607186,607216" data-case-paths="/a2d/726/1041-01,/a2d/726/1041-02,/a2d/726/1041-03,/pa/556/0062-01,/pa/556/0062-02,/pa/556/0063-01">726 A.2d at 1047</a>.</p>

The <em>Parham </em>Court made manifest that such a medical diagnostic procedure is not required to be judicial or adversarial in nature, and that the decision should represent the independent judgment of what the child requires based upon all sources of information traditionally relied upon by medical professionals. Here, an assessment regarding inpatient treatment is made by a psychiatrist, a licensed psychologist with specific training in drug and alcohol assessment and treatment, or a certified addiction counselor. Moreover, unlike the process at issue in <em>Parham, </em>the assessment <em>sub judice </em>is not determinative, but, rather, is used in a subsequent formal adversarial proceeding <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>to determine whether inpatient treatment is appropriate. Thus, we find that an assessment rendered by these statutorily-prescribed professionals satisfies <em>Parham’s </em>requirement of a decision made by appropriate medical personnel. Additionally, because only an informal determination regarding the necessity of treatment is required for purposes of due process, we reject Appellant’s assertions that there must be notice and counsel at the assessment and the ability to challenge the administration of the assessment. These formalities urged by Appellant, which are more properly found in criminal proceedings, are in direct conflict with the teachings of <em>Parham. </em>Again, we underscore that the proceedings involve a minor and are civil and therapeutic in nature — for due process purposes, the assessment cannot be characterized as an interrogation or criminal detention.</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[172,1174,1153,1190]],["BL_122.1",122,[272,320,975,44]]]'>As to the hearing itself, we find that the protections provided by Act 53 at the hearing to determine the propriety of treatment meet the minimum protections mandated by our federal Constitution. At the formal hearing, a neutral judge considers testimony regarding the propriety of involuntary treatment. The minor’s counsel is permitted to cross-examine witnesses. If, by clear and convincing evidence, the judge finds that the child is drug dependent, incapable of accepting or unwilling to accept voluntary treatment, and will benefit from involuntary treatment, the judge will order treatment for a period of 45 days or less. Each additional 45-day period of treatment is to be evaluated after a review hearing with the same safeguards as noted above. Due process protections are to be flexible, fair, and grounded in common sense. We stress that we are dealing with a process in which a parent or guardian is seeking medical treatment for their child. This statute is civil in nature and involves therapeutic treatment for a brief duration — as well as the hope of recovery and a brighter future for the child. In sum, we conclude that those aspects of the Act 53 process challenged here comport with the minimal due process protections required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as informed by the <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>United States Supreme Court’s decision in Parham.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

We note that, while a comparison between similar statutes may certainly be a useful tool to consider the protections due in this situation, we agree with Appellant that the constitutionality of Act 53 rises or falls on an analysis of that statute itself, which, unlike the MHPA, applies solely to parents and guardians and their children. Moreover, as explained above, we believe that it is the analysis set forth in the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Parham </em>resolving a similar due process challenge that is of greater relevance in determining whether Act 53 is inconsistent with the protections required by the federal Constitution. Finally, Appellant agrees that certain aspects of the MHPA provide greater protections for individuals subject to that statute than those set forth under Act 53, and, in addition, points to statutes from other states providing for involuntary commitment for substance abuse treatment for minors which provide greater protections. Appellant’s Brief at 10 n. 11. Similarly, while not the subject of this appeal, Appellant points to additional procedures implemented by the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas concerning Act 53 proceedings which offer extra protection to minors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> We only consider in this appeal, however, <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>whether Act 53 provides sufficient minimum protections to pass constitutional challenge pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Moreover, we uphold the constitutionality of a statute unless it “clearly, palpably, and plainly violates constitutional rights.” <em>Ludwig, </em><a href="/pa/583/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="583 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="687707" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0006-01">583 Pa. at 15</a>, <a href="/pa/583/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="874 A.2d 623" data-case-ids="687707,8954766" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0006-01,/a2d/874/0623-01">874 A.2d at 628</a>. Therefore, while the provision of additional protections for minors as exemplified in other statutes and in Allegheny County may be salutary, they do not render Act 53 itself unconstitutional. In this light, Appellant’s argument for additional protections is more properly made to the General Assembly.</p>

The provisions set forth in Act 53 — which provide for a petition by a parent or guardian, an assessment by a medical professional, a formal hearing prior to commitment to a facility for drug and alcohol therapy, which includes the right to counsel, testimony before a judge to establish the propriety of commitment by clear and convincing evidence, the cross-examination of witnesses, and periodic review embracing the same protections every 45 days — go beyond the minimum process that is due to pass constitutional muster. We find, for the reasons set forth above, the procedures set forth in Act 53, on their face, strike an appropriate balance between a minor’s right to not be confined unnecessarily for medical treatment, his or her parent or guardian’s right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children, and the state’s interest in both using its resources appropriately and not imposing unnecessary procedural obstacles that would discourage children in need or their families from seeking necessary medical assistance. Thus, we hold that Act 53 does <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>not violate the due process protections required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>

Here, the Act 53 hearing did not involve a jury, but a judge. The Superior Court opined there is no reason to believe that the judge’s initial observation of Appellant in restraints rendered the judge incapable of adjudicating the matter fairly or that the judge was biased by Appellant being restrained. Moreover, the Superior Court noted that the juvenile court judge believed the hearing was only to last five to ten minutes, and that Appellant was a flight risk. Finally, the court specifically considered whether or not Appellant could effectively communicate with counsel. The Superior Court reasoned that the juvenile court judge observed that Appellant was able to communicate with his counsel, and noted that Appellant failed to offer any specifics as to how the restraints did in fact interfere with his ability to communicate with counsel.

Referring to <em>Parham, </em>the high Court reversed the lower tribunal and determined that, as the statute required an examination by mental health professionals concerned with whether the child needs and can benefit from institutional care, that such professionals engaged in a full background history from all available sources, if such professionals conclude that institutional care is not in the best interests of the child, it must refuse the child's admission, and that the statute required the child’s condition be reviewed periodically, it satisfied the criteria in <em>Parham. </em>Thus, the Court reversed the lower court's order finding the Pennsylvania statute unconstitutional.</p>

Appellant maintains that prior to the hearing he was taken by law enforcement officers without notice and without a document justifying this action.

After the Act 53 hearing, Appellant asserts that he was held at a facility for delinquent or adjudicated youth, and then transported in restraints to the drug abuse treatment facility where he underwent treatment. The Superior Court did not address this issue. Before us, the Commonwealth asserts that, for this reason, it should not constitute part of our current review. Our independent review of Appellant's brief to the Superior Court reveals that Appellant limited his argument regarding improper restraint to that which occurred during the Act 53 hearing and, while mentioning his restraint prior to the hearing, failed to offer any discussion that this was a violation of due process.

In most instances, this is all the care a child requires. However, if, after a period of outpatient care, the child’s abnormal emotional condition persists, he may be referred by the local clinic staff to an affiliated regional mental hospital.</blockquote>

I would hold, though, that, in view of the substantial involuntary commitment periods authorized by Act 53, and the possibility of erroneous deprivations due to the brevity of the assessment process, the Fourteenth Amendment entitles a minor to a more thorough evaluation concerning the need for inpatient treatment than the relatively scanty procedures outlined in Act 53.

In my opinion, the circumstances surrounding the underlying commitment in this case illustrate the need for such additional protections. Here, a fourteen-year-old boy was subjected, without any prior notice, to arrest and shackling at his home by multiple law enforcement agents, who then transported him to the courthouse where he remained shackled throughout the entire evaluative process, including the court hearing. All of this occurred without any criminal charges having been lodged. Although I agree with the majority to the degree it concludes that the judge was not likely prejudiced in his fact-finding role, the fact that Act 53 appears to allow for such heavy-handed actions against minors within a purely civil context supports the conclusion that its due process protections are inadequate to pass constitutional scrutiny.</p>
