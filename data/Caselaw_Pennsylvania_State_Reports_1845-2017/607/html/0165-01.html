He contends that “the Lebanon County police took advantage of [the] same Fifth Amendment violation in obtaining their confession.” Martin’s Brief, at 22.

Thus, he <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>maintains, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to litigate his motion to suppress his confession to Lebanon County detectives on the grounds that the confession violated his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and for failing to offer evidence at the suppression hearing in support of such claim.</p>

Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that the F.B.I. report referencing Martin’s statement to Agent Vick on October 5, 1993 clearly establishes that Martin initiated the communication about his criminal acts. It maintains that Agent Vick did not interrogate Martin; rather the only communication initiated by Agent Vick was in relation to changing the placement of Martin’s handcuffs because he was suffering discomfort. The Commonwealth concludes that the conduct of the law enforcement officers was entirely consistent with the prevailing law allowing defendants to initiate conversations with police, even after they invoked their Fifth Amendment right to counsel.

In the court’s view, it was Martin, not Agent Vick, who initiated actual discussion about the murder; indeed, even after the agent reminded Martin of his previous invocation of his rights to silence and counsel, Martin expressed willingness to discuss the incident, was re-read <em>Miranda </em>warnings by the agent, and explicitly waived his rights both verbally and by signing the F.B.I.’s standardized waiver form.

PCRA Ct. Op., 3/4/04, at 73. The court’s perception of the great differential between the two mitigation “packages” convinced it that appellant had been prejudiced.

Counsel followed Martin’s instructions regarding his psychological history, yet was able to reveal a bit of Martin’s past through his mother’s testimony; he respected Martin’s instruction and still gave the jury insight into his client through a witness counsel felt would be more readily accepted by the jury. Whether it would be more readily accepted by appellate judges is not the issue.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[258,1101,1153,1260]],["BL_267.1",267,[155,321,1146,91]]]'>Counsel is presumed effective, and to overcome this presumption, Martin must satisfy a three-pronged test and demonstrate that: (1) the underlying substantive claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel did not have a reasonable basis for his actions or failure to act; and (3) Martin suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s deficient performance. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="227" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="228" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 975 (1987). The evidence presented to the PCRA court as confirmation of counsel’s ineffectiveness in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence fails to meet this burden. Attorney Kilgore did not pursue such evidence under direction from his client. Attorney Kilgore was under no obligation to pressure Martin to present such evidence when it was quite clear he was not interested in the prospect. Nor, as the majority and PCRA court hold, was Attorney Kilgore required by the governing ineffectiveness standard to circumvent his client’s wishes and investigate or present evidence on a line of argumentation his client clearly did not wish to pursue. Attorney Kilgore followed Martin’s instructions, detrimental or not, and presented his case employing reasonable, strategic techniques. Pursuant to this Court’s precedent, he should not be found ineffective for such actions. I would find the portion of the PCRA court’s order granting a new penalty phase should be reversed <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>and the case remanded for reinstatement of Martin’s original death sentence.</p>
