I <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>believe the Court has an obligation to grapple with these significant recurrent issues and to provide guidance to the bench and bar.</p>

The detective had received a phone call approximately one hour earlier from a confidential informant, who said that an individual exactly matching Appellee’s appearance was offering crack cocaine for sale at that specific location. Appellee did not engage in any suspicious behavior during the ten-minute period during which this detective, alone, observed him. However, when another officer arrived shortly thereafter in a marked patrol car and pulled next to where Appellee was standing, Appellee removed his jacket, threw it and his cell phone onto the street, and fled in the opposite direction. The officer and the detective gave chase, overtaking Appellee by using a Taser. The police recovered Appellee’s jacket from the street, searched it, and seized cocaine and an open pack of latex gloves from the right pocket. After a hearing on Appellee’s subsequent motion to suppress, the trial court denied the motion. Appellee was convicted of possession of controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver, and possession of drug paraphernalia. On appeal to the Superior Court, Appellee’s judgment of sentence was reversed on the basis that Appellee had been arrested without probable cause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Specifically, the High Court held that the existence, in combination, of two specific factors supported reasonable suspicion, to wit, 1) presence in a high-crime area; and 2) unprovoked flight. This Court subsequently recognized the significance of the <em>Wardlow </em>holding, and stated “it is evident that unprovoked flight in a high crime area is sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop under the Fourth Amendment.” <em>In re D.M., </em><a href="/pa/566/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="566 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="706229" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0445-01">566 Pa. 445</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="781 A.2d 1161" data-case-ids="706229,9480622" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0445-01,/a2d/781/1161-01">781 A.2d 1161</a>, 1164 (2001). Further, in <em>In re D.M., </em>this Court held, as a matter of both federal and state constitutional law, that where a person, who exactly matches an anonymous caller’s physical description of a man wielding a gun at a specified location, flees upon observing the arrival of a police officer, there is sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em><a href="/pa/566/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="781 A.2d 1161" data-case-ids="706229,9480622" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0445-01,/a2d/781/1161-01">Id.</a> </em>Specifically, this Court held that the existence, in combination, of two specific factors supported reasonable suspicion, to wit, 1) an exact match in the physical description of an individual reportedly engaged in illegal activity; and 2) unprovoked flight.</p>

Similarly, under <em>In re D.M., </em>once the existence of unprovoked flight by a person who exactly matches the physical description of an individual reportedly engaged in illegal activity is established, that also is the end of the inquiry. The Commonwealth has thereby, and without more, fulfilled its obligation to demonstrate that the pursuing police officer had reasonable suspicion that the fleeing suspect was engaged in criminal activity.</p>

In essence, two exceptions to the totality of the circumstances analysis have been created by the United States Supreme Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and this Court. Yet, Pennsylvania <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>courts, at every level, routinely fail to appreciate what <em>Ward-low </em>and <em>In re DM. </em>hold is the dispositive effect of unprovoked flight by a person in a high-crime area or by a person who exactly matches the physical description of an individual reportedly engaged in illegal activity, in the determination of the existence of reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative detention. I believe it is incumbent upon this Court to supply the guidance necessary so that suppression motion rulings regarding the existence of reasonable suspicion are rendered under the appropriate legal standard. Accordingly, I would not dismiss this appeal. Rather, I would apply the holdings of <em>Wardlow </em>and <em>In re DM., </em>and accordingly would reverse the order of the Superior Court, and reinstate the judgment of sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>
