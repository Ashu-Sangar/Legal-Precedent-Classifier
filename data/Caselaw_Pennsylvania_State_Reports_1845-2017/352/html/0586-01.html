Such rules and regulations have been duly formulated, and one of them provides that “No member of the . . . force shall be discharged, reduced in rank, or lose any pay except by order of the Commissioner, or pursuant to sentence of court-martial, approved by the Commissioner”; that is, the option is given to the Commissioner either by his own action to dismiss a member of the force (as he did in the present instance), or to refer the case to a court-martial but with the reservation that its sentence must be approved by him.</p>

We are unable to give to this curt and meagre phrase any such broad interpretation. The legislature has many times evidenced its ability to enact unambiguous provisions governing the appointment, promotion and reduction of policemen and other public employes and establishing protection for them against arbitrary and unjustified dismissals. Such provisions, for example, are to be found in the Act of June 25, 1919, P. L. 581, for the government of cities of the first class, in which the entire Article XIX, as amended by the Act of July 29, 1941, P. L. 579, is devoted to that subject; also in the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, for the government of cities of the second class, which in Article III, section 1, as amended by the Act of June 15,1937, P. L. 1761, imposes detailed and elaborate restrictions upon the appointment and discharge of policemen, and in the Acts of May 23, 1907, P. L. 206, and June 3,1943, P. L. 826, which contain similar regulations for second class cities with respect to the method of appointing and discharging other employes in the classified service; also in the Act of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, for the government of cities of the third class, which in Article XLIV, as amended by the Act of June 4, 1941, P. L. 83, sets up an elaborate civil service system for the police and other departments; also in the Act of June 5, 1941, P. L. 84, regulating the appointment and removal of members of the police force in boroughs, incorporated towns and townships of the first class. Then there are various statutes establishing such provisions for certain departments of the <em>State </em>government ; for example, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Act of June 16, 1937, P. L. 1762, Article III, for employes of the Liquor Control Board, and the Act of June 5, 1937, P. L. 1705, section 19, for employes of the State Board of Housing. Similar provisions are established by section 2504-A, added to the Administrative Code of 1929, P. L. 177, by the Act of June 24, 1937, <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>P. L. 2003, for employes of the Department of Public Assistance, the State Board of Public Assistance and the local boards; by the Act of December 5,1936, P. L. (1937) 2897, section 208, for employes of the Department of Labor and Industry administering the Unemployment Compensation Law; and by the Act of August 6, 1941, P. L. 861, sections 13, 14 and 15, for employes of the Pennsylvania Board of Parole. By the Act of June 6, 1939, P. L. 250, adding section 452 to the Administrative Code of 1929, P. L. 177, a State Civil Service Commission was created, and the Civil Service Act of August 5, 1941, P. L. 752,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> established a comprehensive system under which there was placed within the control of that body the classified service of most of the departments and boards of the state government hereinbefore referred to; incidentally it is significant that in the list of such departments and boards enumerated in Article I, section 3(c) of that act the State Police Force is not included as presumably it would have been had the legislature deemed that the members of the force were, or intended that they should be, under civil service protection. It is thus obvious that not only has the legislature seen fit to bestow such protection upon the employes of some state agencies and not others, but in each and every case where it so intended it has expressed its purpose in precise and unmistakable language.</p>

L. 2436, is that rules and regulations should be adopted “for the filing and hearing of charges” against members of the State Police. Nothing is specifically or categorically said, as in the language of all the other acts cited, to the effect that no member shall be <em>dismissed </em>unless charges be filed and established at a hearing — in other words, that the filing and hearing of charges is a <em>prerequisite to dismissal. </em>The act says nothing whatever of the <em>discharge </em>
      <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>of members of the force or of the <em>causes </em>for discharge. Its language can reasonably be interpreted to mean nothing more than that the Commissioner should afford suitable opportunity for charges or complaints to be made against a member of the force by third persons<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> or by other members and for a hearing, which might be held either by the Commissioner or by someone on his behalf, to consider such charges. All that the act suggests is that some mechanism should be provided whereby charges may be aired and heard, but there is nothing from which it can reasonably be inferred that, unless such a mechanism be resorted to, the <em>Commissioner may not dismiss a member </em>from the service for what he considers good and sufficient reason. If the legislature desires to place members of the State Police Force under civil service protection it may readily do so, employing the same clear language it has used in other instances, but we cannot hold, by any justifiable extension of the power of judicial interpretation, that it has manifested such an intention merely by directing the Commissioner, with the approval of the Governor, to make rules and regulations for the filing and hearing of charges against such members. There is, indeed, a grave question whether, if such a construction of the statute were to be adopted, it would not render the constitutionality of the act extremely doubtful. Establishing restrictions on the common law right to discharge employes is a matter of substantive enactment, and the legislature cannot delegate to the Commissioner the power to make what amounts to such an enactment through the medium of “rules and regulations”. Authority may be given to a government official or an administrative agency to make rules and regulations to cover mere matters of detail for the implementation of a statute, but where the statute itself <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>is lacking' in essential substantive provisions the law does not permit a transfer of the power to supply them, for the legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law: <em>Chester County Institution District v.

Policemen and firemen in our cities are protected by law against summary removal without cause, and in the nation neither the President of the United States nor the Chief of Staff of the Army nor anyone else can either in peace or war <em>summarily </em>remove officers from the service or reduce them in rank.

This power to remove <em>does </em>attach to a “legislatively created office” as well as to any other office, unless the Constitution or the Legislature provides to the contrary.

He can summarily order his dismissal <em>or </em>he can subject him to a court martial, the sentence of which court martial is subject to the Commissioner’s approval.

If the Commissioner may summarily dismiss at will one State policeman and not even be required to assign cause or justification for his action, he may arbitrarily dismiss the whole of the force at one and the same time. The adverse effect of the mere existence of such autocratic power in one appointed official upon the morale of a police force need only be hinted at to be realized. Nor is it any extenuation for the existence of such arbitrary power in the Commissioner to say that no Governor would long retain a Commissioner who would sweepingly and without “charge, cause or reason” dismiss all of the members of the Force.

But, until the situation is so corrected, the deficiency in the law and its concomitant possibility for harm will endure. I think that is especially regrettable under the circumstances. Not by the most attenuated inference can I bring myself to conclude that the legislature ever intended by its relevant enactments that the law should be as this Court now finds it to be. On the contrary, it is my opinion that, under the law as it now exists and for years has existed, no enlisted member of the State Police Force can be discharged or dismissed during the term of his enlistment except upon the judgment of a court-martial after charges and due hearing in accordance with the regulations, long since promulgated by the Commissioner (formerly Superintendent), in pursuance of the power legislatively con<a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>ferred upon him to make rules and regulations for the governance of the State Police.</p>

In answer to the first ground it should be borne in mind that the common law rule, as to removability from appointive office, does not obtain in respect of a legislatively created office where the legislature has indicated that the appointee is removable by some method other than discharge by the appointor. Such a legislative intention, in connection with the discharge or removal of a member of the State Police, is evidenced, in my opinion, by the statutes by which we are here bound and the rules and regulations duly adopted pursuant to the legally presumed knowledge of the legislature. The second ground assigned by the majority is equally untenable. It relies upon an invalid assumption by the Commissioner of the power to discharge in open disregard of legislative intent. After all, the question involved in this case is to be determined alone by statutory interpretation. Certainly, there is no Act of Assembly which expressly authorizes the Commissioner to discharge summarily members of the State Police. Why then, merely because of the common law rule, should we impute to pertinent statute law something which the legislature could not reasonably have intended? What justification can there be for ascribing, by judicial construction, to the administrator of the State Police the power of a Praetorian Guard over the personnel of the Force?</p>

In passing, it may be observed that the Commissioner is hardly to be thought of as an appointor to public office in the broad signification of that term as it is ordinarily contemplated in the law. In reality, the Commissioner is little more than a recruiting officer so far as the selection of the members of the State Police is concerned. Manifestly, his discretion is considerably restricted. Statutes prescribe qualifications for membership; training for applicants is provided; and examinations are held. From the qualified applicants, so ascertained, the Commissioner selects the candidates, who are then <em>“enlisted” </em>in the Force as required by statute.

By Act of June 29, 1937, P. L. 2436, the legislature amended See. 711 of the 1929 Act by providing that “The Commissioner of Pennsylvania Motor [now State] Police . . . shall . . . make rules and regulations subject to the approval of the Governor, [1] prescribing qualifications prerequisite to, or retention of, membership in the force; [2] for the enlistment, training, discipline, and conduct of the members of the force; [3] for the selection and promotion of such members on the basis of merit; [4] for the filing and hearing of charges against such members, and such other rules and regulations as are deemed necessary for the control and regulation of the Motor Police Force.” It will be noted that the 1937 amendment in no way restricted or enlai’ged the Commissioner’s power to make necessary rules and regulations. His power in such regard was the same after the amendment of 193r as it had been continuously ever since the Act of 1905. All the 1937 amendment did was to specify in the four particulars, as above numbered, certain matters which <em>should </em>be covered by such rules and regulations. So far as the direction to make rules and regulations “for the filing and hearing of charges against such members” is concerned, that provision was but confirmatory of what had already been done by the Superintendent (Commissioner) under the power to makes rules and regulations. See General Order 22, the Buies of Courts-Martial applicable to the Pennsylvania State Police.</p>

Article 4 thereof provides that: “No member of the Pennsylvania Motor Police Force shall be discharged, reduced in rank, or lose any pay except <em>by order of the Commissioner, </em>or pursuant to sentence of court-martial, approved by the Commissioner.” (Emphasis supplied). The majority of this Court say that by virtue of the foregoing Article the Commissioner has the right to discharge an enlisted member of the State Police Force without cause or reason. The ineffectuality of the authority to that end in Article 4 lies in the fact that the Commissioner, and not the legislature, created it. In this connection, is it not strange that, if the Commissioner enjoyed throughout, by virtue of the common law, the power to dismiss at will a member of the Force, he should find it necessary in 1939 to arrogate to himself such power by the expedient of promulgating a new regulation? The fact is that, from the time of the creation of the State Police Force, there has never been an intimation in any of its rules or regulations, and certainly in no statute, that the Commissioner had the power to dismiss a member at will <em>save </em>for the single interpolation in Article 4 of General Order No. 20 promulgated by the Commissioner on November 1,1939.</p>

To permit the Commissioner, under the guise of promulgating rules and regulations for the administration of the State Police, to affect and impair substantive rights of members of the Force (created by contract of enlistment as required by statute) would constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Nothing less than an express statute could take away or provide for the taking away of such rights and, then, only as to prospective enlistments. In the case of federal enlistees, since 1806 they have entered into their federal contracts of enlistment bound with knowledge of the provisions in <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>the existing Articles of War as to the terminability of their enlistments. But, as yet, there is no statute in Pennsylvania which specifically authorizes anyone to abrogate summarily the contract of an enlisted member of the State Police Force. To give to the statutory provision, which directs the Commissioner to “make rules and regulations”, the scope for which he contends would be to render the exercisable authority unconstitutional and, that, we are forbidden to do by a well-established rule of construction: <em>Pennsylvania Company, etc. v.

Being such, it was competent for the legislature to authorize him to make rules and regulations for necessary administrative purposes. See <em>Manhattan General Equipment Co. v.

It is never to be presumed, however, that the legislature intends to delegate power to create, affect or impair substantive rights. Only the legislature itself can act to that end and, then, necessarily subject, of course, to pertinent constitutional limitations. As a corollary to the rule which forbids a delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency (see <em>Hotel Casey Company v. Ross, </em>supra, <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>at p. 578), it is axiomatic in the body of law, which has developed with the wide extension of administrative agencies in this country, that regulations promulgated by such agencies must conform strictly with the laws creating and empowering the agencies; must be reasonable; must be designed to carry out the purpose of the cognate laws; and must not assume to amend them: <em>Stark v.

Of course, it was not sufficient for that purpose and for the very good reason that it was not intended to do so. There was no occasion to provide civil service for the State Police. The legislature, having authorized the Commissioner to make rules and regulations for the control and regulation of the State Police, is presumed to know what rules were extant pursuant to that authority and that, under the rules and regulations so adopted and promulgated, there was a provision for the filing of charges against a member of the State Police and for a hearing thereon before a court-martial. To those in <em>enlisted </em>governmental service, court-martial affords due process of law. Cf. <em>United States ex rel. French v. Weeks, Secretary of War, </em><a href="/us/259/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="259 U.S. 326" data-case-ids="423314" data-case-paths="/us/259/0326-01">259 </a><a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a><a href="/us/259/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="259 U.S. 326" data-case-ids="423314" data-case-paths="/us/259/0326-01">U.S. 326</a>, 335; <em>Reaves v.

Furthermore, the argument that the legislature has provided civil service wherever it thought it was needed proves too much. Since the legislature has deemed it necessary to protect by civil service the tenure of the members of various administrative bodies of the State as well as the policemen of all cities of all classes, is it reasonable to presume that it intended to leave unprotected the members of the State Police Force? In reality, I think that they have been and are protected by the rules of court-martial duly made applicable to that body pursuant to legislative authority.</p>
    <p id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.4",644,[274,946,1150,1140]]]'>As the decision of this Court is placed upon the power to discharge at will, which the majority attribute to the Commissioner, it is unnecessary to consider the possible additional basis for affirmance suggested in the majority opinion. It may be pointed out, however, that, to hold that mandamus does not lie because the period of the term of enlistment, current at the time Ruch was dismissed, had expired when he sought the remedy, would be to render effective, and thereby honor, the illegal and unwarranted action by which he was deprived of his membership in the State Police. And, that, I do not think the law favors or requires. Ruch, having been seriously harmed in his personal and property rights by the unlawful and arbitrary dismissal, is entitled to reinstatement. His right to mandamus (the appropriate remedy) to effect that result is clear. The extent of the relief possible under the circumstances is a matter which a court could properly mold with entire justice to both the State and the petitioner. He could at least be restored to the status and the portion of the term unexpired at the time of his wrongful dismissal.</p>
