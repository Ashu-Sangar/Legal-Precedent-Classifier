Here the lien arose on March 10, 1943, and notice thereof was filed with the Prothonotary of Adams County on July 21, 1943, some six months before the lien of the execution creditor attached by virtue of its levy.</p>

In <em>Michigan v. United States, </em><a href="/us/317/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="317 U.S. 338" data-case-ids="303873" data-case-paths="/us/317/0338-01">317 U.

The Supreme Court said, per Mr. Chief Justice Stone (pp. 340, 341) : “We do not stop to inquire whether this construction of the state statutes is the correct one, for we think the argument ignores the effect of a lien for federal taxes under the supremacy clause of the Constitution. The establishment of a tax lien by Congress is an exercise of its constitutional power ‘to lay and collect taxes’. Article I, §8, of the Constitution. <em>United States v.
