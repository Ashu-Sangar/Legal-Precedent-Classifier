His car was running about a <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>foot oi’ two to the west of the centre line of the road. Freeport Road is 30 feet in width and is a through state highway. North Street, which is also 30 feet in width, intersects Freeport Road from the west but does not cross it. There is a stop sign on the southerly side of North Street 21 feet 8 inches back of the road. From this sign there is a view up the road for a distance of 430 feet, and from a point four feet closer to the road the view north is increased to 810 feet; conversely, views for the same distances respectively may be had down Freeport Road to these two points. The street light at the intersection was burning at the time of the accident which gave rise to the present action.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[260,988,1151,1015]]]'>Defendant’s .bus, coming east on North Street, stopped at the sign and then, starting up again, continued on toward and into Freeport Road at a speed of five to six miles per hour. Plaintiff did not see the bus, although it was fully lit up, until he was 50 to 70 feet away and the bus was 4 to 6 feet back on North Street; assuming, he says, that it would stop before emerging on Freeport Road, he kept on and did not apply his brakes until he was 25 to 30 feet away and the bus was 2 or 3 feet out on the road. His car struck it on or immediately behind its left front wheel, the bus being then 4 or 5 feet past the centre line of Freeport Road. The force of the collision was very great, wrecking the front of plaintiff’s car beyond repair and causing considerable damage also to the bus. Plaintiff was rendered unconscious, sustained various injuries, and brought this suit to recover damages. A verdict in his favor was nullified by the court’s entry of judgment for defendant n. o. v.</p>

From the point where the bus started at the stop sign to the place where the collision <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>occurred was a distance of 40 to 42 feet; for the bus to traverse that distance consumed about 5 seconds; during that time plaintiff covered approximately 220 feet and the passage of the bus from the stop sign to and across half the width of Freeport Road was in his plain view; nevertheless he continued on and made no attempt to stop his car until he was so near that collision was inevitable. He bases his defense against the charge of contributory negligence on the provision of the Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, section 1016, as amended, which forbids the operator of any vehicle from entering a through highway, when an official “thru traffic stop” sign has been erected, without first coming to a full stop within a reasonable distance before entering the intersection on such highway, and on the provision of section 1014(c), which requires the operator of a vehicle entering a through highway to yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching in either direction on such highway. It is true that, because of those provisions, it has frequently been ruled that a person operating a vehicle on a through highway is justified in assuming that anyone approaching on an intersecting road or street will obey the stop signal and give him the right of way as required by the code: <em>Rhinehart v.
