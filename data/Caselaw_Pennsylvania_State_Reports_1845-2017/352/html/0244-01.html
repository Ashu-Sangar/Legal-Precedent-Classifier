He was survived by three daughters, three sons, and a grandson (child of a deceased daughter). In separate paragraphs of his will, testator made specific devises of three farms, one to <em>each </em>of his three daughters for life, with remainders to their respective children, <em>if any, </em>and upon the happening of a contingency hereinafter recited, then to a named son. Certain <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>shares of stock were bequeathed under similar provisions.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[217,390,1149,743]]]'>The question involved relates to title to a farm and shares of stock bequeathed to a daughter, Ida Josephene, for life. The relevant language requiring construction is in the sixth item of the will reading: <em>“I </em>give and devise to my daughter Ida Josephene the farm . . . during the term of her natural life . . . and after the death of my said .daughter Ida Josephene then I do give and devise the same to her lawful children, if any, and to the survivor of them forever, but if all of said children, if any shall die without lawful issue before attaining the age of twenty-one years then I do give and devise the same to my son George E. forever. . . .” The gift of the life estate and remainder of the shares of stock is similar to the devise of the farm and will not be recited.</p>

As pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant, if a literal construction of the words were adopted an absurd result would ensue. If the daughter had married and had given birth to one child, and the child had died an hour after birth, the remainder would have passed to the son; whereas, if the same child had died an hour before birth and thus the daughter never having had any child born to her, the property would not go to the son. The learned chancellor agreed that such a “result is unquestionably, absurd and unreasonable”. Where words used might under a given construction lead to a result which is highly improbable, the court will lean toward a construction that will carry out the natural intention of the testator. <em>Mayhew’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/307/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="307 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="1138195" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0084-01">307 Pa. 84</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.%20724" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="160 A. 724">160 A. 724</a>; <em>Conner’s Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/318/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="318 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1159610" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0150-01">318 Pa. 150</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.%2015" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="178 A. 15">178 A. 15</a>; <em>Hannach’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/332/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="332 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1186566" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0145-01">332 Pa. 145</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20711" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="2 A.2d 711">2 A. 2d 711</a>.</p>
