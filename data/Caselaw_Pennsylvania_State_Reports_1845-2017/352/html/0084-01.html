S. 1303, entitled “An Act Belating to the Commencement of Actions.” That-very title just quoted indicates that the act had nothing to do with <em>venue. </em>It assumed that there was an action to “commence” and a place to “commence” in and it provided only for <em>service </em>after an action in trespass was commenced in the proper forum. The act prescribed <em>how </em>an action should be commenced — not <em>where </em>it should be commenced. The Act of 1836 was but one section of a <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>ninety section act “relating to the commencement of actions.” The legislature which enacted it might aptly be termed “a procedural legislature,” for in addition to the act whose section 42 we are considering, this legislature enacted an unprecedented number of procedural acts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

I believe most courts have proceeded on the theory that it was taken for granted that no person would institute a suit against a corporation except before a “court of competent jurisdiction” or “in the proper county,” and that therefore the Act of 1836 was only a service act. Some courts of Common Pleas have proceeded on the theory that the act was a venue act.

On the contrary, the phraseology of section 8 of the Act of 1842 indicates that its framers regarded section 42 of the Act of 1836 as exclusively a <em>service </em>act. Since about the only private corporations in 1836 and 1842 were turnpike, bridge and canal and railroad companies, it seems probable that when the legislature passed the Act of 1842 it deemed it a broad enough venue act for all practical purposes.

This Act of 1836, can be accurately described as Justice Mitchell describes the Act of 1901, as “an act whose title and plain general purpose relates solely to method of service.” It may also be pertinently added: “It is not to be presumed that the legislature intended to abrogate or modify a rule of the common law by the enactment of a statute upon the same subject; it is rather to be presumed that no change in the common law was intended, unless the language employed clearly indicates such an intention.” 25 R. C. L., Section 280, p. 1054. Certainly section 42 of the Act of 1836 does not “clearly indicate” <em>any such </em>intention, and this court during the 108 years which intervened between the Act of 1836 and the two line per curiam opinion in the <em>First National Banh of Altoona </em>case, supra, handed down on May 20, 1944, <em>never■ held, </em>that merely the arising in a certain county of a cause of action in trespass against a corporation gave the courts of that county jurisdiction in that case. It is most significant that in not a single case reported in either the Supreme or Superior Court reports (except the <em>Banh of Altoona </em>case, supra, in which a re-argument has been ordered) has jurisdiction in either a trespass or an assumpsit action ever been obtained against a corporation by reason of the cause of action having arisen in the county from whose court the summons issued.</p>

Oil City Boiler Works, </em>supra, that “no suit is authorized against a corporation except in a county where the corporate property is in whole or in part situated, or where it transacts a substantial part of its business.” For us so to rule would make our practice in <em>trespass </em>suits against corporations consistent with our practice in <em>assumpsit </em>suits against corporations and with Eule 2179 of our new Procedural Eules.
