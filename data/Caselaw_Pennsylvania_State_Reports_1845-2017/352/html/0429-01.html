The latter provided “ ‘that the company will loan upon the sole security of the policy ... up to the limit secured by the . . . cash or loan values at the end of the policy year within which application for the loan is made. ...

Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/264/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="264 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1048528" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0505-01">264 Pa. 505</a>, 508, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20847" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="107 A. 847">107 A. 847</a>; <em>Francis v.

By the terms of the loan agreements the interest was not due and payable until the anniversary date of the policy. When the loan agreement referred to the indebtedness and interest thereon equaling or exceeding the loan value shown by the table attached to the policy, it referred to interest due on the anniversary date. It is suggested by the appellant that this construction compelled the company to carry a loan after the security had become inadequate. To this it may be replied that the company, experienced in such matters, should have provided for such a contingency in clear and unequivocal language or required the interest to be paid in advance. By the pleadings it appeared that the value of the policy was increasing in the same sense that the interest was accruing. It is evident that it was not contemplated by the agreements in question that the interest would be exacted before the anniversary date of the policy for by its terms the insurer agreed to loan upon the sole security of the policy up to the limit of the ‘cash or loan values at the end of the policy year within which application for the loan is made.’ . . .</p>

We have no difficulty in finding that the defendant did not exercise strictly its right to a forfeiture of the policy and that the forfeiture was not justified and was unlawful for several reasons: In the first place, the notice was premature, in that the policy by its terms would not have lapsed on July 19, 1934, as noted above; in the second place, the notice was not strictly in accordance with the provisions of the policy; in the third place, the company demanded a payment greater than it should have.” In its letter of June 18,1934, pursuant to which letter the company claimed the policy lapsed, the company took the position that it had “loaned the entire value of the policy in payment of a pro rate premium.” The Referee properly found that such was not the fact. <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>The Referee pointed out: “Even on the defendant’s own calculations there was some loan value on May 4 and on June 18. Instead of making such a loan, the company demanded payment of the full balance of the premium due May 4, to wit: $64.15, and notified the insured that if this amount was not paid within thirty-one days after the date of the notice, June 18, 1934, the policy will cease. Under these circumstances, the insured was misled when he was informed that the loan value had been used up to pay a pro rata premium and the amount demanded was for more than he should have been required to pay.”</p>

This evidence, if it exists, must be found in inferences drawn from plaintiff’s conduct in respect to the policy. It is undisputed that the insured made no objection to the defendant’s statement in the letter of June 18, 1934, that if the balance of the premiums, amounting to $64.15, is “not paid within 31 days after date of this policy . . . the policy will cease.” The Referee stated in his report: “No premium or tender of payment of premium has been made either on October 17, 1934, or on any other subsequent quarterly premium payment date, or at any time up to the date of the death of the insured on May 4, 1941. In fact, twenty-eight premium dates passed since the forfeiture was declared.” The insured did not even take exception to the letter of June 18th even to the extent of suing on the contract to recover damages for its breach or suing in assumpsit to recover the money paid on it. In <em>Gaskill v. Pittsburgh Life &amp; Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/261/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="261 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1042237" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0546-01">261 Pa. 546</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20775" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="104 A. 775">104 A. 775</a>, this court held that one holding a policy in an insurance company which wrongfully revokes the policy may elect whether to enforce the contract or treat it as rescinded and recover for the breach, and if he takes the latter course he may <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>recover back the full amount of the premiums paid thereon with interest, without deduction for the protection afforded the assured while the policy was in effect.” To the same effect is the decision in <em>Kerns v. The Prudential Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/11/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="11 Pa.

While courts have gone far in interpreting insurance contracts in favor of the insured when questions have arisen as to the continued existence of an insurance policy under certain conditions even when premiums have not been paid, we do not believe that any court has gone as far as appellee would have us go in this case. The facts in this case do <em>not </em>bring it within the general rule stated by Joyce on Insurance, Yol. 2, sec. 1123, p. 2240, as follows: “If the company has expressly declared a forfeiture of the policy, and it is clearly apparent from acts or declarations that a tender would not be accepted, or if it has declared a forfeiture and refused the premium, the fact that there has been a failure subsequently to pay or tender the premiums as they fell due will not prevent a recovery on the policy.”</p>

The company <em>ashed </em>for a tender of premiums on July 19, 1934, (when a premium was <em>not </em>in fact due), and it said that if the premium was not paid <em>then </em>“the policy will cease.” Upon receipt of this notice it was the insured’s duty to <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>call the company’s attention to the error in its calculation and to challenge its statement as to the date the policy “will cease.” Instead of doing this, the insured apparently accepted the company’s calculations and conclusions and never thereafter tendered any premiums. We cannot reasonably believe that the insured had any idea that he was, by the letter of June 18th, being presented with a paid-up life insurance policy. He knew that to keep a policy alive (before it becomes a fully paid-up policy) premiums must be paid when they are due or within 31 days thereafter. When after the receipt of the letter of June 18th the insured did nothing in respect to this policy the inference is legitimate that he considered it as terminating on July 19, 1934, and accepted the situation. If he had wished to keep his policy in force after the latter date, he would have challenged the defendant’s statement, and would have said that according to the loan value of this policy, it remains in force until a date subsequent to July 19, 1934, and at that subsequent date, the premium then due will be forthcoming. Of course, if the insured had died after July 19, 1934, but before the “subsequent date,” the beneficiary could have recovered on the policy. The subsequent date was apparently July 23,1934.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It certainly was <em>not </em>May 4, 1941, when the insured died. That the insured looked upon the policy as having “ceased” is indicated by the fact that three months after he received the letter of June IS, 1934, he applied to the original soliciting agent for a new policy and stated in his appli<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>cation that the only policy then in force on his life was another policy which had been issued by defendant in 1933.

An insured is not required to make tender of premiums where the company by its action plainly tells him that his tenders will be refused.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> But that was not the situation in the instant case.

From the facts stated there is no particle of doubt of the fact of such abandonment. For more than three years the insured made no effort .to pay or tender any premiums under this policy, nor did he make any inquiry concerning the policy.
