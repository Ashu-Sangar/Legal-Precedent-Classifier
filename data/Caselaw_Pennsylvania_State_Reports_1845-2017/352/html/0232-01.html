But, it must not be overlooked that tbe presumption of acceptance of a gift or devise arises out of tbe supposed benefit inuring therefrom to the donee or devisee. It is but the law’s imputation to a donee or devisee of conduct in keeping with the usual and ordinary-human experience in such circumstances. The presumption, however, is not a substitute for evidence. It merely furnishes a procedural rule which casts upon a donee or devisee the burden of proving that he did not accept the gift or devise if that be his allegation. See <em>Watkins v. Prudential Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/315/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="315 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1156742" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0497-01">315 Pa. 497</a>, 500-503, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20644" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="173 A. 644">173 A. 644</a>, where Justice (now Chief Justice) Maxey treated fully with the office of a legal presumption.</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[224,1387,1151,971]]]'>But, before there can be a presumption of an acceptance of a gift or devise there must exist a subject-matter of some value, however slight, capable of transmission by the putative donor or testator as his bounty. In the instant case, it clearly appears from the facts alleged in the affidavit of defense that the testator’s estate was hopelessly insolvent. Necessarily, it had to be used first to pay creditors. Not only did the law so require but the will itself expressly so provided. Obviously, therefore, there was nothing upon which the devise could operate. Had the defendant sought to assume ownership over the property in question, she would have had to take it subject to a mortgage for a principal sum greater than the worth of the property (not to speak of accumulated overdue interest in an amount more than half as large as the mortgage debt) and, in addition, she would have had for appeasement creditors of her deceased husband’s estate with claims aggregating more than ¡¡¡&gt;300,000.</p>
    <p id="b271-3" data-blocks='[["BL_271.3",271,[185,283,1151,918]]]'>
      <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>There is no basis in human experience for inferring, from the mere act of giving or devising, that a designated recipient has accepted a gift or devise which is not only without <em>any </em>pecuniary value but which would be a financial millstone around his neck. To give the presumption the conclusive effect in this case, for which the appellant contends, would be to establish arbitrarily as truth a condition contrary to fact. The law is not so vain as to create a presumption where the factual situation essential to its integrity is absent. <em>Oessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex. </em>Under the facts alleged by the defendant, the procedural aid afforded by the legal presumption of acceptance is unavailable to the plaintiff. The affidavit of defense shifted the burden of proof to the plaintiff whose duty it thereupon became to offer affirmative evidence that the defendant had, in fact, accepted the devise.</p>
    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[180,1214,1152,1084]],["BL_272.1",272,[255,281,1151,756]]]'>If such proof be offered (which the plaintiff’s statement of claim has not yet forecast), it will then be open to the defendant to prove in keeping with her allegations that she never affirmatively accepted the property as hers; that, on the contrary, her conduct throughout from the time of her husband’s death was wholly inconsistent with any thought of ownership on her part; and finally, that, when it was first brought to her attention that the property was owned by her husband at the time of his death, she immediately executed and recorded the formal disclaimer and renunciation and forthwith notified all interested parties accordingly. It is true that the latter action was not taken for more than eight years after the husband’s death and the probate of his will. But, in view of the facts alleged by the defendant, it is not possible to say as a matter of law that the defendant’s action in such regard was belated. From the time of her husband’s death, no one, not even the mortgagee, had ever asserted any liability against her on account of the property which had been in the exclusive possession of <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>the mortgagee from a time antedating by two years the death of her husband and continuously thereafter. With reference to the disclaimer, the question of importance is how promptly did the defendant act after she first ascertained that the property was a part of her deceased husband’s insolvent estate. In <em>Pennsylvania Co., etc., v. Bergson, </em><a href="/pa/307/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="307 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1138161" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0044-01">307 Pa. 44</a>, 54, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.%2032" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="159 A. 32">159 A. 32</a>, this Court emphasized that the timeliness of a disclaimer is to be determined in relation to the donee’s acquisition of knowledge of the alleged gift and not the date of the gift. See also <em>Bacon v. Barber, </em><a href="/vt/110/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="110 Vt. 280" data-case-ids="2373525" data-case-paths="/vt/110/0280-01">110 Vt. 280</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%209" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="6 A.2d 9">6 A. 2d 9</a>, 12-13.
