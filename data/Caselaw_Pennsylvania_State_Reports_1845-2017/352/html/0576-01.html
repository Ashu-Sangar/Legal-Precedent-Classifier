Consideration of the election machinery and other mandatory time limits provided by the code forces a similar conclusion. The Board of Elections is not, as urged by appellant, a party entirely disinterested in the matter. “The Election Code makes the County Board of Election more than a mere ministerial body. It clothes it with quasi-judicial functions . . .”: <em>Boord v. Maurer, </em><a href="/pa/343/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="343 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1208302" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0309-01">343 Pa. 309</a>, 312. Section 953 of the Code (25 P.S., Section 2913) provides a period of 30 days before the last day for filing nominating petitions, within which time the petitions must be prepared. Any signature not bearing a date within said 30 days “shall” not be counted. All nomination petitions <em>must </em>be filed at least 20 days prior to the date of the primary <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>election. Appellant concedes that the requirement that the original petition to set aside the nomination papers shall be presented to the Court of Common Pleas, of the county in which the nomination papers are filed, within 7 days after the last day for filing nomination papers is mandatory. The requirement that “a copy of said petition shall, within said period, be served on the officer or board with whom said nomination petition or paper was filed” assures the physical presence of a copy of a petition to strike off nomination papers in the same public office in which the nomination papers are on file. The copy, together with the challenged petition, becomes a public record open to inspection by the public. See Section 308 of the Election Code (25 P.S. Section 2648). The essence of the thing required is having a copy of a duly filed petition to set aside the nomination papers on file as a public record not later than 7 days after the last day for filing nomination papers. Proper filing of both the petition and a copy thereof must be had before an appeal to a court of common pleas has been perfected. Failure to perfect an appeal within the time prescribed by the legislature is fatal to appellant’s case. Cf. <em>Singer v. Delaware L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/254/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="254 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1025497" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0502-01">supra, 504, 505</a>; <em>Harris v. Mercur (No. 1), </em>supra, 317. Clearly the legislature intended all provisions of Section 977 to be mandatory. It could not, however, constitutionally impose upon the courts mandatory duties pertaining to the exercise of the judicial function: <em>Socialist Labor Case, </em>supra, 80. As applied to all others, the provisions are mandatory.</p>

Each failure to comply strictly would necessitate judicial determination of a reasonable time, under the circumstances, within which the required service must be made. Laxity and delay in perfecting appeals <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>to the courts of common pleas would be encouraged. Matters of vital importance to our popular election system of government would be removed from tbe uniform and definite, and relegated to uncertainty dependent upon a question of degree and relative desirability. This tbe legislature has wisely foreclosed by enactment of tbe statute in question. Clearly, appellant’s duty to serve a copy of tbe petition upon tbe County Board of Elections witbin tbe time limit prescribed for tbe filing of tbe petition was mandatory. Tbis legislative mandate cannot be waived or dispensed with by tbe court. Appellant’s contention that there has been substantial compliance is, therefore, without merit.</p>

      <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>When the Legislature wished to make the provision as to filing objections to nomination papers within seven days after the last day for filing said nomination papers, it used language whose <em>mandatory </em>purport could not be mistaken. It said: “All nomination petitions ... received and filed within the periods limited by this Act <em>shall he deemed to he valid, unless ” </em>etc. [italics supplied]. If the Legislature wished the provision as to serving a copy of the objecting petition “within said period” [seven days] to be mandatory, it would have had <em>two </em>“unless” clauses instead of one in Section 977, and the second “unless” clause would have contained a provision as to the service of a copy of the objecting petition within the same period. The very substantial difference between the phrasing of the first and second complete sentences, respectively, in Section 977, supra, clearly indicates that the first sentence was a command while the second sentence was only a direction.</p>

Loxdale, </em>1 Burr. 447, as follows: “Whether a statute is mandatory or not depends on whether the thing directed to be done is of the essence of the thing required.” This test has frequently been approved by the courts of this state. In <em>Deibert v. Rhodes, </em><a href="/pa/291/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="291 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1107247" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0550-01">291 Pa. 550</a>, this court said: “ ‘Whether a particular statute is mandatory or directory does not depend upon its form, but upon the intention of the legislature, to be ascertained from a consideration of the entire act, its nature, its object, and the consequences that would result from construing it one way or the other’: 36 Cyc. 1157; quoted with approval in McQuiston’s Adoption, <a href="/pa/238/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="238 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="991556" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0304-01">238 Pa. 304</a>, 308. ‘When a statute directs certain proceedings to be done in a certain way, or at a certain time, the law will be regarded as directory and the proceedings under it will be held valid, though the command of the statute as to form and time has not been strictly obeyed; the time and manner not being the essence of the thing re<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>quired to be done’: Coolbaugh v.

One provision of a statute may be mandatory and another directory. ‘Statutes, or particular provisions of statutes, may be either mandatory or directory. A mandatory provision is one the omission to follow which renders the proceeding to which it relates illegal and void, while a directory provision is one the observance of which is not necessary to the validity of the proceeding’: 25 R. C. L. 766.” Applying this established test and considering the object of Section 977, and the consequences which would result from construing the second sentence as mandatory, I am forced to the conclusion that the second sentence is <em>not </em>mandatory.</p>

If the charge is well founded, the papers should go the way of all other spurious papers; if the charge is not well founded, the papers and their sponsors should be cleared of the imputation cast upon them. If, as charged, there are on the nomination papers several thousand forged names, these papers constitute no legal foundation whatever for the allegedly made nomination papers of the American Labor Party, of certain candidates for Philadelphia city offices. The papers, if spurious, as charged, have no more legal standing than a forged will or a counterfeit hundred dollar bill. The one day’s delay in notifying the board with which the alleged spurious nomination papers were filed, that these papers had been attached on the day before by a petition filed in the Court of Common Pleas, did not in the slightest degree hamper that board in the performance of any duty cast upon it by law in respect to those papers. As the board made no objection to the filing of those nomination papers, the matter was out of its hands when the objecting petition was filed in due time <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>in the prothonotary’s office. The serving of a copy of the objection on the board was of no legal consequence. The question of the validity of the nomination papers was no longer a matter for it to pass on.</p>

It was a mere notice to an official body that the validity of certain alleged nomination papers was no longer before that body but was before the court. It had gotten <em>there </em>because objectors put it there on time. That a copy of their petition was served on the board of elections a day later had no prejudicial effect whatever on the proceedings then in court. The language used by that part of the Act directing the serving of a copy of the petition is in such striking contrast with the language it used in commanding the petition itself to be filed within seven days, that the contrast should be given the judicial significance it is obviously entitled to. •</p>

That court said: “The word ‘shall’ [in a statute] may be held to be merely directory when no advantage is lost, when no right is destroyed, when no benefit is sacrificed, either to the public or to any individual, by giving it that construction.”</p>

      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>The court below clearly had jurisdiction of the subject matter of this case and of the parties. In my judgment the court below was not justified in refusing to hear the case and to grant the relief the facts warranted merely because the objectors to the nominating petition were one day late in serving on the board of elections a copy of the petition they had filed with the court within the required seven-day period. This service on the board amounted to no more than a notice to it of the pendency of the proceedings in court and the provision requiring this notice was no more than a mere direction. I would therefore reverse the order of the court below and let the facts as to the allegedly fraudulent nomination papers be judicially ascertained.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[322,1106,861,34]]]'>Mr. Justice Jones concurs in this dissent.</p>
