The failure of the school directors to take adequate security, was a breach of statutory duty rendering them liable for loss, not only to the school district, but to others sustaining damage legally resulting from their unlawful conduct. If they had done their duty, the school district would not have sustained any loss and the assets for distribution to depositors could not have been diminished by a claim for a fund held on constructive trust. It is unnecessary, for the purposes of this case, to consider whether the trust res is the entire deposit or only the excess over the amount secured by the bond, an amount in itself not free from dispute.</p>

The appellant depositors contend that the school district waited too long to assert the new basis of recovery. Whether laches ap<a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>pears depends on whether the school district’s conduct resulted in such a change in the depositors’ position as to have disabled them from obtaining redress from the directors for the unlawful acts. The learned court, from whose order the appeal comes, thought there was no laches “. . . in view of the fact that the parties [appellant depositors] against whom the claim is presented will suffer no more of an injury than if the claim had been successfully concluded at the time of the filing of the exceptions” in 1933. We think this is an erroneous view. The appellant depositors, as between themselves and the bank, had the right to assume that the bank had complied with the law regulating the receipt of deposits; they had no knowledge of the school directors’ unlawful acts nor of the trust company’s wrong in receiving the school funds in the circumstances stated in the school district’s petition. The present dispute is not between the school district and the trust company. The trust company has become insolvent. Three parties are now directly concerned: (1) the school district; (2) the school directors who are now accused by the school district of having unlawfully deposited its money; (3) depositors entitled to distribution. The depositors say it is inequitable to permit the school district to enforce the trust unless the directors, whose unlawful acts created the trouble, are required to restore for distribution to the depositors, an amount equal to the amount claimed by the school district. The Secretary of Banking and the liquidating trustees succeeded to the assets for the purposes of administering them. The status of the parties was fixed as of the date on which the Secretary took possession. The assets then passed into the custody of the law. They included an amount which had been placed in the bank by the unlawful conduct of the school directors acting for the school district. The school district had two sources of recovery: (1) by requiring the directors to repay the amount unlawfully diverted, and (2) by an equitable application to charge with a con<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>structive trust the traceable assets in the hands of the Secretary. The depositors had only one source of payment. If, therefore, the school district had made timely application on the ground for the first time set forth in the petition of 1943, the court, in granting the petition, could have subrogated the depositors to the school district’s right against the directors. If the averments in the petition are true, the school directors were liable to surcharge by the auditors required to audit the school finances as directed in sections 2601 and 2616 of the School Code: compare <em>Hanover Township School District’s Audit, </em><a href="/pa/265/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="265 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1051860" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0157-01">265 Pa. 157</a>, 164, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.%20656" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="108 A. 656">108 A. 656</a>; <em>Chester School District Audit, </em><a href="/pa/301/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="301 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1126435" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0203-01">301 Pa. 203</a>, 214, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.%20801" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="151 A. 801">151 A. 801</a>; <em>Appeal of Sykesville Borough, </em><a href="/pa-super/91/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="91 Pa.

The effect of the school district’s failure to enforce the personal liability of the directors and the legal effect of the lapse of time since that liability arose, must be borne by the school district; the legal consequences of its inactivity may not equitably be shifted to the other depositors.
