The decrees are in accord with the prayers of the bills but must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.8",352,[241,980,1151,1130]]]'>The right to assess railroad real estate was conferred on the city by the local and special Act of January 4, 1859, P. L. 828, entitled “An Act to enable the city of Pittsburgh to raise Additional Revenue.” Section 3 provides “That all real estate situated in said city, owned or possessed by any railroad company, shall be and is hereby made subject to taxation for city purposes the same as other real estate in said city.” The term “real estate,” as used in that act, came up for construction in appeals reported as <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/104/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="104 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="452148" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0522-01">104 Pa. 522</a>. It was held that the term was used in the statute with the intention of authorizing taxation of railroad real estate theretofore not subject to local taxation such as land, building and improvements considered essential to the exercise of the franchises of public service corporations but not being, like right of way, part of the corporate franchise.

With respect to the property in the first ward, the city’s power to tax is conceded; the only question is whether, out of the large area occupied by the Smith-field Station of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad Company with tracks, platforms, facilities, etc., a part of the tract, assessed in two parcels, should have been exempted as slope alleged to constitute part of the right of way. Plaintiff raises no question of the right to assess so much of the real estate at this location as is not part of the right of way.</p>

The answer of course depends on what the legislature provided. The power of the legislature to authorize such taxation must be conceded: <em>Appeal of Hewitt, </em><a href="/pa/88/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="88 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="1061157" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0055-01">88 Pa. 55</a>, 59; <em>Pittsburgh’s Petition, <a href="/pa/217/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="217 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="953639" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0227-01">217 </a></em><a href="/pa/217/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="217 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="953639" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0227-01">Pa. 227</a>, 229, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20348" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="66 A. 348">66 A. 348</a>.</p>

Tbe title to tbe Act of 1867 is “A Further Supplement To tbe acts incorporating tbe city of Pittsburg, extending its boundaries, enlarging its corporate powers and perfecting its municipal organization, and submitting tbe proposed consolidation to a vote of tbe people.” Tbe title to tbe Act of 1868 is “An Act Supplementary to tbe acts incorporating tbe city of Pittsburg.” Section 21 of tbe Act of 1868 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> provides “That all laws and ordinances relating to tbe city of Pittsburg, wbicb were in force at tbe time of tbe passage of tbe aforesaid act of April sixth, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, and wbicb have not been subsequently repealed or supplied, are hereby declared to be and remain in full force and applicable to said city as consolidated by said act.”</p>

We should have assumed that there could be no doubt of that but for tbe conclusion of tbe learned court below. We have therefore considered tbe subject. Tbe learned judge said: “Section 21 of tbe Act of 1868 does not expressly make tbe Act of 1859 applicable to new territory then brought within tbe confines of tbe City. It simply extends to tbe consolidated City tbe benefit of laws in force at tbe time of con<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>solidation. To hold that it gave the City authority to tax railroad properties not subject to taxation before consolidation with the City would be imposing a tax upon a new subject of taxation without clear and express words for that purpose, by implication only. So far as the consolidating Act is concerned it left all subjects of taxation as they were when it was passed and as they existed when the consolidation was affected. The consolidated City was not given power to create a taxable subject on certain kinds of real estate not made taxable by the general law.”</p>
    <p id="b355-3" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[169,885,1154,965]]]'>We must reject that conclusion. This court has said precisely the contrary in speaking of the effect of the Act of 1859. In <em>Passenger Railway Co. v. </em>Pittsburg, <a href="/pa/226/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="226 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="967951" data-case-paths="/pa/226/0419-01">226 Pa. 419</a>, 427, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.%20662" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="75 A. 662">75 A. 662</a>, Mr. Justice Elkin said: “It is true that the territorial limits of the act of 1859 were extended several times prior to the adoption of the new constitution when additional territory was added to the city of Pittsburg, but this result was accomplished by the express provisions of the acts authorizing the consolidation and extensions.” This case, we may add, dealt with territorial enlargement of Pittsburgh pursuant to a statute passed after the adoption of the Constitution of 1874. The statute was therefore subject to constitutional limitations, imposed by Article III, which were not applicable when the Act of 1859 was passed. Probably for that reason the enabling Act of 1906 does not contain a provision such as section 7 of the Act of 1868.</p>

The records of the appeals were offered in evidence. They came on for hearing at a Pre-Trial Court. As the procedure was the same, we shall refer to one of them as typical. Civil Procedure rule 212 provides for pre-trial conference. Among other provisions, the rule states: “The court may make an order reciting the action taken at the conference, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, and the agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and limiting the issues for trial to those not disposed of by admissions or agreements of the attorneys. Such order when entered shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified at the trial to prevent manifest injustice.” At the pre-trial hearing, the plaintiffs and the city agreed on what the assessment should be; the order of the court, establishing the assessment in the amount agreed to became a judgment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that judgment became final. The appel<a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>late proceeding ended at that point.
