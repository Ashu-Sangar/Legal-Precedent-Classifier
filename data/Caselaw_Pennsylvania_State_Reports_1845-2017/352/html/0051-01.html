Maize, aged 33 years, the wife of Earl R. Maize, the administrator named as plaintiff. Mrs. Maize, the mother of two children, died as a result of inhaling the fumes of a poisonous chemical, carbon tetrachloride, which comprises 45% of a cleaning fluid designated as Atlantic Safetv-Kleen which is manufactured and sold to the general public by the defendant. The cans which contain it, and from one of which Mrs. Maize procured the fluid, display on one side the words “A Highly Efficient Dry Cleaner” in letters 5/16" in height followed by these words in letters 3/16" in height: <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>“For every dry cleaning purpose. Will not injure the finest fabrics.” On the can there twice appears the word “Caution” in letters *4" in height followed by the following words in <em>y8" </em>type: “Do not inhale fumes. Use only in well ventilated place.” The compound word “Safety-Kleen” appears on the two broad sides of the can in letters ranging from %" in height to %" in height, “S” and “K” being the largest letters, and on the two narrow sides of the can in letters a trifle smaller. Thus the compound word “Safety-Kleen” stands out on the four sides of the can.</p>
    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[202,876,1151,811]]]'>The 2-gallon can of Safety-Kleen which contained the fluid Mrs. Maize used was delivered to her by her brother on May 13, 1942, and on the following day she used the fluid in cleaning rugs in her home. One of these rooms was 18' x 12' in dimensions. The other was a smaller room. She worked at the job “a good part of one morning” and also in the afternoon and in the evening. At noon she had a headache from inhaling the fumes and in the evening she became ill. Her illness continued until May 27th when she died. It was established that the cause of her death was the inhaling of the fumes from Safety-Kleen. These fumes entered the blood stream and destroyed the liver and kidneys. Judge Marshall of the court below made the following statement in his opinion:</p>

The jury returned a verdict of $2500 to Mrs. Maize’s estate and $7500 to her husband and children. The defendant made a motion for judgment n. o. v. The defendant in support of its motion contended that the fluid used by Mrs. Maize was sold by it to Portable Lamp &amp; Equipment Company for the latter’s own use and not for resale, and that on May 13 or 14, 1943, Elmer Davis, a brother of Mrs. Maize (this brother being employed by Portable as a serviceman) took “out of stock” at Portable a can containing Safety-Kleen and delivered it to his sister. The defendant argues from this that Mrs. Maize stood in no legal relationship either to the defendant or to Portable. ■ She simply used the fluid taken by her brother from the stock of Portable. As the court below pointed out, Elmer Davis testified that the can he took was a full can and he denied that he filled it from the drum on the original purchaser’s premises. This presented an issue of fact for the jury on this phase of the case.</p>

We said in <em>Ebbert et al. v. Phila. Electric Co., </em><a href="/pa/330/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1182966" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0257-01">330 Pa. 257</a>, 269, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20323" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="198 A. 323">198 A. 323</a>: “The test to determine whether there is liability in an action of tort is in the answer to the question whether the defendant by an act or omission injured another by disregarding a duty imposed by law in respect to that other.

This duty is breached by any legally harmful act or omission which might have been foreseen and avoided, . . . Holmes in ‘The Com mon Law/ page 145, says: ‘Most liabilities in tort . . . are founded on the infliction of harm which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to avoid at the time of the acts or omissions which were its proximate cause.’</p>

Kelly, </em><a href="/pa/314/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="314 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="1154642" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0099-01">314 Pa. 99</a>, 110, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.%20139" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="170 A. 139">170 A. 139</a>, we said: ‘The duty defendant breached was a duty imposed by law, not a duty self-imposed by contract.’ ” That the fluid the defendant manufactured and sold for general use in cleaning fabrics is highly dangerous is proved by the tragic result in this case. That housewives and others would use the fluid in places that were not “well ventilated” by frequently changing currents of air might reasonably have been foreseen by the defendant. That the conspicuous display on each of the four sides of a can of the words “Safety-Kleen” would naturally lull the user of that fluid so-named into a false sense of security might also reasonably have been foreseen by the defendant. That the display at the very bottom of the two narrow sides of the can of the word “Caution” in % inch letters followed by the words in % inch letters : “Do not inhale fumes; use only in well ventilated places”, would be sufficient to cause every user of that fluid to use it in a place which would be sufficiently well ventilated to blow the fumes away before they were taken into the body by breathing may well be adjudged unreasonable. The word “SAFETY” was so conspicuously displayed on all four sides of this can of dangerous fluid as to make the word “Caution” and the admonition against inhaling fumes and as to use only in a well ventilated place seem of comparatively minor import. In fact, it is understandable that a woman busily engaged in the task of cleaning rugs might not take time to read everything on the can, particularly since the word “SAFETY” was so prominently featured as to exclude from her mind that “provident fear” which has been <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>characterized as “the mother of safety.” This court has laid down the rule that anyone who is responsible for the existence of any dangerous instrumentality or substance with which persons are likely to come in contact must “impose a measure of control that is adequate to the protection of human beings” from it.

Power &amp; Light Co., </em><a href="/pa/311/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="311 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1146245" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0387-01">311 Pa. 387</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20589" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="166 A. 589">166 A. 589</a>, wherein we repeated at page 393 what was said in <em>Koelsch v.

There the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the plaintiff, had not made out “a submissible case” because on the label were the words: “Volatile Solvent, use with adequate ventilation. Avoid prolonged breathing of vapor,” and an agreed state of facts was that “other manufacturers of carbon tetrachloride use a similar label” and this label “was approved by the Surgeon General of the United States.” “Other manufacturers” and the official just named are not authorized to prescribe the standards of care by which the respective rights and liabilities of persons subject to the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania courts are determined. We said in the <em>MacDougall </em>case above cited (pages 396, 397) : “Vigilance must always be commensurate with danger. A high degree of danger always calls for a high degree of care.

Before the jury retired to deliberate, the judge wrote the words “Estate” and “Family” upon the verdict slip and instructed the jury to write thereon the amounts they found for respectively the estate and the family, if their verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff. The jury wrote after the word “Estate” $2500 and after the word “Family” $7500. These words were written above the word “Verdict” on the jury slip. Upon the trial judge receiving the verdict he wrote under the <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>word “Verdict” the following: “We find for plaintiff and award Earl R.

But in those cases the verdicts recorded were in fact the verdicts the juries <em>intended </em>to have returned and recorded. In the instant case the verdict received and recorded was not the verdict the jury had agreed upon. Through a clerical error on the part of the trial judge the verdict <em>recorded </em>was not the jury’s real verdict. What the verdict in the jury’s mind was and what it thought the verdict it was rendering was is not questioned by anyone. If under such circumstances a palpable mistake in the receiving and recording of a jury’s verdict cannot be corrected by the court and the true verdict substituted therefor, justice must be sacrificed so that the recording of a jury’s verdict may be invested with sacrosanct rigidity. Fortunately, the law does not require courts to. apply any such unreasonable rule. In <em>East Broad Top Transit Co. v.

Must the court be forever chained to an error merely because the sun has gone down upon it?”</p>

The jury found a verdict “in favor of the plaintiff.” On the argument of a motion by defendant to strike the judgment from the record, the parent plaintiff waived his right to the sum claimed by him for expenses. The court moulded the verdict so that it was in favor of the minor plaintiff by her father and next friend in the sum of $1833.25 which represented the difference between the verdict returned and recorded, $2000, and the sum claimed but later waived by the parent plaintiff. The Superior Court held that “this action was within the sound discretion of the court.” It said “to hold that the court was without authority to mould the verdict would cause a grave injustice to the plaintiff.”</p>

Exit there is one important limitation to this rule, and that limitation is that the amendment in all cases must be such as to make the verdict conform to the real intent of the jury. ‘The judge cannot, under the guise of amending the verdict, invade the exclusive province of the jury or substitute his verdict for theirs.’ <em>Acton v.

    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[207,374,1154,1073]]]'>To permit the verdict of a jury to be amended after the jury is discharged, except in a clear case of error in announcing and recording the verdict, might lead to great abuses, and such amendments are permissible only in very exceptional cases where the facts are not disputed and where justice requires it. This is such a case. This jury actually agreed on a verdict for the “Family” in the sum of $7500 and for the “Estate” in the sum of $2500, and so declared in its written return. The trial judge in amplifying the jury’s finding confused in his composition the conceptions of “Estate” and “Family,” and when his amplification was read to the jurors the latter not realizing that a transposition had been made in their respective findings gave formal assent to a verdict which they believed was the one they had agreed to and returned, but which was not. Since the facts are undisputed and no objection made by or in behalf of any party in interest, and since it is the just thing to do, the proposed amendment correcting what is so plainly an error will be ordered.</p>
