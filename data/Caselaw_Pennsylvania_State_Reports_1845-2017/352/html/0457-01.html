The appellant companies also contend that the procedure prescribed by Section 9 of the Act of 1937<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> works a deprivation of property without due process of law and an impairment of the obligation of contracts and is, therefore, unconstitutional <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>and void; and, further, that the power conferred by Section 9 cannot be exercised against non-residents.</p>

Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company Case, </em>at page 466 ante. That the funds here involved were appropriate matter for escheat at the time of the enactment of the Act of 1937, we think is clear. Dividends or profits declared by any corporation and any debt or interest on debt owed by a corporation were made “eseheatable to the Commonwealth” by the Act of June 7, 1915, P. L. 878, Section 7 (27 P. S. §282). The Act of 1915, as amended by the Act of April 21,1921, P. L. 223, further provided that “. . . any moneys or property held by any . . . corporation . . . belonging to any other person, the escheat of which is not otherwise provided for in this section, . . . shall be eseheatable to the Commonwealth . . . .” Of course, before moneys or property may be actually escheated under the provisions of the Act of 1915 or the amendment thereof, the want of a claim to the moneys or property or the non-payment thereof for the period of time prescribed by the applicable statute would necessarily have to be established. The implication in <em>Edelman v. Boardman, </em><a href="/pa/332/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="332 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1186622" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0085-01">332 Pa. 85</a>, 95, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20393" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 A.2d 393">2 A. 2d 393</a>, that, except for the Act of 1937, the escheatability of property such as the present is involved <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>in “reasonable, or even serious, doubt” did not conclude the ultimate issue. Nor was it intended so to do. A definitive answer to that question was neither required there nor given. That the moneys and property here in controversy were escheatable under existing law, we have already pointed out; and that satisfies the requirement of the Act of 1937.</p>

The learned court below found to that effect and held, accordingly, that the unclaimed dividends were not subject to an ordér requiring them to be paid into the State Treasury without escheat.
