In 1936 they requested the auditing judge to reaward the fund to a trustee for the sole benefit of the son. At that time, and for some years previous thereto, the son was <em>non compos mentis </em>and therefore disqualified from receiving the fund. The appellants wished to avoid the expense of an appointment of a committee or guardian. They contemplated that the son should use the principal and income of the estate for his maintenance, support and care, and at his decease <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>they would become entitled thereto. The auditing judge complied with this request, but noted that the procedure was irregular.

No jurisdiction is conferred upon an orphans’ court to supervise the administration of the estate of an adult person who is <em>non compos mentis. </em>It is abundantly clear, however, that the award to the trustee was for the sole and exclusive use of the son and for no other persons. The auditing judge <em>supplemented </em>his award with these words: “without prejudice to the rights of (the son) to appear ... at any future time and request termination of the trust.” This award was made on March 19,1936. Seven years later, on March 15,1943, upon the audit of the second account of the trustee, the auditing judge, reciting all the foregoing facts, stated that the son <em>(ibecame entitled to the principal in remainder upon attaining the age of twenty-five years” </em>and reawarded the fund to the trustee “upon the same uses and purposes as directed in the aforesaid adjudication of March 19,1936” and repeated the right given to the son to appear and request termination of the trust.</p>

They claim that the son possessed but a life estate and that they are the remainder-men. It appears from the record that the real reason for appellants’ reversal in position is that other claimants have appeared who maintain that they are nearer in consanguinity to the son than the appellants. The assigned reason for attempting to repudiate their stipulation, upon which the court acted, is that appellants say that <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>liad tliey then known of the existence of such adverse claim, they would not have agreed to the will construction.
