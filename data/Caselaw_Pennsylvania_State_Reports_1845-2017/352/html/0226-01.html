Gilligan and Patrick J. Finn to the extent herein mentioned, and that I now hold the same in trust for the said Mary Gilligan, John Gilligan, James Gilligan and Frank Gilligan, widow and heirs of the said Patrick M. Gilligan, deceased, and that I will at any time upon request of the said Mary Gilligan, John Gilligan, J ames Gilligan and Frank Gilligan, their heirs or assigns, convey said premises to them as I may thereunto be required to the extent of their interest therein.” The other deed contained a declaration in the same words for the benefit of John T. Lenahan, his heirs or assigns. Each declaration specified the fractional undivided interests of the beneficiaries, Avhich, however, did not include the entire title; part of the estate was vested in Louise Barring as absolute owner. No request to convey was made in the lifetime of Louise Barring, who died November 8, 1925. She left surviving her, three daughters, two of them, defendants, the third having conveyed to the two defendants her interest in the land. Mrs. Barring, during her life and her heirs, since her death, have managed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the property and received the income from them. There is evidence that defendants had con<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>structive notice of the plaintiffs’ interests at least since 1925.</p>

She stated that Patrick Gilligan and John T. Lenahan had paid fractional parts of the consideration and were therefore entitled to the interests in the property.

Such a. trust in Pennsylvania, is a passive or dry trust<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> executed by the statute of uses. Appellees, in their brief of argument, say, “It was a dry trust.” The statute is in force in Pennsylvania (Roberts’s Digest of Select British Statutes (1847) p. 413) and provides, “Where any person . . . be seized . . . of . . . lands ... to the use . . . of any other person . . . every such person . . . shall from henceforth ... be seized . . . of . . . the same . . . lands ... in such like estates as they had ... in use.”</p>

Plaintiffs’ claim is subject to that Act: Compare <em>Sieger v.

This suit was brought, as we have said, on December 5, 1941. If defendants had abandoned possession of and had received no income from the premises for six years prior to bringing suit, the statute would be a bar, but it is not a defense in this suit because the receipts annually thereafter created new obligations each year to divide with the co-tenants as income was received. It is the fact that a new obligation arose each year of defendants’ possession which distinguishes this case from the illustration given by the learned judge in his opinion when he said: “If these plaintiffs had loaned a sum of money to these defendants and had waited sixteen years before endeavoring to collect it, their right would have been barred.” The same distinction makes the cases on laches cited by appellees inapplicable as reference to one or two typical cases will show. <em>Barnes &amp; Tucker Co. v.
