The lease, which was unrecorded, was for a twenty-five year term, beginning as of April 1, <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>1910, at an annual rental of two hundred dollars. The demised property was to be used “for a reservoir site . . . for the location of a reservoir, dam and pump house . . .”. The lease granted the lessee “the right to lay, repair, maintain, and relay a pipe line from the said reservoir upon, under and through the said premises ... to a point where the pipe line leaves the land of said William B. Howell”; “the right to locate, erect, repair, maintain and remove a power line over, across and through the premises”; and “the full right of ingress, egress and regress to and from all parts of the land occupied by said reservoir, dam, pump house, pipe line and power line, for all proper purposes within the terms of this agreement.” The lease contained a covenant “That the water from said reservoir shall be used by [the lessee], <em>its successors or assigns, </em>upon the premises now or hereafter to be acquired by it or them.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

The only other provision for the termination of the lease was upon the lessee’s failure to pay the rent reserved.

Some time prior to March 27, 1941, tbe township, acting by its officers and employees, started to tear down tbe stone pump bouse referred to in tbe Howell lease and proceeded with tbe erection on tbe demised property of a new pump bouse, a filtration plant and a storage tank (no structure similar to tbe latter two having been on tbe leased premises before), and tbe laying of a new pipe line from tbe reservoir. This work was undertaken by tbe township in conjunction with tbe Works Progress Administration of tbe government of tbe United States and was pursued subsequent to tbe court’s denial of tbe plaintiff’s petition for a mandatory injunction in this case.

The preceding lessees under tbe Howell lease, viz., Ocean Coal Company, Herminie Land Company and Stubbs, bad for many years furnished water from tbe reservoir on tbe demised property to both commercial and domestic users in the village of Herminie.

As the deed from Herminie to Stubbs, as well as the deed from Stubbs to the township, each specifically identified the Howell lease as among the subjects thereby conveyed, it is apparent that the question raised by the appellant turns solely upon whether Ocean Coal Company’s deed to Herminie Land Company was intended to, and did, assign the Howell lease.</p>
    <p id="b594-3" data-blocks='[["BL_594.3",594,[230,267,1153,1734]]]'>
      <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>The lease itself contained no restrictions upon its being assigned. On the contrary, it contemplated its possible assignment. Certain rights thereby created in the lessee were expressly made to run also in favor of the lessee’s “successors and assigns”. Nor was the lessor’s consent to an assignment required by the terms of the lease. While it is true that Ocean’s deed to Herminie did not mention the Howell lease, <em>eo nomine, </em>as a part of the intended grant, it did purport to convey “. . . any other . . . estates, rights and interest in land whatsoever, which have been heretofore acquired or reserved by the said grantor and are now owned by it.” That a lease is an interest in land and, as such, embraced by the comprehensive terms of the clause just quoted can hardly be disputed.

In view of the breadth of Ocean’s conveyance to Herminie and in the absence of any specific exclusion of the Howell lease therefrom, it would be unreasonable to construe Ocean’s deed to Herminie as excluding an assignment of the Howell lease. To do so would be directly contrary to the construction which Ocean and Herminie had placed upon the conveyance between them. Upon delivery of the deed, Ocean forthwith surrendered to Herminie the premises demised by the Howell lease and Herminie immediately entered thereupon as the lessee. It is beyond question that Ocean intended to grant to Herminie and the latter understood it was receiving from Ocean an assignment of the Howell lease.</p>

Each of them was concerned with whether certain memoranda, consisting of two or more apparently unrelated documents, were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. The question here presented is not whether there was an enforceable contract but whether an admittedly valid deed operated, inter alia, to assign a specific lease.</p>
    <p id="b595-3" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[169,712,1155,1413]],["BL_596.1",596,[247,278,1148,319]]]'>In any event, the plaintiff’s conduct estopped her from denying that the Howell lease was assigned by Ocean to Herminie. Upon entering into possession of the demised premises, consequent upon Ocean’s deed, Herminie assumed and discharged the liabilities of lessee under the Howell lease with the acquiescence of the plaintiff who received and accepted from Herminie the rentals due under the lease. Likewise, upon Herminie’s express transfer and assignment of the lease to Stubbs, the plaintiff knowingly treated the latter as lessee and received from him the rentals due under the lease. It is of no present importance to the question of Ocean’s assignment of the Howell lease that the plaintiff refused to accept rental from the township after the assignment by Stubbs. The plaintiff did in fact retain the township’s warrant for the first year’s rent for nine months before returning it. During that time the township was in possession of the demised property and had obligated itself in respect thereto without objection or remonstrapce from the plaintiff. Her continued refusals of the township’s warrant for the first year’s rental, down to March 27, 1941, were solely for the expressed reason that the township had acquired no rights in the Howell lease by virtue of the assignment from Stubbs. It was not until that date that plaintiff’s attorney in his letter returning the township’s re-offered warrant for <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>the first year’s rental and its check for the then accruing second year’s rental first assigned a want of legal tender as an additional reason for the plaintiff’s unwillingness to accept the township’s payment of the rental. It was then too late to interpose that objection so far as affecting the township’s prior tenders was concerned.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[248,608,1152,807]]]'>Were the use which the township made of the water from the reservoir a violation of the lease, it amounted at most to a breach of covenant and not a breach of condition. Even if this were doubtful, it is a well-established principle of law, applicable in all cases, that, wherever possible, a restriction upon the use of land will be construed as a covenant rather than as a condition: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. v. Delaware Division Canal Company, </em><a href="/pa/332/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="332 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1186563" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0053-01">332 Pa. 53</a>, 59, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.2d%20672" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 A.2d 672">1 A. 2d 672</a>. But, it is by no means clear that the township’s use of the water for appropriate municipal purposes within its own territorial limits constituted any breach of the covenant. The covenant did not purport to exclude uses of water by the lessee, its successors and assigns off the demised premises: cf. <em>Todd v. Sablosky, </em><a href="/pa/339/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="339 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1201265" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0504-01">339 Pa. 504</a>, 508, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20A.2d%20677" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="15 A.2d 677">15 A. 2d 677</a>.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[251,1425,1151,755]]]'>And, here again, the plaintiff’s conduct estopped her from asserting that the use made of the water by the township breached the covenant of the lease. Successively, Ocean Coal Company, Herminie Land Company and Stubbs all had supplied residents of the village of Herminie with water for domestic and commercial uses from the dam on the Howell property. And, while there was no affirmative proof that the plaintiff had knowledge of that circumstance, neither is there any evidence that she was without such knowledge. The use so made of the water was an open and notorious fact necessarily widely known locally and whereof the plaintiff, in connection with her application for a mandatory injunction, may well be considered to have had notice.</p>

Apart from the plaintiff’s evident desire to bring about a forfeiture of <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>the leasehold so as to compel the township to deal with her on her own terms, substantially the only damage whereof she complains is the dumping of some excavated earth on her property. Even as to that she has not yet offered proof of the extent of such damage, if any. The fact that the township tore down the old pump house and replaced it with a new and more modern one at large public expense was not a violation of the lessee’s covenant to deliver up the demised premises to the lessor at the end of the tenancy with the “dam, reservoir and pump house structure all in good and substantial repair and condition.” It was, rather, in keeping with the intendment of the covenant. The lease was virtually one in perpetuity so long as the lessee desired to keep the premises and paid the annual rental therefor when due. It was certainly within the contemplation of the parties to the lease that replacements would become necessary and that they might be made by the lessee without imperilling the leasehold. See <em>Todd v. Sablosky, </em>supra, where this Court, in construing a restriction in a lease against the use of demised property for certain businesses, said that it was “clear that the covenants . . . were not intended to prevent <em>any </em>commercial use of the premises.” Any damages that the plaintiff has suffered from the township’s use of the leased property can both adequately and completely be recovered at law.</p>
    <p id="b597-3" data-blocks='[["BL_597.4",597,[217,1706,1151,645]],["BL_598.1",598,[211,273,1151,1188]]]'>In any view, the plaintiff has not shown the “clear legal right to the use, occupation or enjoyment of the property” requisite to the granting of the equitable relief sought: <em>Myersdale &amp; Salisbury Street Railway Company v.

Moreover, the adverse and serious effect upon the public interest, were the relief which the plaintiff seeks granted, argues strongly for the withholding of equity’s grace. In <em>Becker v. The Lebanon and Myerstown Street Railway Company, </em><a href="/pa/188/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="188 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="901261" data-case-paths="/pa/188/0484-01">188 Pa. 484</a>, 495, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.%20612" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="41 A. 612">41 A. 612</a>, where, admittedly, a legal right of the plaintiff had been infringed, this Court said that <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>“In view of the learned judge’s findings in the present case, on the loss to the defendant, the inconvenience to the public, the smallness of the injury to the complainant and its easy compensability in money, he could scarcely have reached any other conclusion than that complainant, however clear his right, should be left to his remedy in damages.” The supportable findings of the learned chancellor in the instant case make the above-quoted ruling peculiarly apposite here. See also <em>Caruthers v. Peoples Natural Gas Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/155/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="155 Pa.

Cf. <em>McNanamy v. Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/114/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="114 Pa.

The conclusion is inescapable that the learned court below acted properly when it denied the plaintiff the equitable relief sought and certified the controversy to the law side of the court.</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[213,1474,1150,692]]]'>The contention of the appellant that the water district of the township was not created validly bears no material relation to the respective rights of the parties to the premises demised by the Howell lease which constitute the subject-matter of the plaintiff’s complaint. This is not a proceeding to test the legality of the water district. We cannot, therefore, appropriately concern ourselves with that question. However, it may be observed in passing that the plaintiff mistakenly relies upon provisions in the Public Utility Law which are pertinent where a municipality furnishes a public service to customers beyond its own territorial boundaries. Such is not the situation in this case.</p>
