    <p id="b47-7" data-blocks='[["BL_47.10",47,[203,867,1150,589]]]'>The question in this case is whether the State Department’s recognition of the defendant corporation as a governmental instrumentality of the Republic of Mexico, with an attendant right to sovereign immunity, required the court below to release property of the defendant from the grasp of the court’s process, viz., a writ of foreign attachment issued by the plaintiff against funds of the defendant on deposit in a local bank. The learned judge of the court below thought that it did and, accordingly, entered an order dissolving the writ, from which the plaintiff appeals.</p>
    <p id="b47-8" data-blocks='[["BL_47.11",47,[203,1469,1149,863]],["BL_48.1",48,[229,281,1150,1012]]]'>By an agreement entered into November 16, 1938, the plaintiff, an Ohio corporation, agreed to supply, according to specifications, the equipment and materials necessary for the construction by the defendant, under the plaintiff’s supervision, of a manufacturing plant in Mexico for the defendant’s use. On December 7, 1938, the parties to the construction agreement, together with the Butler County National Bank &amp; Trust Company, of Butler, Pennsylvania, entered into an escrow agreement. By the terms of that agreement the defendant was required to deposit with the bank, as escrow agent, the sum of |125,000 to secure payment to the plaintiff of the sums due for the purchase of the equipment and materials necessary for the construction of the defendant’s plant under the contract. The escrow agreement provided that the last |50,000 of the money so deposited was <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>not to be paid to the plaintiff until certification by the latter to the escrow agent that all of the terms of the construction contract had been complied with and a like certification by the defendant that the completed plant fulfilled the specifications and requirements of the contract. All but $25,000 of the money deposited in escrow had been paid to the plaintiff by August 18, 1944. On that date, the plaintiff, claiming to have complied with all of the terms of the construction contract and having so certified to the escrow agent, caused the balance on deposit to be attached by virtue of a writ of foreign attachment issued out of the court below against the defendant and summoning the depositary bank as garnishee. The issue here involved is unrelated to any controversy as to the plaintiff’s performance of the construction contract. The sole question is whether the court below had jurisdiction to entertain the attachment proceeding in view of the following admitted or undenied facts.</p>

As a basis for the claim of immunity, the communication set forth that Petróleos Mexicanos is “an instrumentality of the Mexican Government”; is wholly owned and controlled by that Government; and that it had been incorporated and organized on June 7, 1938, as a “public institution” by decree of the Congress of the Mexican United States for the purpose of operating and developing oil properties in Mexico which the government of that country had expropriated a few months earlier. After twenty per cent of the profits from the corporation’s operations had been set aside as contingent reserves, seventy-five per cent of the balance was to be paid to the Mexican Government and twenty-five per cent <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>to the corporation’s “workers”. The communication and attached documents set forth further matters which show the public character and purpose of Petróleos Mexicanos, but, with that, we need not be concerned. The matter of present importance is the action taken by the Secretary of State and not its merit.</p>
    <p id="b49-4" data-blocks='[["BL_49.4",49,[192,603,1150,756]]]'>As a result of the communication from the Mexican Charge d’Affairs, Secretary Hull on October 4,1944, addressed a letter to the Honorable Francis Biddle, Attorney General of the United States, which, in part here material, reads as follows: “The [State] Department accepts as true the statements made by the Charge d’Affairs ad interim of Mexico that the defendant, Petróleos Mexicanos, is a public agency or instrumentality of the sovereign state of Mexico; and I may add that it has heretofore been recognized as such by this Government.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Consequently, this Government recognizes and allows the claim of the Government of Mexico that Petróleos Mexicanos is immune from suit and its property from attachment.</p>

    <p id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[235,982,1155,1188]]]'>As stated by Mr. Chief Justice Stone in <em>Ex Parte Republic of Peru, </em><a href="/us/318/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="318 U.S. 578" data-case-ids="364517" data-case-paths="/us/318/0578-01">supra, at p. 588</a>, the “ * * * principle is that courts may not so exercise their jurisdiction, by the seizure and detention of the property of a friendly sovereign, as to embarrass the executive arm of the Government in conducting foreign relations. ‘In such cases the judicial department of this government follows the action of the political branch, and will not embarrass the latter by assuming an antagonistic jurisdiction’ ”. Again, from the same authority at p. 589, — “This practice is founded upon the policy, recognized both by the Department of State and the courts, that our national interest will be better served in such cases if the wrongs to suitors, involving our relations with a friendly foreign power, are righted through diplomatic negotiations rather than by the compulsions of judicial proceedings”. Nor is the constitutional power of the executive branch of the national government in the field of foreign relations “ * * * limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition” : <em>United States v. Pink, </em><a href="/us/315/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="315 U.S. 203" data-case-ids="374717" data-case-paths="/us/315/0203-01">315 U. S. 203</a>, 229.</p>

It is irrelevant here that the foreign instrumentality conducts a commercial enterprise which, it was contemplated, would show a profit. Even if that had present relevancy, the enterprise was for the development of the trade and commerce of the foreign government and to supply revenues for its treasury, — appropriate concerns of that government: cf. <em>Berizzi Brothers Company v. Steamship </em>Pesaro, <a href="/us/271/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="271 U.S. 562" data-case-ids="1276177" data-case-paths="/us/271/0562-01">271 U. S. 562</a>, 574. Nor is it of any significance that the governmental instrumentality is a separate corporation. A determination by the Secretary of State with respect to the status of such instrumentalities is as binding upon the courts of this country as is his determination with respect to a foreign government itself. Cf. <em>United States v. </em>Pink, <a href="/us/315/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="315 U.S. 203" data-case-ids="374717" data-case-paths="/us/315/0203-01">supra, at p. 229</a>, and <em>The Maret, </em>supra, at p. 442.</p>

The learned judge of the court below was unable to find any waiver; and, likewise, neither can we, either in the construction contract, the escrow agreement or elsewhere in the record now before us. On the other hand, the Mexican Government, the creator and beneficiary of the instrumentality, seasonably made claim of immunity in the defendant’s behalf before the Department of State which at once acknowledged the right and promptly caused the court below to be informed accordingly.</p>
