Appeal from said probate was taken by decedent’s two brothers sister to the or-phans’ court, averring that the alleged will was a forgery and praying that the of administration cum testa-mento annexo be revoked and set aside. An answer was filed averring that the instrument was the will of the decedent. After a hearing appellant petitioned the court to award an issue devisavit vel non for trial of the charge of forgery.

Lare had become proficient in shorthand and typing. She was employed as stenographer and typist for a number of years and as private secretary to the General Sales Manager of the Crescent Portland Cement Company until 1929. From that date she was never gainfully employed and rarely, if ever, used a typewriter for any purpose although she owned an Underwood portable machine, the one admittedly used in the preparation of the alleged will. All her correspondence was carried on in longhand.</p>

This generosity continued until she died. Upon Kilpatrick’s death she inherited considerable money which yielded an annual income of approximately $10,000. In 1937, Dr. Pracht, her physician, introduced her to Marcellus R. Lare, Jr., appellant, who was then employed as a security salesman and had been previously employed in a bank. He was a man of little property. A year and a half later they were married in Miami. Appellant left his position in a Miami bank shortly before the marriage, and in April of 1939 they moved to Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. In 1940, decedent purchased a $15,000 home in Mount Lebanon, and took title in the name of her husband and herself as tenants by the entireties. Appellees testified that the married life of decedent was unhappy and that she suffered from high blood pressure and upon several occasions was a patient at a hospital and a sanitorium. She was troubled and disturbed by his failure to obtain employment, his continued attempts to interfere with her friendly relationships with,her brothers and sister, and his demand for an increased share of her wealth. He left her for two weeks and lived with his mother. He then accepted a position as accountant for the Rust Engineering Company at Portsmouth, Virginia, and retained this position from December, 1940, until April, <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>1941. During this period decedent visited him twice. Later he returned to Pittsburgh and accepted an appointment to the force of Pennsylvania Bank Examiners which required him to spend much time away from home. J. Kirk Benner, Esq., attended to the small amount of legal work which her property required. He had been attorney for the estate of her first husband.</p>
    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[175,665,1150,373]]]'>The check upon which the alleged will was written was identified as coming from the back of her check book. She had been in the habit of removing blank cheeks, signing and carrying them about in her wallet. The check in question was withdrawn from the back of the book some time between her admission to the West Penn hospital on May 13, 1940, and May 16, 1940.</p>
    <p id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[171,1050,1153,853]]]'>Immediately upon her decease appellant contacted Renner and inquired whether his wife had left a will and was informed that although she had often mentioned the possibility of making a will providing for her sister and brothers he knew of none. Several days later Renner and Lare had a lengthy discussion at the latter’s home about the manner in which the estate would be settled in event of intestacy. After letters of administration had been granted on June 29, 1942, Lare, on July 2, wrote to Renner forwarding numerous papers, among which was the purported will. Renner’s advice was to destroy the check. He stated that he would not represent Lare or any other interested party in the settlement of the estate. Numerous attempts were made by appellant to secure Renner as counsel, all of which failed.</p>

At the trial, comparison of Lare’s typewriting, made in open court, with that of the reputed will, failed because Lare at that time used an unusually heavy touch. Mr. Nernberg, a handwriting expert, compared the signature on the alleged will with admittedly genuine signa<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>tures of the decedent and was of opinion that the former could not have been that of the decedent.</p>
    <p id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.4",362,[239,392,1153,1729]]]'>The evidence adduced in support of the validity of the instrument shows that many unimpeachable witnesses agreed that the signature was that of decedent and genuine. Analysis of Mrs. Lare’s signatures show them to have similar characteristics with regard to size and variation. Only appellees’ witness declared it a forgery. Nernberg failed to take into consideration degrees of variation in writing and made no comparison with exhibits made on or near the date of the alleged signature. Mrs. Lare, around the date of the will, used both dark and green ink. Numerous exhibits were put in evidence in which blue ink was used, to disprove appellees’ theory that to be genuine the signature would of necessity have been in green ink. Three people saw Mrs. Lare use the typewriter during the last several years of her life. Although having been ill for a number of years she had not typed professionally for thirteen years. The machine she was using was a small portable machine, not the larger business office type. The typing on the check is neat and the margins well arranged, and not crowded. Comparison of the letters of expert typists, made in the court room, reveal the same errors allegedly existing upon the will. An exhibit typed by one of the professional typists in the court room revealed the same misalignment urged by the appellees as evidence of a forgery. Lare had a habit of completing and punctuating dates; Mrs. Lare wrote partial dates. The contested instrument does not contain any punctuation after the date. Exhibits of actual typing by Mrs. Lare were offered, and Leslie, appellant’s expert, used the same for comparison in determining the typing to be that of decedent.</p>

Any quarrels they had arose over the great amount of gifts of money which were given to the contestants or their children. Her generosity decreased considerably <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>in the last year of her life. Many exhibits refer to the happy marriage and her great desire to be with him whenever possible. Although contestants were continually attempting to create friction between decedent and appellant, on April 24, 1942, she wrote “I want to live and enjoy life and you and our house.” Upon numerous occasions she remarked that she would leave all to her husband, thus establishing the disposition of her estate to be a natural one.

The issue raised by a petition to set aside the order of the Register of Wills and to revoke the letters of administration C.T.A. issued to M. R. Lare, Jr., was thoroughly litigated before Judge Milholland, of the Orphans’ Court, in a protracted hearing which lasted, with brief recesses, from July 9th to July 23,1943. The record before us comprises 3,290 pages. It was the conclusion of Judge Milholland that the wili was a forgery and that ho jury verdict sustaining it could be permitted to stand. Exceptions were filed to this adjudication, and these were argued before the court en banc, consisting of Judges Teimble, Patteeson and Milholland. The court en banc adopted Judge Milholland’s findings and conclusions that the alleged will was a forgery. I agree with Judge Milholland and the court en banc that the will is a forgery and that no jury finding in its favor could be sustained. There is no reasonable expectation that any further light would be thrown upon this case by a jury trial. The record of such a trial would presumably be about the same as the record now before us. On this record a verdict sustaining this alleged will would be most unlikely and to sustain such a verdict would be shocking to any judicial conscience.</p>

While, of course, a will can be written on a bank check form, it is so unusual for anyone to do so when ample paper is available and there is no necessity to write a will on a bank check form, that when an alleged will so written is offered for probate it naturally excites suspicion as to its genuineness. Before it is accepted as a will there ought to be some plausible explanation as to why the alleged testator chose to write a will on such a small piece of paper, and on the side of it which contained printed matter instead of the side of it which was blank. The bank check form allegedly used for the writing of this alleged will was 6-% inches in length and 2-% inches in width. It contained about one inch from the top the printed words “Forbes National Bank.” Near its right end and about an inch from the bottom it contained the word “Dollars,” and about one inch above that word and a little to the left of it is a dollar ($) sign, and near the top are the words “Pittsburgh, Pa. No.” and on the left side are the words: “Pay to the order of.” Mrs. Lare, the alleged maker of this alleged will had had business experience and had been a “skillful typist.” From 1919 to 1929 she had been secretary to the General Sales Manager of a cement company. A person of ordi<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>nary business sense and experience would not be likely to use a <em>blank check </em>as a paper on which to write her will disposing of property of the value of $80,000, and if because of some unusual circumstance she did use a blank check for that purpose she would naturally use <em>not </em>the already partially occupied face of the check but the totally unoccupied back of it. There is probably not a single instance anywhere of any person using the <em>face </em>of a “blank” check containing the usual printed matter, on which to typewrite a <em>will. </em>Mrs. Lare, who had been a trained secretary, doubtless had plenty of paper available for the writing of a will in the usual form and would not have resorted to her. check book for paper on which to express her testamentary intentions.</p>

This fact was inferentially admitted by Lare who testified that he once told his wife he “would not give or take a blank check from Jesus Christ; it is too dangerous.” This alleged will was evidently written on a blank check form on which Mrs. Lare had carefully written her name on the signature line, intending that the form should later be filled out as a <em>check. </em>The blank on which this “will” was written was taken from the check book between <em>May 13th and 16th, 1940. </em>The will bears a date <em>twenty months later, </em>i.e., January 21,1942. Each check book of 201 checks which Mrs. Lare used, lasted about one year. She did not use a new book until all the checks in the preceding book were used. It is unthinkable that anyone writing a will on January 21, 1942, on a blank check, would use one from a book that had been depleted of all its blanks nearly two years previously? The obvious inference is that Lare had obtained possession of a blank but signed check of his wife’s in <em>1940 </em>and had carefully retained it for the very fraudulent purpose for which he used it twenty months later. The paper on which this alleged will was written shows unmistakable signs of having been kept for a long period (See “#12,” post).</p>

It is highly improbable that the decedent who inherited all her estate from her first husband who died in 1935, would leave all her estate to her second husband whom she married thirty-eight months before the alleged will was executed, to the exclusion of her two surviving brothers and one sister. One brother was in 1942 about 35 years of age, and the other about 52 years of age, and the sister was about 40 years of age. Mrs. Lare’s relations with them were amicable. She had talked to her attorney, J. Kirk Kenner, and expressed her desire to make a will in which provisions would be made for her brothers and her sister and their children. Mrs. Lare’s attorney testified that in one of the last of Mrs. Lare’s many telephone conversations with him, she spoke of a plan to visit his office in Connellsville, as soon as she should recover from her illness, to carry out a plan to make a will providing for “Katherine and the boys,” meaning the three contestants who are appellees here, “and their children.” Lare himself admitted that Mrs. Lare “thought warmly of her family.” There was evidence that she expressed a belief that Mr. Lare “had married her for her money.” The court found that “old, established friend of the decedent, who knew her well enough to learn from her that her life with Mr. Lare was a most unhappy one, [testified that] one of the principal causes of her unhappiness was that she was unwilling to forget her regard for contestants or to abandon her practice to make material provisions for them in the face of Mr. Lare’s jealous and bitter opposition.”</p>

Attorney Kenner had been the executor of the will of Mrs. Lare’s first husband, who left all his estate to her. Mr. Kenner continued to do all her legal work until her death. She trusted him so implicitly that she sent him “checks signed in blank to be used after he filled them in, for the correct amount, to the proper payees.” She wrote him and told him about her anxiety to make a will “to take care of her sister and brothers.” During the last three or four months of her life” she talked to <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>Attorney Renner on the telephone. <em>Yet she never mentioned to this </em>trusted attorney and personal adviser anything about the will which was offered for probate in this case and which bears the date, January 21,1942.

A most significant circumstance against the genuineness of Lare’s claim that this blank check “will” is his wife’s will is the fact that after his wife’s attorney, J. Kirk Renner, had told him “If I were in your position I would not attempt to probate that as Gertrude’s will,” that the “will” was a forgery and to “tear it up,” he requested Mr. Renner to become his attorney and secure for him the probate of the paper as a will. Lare admitted in his testimony that Attorney Renner said to him: “Tear it up! I would not probate that will.” Lare then became “very excited, jumped from his chair, began pacing back and forth” and said: “You don’t think I would do anything like that, do you? [evidently meaning to forge a will]. I put men in the penitentiary for less than that.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> After this interview with Attorney Renner, Lare waited two or three weeks, i.e., until July <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>31st, before offering the “will for probate.” When asked why he held the will so long after this interview, Lare replied: “I wanted him [Renner] to state in writing to me his position.”</p>

Lare’s testimony as to where the alleged will was found and how he found it greatly strengthens one’s conviction that this “will” is a fraud. Mrs. Lare had in her home a steel filing cabinet, with a lock on it, in which she kept stock certificates, fire and automobile insurance policies, title to car, war savings bonds and other valuable papers. <em>Yet Tier will disposing of property worth $80,000 was not kept in this boa, </em>but Lare found this will, so he says, “in the last place in the world I would expect to find it,” in her wallet. He found it there, so he says, when he was looking for her automobile registration card which he wanted in order to obtain the manufacturer’s number of Mrs. Lare’s automobile. He could easily have obtained this from the title certificate which he well knew was in the steel box to which he had the key. Though Lare quickly found the registration card in the wallet, he did not at once use the information thus obtained for the necessary inscription of the Federal Stamp Tax (his avowed purpose), but he kept on searching in the wallet and “in the right hand compartment having the flap over it” he found the “will.” He says “he then sat there and started to bawl.” It is indeed strange that Mrs. Lare would carry her will in her wallet, though all other valuable papers were <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>carefully kept in a steel cabinet, and it is equally strange that she had never informed her attorney or even Lare himself or anyone else of the existence of this will, though she held frequent communications with her attorney <em>after </em>the date of the alleged will.</p>
    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[176,557,1150,1623]]]'>7. Another circumstance which is highly condemnatory of Lare’s good faith in this matter is found in the threatening language he used in an obvious attempt to discourage the contest of the “will” he offered for probate. After Attorney Renner refused to represent Lare, the latter wrote Renner under date of July 17, 1942, inter alia, as follows (Rec. 3304a) : “In regard to the possibility of contest, I have nothing whatsoever to fear. ... In event of any attack you will of course be in a vulnerable spot for you will have to testify as to what ever you may know about anything. You will be in the meleé even if you would like to stay out. While I will not push you I know that you will be pushed and plenty hard.” Then he said: “It will be rather hard for them [his wife’s brothers and sister] to hear their heritage from the mouths of the doctors and nurses who have attended Pat for the last few years. I cannot help that.” The word “heritage” is a little cryptic, but apparently Lare was threatening disclosures which might embarrass the brothers and sister. This letter evidenced a desire on Lare’s part to blackmail both Attorney Renner and the relatives into silence, so that he could reap the fruits of the alleged “will,” which Attorney Renner had discredited. What this court said in <em>McHugh v. McHugh, </em><a href="/pa/186/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="186 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="989688" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0197-01">186 Pa. 197</a>, 203, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.%20410" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="40 A. 410">40 A. 410</a>, is apposite here: “. . . evidence of the misconduct of a party in connection with the trial is admissible as tending to show that the party guilty of the misconduct is unwilling to rely on the truth of his cause, or is conscious that it is an unjust one.”</p>

When we consider that the established fact that Mrs. Lare was a skillful and experienced typist, this spurious “will” <em>shows on its face </em>that it was never <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>typed by her. As Judge Milholland aptly said in his opinion: “. . . the contestants offered the testimony of two experts, Mrs. Grace Martin Cornelius and Mr. Nernberg. . . . Both of these experts working independently of each other, reached the same conclusion: that the typewriting on the alleged will could not possibly have been the work of a typist having professional training and experience, such as was possessed by the decedent, and that the errors and peculiarities of the typewriting on the alleged will were the same as those which consistently appeared in all the admitted typewriting works of Mr. Lare. The peculiarities referred to by both of these experts were the uneven touch reflected in the varying blackness of the letters in the alleged will; the awkward confusion of the word “all” with the printed “$”; the peculiar single spacing after periods, which would never occur in the work of a typist having the training and experience of the decedent; the erratic misalignments in the body of the will; the inconsistent misalignment of the date and the punctuation of the closing sentence of the alleged will.” That all skillful typists make <em>two </em>spaces after a period was proved and is obvious from the casual inspection of well typed letters. Appellant concedes.“it appears in the record that Mr. Lare’s typing does show the habit of making [only] one space after a period.” Six samples of Lare’s typing each show a single space after periods, as does the “will” he offers for probate. A trained typist, as Mrs. Lare was, would leave two spaces after each period. Two experts on typing testified that it was Lare himself who typed this challenged paper and the reasons they gave for their conclusion are convincing.</p>

There are on the blank check form used for this will 12 printed words and a printed sign and the numbers 8-139. None of these had been obliterated. It is obvious that <em>if </em>a skillful typist used the face of this check form for the purpose of writing a will on it, she would have “blotted out” the above words and sign and num<a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>bers. No person of Mrs. Lare’s long experience as a secretary would on such an important document as her will, allow tbe printed words “Forbes National Bank” and “Pay to the Order of” to appear in it when they serve no purpose there. These printed words would naturally induce a trained typist if she was going to use a “blank check” to write a will to use the <em>bach </em>of the check on which no printed words or signs or numbers appeared.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[182,778,1149,365]]]'>10. Judge Milholland and the court en banc concluded from the testimony of several credible witnesses that though Mrs. Lare was a skillful typist, she during the latter years of her life avoided the use of a typewriter. It is therefore improbable that Mrs. Lare would revert to the use of the typewriter in order to write a 43 word will.</p>

On January 9, 19.43, at Mr. Lare’s direction, his counsel addressed to Mr. Nernberg and Mr. Fearon (the expert witnesses employed by Lare) identical letters which purported to offer for their inspection several hundred specimens of his dead wife’s <em>handwriting, </em>and which requested that the two experts compare these with the signature on the alleged will, and so determine whether the latter was or was not genuine. Neither of the experts employed by Lare offered any specimen of Mr. Lare’s <em>typewriting, </em>or suggested the existence of any specimens of Mrs. Lare’s typewriting, or the possibility of any comparison of either Mr. Lare’s or the decedent’s typewriting with that appearing on the alleged will. Though Mr. Lare engaged an expert, E. C. Leslie, and through the latter asked Lare to furnish him samples of Mrs. Lare’s “work on the typewriter” and though he repeated these requests during the months preceding the trial, Lare did not furnish samples of her typewriting, (except a few unsatisfactory carbon copies). As a result, Mr. Leslie was never able to form any opinion of the genuineness or forgery of the typewriting on the alleged will. His testimony indicates that he devoted <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>himself to the study of Mrs. Lare’s <em>signature. </em>He testified (2319a) that he saw some carbon copies of Mrs. Lare’s typing and when asked whether these carbon copies were satisfactory he answered “They were satisfactory to the extent that I could not say whether Mrs. Lare typed or did not type the will, I could not honestly say she did or honestly say she did not.”</p>

Another circumstance which stamps this “will” as fraudulent is the fact that although the typing on this paper was comparably fresh, the paper itself showed age.

If Mrs. Lare signed a check form not filled out (as was her custom) and if her husband came into possession of such a paper and if he over her genuine signature wrote a will, without her authorization, that will is a forgery.

The chancellor and the court en banc did not believe Lare’s testimony and characterized “much of it” as “evasive and contradictory.” Lare’s claim that his wife and not he typed the “will” is contradicted by an array of facts which proclaim the alleged will a sham. Lare had a strong motive to lie in this case for if his testimony is accepted he will receive not merely half of his wife’s $80,000 estate under the intestate laws (which he gets in any event), but also the other half of her estate under a will which he undoubtedly criminally fabricated.

It based its decision on the facts that the alleged will contained words and names inconsistent with decedent’s education and knowledge, that it did not carry out his expressed intentions as to the disposition of his estate, that the story told to explain the delay in producing the will Avas highly improbable, that there was evidence of the spurious character of the signature of the second witness and that the signature of one of the subscribing witnesses was a forgery and that the presumptive beneficiary of the will Avas not the person the decedent had ever declared his intention to make his principal beneficiary. In that case this court affirmed the action of the court below, and said, inter alia: “Fraud, of which forgery is a glaring example, is one of the principal grounds of equity jurisdiction, and, as a general rule, equity may decree the cancellation of a written instrument found to be a forgery: 9 Corpus Juris, 1195” and other authorities and cases.

In <em>Fleming’s Estate </em>there was at least one “subscribing witness” whose signature apparently withstood all attacks made upon its genuineness, and yet this court held that the Orphans’ Court reached a right decision in refusing an issue.

Is the signature on the alleged will the handwriting of Mrs. Lare; and, if it is, did she sign the document before or after the typewriting was inscribed upon it?</p>
    <p id="b388-6" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[261,989,1151,261]]]'>On this point, Mr. Lare, proponent, relies wholly on the testimony of his expert, Mr. Leslie, corroborated by that of several lay witnesses, that the signature is in Mrs. Lare’s handwriting. Mr. Lare offered no evidence tending to show that it was written in January, 1942.</p>
    <p id="b388-7" data-blocks='[["BL_388.7",388,[261,1261,1150,642]]]'>To answer this, contestants showed, by physical comparisons of the questioned signature with admitted signatures of January, 1942, and of earlier years, corroborated by the testimony of their expert, Mr. Nernberg, that the questioned signature is quite different from genuine signatures of January, 1942, but very much like those of the earlier years — particularly signatures of May, 1940. These facts, as Mr. Lare’s expert conceded, tend to show that the questioned signature was not written in January, 1942, and that it must, instead, have been written in May, 1940, or at some period similarly remote from the date of the alleged will.</p>

    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.3",389,[165,278,1149,589]]]'>
      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>On this issue, Mr. Lare offered no evidence in the Orphans’ Court. Since the hearing, and in this Court, he has attempted to compare the typewriting on the alleged will with that of Mrs. Lare’s sister, Katherine M. Sayre, arguing that this comparison shows that the typewriting on the alleged will was the work of a skilled operator. This argument may be ignored, however. To justify its rejection, it is necessary only to observe that Mrs. Sayre was not a proficient typist; or to compare the typewriting on the alleged will with the work of an experienced typist on such a document as a Will or Deed.</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[166,879,1151,1346]]]'>To prove forgery of the typewriting, contestants showed that Mrs. Lare had been a highly proficient touch typist of many years’ experience in business, but that she had avoided using the typewriter for any purpose during some years before her death — no sample of typewriting known to be her work was produced by anybody at the hearing. These things were not contradicted. Contestants offered also the testimony of their experts, Mr. Nernberg and Mrs. Cornelius, which was corroborated by the physical appearance of the typewriting on the alleged will, showing two things: that it could not have been the work of a skilled typist, and that its defects were the same as appeared in the many available samples of Mr. Lare’s work produced on the same typewriter. This testimony was not contradicted by Mr. Lare’s expert. It was contradicted only by Mr. Lare’s denial, in rebuttal, that he had typewritten the alleged will; and the weight of this denial was lessened by the fact that, when he was required to operate the typewriter during the hearing, and so to provide samples of his work for comparison with that of the alleged will, Mr. Lare adopted a touch and a method of operating the machine which, as his own expert admitted, were most unnatural, and which tended to disguise and conceal the characteristics of his normal work.</p>

This finding was of the greatest importance; bnt it required the rejection of no evidence offered by Mr. Lare, except his denial of any part in the making of the alleged will, and Mr. Leslie’s opinion that it is impossible to distinguish the work of skilled and unskilled typists.</p>

    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[259,722,1151,741]]]'>To support the alleged will, Mr. Lare relied wholly upon the testimony of Mr. Leslie that the signature was genuine; upon his own denial that he had typewritten the document; and upon the contention that the alleged will was a natural one; i.e., upon letters addressed to him by Mrs. Lare which expressed her affectionate regard for him — but which made no reference to any plan to give him any portion of her estate; upon the testimony of two hairdressers and a comparative stranger, concerning declarations of her plans to provide for him in her will; and, finally, upon argument (refuted by Mr. Lare’s own testimony) that Mrs. Lare, by January, 1942, has become estranged from the contestants, and her former friends and business associates.</p>

Among these were such things as the facts that the alleged will was typewritten on a blank check, which had been removed from Mrs. Lare’s checkbook in May, 1940; that she had, during her lifetime, given blank, signed checks to persons she trusted — to Mr. Renner, admittedly, and to Mr. Lare <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>also, to judge by the appearance of Ms handwriting above her signature on a great many of her cancelled checks; that she had carried a blank, signed check in her purse at times shortly before her death; and that the alleged will had the physical appearance of an old, worn blank check on which a fresh, typewritten inscription had been impressed.</p>
    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[149,663,1152,530]]]'>Judge Milholland concluded that the alleged will was a forgery and that no jury verdict sustaining it could be permitted to stand. To reach this conclusion, he relied on the two ultimate findings just described — concerning the signature and the typewriting, plus a number of circumstances which were, without important exception, open to no dispute. In other words, to sustain a finding of forgery, it was not necessary to reject any significant testimony offered by Mr. Lare, except that of Mr. Lare himself.</p>
    <p id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[152,1212,1155,1033]]]'>Thus, since nobody else had access to the typewriter used to write the will, the Chancellor found that, if Mrs. Lare had not typewritten the document, it must have been the work of Mr. Lare. But if he typewrote it —which followed from the finding of fact, discussed above, that Mrs. Lare did not — he was certainly guilty of perjury, and the alleged will was almost as certainly a forgery. Every other known circumstance of the case tended to corroborate that conclusion. Mr. Lare had the essential motive; his own testimony and his conduct at every stage of the matter showed that he desired greatly to obtain his wife’s entire estate. He had the opportunity : it was conceded that his wife had not hesitated to carry and to issue checks bearing her signature, but otherwise in blank. The peculiarities of the instrument itself: those of its origin in the 1940 checkbook; those of its alleged discovery after Mrs. Lare’s death; and those of Mr. Lare’s attempts to maintain it, were all undisputed ; and they all pointed to the conclusion of forgery.</p>
    <p id="b391-6" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[159,2253,1148,101]]]'>The Chancellor’s findings of fact in this case have the quality and weight of the verdict of a jury.</p>

      <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>Mr. Lare’s argument implies that this Court can and should review the evidence and determine for itself whether the Chancellor’s findings are correct or not.

    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[240,611,1157,1077]]]'>In <em>Lowe’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/318/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="318 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1159579" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0497-01">318 Pa. 497</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.%20820" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="178 A. 820">178 A. 820</a>, the decedent was an elderly woman, and the contestant her son. By an admittedly genuine will made in 1931, she had conferred many benefits on the son. After her death, a paper dated 1934 was produced and offered for probate as a later will. The son (who stood to lose much under the new instrument) contested probate, contending that it was a forgery, and also that, if it were genuine, the testatrix had lacked testamentary capacity, and had been subject to undue influence. There were conflicts in the evidence on all issues. For example, a number of lay and expert witnesses testified that the signature was not genuine; this being met by testimony of the same kind that it was genuine. The Chancellor found as facts that the testimony in favor of the alleged will was true, and the testimony against it therefore false; and refused contestant’s request for an issue d.v.n. His findings were approved by the Orphans’ Court en banc. This Court held that such findings of fact are conclusive here (Simpson, J., p. 501):</p>

In the Orphans’ Court, the burden of proof of her testamentary capacity and of her freedom from undue influence was properly imposed upon the proponent. The evidence was in conflict. For example, the contestants produced the testimony of several physicians, which indicated that the testatrix had lacked the capacity to make a will. Nevertheless, the Chancellor found as facts, in an opinion affirmed by the Orphans’ Court en banc, that the testatrix had been mentally capable, and that the alleged will was valid; and refused an issue d.v.n.

Testatrix was an elderly widow, who was survived by a number of children.

James contradicted this; and offered lay and expert evidence of genuineness. So far, the case required— principally — a choice between the testimony of a self-confessed forger and that of an apparently honest man ; but the circumstantial evidence favored a conclusion of forgery. James’ account of the discovery of the will was suspicious — it was almost exactly like Mr. Lare’s account of the discovery of the alleged will here; and the Culbertson will, if genuine and properly dated, had appointed as executor a twelve-year-old-boy.

    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[177,770,1151,535]]]'>“The parties were personally heard by Judge Gest, and his findings of fact, attesting the truth of the statements heretofore set forth, approved by the court in banc, fully cover the contentions raised by the respective parties. It is needless, in passing upon the merits of the case, to refer to the unbroken line of authorities which hold that the facts as determined by the orphans’ court are conclusive upon us where based upon sufficient evidence, and an examination of the record shows those made here to have been fully justified.”</p>
    <p id="b403-6" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[177,1318,1151,760]]]'>In each of these four forgery cases, the Chancellor was required to decide bitterly contested issues of fact, from evidence containing conflicts far more substantial and difficult — and much less one-sided — than those presented by this record. In each of the four, the Chancellor was, nevertheless, convinced by the evidence that no verdict of genuineness could be a true verdict, and being so convinced he rejected the proponent’s evidence, refused proponent an issue, and set aside the alleged will. This method of treating such cases simply applied the rule in <em>Caughey v. Bridenbaugh, </em>supra, and <em>Phillips Estate, </em>supra; and, when we affirmed the Orphans’ Courts, in all four cases, this Court simply applied that rule, and the related rules which have been discussed.</p>

There the court below refused an issue and we reversed on the ground that there was a breach of judicial discretion, because the evidence showed <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>that no Chancellor conscientiously could have found that there was not a substantial dispute. Here, however, the manifest weight of the evidence clearly shows that the purported will is a forgery and the Chancellor properly so found. No judicial mind, in my judgment, could have reached any other conclusion. His findings are overwhelmingly supported by the evidence and therefore should be binding on this Court.</p>

It appeared that the contestant had made some efforts to forge a will, and to buy favorable testimony. This Court said (Kephabt, J., p. 342) : “. . . This evidence was not impeached on cross-examination, and was denied by appellant only. It is scarcely necessary to comment on the effect of this testimony on contestant’s credibility as well as on the good faith of this proceeding.
