    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[247,429,1153,1191]]]'>There was formerly a residential property at 820 South Washington Avenue in the City of Scranton, and in 1916 a service pipe for gas was installed in the premises. In 1928 defendant company, which is a public utility corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing gas and water, was notified that gas was no longer required for this property; accordingly, it removed the meters from the house and stopped the service, but, instead of disconnecting the line at the curb, it merely capped the service pipe inside the cellar wall and retained gas in the pipe under pressure from the Washington Avenue main. Later in that same year the house was torn down, the cellar filled in, and the service pipe buried in earth, cinders and debris. In 1929 a factory building was erected upon the lot; the basement was located in a different place than the old cellar and a concrete floor was laid upon the filled-in ground over this pipe. A new service pipe was installed in 1938 entering the factory building from a different street, but this service also was discontinued and this new pipe capped in 1940, since which time no gas whatever has been furnished to the premises.</p>

It was discovered that the disused pipe which had originally served the residence was rusted through and full of holes, and it is not contested that the gas which caused the explosions escaped from that pipe.</p>

While its measure of responsibility is not that of an insurer, the company is liable for an explosion when it knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care should have known, of a defect in its pipes or mains. It is not sufficient for it merely to install proper lines and fixtures but it is required to maintain them, and this entails inspection from time to time and watchfulness for conditions incident to natural wear and tear: <em>Heh v.

But this principle of non-liability on the part of the company in the case of a service pipe, as distinguished from its own mains, is not without exception, for if the gas company knows that there are defects in such a pipe, or is in possession of facts which should reasonably inform it that it is unsafe, it then becomes its duty to investigate the safety of the pipe before it continues to use it for the transportation of gas, and if it fails in that duty it becomes liable for any resulting accident. More specifically, if the company knows, or under the circumstances has reason to know, that a service line is rusted and corroded to such an extent as to permit gas to escape therefrom, it would be its duty either to notify the property owner to repair it, or to shxit the gas off at the street in order to avoid the likely danger: <em>Windish v.

Here defendant maintained its gas under pressure in a service pipe which, by the exercise of the slightest, much less a high, degree of care, it would have realized was unsafe for the purpose. Its records showed the original installation and the location of the pipe, and, having this information, and knowing that this pipe had remained buried, unrepaired and uncared for during a period of almost 14 years, it should have shut off the gas at the curb or else disconnected the line at the main. The pipe had been definitely abandoned and served no useful purpose whatever as far as the property owner was concerned for plaintiff was no longer a consumer of the company’s gas; defendant not only knew that the house which the pipe had supplied had long been torn down, but it had installed a new service pipe from another street into the factory building now erected on the premises. While the pipe itself continued, of course, to belong to the owner of the property, the gas in it belonged to defendant, and the only right that a gas company has to maintain or store its product under the surface of a private owner’s ground is for the purpose of supplying the property with the gas contracted for by the owner or the tenant; when that purpose is not being subserved the company is subject to the same duty of inspection and care with respect to the service pipe as devolves upon it in respect to the pipes which it itself owns and uses in the conveyance and storage of its gas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

While its failure under such circumstances to cut the service off at the street may not in itself constitute negligence, there <em>is </em>imposed upon it the duty to exercise a high degree of care and to inspect, maintain and keep the service pipe in repair as long as it is so used, and for failure to observe this duty it must be held responsible for any resulting injury to innocent persons or their property: <em>Canfield v.
