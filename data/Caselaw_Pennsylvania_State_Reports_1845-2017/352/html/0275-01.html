Swartley constituted a partnership, trading as Philadelphia Steel and Iron Company, and will be referred to as Steel Company. Their plant is at Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, where they employ over 200 employees. On January 22, 1942, they had a lot of long steel bars for delivery to Baldt Anchor Chain &amp; Forge Company at Chester, Pennsylvania; their own trucks were too short to haul them. An employee named Carr, in charge of shipping, directed James Gaynor, a laborer in the yard, to obtain a tractor trailer in which the shipment might be delivered. Gay-nor testified: “A. Well, I was out in the yard and Ed Carr came out to me and he said, Jim, he said, there is a load to go to Chester, ten ton. He said, See if you can get hold of a trailer to haul it. So me and him goes into the office, in the shipping office, and we picks up the phone, and we looked Booney’s number up in the book, and I calls up Booney, and Joe Booney answered the telephone. So I said to Joe, I said, Joe, I said, this is Jimmy Gaynor calling. I said, We got a load up here to go to Chester. I said, Can you handle it? And he said, Yes, I guess so. So I said, Well, what is the rate? He said, Oh, he said, twelve cents a hundred. So I turned to Ed Carr, and Ed Carr says, All right. Q. What did you say to Mr. Carr? A. I told Ed Carr twelve cents a hundred. So he said, Send the truck on up. So the truck, he sent the truck up, and I don’t remember when the truck got there, what time the truck got there.” He was also asked: “Q. Were you in control of this load at the time it was placed on Booney’s truck in the yard of the Philadelphia Steel Company? A. Was I in control of it? Q. Yes. A. Well, I placed the order with Booney— Q. Yes? A. — to haul this load. Q. Yes? ... Q. I asked you if you were in control of that load when it was placed on Booney’s truck in the yard. A.

He was employed in the Steel Company’s yard as a laborer; he testified: “I do anything in general.” His wages as laborer were at the rate of 90 cents an hour. Apart from his work as laborer, he conducted a trucking business <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> with two small trucks and drivers employed by him. He was authorized by the Public Utility Commission to haul the Steel Company’s products, as a Class D carrier, from Philadelphia to Bath in Northampton County. In addition, he had a Class B certificate allowing him to transport rubbish, building materials, etc., in dump trucks between points in the City of Philadelphia and within five miles of the City Hall. His employment by the Steel Company in his trucking business, was based, as he said, on “just a verbal contract. They gave me the things to haul and it was to be hauled out of there.” He testified that his certificate did not authorize him “to go to Chester.” He therefore knew that, without violating the Public Utility Law, he could not make an independent contract with the Steel Company to carry the shipment to Chester. Such an arrangement would not only sub<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>jeet Mm to the criminal provisions <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> of the Act, but conld not result in a contract: compare <em>Penna. R. R. v.

Presumably his employer, the Steel Company, knew that his license to carry its products, as a Class D carrier, was limited to transportation to Bath, and therefore the Steel Company did not intend to violate the Public Utility Law by attempting to contract with him to haul to Chester. In complying with the request of his superior, Carr, to order a trailer, Gaynor necessarily acted as the servant of the Steel Company; this must be so because his recognized lack of authority to transport to Chester made it impossible for him legally to become an independent contractor for such transportation and at the same time to make another independent contract with another carrier for the same transportation. He was not acting as a broker. If specified conduct, in one view, may be construed to be lawful, and in another, to be unlawful, the lawful construction shall be adopted: <em>Rau v.

The thing to be accomplished by the Steel Company was the delivery of the steel to its customer in Chester. If its servant was negligent and the negligence was the legal cause of plaintiff’s injury, the Steel Company is liable. Deliveries by the Steel Company were in the regular course of its business and, for that purpose, it maintained two trucks in constant use. <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>Gaynor occasionally drove one of them. It happened that its trucks were not long enough to hold this shipment, making it necessary to hire a truck of greater capacity.

We are, however, not prepared to say that there was abuse of discretion in allowing the amendment. But it did not put the averments out of the case for all purposes. Rooney’s original averments still remained as averments of fact made in the case; he was a party to the suit; the jury was not required to credit his oral testimony contradicting his original averments. The same thing is true of the averments in Wilson’s affidavit of defense, which were to the same effect as Rooney’s, and which were similarly amended. In <em>Kreiter v.

Eooney testified: “Q. Did he [Gaynor] ask that a driver be sent with the truck? A. Well, that is the only way I <em>let</em>

      <em> </em>the truck <em>out, </em>with a driver.” He had no authority from the Commission to be a contract carrier by motor vehicle, a fact for consideration in determining his relation to the transaction. A contract carrier by motor vehicle is defined in section 2 (7), Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1053, Article I, 66 PS section 1102 (7), as amended, as “. . . any person . . . who . . . provides or furnishes . . . with or without drivers, any motor vehicle for such transportation . . .”; see, also, Section 804 of the same Act, 66 PS section 1304, as amended; <em>Allaman v.

The Steel Company therefore could lawfully borrow a truck and with it lawfully haul their own property; the Steel Company had used Rooney’s truck once before in delivering to its Chester customer. Rooney was Wilson’s general employer but when he “. . . <em>let </em>the truck out, with a driver,” the lessee or bailee became the driver’s special employer for the transaction, the relation of master and servant being thereby established. The rule referred to earlier in this opinion preferring a lawful to an unlawful interpretation of conduct is also applicable to Rooney’s relation to the transaction.

The test is always whether, in the particular service for which the employe was borrowed, he continued liable to the direction and control of his general employer or became subject to that of the party to whom he was lent or hired, not merely with regard to the result of the work but as to the way in which it should be performed. The criterion is not whether the borrowing employer <em>in fact </em>exercised control, but whether he had the <em>right </em>to exercise it.” The thought, so expressed, may be supplemented by quotation from the opinion of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Dippel v. Juliano, </em><a href="/md/152/0694-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="152 Md. 694" data-case-ids="2282000" data-case-paths="/md/152/0694-01">152 Md. 694</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20514" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="137 A. 514">137 A. 514</a>, 516-517: “The only difficulty about the rule, and it is a real difficulty, is to determine what is meant by ‘control.’ Ordinarily it means the power to govern, dominate, direct, or supervise in some respect the conduct of another, but the difficulty arises in attempting to define the extent or degree of dominion necessary to constitute the ‘control’ which the borrower must have over a servant loaned to him before he becomes responsible for his acts, as the word is used in cases applying the rule. Evidently full dominion and control is not necessary, for that would imply the right to hire and discharge, and that is nowhere regarded as essential, while the mere right to point out and direct the servant as to the details of the work and the manner of doing it, leaving to the servant or his general employer the right to determine what work he shall do and what means he shall employ to do it, ordinarily is not enough. But where the work to be done is the borrower’s work, and a part of his business, and he has the power and authority to direct when and where and how it shall be done, and where the work is not within the scope of the general <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>employment of the servant, it may fairly be said that so far as that work is concerned he is under the control of the borrower and that the latter will be responsible for his negligent acts. <em>Standard Oil Co. v.
