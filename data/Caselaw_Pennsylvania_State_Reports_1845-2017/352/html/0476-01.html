Shortly thereafter he caused the account to be placed in the name of himself “or” his wife. The wife signed the signature card and the bank made the appropriate changes on its records and upon the deposit book. Ten years later the wife became insane and was committed to a state hospital where she is still confined. Within four months after the wife’s commitment the husband caused his wife’s name to be expunged from the savings account by the simple expedient of inducing the trust company to cancel and strike out her name from its records and the savings deposit book. The day following the alteration of the account the husband executed a. will wherein his estate was given to the trust company, in trust, for the benefit of his wife for life and whatever remained of income and principal at her decease was bequeathed in thirds, one to a named niece of the wife, one to another named niece of the wife, and the remaining third to testator’s nephew (appellant). The will provided that if either niece died in the widow’s lifetime her share was to pass to the other niece, and if both nieces died then to the nephew; and if the nephew predeceased the widow, his share was to pass to the two named nieces of the <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>wife or to the survivor of them.

There is not the slightest evidence of the knowledge or consent of the wife concerning the husband’s 'act; she was insane at that time and was therefore without capacity to consent, either expressly or impliedly.

    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[190,611,1152,1139]]]'>According to a stipulation in the record, when the wife’s name was stricken from the account on October 1, 1942, there was a balance of $21,784.31. From that date until the husband’s death May 13,1943, he made deposits and withdrawals from the account. At the death a balance of $21,234.31 remained in the account, which was therefore $550, less than at the date of the striking out of the wife’s name therefrom. It is conceded that such withdrawals were for the use of both, and particularly for the expenses connected with the wife’s hospitalization. Chief Justice Kephart, in <em>Madden v. Gosztonyi S. &amp; T. Co., </em>supra, said (page 489) : “The authorities . . . would seem to show that either spouse presumptively has the power to act for both, so long as the marriage subsists, in matters of entireties, without any specific authorization, provided the fruits or proceeds of such action inures to the benefit of both and the estate is not terminated. But neither may by such action destroy the true purpose of the estate by attempting to convert it or a part of it, in bad faith, into one in severalty.</p>

    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[247,1209,1153,797]]]'>As the trust company is before us in a fiduciary capacity we must note that its required acts as guardian and also as executor involve conflicting interests that should not be assumed by the same fiduciary. The conduct of the trust company in striking the wife’s name from the account was unjustifiable; it was its duty as guardian to correct that wrong; the wrong was done at the request of the husband, whose conduct the trust company as executor was called on to defend. We must condemn the assumption of such inconsistent positions. As the facts are undisputed and the question one of law, and because the audit discloses that while the husband’s estate is insolvent, due to administration expenses not having been met in full, there are no unpaid creditors, and therefore no harm has resulted.</p>
