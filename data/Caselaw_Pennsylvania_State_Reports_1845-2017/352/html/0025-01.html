The president of the Bridge Works, and Mr. Wick, had a common office, and their secretary was Miss Marion Horne. Mrs. Wick first learned of Miss Horne from him and in course of time found occasion frequently to complain of his constant association with Miss Horne. In the course of these discussions, Mr. Wick informed his wife that he no longer loved her, that he had “fallen deeply in love with” another and “would like to have” his freedom. Mrs. Wick was not well, having had several heart attacks, one of which in 1940 kept her under the doctor’s care “most of the winter.” At the same time and continuously afterward Mr. Wick continued his association with Miss Horne when she was not on duty in the office of the President of the Bridge Works. Mrs. Wick failed in her efforts to dissuade Mr. Wick from the execution of his threats to leave her and obtain a divorce as a result of which (as he threatened) she would have nothing.

No, I never was at a dance but I have been to social gatherings with them. Q. And have you had an opportunity to observe Mrs. Wick’s attitude toward him on those occasions? A. Yes. Q. And on those occasions or any time you were at the home did you see any evidence of jealousy on her part, in regard to Mr. Wick? A. I never did.”</p>

Miss Kathryn Wick, testifying with respect to times when she was not absent at college, was asked: “Q. Did you ever hear them quarreling continuously, as your father said? A. I have never heard of those regular battles that <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>he described, or any hysteria. There have been discussions and possible disagreements or arguments, something like that, but never any of this loud talking and hysteria that he has described. Q. Did you hear that in 1936? A. No. Q. Or 1937? A. No. Q. Or anytime during the Christmas or spring vacations thereafter? A. I have never heard any of this violent fighting that he has described, and I have heard him say very lovely things to mother. Q. And you had never known of any difficulty between your mother and father during that period of time? A. The first time that I had any inkling of that trouble was when I was in New York. Q. When was that? A. It was just the very end of June. Q. What year? A. 1942. Mother wrote to me— Q. Who? A. Mother wrote to me that Daddy had left home. Q. Was that June or July? A. Well, I am not just exactly sure whether the very end of June or the very first of July. It was either the 29th or 30th of June or the 1st or 2nd of July. I believe it was about the 30th of June I received the letter.”</p>

She heard nothing of any quarreling by them until just before Mr. Wick left. She testified: “Q. What happened when you did hear something in the nature of quarreling coming from the Wick house? A. One night I heard somebody crying over there and crying out 'Daddy, don’t leave us, please don’t leave us; don’t do it; don’t do it.’ That is all. Q. Who was talking? A. Well, the first night we really weren’t sure — we thought it was young Ruth, and George was punishing her or something; that is a neighborhood reaction. Then, another night — a few nights later, the same thing happened, then we knew it was Margaret begging George not to leave.”</p>

Mrs. Wick’s conduct and remonstrances, particularly with respect to Miss Horne, may not always have been in good taste but under the evidence may be considered results rather than causes of her husband’s conduct. We consider it unnecessary to discuss the evidence of suggested gas asphyxiation, the use of a revolver, and the threats of reckless driving; the evidence on those subjects was primarily for consideration in Mr. Wick’s suit against his wife; as his libel was dismissed, these subjects have only secondary importance in our review of Mrs. Wick’s appeal. That evidence may indicate an overstrained nervous condition resulting from defendant’s conduct, though for present purposes, it is unnecessary to make definite findings from that evidence.</p>
