It is a railroad crossing case in which the alleged absence of due warning by the train before it reached the crossing is the basis of the complaint of negligence. The accident occurred at 6 A.M., October 27, 1942, before daylight. The minor plaintiff was a passenger in an automobile driven by John B. Kramer (the plaintiff in a companion case). Norman Kemmerer was also a passenger. He was killed in, the accident. The road which these men took on the fatal morning was unfamiliar to all of them. It had but recently been reopened to traffic, after improvements had been made upon it. As the court below states in its opinion: “Neither Kramer nor Kindt knew of the existence of the railroad crossing at this point and much of the testimony was concerned with the question whether or not the rails were visible from any distance and whether the cross arm warning post was obscured by foliage and whether the words of warning were legible <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>or illegible.” The parties were travelling with the windows closed. After the car was struck by a train travelling about 15 .miles an hour, both Kindt and Kramer were unconscious. Before the accident both these men were looking straight ahead. Kramer testified that he heard no bell and “there was no whistle blowing.” Kindt testified that “there was no train whistle sounded” and “no bell of a locomotive rung” and that they were “riding in silence.”</p>

Several of the crew on the cab of the engine testified that the bell of the engine was also ringing at least up to the crossing. There were no witnesses as to the light and signals other than defendant’s employees.</p>

P. &amp; R. Ry. Co., </em><a href="/pa/202/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="202 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="992346" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0504-01">202 Pa. 504</a>, in which a passenger in the railway train involved in the collision testified: “There was no bell rung before approaching the crossing.” “I did not hear any whistle until the one .■ . . when the crash occurred.” The witness was contradicted by the train crew. This court in holding that the evidence of lack of warning was insufficient said: “How many in a train do hear the whistle or can <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>but certainly say that none was sounded?” It was suggested in the case cited that such evidence from a witness so circumstanced at the time of the non-bearing of signals as the time in question was “but a scintilla and not sufficient to justify a charge of negligence.” In the instant case the court below said: “The distinguishing test is the opportunity and attentiveness of the witness to have observed the fact, if it existed. So, regardless of the form of the question or answer, testimony of the failure to sound or give warning is positive if the witness would have heard or seen a warning, had it been given, negative if he may or may not have heard or seen the warning. <em>Keiser v.

Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/349/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="349 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="458621" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0430-01">349 Pa. 430</a>, which appellee cites, does not support the position taken by the court below in this case, because the facts are substantially different in the <em>Williams </em>case. In that case we held that a man on a motorcycle approaching an intersection must be “consciously listening for warnings from traffic approaching from the intersecting street” and that if he is not so “consciously listening,” his testimony that “no bell [on a fire truck] was rung or <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>siren sounded” was under these circumstances “negative in character and insufficient to make out a charge of negligence.” When this court held that a person on a vehicle <em>approaching a crossing </em>must be “consciously listening” for warning signals, it did not mean to imply that persons riding in vehicles must <em>always </em>be “consciously listening” for warning signals. It meant that they must listen for such signals whenever it is reasonable to believe that other moving objects may possibly be approaching them. If the driver of a car knows or has reason to believe that he is approaching a railroad crossing or a through thoroughfare he must, of course, “stop, look and listen.” If he reasonably believes he is on a quiet country road far away from all traffic, he does not have to “consciously listen” for warning signals. In the instant case the evidence satisfied both the court and the jury that these plaintiffs did not know or have adequate reason to know that they were about to cross a railroad. The degree of attentiveness to which the law holds them must be determined by that fact. If they were not chargeable with the knowledge of the presence of a railroad crossing, the duty to “stop, look and listen” at that point was not cast upon them. This court said in <em>Galliano v. East Penn Electric Co., </em><a href="/pa/303/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="303 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="1130057" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0498-01">303 Pa. 498</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20805" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="154 A. 805">154 A. 805</a>, “it is the duty of the driver of a street car or a motor vehicle at all times to have his car under control, and having one’s car under control means having it under such control that it can be stopped before doing injury to any person in any situation that is reasonably likely to arise under the circumstances.” A corollary of that rule is that it is the duty of a driver of any vehicle to be so alert (i. e., consciously listening or seeing) that he will perceive any warning of danger that is likely to be manifested under the circumstances. Of course, the fact that these plaintiffs did not know that they were near a railroad crossing tends to support the argument that they were not attentive to signals, but it does not conclusively establish the fact that their testimony as to the absence of signals was negative.</p>

A person habituated to intense mental concentrations is not as likely to hear noisés as is one whose mind is more objective in character. It is perhaps correct to say that extroverts are more perceptive of sights and sounds than are introverts. The mind of the one is directed outward; the mind of the other is directed inward. Very frequently an introvert does not <em>see </em>an object he <em>looks at. </em>Two persons equal in vision may be sitting side by side and looking in the same direction and one of them will see objects to which the other is completely blind. The same phenomena often obtains with two persons of equal auditory powers; one will hear because his entire interest is in externals; the other will not hear because of his propensity for reflection.</p>

In the charge appears this statement: “The courts have stated that testimony as to the absence of such things is called negative testimony; unless a person is on the alert, is listening for a sound or looking for a light, it is negative testimony to say that there was no sound and that there was no light, .'and that that amounts to saying simply that they heard no sound or that they saw no light.” To say that unless a person “is listening for a sound or look<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>ing for a light” his testimony as to the absence of a sound or a light “is negative testimony” and so entitled to but little weight is to ignore reality. It is reasonable to believe that if a person is of normal alertness he will hear the whistle of a nearby locomotive unless he is absorbed in thought or conversation. When a witness testifies, as did Kindt and Kramer, that there was “no whistle blown” and “no train whistle sounded,” they should be examined and cross-examined as to their alertness and attentiveness at the time. When Kramer’s counsel asked him after he had testified “there was no whistle blown”, “Would you have heard one if there would have been one blown?” the court sustained an objection to the question, saying: “He has already said there was no whistle blown.” This statement naturally halted the attorney in his development of facts as to the witness’ alertness or attentiveness, which facts might have added to the probative value of the statement.</p>

The probative value of a truthful witness’ statement as to what he saw or heard depends on its factual background and on his sensory powers and the accuracy of his memory. Judging the credibility of a witness and the weight of his testimony is preeminently a jury’s function. Of course, when the testimony offered does not <em>even if credited </em>meet the burden resting upon a plaintiff, it is the trial judge’s duty so to declare. If in the instant case the jury accepted at its face value the testimony that no whistle was blown or bell rung, plaintiffs’ burden on that phase of the case was met.</p>

For example, a statement by a very deaf man or by a. man completely absorbed in thought at the time, • that no whistle was blown would simply mean that he did not hear a whistle blown. When witnesses testify that no whistle was blown or bell rung, all the- circumstances which surrounded the witnesses at the time and something as to the perceptive faculties of the witnesses, should be brought out either on direct or on cross-examination, and the jury should decide whether or not their testimony is of a positive and convincing character. “The tone and manner of a witness not infrequently indicate whether or not he is telling the truth”: <em>Belmont Laboratories, Inc. v.

Another witness testified he saw Surratt in Washington that morning. At John Surratt’s trial in 1867, it was conclusively proved that he was in Elmira, New York, for at least 24 hours just preceding Lincoln’s assassination.</p>

Professor John L. Haney in his monograph on that address said: “The testimony of those who were present is to the effect that it was received: (1) with indifference on the part of the tired and inattentive spectators; (2) in silence, with no applause during or after the delivery; (3) with applause in the middle and at the end; (4) with tears, sobs, and cheers; (5) with wild and lengthened excitement; (6) with remarkable enthusiasm; (7) with loud outbursts of applause; (8) with roars of applause; (9) with hurricanes of applause.’’ There was a similar divergence in the reports- as to. Lincoln’s use or non-use of a manuscript on that occasion, and. as to the quality of his voice. Some reported his voice as being “thin and high”; others, as “deep and powerful.” Some said he “could be heard by all”; others that “he could not be heard, he spoke so low.” ■</p>

Maryland Casualty Co., </em>5th C.C.A., 63 Fed. 2d 10: “District Judges are pronouncing no mere rigmarole when, in law cases, they charge jurors that they are the sole and exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight to be given to their testimony. They are setting forth the very substance of a jury trial as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution. Its purpose and aim is not to preserve mere matters of form and procedure, but' substance of right. This requires that questions of fact in common-law actions shall be settled by a jury, and that the'court shall not assume, directly or indirectly, to take from the jury or to .itself such prerogative.”</p>
