Marie Moody, one of the defendants, is the record owner of the property. The other defendants are her husband, Duard Moody, and her brother, Charles Coe. Coe, a resident- of Allegheny County, was served personally with the bill of complaint. The Moodys are residents of West Virginia and were served at their residence in that State pursuant to an order of the court below, on petition of the plaintiff, under the provisions of the Act of April 6, 1859, P. L. 387, as amended (12 P.S. § 1254).</p>

Their petition contains, inter alia, an averment that Coe is not a proper or necessary party to the suit. If that be so, and the Moodys are dismissed as not having been property served, the suit would automatically fall for want of any proper parties defendant. It is the contention of the Moodys that the relief sought by the plaintiff would necessarily be <em>in personam </em>as to them and that the court lacks the power to summon persons from beyond its territorial jurisdiction and make them answerable for relief of such nature. The learned court behnv discharged the rule which had been granted on the Moodys’ petition to vacate and dismiss. It is from that order that they bring the present appeal.</p>

For present purposes, therefore, it need only be noted that the bill of complaint pleads a case for equity’s jurisdiction. In substance, the bill avers that Coe purchased the property in question under circumstances which constituted a fraud on the rights of the plaintiff who was and, for a number of years, had been an occupant of the property as a place of business; that, as allegedly known to Coe at the time of his purchase, the plaintiff Avas then carrying on negotiations for the purchase of the property; that Coe stood in a relation of trust and confidence to the plaintiff by whom he Avas employed; and that, in aid of the fraud alleged, Coe had taken title to the property in the name of his sister, Marie Moody, who forthwith notified the plaintiff to vacate. The relief prayed for is that Marie Moody and her husband be declared trustees of the property for the benefit of the plaintiff; that they be directed to convey it to the plaintiff and restrained from conveying it to anyone else; and that they and the defendant, Coe, be enjoined from evicting the plaintiff from the premises.</p>

That Act provides in part here material that “ ... it shall be lawful for any court of this commonwealth having equity jurisdiction, upon the special motion of the plaintiff <em>, in any court in equity . . . concerning . . . lands . . . , situate or being within the jurisdiction of such court </em>... , to order and direct that any . . . process ... in such suit, be served upon any defendant or defendants therein, then residing or being out of the jurisdiction of such court, wherever he, she or they may reside or be found; and [thereafter] ... to proceed as fully and effectually as if the same had been made within the jurisdiction of such court: . . .”.

The rule of law upon which the appellants rely will readily be conceded (see <em>Atlantic Seaboard Natural Gas Company v.

This rule, which is supported by the weight of considered authority, has been well stated as follows: “A state can exercise through its courts jurisdiction over land situated within the territory of the state, although a person owning or claiming an interest in the land is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the state:” Eestatement, Conflict of Laws, § 101.</p>

A requirement that they execute a deed to the plaintiff for the property would be but incidental to the real relief sought and designed merely to conform the record title accordingly, Mrs. Moody being presently the record owner. By refusing to comply with the court’s direction <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>that they execute a deed to the plaintiff, the Moodys could not render the substance of the decree ineffectual. In fact, it would be wholly immaterial whether or not they obeyed the court’s direction to them in such regard. The court would not be without power to act in effectuation of its decree even though the Moodys should do nothing : Act of April 19,1901, P. L. 83, Sec. 1 (21 P.S. § 53).</p>
    <p id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[186,671,1151,917]]]'>The Act of 1901, supra, relevantly provides that “in any proceeding at law or <em>in equity, </em>in any of the courts of this Commonwealth having jurisdiction, if the said court shall order a conveyance to be executed by either of the parties to the said proceeding of his or her interest in any lands or tenements to any other party or person, and the party so ordered shall neglect or refuse to comply with the said order and make the said conveyance, . . . <em>it shall he lawful for the said court to order that such conveyance he made </em>by the sheriff, prothonotary or clerk, or by a trustee specially appointed for that purpose ; <em>and the said conveyance </em>having been duly executed . . . , <em>shall he good and effective </em>to convey the interest of the recusant, neglecting, . . . party to the extent ordered by the court, <em>the same as if it had heen duly executed and delivered </em>by such party personally:” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

A Pennsylvania court of equity, having jurisdiction of the subject-matter, can act <em>in rem </em>with respect to lands lying within its territorial jurisdiction. The Act of 1859 operates to make the court’s decrees <em>in rem </em>effective as to nonresident defendants who have been served in accordance with the provisions of that Act, while the Act of 1901 makes available the efficient means for effectuating the court’s orders or decrees in such regard without the defendant’s personal compliance.</p>
