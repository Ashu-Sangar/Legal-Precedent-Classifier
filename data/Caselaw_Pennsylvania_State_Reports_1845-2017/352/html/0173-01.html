Following the marriage they lived at Avalon, Pennsylvania. McKrell, then a store manager for the Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, later attended and was graduated from a chiropractic college and a school of naturopathy. He was subsequently licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a naturopath and opened an office in his residence. Three children, all of whom are living, were born of the marriage. No differences of a serious nature were experienced, and the parties to this litigation, with their <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>three children, lived a normal happy life for seventeen years prior to June, 1941. Appellee prospered and family relations were harmonious. It was at this time that he secured the services of one Mrs. Eva McAnulty to assist him at the office. She was young and attractive, and. studied at the Universal College of Chiropractics at Oakland. She acted as secretary and stenographer, aided in the adjustment of patients, and made laboratory tests. Immediately after she became his assistant appellee began to remain at his office until twelve and tivelve-thirty in the morning. Rarely, if ever, was he at home with his family, putatively because both he and the assistant worked continuously, not only in the practice but also in the study of their profession. Appellant Avife protested this course of conduct. After having been informed that they had been seen together in public late in the evening, and having seen them upon one occasion in front of a theatre, she began to doubt the truth of his explanation. McKrell never manifested any intention of discontinuing the apparent close association with Mrs. McAnulty. As a result of the tension thus created appellant became troubled and suspicious of his infidelity. She sought the aid of his sister in restoring their previous happy family life. On January 17, 1942, Dr. McKrell, without any explanation to appellant and Avithout having provided for the maintenance and support of Mrs. McKrell and the children, left the family home and has never returned. Later he sent her $25 a Aveek for the maintenance of herself and the three children. He has never attempted, directly or indirectly, to effect a reconciliation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> One year later, in January, 1943, he filed this libel in divorce.</p>

Mutual professional interests and an increased clientele required that they work together practically every night, and that they attend professional meetings. They returned home together and npon several occasions secured the use of a taxicab rather than walk. Their association was purely for business purposes and his habit of walking home with her every evening was a matter of courtesy, since she lived only a block and a half from the McKrell home. Appellant refused to believe his explanations and on one occasion accused him of being a “whoremaster” and a “dirty lowdown son of a bitch.” Once she telephoned the assistant and called her a “hussy” and a “little whore”, and upon another occasion came to the doctor’s office and left a note in her typewriter, warning her to stay away from Dr. Mc-Krell.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This suspicion and distrust continued to increase. On June 22, 1942, upon returning home late at night from a fraternity initiation appellee found the bedroom door locked and he was denied admittance to the room. Subsequent thereto accusations became more frequent. Appellant attempted to prejudice the children against their father, and in their presence accused him of indecency and improper conduct with Mrs. Mc-Anulty. As a result of this conduct, appellee contends that his professional standing and health have been affected.</p>

She was a good housekeeper <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>and mother, and prior to 1941 was happy and contented.

Prior to June, 1941, she regularly met appellee in the city on Thursday evenings and they had dinner and enjoyed a movie or a show. After that date this routine ceased. She, however, continued to spend Thursday evenings in town. Upon one occasion she saw appellee and his assistant in front of the Penn Theatre. Several witnesses testified they had seen the appellee and Mrs. McAnulty going into the theatre together. They had been seen together at other places. One, Hazel Wilkie, positively identified them as the couple she had seen “with their arms around each other’s waists” on Euclid Avenue near Mrs. McAnulty’s home.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Mrs. McKrell admitted calling the assistant on the telephone and telling her to stay away from her husband and that she wrote the note above referred to. The incident of the locked bedroom door was admitted. Appellant explained, however, that she was in great need of rest and, to prevent being disturbed by appellee’s habitual arrival at a very late hour, locked the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>door. Although the door was locked only upon that one occasion appellee thereafter never expressed any desire to be in the room. Admitting that she had believed rumors regarding the impropriety of appellee’s conduct and his infidelity, she testified at the trial that she did not then believe these rumors were true. She also desired a reconciliation for, despite the circumstances, she still regarded her husband with affection.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> After having seen and heard the parties and their witnesses, the hearing judge entered a decree dismissing the libel.</p>

Despite the protestations of Mrs. McKrell, appellee continued to champion the innocence of Mrs. McAnulty. Rather than ease the distressed mind of his wife, he chose to flaunt his attentions to his assistant before her. He assumed an attitude that the matrimonial difficulties stemmed from an unreasonably jealous and irrational wife and not from any act or course of conduct on his part.

Explain what interferences, if any, the respondent, Frances Arline McKrell has caused to be made to the running of your business? A. As to professional courtesy due a professional man, it has been handled rather improperly, I would say, inasmuch as when my patients would become familiar with Mrs. McKrell, they <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>invariably lost the normal professional courtesy due the office and, instead of becoming a doctor in their eyes, I became known by my first name. In other words there was nothing done whatever to add to but rather detract from the office. In addition to that was the interference with the female assistant. I have never had any assistant who met with her approval until after they were gone but during the time the assistant was in the office, why, they were subject to her will to a certain extent.”</p>

Time is no criterion; as I said, we don’t watch the clock. Q. There were occasions when you and your assistant stayed in the office until twelve and sometimes later? A. There were many occasions. In fact, it was very irregular that we were through at nine o’clock. That was most unusual. Q. Would there be patients there until twelve or one o’clock? No. Not always.

So really the only difference between you and your wife was in 1942. That is when this thing came to a head? A. That is when the climax came. However, instead of making it a century of progress, long before this, naturally it was confined to as small a time as possible. If you would like further testimony, I will go back 17 years, if you wish. Q. Just answer the question. All the incidents you testified to on direct examination were in 1942? A. All that has been presented here of these particular incidents, that is right.” The appellant, Mrs. McKrell, testified as follows (p. 111-a) : “Q. Mrs. Mc-Krell, approximately how long or approximately when did the first <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>difference arise between you and your husband?
