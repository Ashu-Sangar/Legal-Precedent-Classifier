    <p id="b155-10" data-blocks='[["BL_155.16",155,[168,1641,1153,592]]]'>Appellee is a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, having its principal office and place of business in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. In the tax year 1938, appellee owned 50% of the shares of the Indiana County Theatres Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, which in the same year paid a capital stock tax to the Commonwealth. In the settlement of appellee’s franchise tax the Commonwealth refused to permit the value of the shares of the Theatres Company to be deducted from the capital stock value of appellee for the purpose of measuring the franchise tax.</p>

The court relied upon the familiar principle that the presumption of law is against double taxation and that no statute should be construed to effect double taxation unless it clearly so provides. The Commonwealth has taken this appeal.</p>

We need not repeat what was there said concerning the fundamental difference between a franchise tax and a property tax. Appellee’s contention in the present case and the decision of the court below are both rested on the false assumption that the franchise tax, in some way, is a tax upon the <em>property </em>of the corporation which is used as a measure for the tax. Despite the decision of this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/336/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="336 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1195631" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0209-01">336 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="8 A.2d 404">8 A. 2d 404</a>, which clearly enunciated the principle of the franchise tax, the court below and appellant have placed their reliance upon the language of this Court in <em>Arrott’s Estate, </em>supra, in which we held that, <em>within the meaning of the personal property tax exemptions, </em>there was a certain equivalence between the capital stock tax on domestic corporations and the franchise tax upon foreign corporations. As we have had frequent occasion to state, the <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>decision in the <em>Arrott </em>case turned entirely upon the construction of the Four Mill County Tax Act and the One Mill State Tax Act, and we found that it was within the <em>spirit </em>and <em>purpose </em>of the exemption provisions in those acts to treat the capital stock of foreign corporations and the capital stock of domestic corporations in the same category. That decision has no other possible implication or extension. In <em>Commonwealth v. Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation, </em>supra, Mr. Chief Justice Kephaet stated at page 218: “The basic problem in that case <em>[Arrott’s Estate] </em>was not the <em>nature </em>of the tax imposed on foreign corporations by the 1935 Act, but rather the problem of the exemption from personal property tax of the shares of stock in such foreign corporations.” The same observation was made in <em>Girard Trust Company, Trustee’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/333/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="333 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1187902" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0129-01">333 Pa. 129</a>, 136, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20252" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 A.2d 252">3 A. 2d 252</a>. It seems abundantly apparent from those decisions and from the subsequent decisions of this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. The Mundy Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/346/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="346 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1216502" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0482-01">346 Pa. 482</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20A.2d%20878" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="30 A.2d 878">30 A. 2d 878</a>; <em>Commonwealth v. Ford Motor Company </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Quaker Oats Company, </em>both supra, that the effect in the <em>Arrott </em>case must be limited to its holding.</p>

      <em>Arrott’s Estate </em>was thoroughly discussed in <em>Commonwealth v.

Ford Motor Company, </em>supra, the franchise tax is not a tax upon the property of the corporation, but upon the doing of business in this Commonwealth. There is, therefore, no resulting double taxation simply because the shares of a domestic corporation which has paid the capital stock tax, a property tax, are included in the computation of the value of the Pennsylvania franchise of a foreign corporation. Double taxation cannot exist where the subject matter of taxation in two acts is not the same. <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>See <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee points out that if it were a domestic corporation subject to the capital stock tax, its tax burden would be much lower by reason of the exemption of such domestic shares. This argument, of course, has no validity. It is not necessary that the tax imposed upon foreign and domestic corporations be identical to avoid unconstitutional discrimination. A state may differentiate in its <em>method </em>of taxing foreign and domestic corporations and may use different incidence and base. What individual differences may result from the selection of different methods of taxation are not in themselves proof of discrimination. “Such differences as result, result not from an intention of the legislature to discriminate against foreign corporations, but from the divergent natures of the taxes imposed on the two classes”: <em>Commonwealth v. Ford Motor Company, </em>supra, at pages 250-251. See also <em>Commonwealth v. Quaker Oats Company, </em>supra.</p>
