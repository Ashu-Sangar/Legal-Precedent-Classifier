The railroad company moved for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. Davis, the other defendant, took no action with respect to the verdict, whereupon plaintiff caused judgment to be entered against Davis in the sum of $20,000. The railroad company’s motions were heard and disposed of by an order granting a new trial “. . . unless the plaintiff shall, within 15 days of this order, remit $10,000. of the verdict. Upon filing a remittitur of that amount and payment of the filing fee the motion for a new trial is overruled and judgment is directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiff, John Brindle Anstine, upon the verdict as remitted . . .” In <em>Ralston v.

The railroad company, after paying the judgment entered on the verdict, as reduced, became entitled to contribution from Davis, the joint tortfeasor. The court was informed at the argument that Davis’ insurer is ready and willing, on behalf of its insured, to contribute one-half of the amount expended by the railroad company in discharging the liability but is precluded from doing so by the litigation instituted by the plaintiff against it and Davis. Apparently, to protect itself, the railroad company then instituted this proceeding to secure contribution by subrogation to plaintiff’s right on the judgment. While the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 1075, 12 PS section 2081, provides for contribution among joint tortfeasors, it originated in equity and may be enforced by the application of equitable principles. Instead of bringing an action at law against Davis, the railroad company adopted the equitable procedure of a petition in the cause in which the judgments were entered, setting forth the proceedings and praying for appropriate relief. On that <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>petition, the court granted a rule on Anstine, the plaintiff, on Davis, the defendant, and on his insurer, requiring them to show cause why the court should not direct Anstine’s judgment against Davis to be reduced to $10,-000 and to have it marked to the use of the railroad company. The plaintiff filed an answer contending for the discharge of the rule for four reasons to the effect that the judgment against Davis “cannot be amended after term time to the benefit of” the railroad company, which “has an adequate remedy at law against” Davis and his insurer. After hearing argument, the court ordered that the judgment against Davis “. . . in the sum of $20,000, be marked for the use of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the right of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in said judgments to be restricted to the collection of one-half of the amounts <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> paid by it in satisfaction of the judgments entered against it in favor of the same plaintiffs to the same term and number, together with whatever interest might be due thereon.” We must affirm that order.</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[264,1373,1150,696]],["BL_585.1",585,[167,279,1152,593]]]'>The argument of the plaintiff-appellant proceeds on the ground, as we understand it, that after the term at which judgment for $20,000 in favor of the plaintiff and against Davis was entered, it became final and that the court was without power subsequently to deal with it; that plaintiff was authorized to enforce it against the defendant or, to the extent of the insurance, against his insurer, merely allowing credit for the $10,000 paid by the railroad company. This is an entire misapprehension of the nature of the proceeding presented by the record. The proceeding, as we have said, is governed by equitable principles. Plaintiff’s suit was to recover for a joint tort. The tort was of a class in which con<a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>tribution is allowed: <em>Goldman v. Mitchell-Fletcher Co., </em><a href="/pa/292/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="292 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1109673" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0354-01">292 Pa. 354</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.%20231" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="141 A. 231">141 A. 231</a>. The liability to contribution was an element in plaintiff’s suit from the beginning to the end. When confronted with the alternative of choosing a retrial of the action against the railroad company, or of remitting $10,000 of the verdict, the choice was made in the light of the familiar rule that settlement or satisfaction by one of several joint tortfeasors was a discharge of all. Plaintiff was not required to accept the suggested reduction but he did accept and remains bound by his deliberate act.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[169,883,1153,1353]]]'>It is of no consequence that the parties did not, in express words, include the disposition of plaintiff’s judgment against Davis; that was implied. The settlement had the same legal effect as if that agreement had been written out at length. The subject was not put beyond the control of the court by the expiration of the term or by the failure of the parties to express it in the settlement; this result follows because the plaintiff could not enforce his judgment except by writ of execution, which was subject to the control of the court: cf. <em>Cake v.

The court below might have gone further and directed that the judgment against Davis be satisfied by payment to the railroad company of one-half the amount paid by it to the plaintiff.</p>
