        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Drew,\nThe question here is whether the estate of a minor can be made liable for the funeral expenses of an indigent father.\nOn April 8, 1943, Charles O\u2019Leary died intestate without real or personal property. His minor daughter, Doris O\u2019Leary, then nineteen years of age, visited the undertaker and made all arrangements for her father\u2019s funeral, and agreed to pay $205.00 therefor. Her action was approved by her guardian, Provident Trust Company of Philadelphia, and both now wish the undertaker paid out of her estate. It is admitted the bill is very modest, that the minor is the only member of the family able to pay; that her estate consists of $2653.00 received in settlement of an accident claim, and that payment of this bill can be made without affecting her future welfare.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County, following precedents in prior adjudications in that court, disallowed the claim; the Superior Court reversed and entered judgment for claimant, and this appeal followed by a guardian ad litem, appointed by the court.\nThe learned Superior Court, after recognizing that \u201cThe common law placed no liability . . . upon a child, whether infant or adult, for the expenses of interment of a deceased parent\u201d, and that there is no statute, or decided case in our appellant courts that does so, felt constrained to hold that \u201cThe law\u2019s solicitude for the welfare of a minor is carried to an extreme . . . the minor should not be prevented from responding to the call of common decency . . . when his estate and his economic future are not thereby jeopardized.\u201d And concluded that on the facts of this case the orphans\u2019 court may order the payment \u201cof a moderate amount to the undertaker\u201d out of the estate of the minor. In such situation it was held reasonable to grant the claim. But in Sibilia\u2019s Estate, 82 Pa. Superior Ct. 67, where an attempt was made to charge the estate of a minor with hospital bills for services rendered the child\u2019s father in his last illness, and the same argument based on consideration of sentiment and humanity was made, an allowance of the claim by the orphans\u2019 court was reversed and the Superior Court said: \u201cNo authority has been brought to our attention which supports the doctrine that a minor child is liable for the debts of her deceased father\u201d. In that case it was stated that there was no adjudicated case to support the action.\nIn Yoder\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 81, 19 A. 2d 139, an appeal just as strong to fine emotions had to be denied by this Court because of the absence of appropriate legislation to support it. There the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in enforcing its statutory rights, as well as those at common law, against the estate of a living incompetent for support in a State institution, appealed from the action of the court below in exempting from the fund a sum for anticipated burial expenses. This court in reversing the court said (p. 84) : \u201cAlthough the suggestion that there should be reserved from the estate of an unfortunate sufficient to bury him and to avoid giving him a pauper\u2019s burial makes a strong appeal to human sympathy, there is no warrant in the law for such an exemption ... In this respect no discretion was lodged in the court and the Commonwealth\u2019s claim must be paid if there are funds available.\u201d\nAll lawyers know that the protection of infants is one of the chief concerns of the law. The rule is that no one may deal with a minor, except for necessaries. Lord Coke said that an infant may bind himself for his meat, drink, apparel, necessary physic and other such necessaries, and likewise for his good teaching or instruction, whereby he may profit himself afterward: 27 Am. Jur. 759. This, generally speaking, has been accepted as the true doctrine. An infant is not competent to contract. This positive inhibition is the way of the law to protect infants against their own lack of discretion and against the snares of designing persons.\nFuneral expenses are a debt of the estate of decedent and are to be paid first in settlement of the estate (see Fiduciaries Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 447, \u00a713(a).\nThis claimant can only be a creditor of the estate of the minor if there is an obligation as a matter of law upon the minor to pay the funeral expenses of her indigent parent. There is no statute or adjudicated case in our appellate courts, supporting such a claim. If such support were here given it would be pure judicial legislation. If the situation requires a remedy, it calls for action by the legislature and not by the courts.\nThe estate of a minor is not liable for the funeral expenses of an indigent father. However, this minor, Doris O\u2019Leary, is now almost twenty-one years of age and since she wishes to pay the bill, she can do so by ratification of her promise upon coming of age.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is reversed; the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County is reinstated and affirmed.",
