        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Patterson,\nThis is an appeal by Marcellus R. Lare, Jr., husband of Gertrude K. Lare, deceased, and administrator cum testamento annexo of her estate, from the action of the court below sustaining an appeal from the probate of an instrument as her last will and testament, holding that the instrument was a forgery, and refusing appellant\u2019s request for the granting of an issue devisavit vel non.\nGertrude K. Lare died June 25,1942, at her home in Mount Lebanon, survived by her husband, Marcellus R. Lare, Jr., appellant, two brothers, Carl E. Maratta and Paul E. Maratta, and a sister, Katherine Sayre, Although married twice decedent was childless. In 1932 she was married to George W. Kilpatrick who died July 13,1935, and in November, 1938, she married appellant. On June 29, 1942, appellant qualified as administrator of her estate. Three days later, while for decedent\u2019s automobile registration card, he found a writing on the face of a blank check, over decedent\u2019s signature, which is purported to be her last will and testament, said writing being as follows:\nDV 11~ ~4 I On July 31, 1942, appellant offered said writing for probate and letters of administration cum testamento annexo were granted. Appeal from said probate was taken by decedent\u2019s two brothers sister to the or-phans\u2019 court, averring that the alleged will was a forgery and praying that the of administration cum testa-mento annexo be revoked and set aside. An answer was filed averring that the instrument was the will of the decedent. After a hearing appellant petitioned the court to award an issue devisavit vel non for trial of the charge of forgery. The hearing judge held the instrument a forgery and refused to award an issue, stating that \u201cno jury verdict sustaining the will could be permitted to stand.\u201d This appeal is from the dismissal of exceptions to the\nContestants\u2019 evidence established that as a young girl Gertrude K. Lare had become proficient in shorthand and typing. She was employed as stenographer and typist for a number of years and as private secretary to the General Sales Manager of the Crescent Portland Cement Company until 1929. From that date she was never gainfully employed and rarely, if ever, used a typewriter for any purpose although she owned an Underwood portable machine, the one admittedly used in the preparation of the alleged will. All her correspondence was carried on in longhand.\nWhile the wife of George Kilpatrick she contributed generously to the support of her brothers and sister and to their children. This generosity continued until she died. Upon Kilpatrick\u2019s death she inherited considerable money which yielded an annual income of approximately $10,000. In 1937, Dr. Pracht, her physician, introduced her to Marcellus R. Lare, Jr., appellant, who was then employed as a security salesman and had been previously employed in a bank. He was a man of little property. A year and a half later they were married in Miami. Appellant left his position in a Miami bank shortly before the marriage, and in April of 1939 they moved to Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. In 1940, decedent purchased a $15,000 home in Mount Lebanon, and took title in the name of her husband and herself as tenants by the entireties. Appellees testified that the married life of decedent was unhappy and that she suffered from high blood pressure and upon several occasions was a patient at a hospital and a sanitorium. She was troubled and disturbed by his failure to obtain employment, his continued attempts to interfere with her friendly relationships with,her brothers and sister, and his demand for an increased share of her wealth. He left her for two weeks and lived with his mother. He then accepted a position as accountant for the Rust Engineering Company at Portsmouth, Virginia, and retained this position from December, 1940, until April, 1941. During this period decedent visited him twice. Later he returned to Pittsburgh and accepted an appointment to the force of Pennsylvania Bank Examiners which required him to spend much time away from home. J. Kirk Benner, Esq., attended to the small amount of legal work which her property required. He had been attorney for the estate of her first husband.\nThe check upon which the alleged will was written was identified as coming from the back of her check book. She had been in the habit of removing blank cheeks, signing and carrying them about in her wallet. The check in question was withdrawn from the back of the book some time between her admission to the West Penn hospital on May 13, 1940, and May 16, 1940.\nImmediately upon her decease appellant contacted Renner and inquired whether his wife had left a will and was informed that although she had often mentioned the possibility of making a will providing for her sister and brothers he knew of none. Several days later Renner and Lare had a lengthy discussion at the latter\u2019s home about the manner in which the estate would be settled in event of intestacy. After letters of administration had been granted on June 29, 1942, Lare, on July 2, wrote to Renner forwarding numerous papers, among which was the purported will. Renner\u2019s advice was to destroy the check. He stated that he would not represent Lare or any other interested party in the settlement of the estate. Numerous attempts were made by appellant to secure Renner as counsel, all of which failed.\nLare sought the advice of appellees\u2019 handwriting experts and failed to amply provide his own expert witness with proper samples of deceased\u2019s typewriting. At the trial, comparison of Lare\u2019s typewriting, made in open court, with that of the reputed will, failed because Lare at that time used an unusually heavy touch. Mr. Nernberg, a handwriting expert, compared the signature on the alleged will with admittedly genuine signatures of the decedent and was of opinion that the former could not have been that of the decedent.\nThe evidence adduced in support of the validity of the instrument shows that many unimpeachable witnesses agreed that the signature was that of decedent and genuine. Analysis of Mrs. Lare\u2019s signatures show them to have similar characteristics with regard to size and variation. Only appellees\u2019 witness declared it a forgery. Nernberg failed to take into consideration degrees of variation in writing and made no comparison with exhibits made on or near the date of the alleged signature. Mrs. Lare, around the date of the will, used both dark and green ink. Numerous exhibits were put in evidence in which blue ink was used, to disprove appellees\u2019 theory that to be genuine the signature would of necessity have been in green ink. Three people saw Mrs. Lare use the typewriter during the last several years of her life. Although having been ill for a number of years she had not typed professionally for thirteen years. The machine she was using was a small portable machine, not the larger business office type. The typing on the check is neat and the margins well arranged, and not crowded. Comparison of the letters of expert typists, made in the court room, reveal the same errors allegedly existing upon the will. An exhibit typed by one of the professional typists in the court room revealed the same misalignment urged by the appellees as evidence of a forgery. Lare had a habit of completing and punctuating dates; Mrs. Lare wrote partial dates. The contested instrument does not contain any punctuation after the date. Exhibits of actual typing by Mrs. Lare were offered, and Leslie, appellant\u2019s expert, used the same for comparison in determining the typing to be that of decedent.\nAppellant and decedent had a normally happy life. Any quarrels they had arose over the great amount of gifts of money which were given to the contestants or their children. Her generosity decreased considerably in the last year of her life. Many exhibits refer to the happy marriage and her great desire to be with him whenever possible. Although contestants were continually attempting to create friction between decedent and appellant, on April 24, 1942, she wrote \u201cI want to live and enjoy life and you and our house.\u201d Upon numerous occasions she remarked that she would leave all to her husband, thus establishing the disposition of her estate to be a natural one. Explanation is given for the friction arising between Renner and Lare, that being the existence of a $1000 note to decedent, not marked paid or satisfied. The language of the will and use of a blank check are also explained.\nThe granting of an issue devisavit vel non is not always a matter of right. Section 21(b) of the Act of 1917, P. L. 363, 20 P.S. 2582, provides: \u201cWhenever a dispute upon a matter of fact arises before any orphans\u2019 court, on appeal from any register of wills . . . the said court shall, at the request of either party, direct a precept for an issue to the court of common pleas of the county for the trial thereof . . .\u201d This dispute must be a substantial dispute: Fleming\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 399, 406; Kane\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 531, 534; Kline\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 374, 378. The existence of a substantial dispute can only be determined by consideration of the evidence as a whole. \u201cIt is the evidence of the fact on the one hand and the evidence in denial on the other, which raises such a substantial and material dispute . . Hile\u2019s Estate, 310 Pa. 541, 544. An issue should be denied where after careful consideration of all the evidence a verdict in favor of the petitioner would have to be set aside as against the weight of the evidence: Hile\u2019s Estate, supra, 544; Fleming\u2019s Estate, supra, 406. An issue should be granted where the evidence is such that a verdict for either party would be permitted to stand: Hile\u2019s Estate, supra, 544; Kane\u2019s Estate, supra, 534; DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 70, 78; Kline\u2019s Estate, supra, 378. The rule is the same regardless of the party petitioning for the granting of an issue: Kane\u2019s Estate, supra, 534. It is the function of the hearing judge to determine whether there is a substantial dispute upon a material matter of fact. He is not, however, to constitute himself the jury. If a substantial dispute does exist, even though the verdict might be at variance with the opinion of the judge, the issue must be granted: DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, supra, 79.\nUpon appeal to this Court the chancellor\u2019s decision will not be reversed unless there appears to have been an abuse of discretion: DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, supra, 78; Dible\u2019s Estate, 316 Pa. 553, 554. In determining whether there has been such an abuse of discretion by the court below we have considered all the evidence. If a jury were to believe the evidence of appellant, a verdict upholding the instrument as the will of Mrs. Lare could be sustained. On the other hand, if the evidence of appellees were believed, a verdict that the putative will was a forgery could also be sustained. The evidence adduced by appellees is not so positive and unimpeachable that appellant\u2019s evidence can be dismissed from consideration as a matter of law. Appellant has established more than a prima facie case. See DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, supra, 77. It cannot be said as a matter of law that the evidence adduced by the proponent of the will is so inherently weak that a jury should not be permitted to consider it.\nWe \u00e1re of opinion that the chancellor erred in concluding that \u201cno jury verdict sustaining the will could be permitted to stand\u201d and in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s petition for an issue devisavit vel non. In so doing he has assumed the province of a jury and has determined material facts upon which there is a substantial dispute.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed and the appeal from the register of wills reinstated, with directions to award an issue devisavit vel non; costs to abide the result.",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne:\nI am in complete accord with the majority opinion.\nThe difference in opinion in this Court concerns the scope of the authority of a hearing judge in the orphans\u2019 court as to when he should grant or refuse an issue devisavit yel non. The majority have decided that the exclusive function of such hearing judge is to determine whether there exists a substantial dispute of fact. The minority view is that the hearing judge may conclude, despite the testimony, that he would not support a verdict of a jury and therefore no substantial dispute exists.\nTo my mind whatever confusion appears is largely due to inapt and unfortunate expressions in some of the cases. It particularly appears in cases where the orphans\u2019 court has been required to determine whether or not the dispute is substantial. It is also apparent in defining the function of a trial judge without a jury, where, under the cases, such judge acts as a chancellor.\nBecause of the large number of reported will contests, it would be neither practical nor useful to attempt to collect and discuss or distinguish them. There has been expended much learning and effort upon this important branch of the law. Like all other matters of legal development, earlier views have been subjected to modification. This Court has not hesitated to declare, in at least one instance, that its earlier view was mistaken. See Cross\u2019s Estate, 278 Pa. 170, 180, 122 A. 267.\nThe case of DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 70, 186 A. 359, is perhaps the latest leading authority upon the subject now under consideration. Mr. Justice Horace Stern has concisely and accurately defined the function of an orphans\u2019 court judge sitting to determine whether a substantial dispute exists: \u201c. . . the judge of th\u00e9 orphans\u2019 court conducting the hearing is not to constitute himself the jury, that is, to decide the case as he would if acting in the capacity of an ultimate fact-finding tribunal. His function is to decide whether there is a substantial dispute upon a material matter of fact, and such a dispute exists if a verdict that might be reached by a jury, even if at variance with his own opinion, would not have to be set aside as judicially untenable because contrary to the weight of the evidence. . . .\u201d We have repeatedly reaffirmed this principle: Kline\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 374, 378, 186 A. 364; Hunter\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 484, 492, 196 A. 35; Noble\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 490, 492, 13 A. 2d 422; Porter\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 476, 482, 19 A. 2d 731; De Silver, Admrs., v. Pa. Trust Co., 342 Pa. 320, 322, 20 A. 2d 761; Young Estate, 347 Pa. 457, 459, 32 A. 2d 901; see also Patti\u2019s Estate, 133 Pa. Superior Ct. 81, 83, 1 A. 2d 791.\nA review of this record has convinced me that the learned hearing judge of the orphans\u2019 court misconceived his statutory function. He constituted himself a jury and decided the case as he would have done if acting in the capacity of the ultimate fact-finding tribunal. With substantial conflicting evidence, he found as a fact that the proponent had forged the questioned testamentary writing. He then held, in effect, that because of such finding he could not support a verdict of a jury in favor of the will and consequently no substantial dispute existed. He declined to award an issue. This, in my view, was clearly error.\nAt the outset we are met with a constitutional provision (Article 1, section 6, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth): \u201cTrial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate.\u201d In North Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Snowden, 42 Pa. 488, 491, this Court said: . . . \u201cif there is any right to which, more than all others, the people of Pennsylvania have clung with unrelaxing grasp, it is that of trial by jury. They brought it with them from the land of their fathers. In every constitution which has been adopted, they have taken care to secure it against infringement, and put it beyond the power of either the executive, the legislature or the courts to take it away from any individual. . . . The judiciary, no more than the legislature, can deny to any litigant the right of trial by jury, in a case appropriate to such a mode of trial.\u201d\nThe orphans\u2019 court, within the scope of its jurisdiction,, acts as a court of chancery. A trial in that court, is a trial by a single judge. Such court, being a court of limited jurisdiction, exercises only such power as is given by statute, Cutler\u2019s Estate, 225 Pa. 167, 73 A. 1111; Cutter\u2019s Estate, 286 Pa. 505, 134 A. 489; Watson\u2019s Estate, 314 Pa. 179, 170 A. 254; Mains\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 243, 185 A. 222; Gilbert Estate, 350 Pa. 13, 38 A. 2d 277.

L. 135), provides: \u201cWhenever a dispute upon a matter of fact arises before any orphans\u2019 court, on appeal from any register of wills, or on removal from any register of wills by certification, the said court shall, at the request of either party, direct a precept for an issue to the court of common pleas of the county for the trial thereof. . . .\u201d\nFor a review of the cases under section 21(b) of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act and the preceding section 21(a) see opinion of Chief Justice Moschziskeb in Cross\u2019s Estate, 278 Pa. 170, 122 A. 267. He clearly defines when such an issue is mandatory and when advisory. See also historical data in dissenting opinion of Justice Simpson in Fleming\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 399, 415, et seq., 109 A. 265.\nAgain, for the sake of brevity, it will suffice to state that it is well-settled that the function of the orphans\u2019 court in merely seeking to ascertain whether a substantial dispute exists, does not deprive the parties of the right to a jury trial. It is only where such a dispute exists that the parties are entitled to demand a jury trial. The dispute must be substantial and not a mere conflict in the testimony: Guar. T. & S. D. Co. v. Heidenreich, 290 Pa. 249, 251, 138 A. 764. Thus, for example, if a will is alleged to have been forged, but two reputable subscribing witnesses testify that they saw testator affix his signature; testator\u2019s banker, lawyer, physician and other friends, as well as a handwriting expert, all testify that the signature is that of the testator, then the mere opinion of a tradesman that he did not believe the signature to be that of the testator, would not be sufficient in weight for the court to declare that the conflict in testimony was a substantial dispute which would necessitate the award of an issue.\nWhen an issue is awarded in a will contest, the verdict, where properly sustained by the court of common pleas, (or orphans\u2019 court trying the case with a jury under the Act of July 1, 1937, P. L. 2665, 20 PS 2585), is conclusive and binding on the orphans\u2019 court: Gross\u2019s Estate, supra. In that case Chief Justice Moschzisker said (page 184): \u201cWhere a substantial dispute exists on a material point of fact concerning the status of an alleged will or testamentary writing, and the evidence is of the probative value required by our decisions, the orphans\u2019 court must send such issue to the common pleas when requested so to do by any party in interest, if that request is made in due season. . . . After judgment entered on the verdict in the common pleas, so long as the judgment stands undisturbed, the findings of fact by the jury of that tribunal are conclusive on the orphans\u2019 court, (a) whenever the issue is of the class mentioned in Rule 2, \u2014 whether sent to the common pleas on request or otherwise, \u2014 or (b) when it involves the decision of a fact upon which depends the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d But in presenting the evidence before the trial judge and a jury \u201cThe trial judge, who sits to determine an issue devisavit vel non, acts as a chancellor. He is not bound by a verdict when it is against the manifest weight of the evidence, which is addressed to him quite as much as to the jury. If his professional and official conscience is not satisfied that it is sufficient to sustain a verdict against the will, either because it lacks probative force or inadequacy, it becomes his duty to set the verdict aside: Kustus v. Hager, 269 Pa. 103; Keller v. Lawson, 261 Pa. 489; Englert v. Englert, 198 Pa. 326\u201d: Brehony, Exr., v. Brehony, 289 Pa. 267, 270, 137 A. 260. See also: Guar. T. & S. D. Co. v. Heidenreich, supra; Buhan v. Keslar, 328 Pa. 312, 194 A. 917.\nUpon a petition, answer and replication in the orphans\u2019 court for an issue devisavit vel non, under section 21(b) of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1917, supra, on the allegation of a substantial dispute, the court must necessarily dispose of the application in one of three ways: (1) Grant the issue, (2) refuse the issue and sustain the will or (3) refuse the issue and declare the will invalid. In this field are hundreds of varying cases, but I shall only consider a few in each classification, as examples of the method by which they have been treated:\n(1) Granting an issue: Sharpless\u2019s Estate, 134 Pa. 250, 19 A. 630; Kline\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 374, 186 A. 364; DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, supra. In each of these cases there existed a well-defined, substantial dispute, the determination of which depended upon a verdict by a jury.\n(2) Refusing an issue and sustaining the will: Lowe\u2019s Estate, 318 Pa. 497, 178 A. 820; Rosenthal\u2019s Estate, 339 Pa. 488, 15 A. 2d 370; Porter\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 476, 19 A. 2d 731. In each of these cases the contestants\u2019 evidence, viewed in its most favorable light, did not measure up to the standard necessary to nullify the testamentary writing.\n(3) Refusing an issue and declaring the will invalid: Fleming\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 399, 109 A. 265; Culbertson\u2019s Estate, 301 Pa. 438, 152 A. 540; Morgan\u2019s Estate, 146 Pa. Superior Ct. 79, 22 A. 2d 87. In Fleming\u2019s Estate, the forgery was established by incontrovertible physical facts, such as presence of carbon on the signature, and by testimony which the majority of the court regarded as overwhelmingly refuting the rather fantastic and dramatic story of the finding of the will and its execution by a surviving witness. Justice Simpson filed a vigorous dissent, regarding the matter as a jury question. In the Culbertson case the confession of the forger was established, and was corroborated by incontrovertible physical facts. Again no substantial dispute was held to exist and the will was stricken down. In the Morgan case the mental incapacity of decedent was so completely proven that the extremely weak testimony of the proponent did not overcome the established facts.\nFrom a consideration of the foregoing, it plainly appears that the orphans\u2019 court hearing judge is limited by statute to a single inquiry, to wit: is there a substantial dispute? He is not, in such capacity, to be confused with a chancellor who, with the aid of a jury, is the trier of fact. At times the hearing judge must weigh the evidence in order to ascertain whether the dispute is substantial. Beyond this he may not go. I am convinced that the rule, which is so accurately stated in DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, supra, is the correct exposition of the law and should be followed.\n, The testimony and the court\u2019s opinion in the present case have been examined with care. The judge has found, as a fact, that not only is the signature to the will forged, but that the typewriting was superimposed by the proponent over the forged signature. The judge states in his opinion: \u201cNo person called as a witness claims to have direct knowledge of the forgery of the alleged will. The evidence offered by both sides consists of circumstantial evidence and the opinions of experts.\u201d\nProponent testified that he found the disputed writing in his wife\u2019s handbag and he was corroborated by two witnesses. Four bank officials and a handwriting expert testified to the genuineness of the signature. Proponent denied that he had typewritten the words of the will. The contestants\u2019 evidence consisted largely of circumstantial evidence, opinions of experts and deductions and inferences to be drawn from tbe testimony. Concisely stated, contestants point to the fact that the will was written upon a blank check, a very unusual circumstance; that decedent frequently signed blank checks and carried them about with her; the improbability that decedent would disinherit her nearest of kin in favor of the proponent, her husband; the advice of the attorney for the decedent to the proponent that he should tear up the will because, in the attorney\u2019s opinion, it was a forgery; the improbability of the proponent\u2019s testimony concerning the discovery of the alleged will; the proponent\u2019s threatening language in attempting to discourage a will contest; that decedent was a skilled typist, whereas the proponent was an amateur; that decedent, at or about the time of the date appearing on the will, carried a fountain pen filled with green ink, whereas the will was signed with black ink; that the check was old, whereas the typewriting was fresh, and many other arguments and conclusions to be drawn from the surrounding facts and circumstances.\nIt appears to me that this testimony, considered as a whole, discloses the existence of a substantial dispute of fact. If what the proponent and his witness have testified to is true, the probate of the will should not be disturbed. On the other hand, if what the contestants\u2019 witnesses say and infer is correct, then the proponent did forge the will and it should be annulled. This is a typical dispute of fact under Section 21(b) of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act, supra, which, under the Constitution, proponent has the right to have tried by a jury.\nI cannot agree that the minority statement that on this record no verdict sustaining the will offered for probate could possibly be allowed to stand is a sufficient reason to deny the proponent\u2019s statutory right to a trial-by jury. While a verdict of a jury will not be lightly set aside, the trial judge, sitting as a chancellor and also subject to reviewby the appellate court (Guar. T. & S. D. Co. v. Heidenreich, supra), still has complete control over the verdict. In my opinion we should continue to follow, and not depart from, our declared law and practice.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMe. Chibe Justice Maxey:\nI dissent from the majority of the opinion in this case. The issue raised by a petition to set aside the order of the Register of Wills and to revoke the letters of administration C.T.A. issued to M. R. Lare, Jr., was thoroughly litigated before Judge Milholland, of the Orphans\u2019 Court, in a protracted hearing which lasted, with brief recesses, from July 9th to July 23,1943. The record before us comprises 3,290 pages. It was the conclusion of Judge Milholland that the wili was a forgery and that ho jury verdict sustaining it could be permitted to stand. Exceptions were filed to this adjudication, and these were argued before the court en banc, consisting of Judges Teimble, Patteeson and Milholland. The court en banc adopted Judge Milholland\u2019s findings and conclusions that the alleged will was a forgery. I agree with Judge Milholland and the court en banc that the will is a forgery and that no jury finding in its favor could be sustained. There is no reasonable expectation that any further light would be thrown upon this case by a jury trial. The record of such a trial would presumably be about the same as the record now before us. On this record a verdict sustaining this alleged will would be most unlikely and to sustain such a verdict would be shocking to any judicial conscience.\nAll agree that the law is settled that the Orphans\u2019 Court has the right to decide in a will case whether or not an issue to determine the validity of an alleged will should be awarded. The constitutional right to a trial by jury has no relation whatever to the power of the Orphans\u2019 Court in such cases, for the Orphans\u2019 Court acts as a court of chancery and \u201cin the exercise of its limited jurisdiction ... it applies the rules and principles of equity\u201d: Willard\u2019s Appeal, 65 Pa. 265, 267-8.\nIt is likewise settled that if there is a substantial dispute upon a material matter of fact, the Orphans\u2019 Court must award an issue; if there is no such substantial dispute the Orphans\u2019 Court may properly refuse to award an issue. Mr. Justice Horace Stern in DeLaurentiis\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 70, 186 A. 359, after reviewing our cases aptly states: \u201c. . . the principle is laid down in unmistakable though variously expressed terms, that a party is not entitled to have an issue submitted to a jury merely because he produces enough evidence to make out technically a prima facie case.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018The true rule is that such a case should not go to the jury at all when the court in the exercise of a sound legal discretion would not sustain the verdict\u2019: Eddey\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 406, 419.\n\u201c \u2018If the testimony is such that after a fair and impartial trial, resulting in a verdict against the proponents of the alleged will, the trial judge, after a careful review of all the testimony, would feel constrained to set aside the verdict as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, it cannot be said that a dispute, within the meaning of the Act, has arisen\u2019: Appeal of Knauss, 114 Pa. 10, 20. . . .\n\u201c \u2018As the rule is usually stated, an issue should be denied in a case where, after a careful consideration and review of all the evidence, the trial judge would feel compelled to set aside a verdict, if found for the petitioner, as impossible and improper on the strength of the evidence, ... To sustain the grant of an issue, the evidence must be such as would permit a verdict for either party to stand. Otherwise, there is no substantial dispute upon a material question of fact\u2019: Hile\u2019s Est., 310 Pa. 541, 544.\u201d\nI have carefully read the record in the case, and I fail to see how any court could sustain a verdict in favor of this will (written on the face of a bank check) should a jury be misled into returning such a verdict. Even if we concede merely for the sake of argument that this proponent has made ont \u201ctechnically a prima facie case\u201d that is not enough, under our decisions, (as Justice Stern pointed out) to warrant submitting an issue to a jury-\nIn human affairs we accept as true those things which are highly probable and as untrue those things which are highly improbable. Thayer in his \u201cTreatise on Evidence,\u201d says, p. 272: \u201cWhat is called the \u2018legal mind\u2019 is still the human mind, and it must reason according to the laws of its constitution.\u201d That Mrs. Lare ever wrote the will her husband presented for probate is so highly improbable that only an immature and gullible mind would believe it. The following are some of the circumstances which convince me that this will is a fraud:\n1. While, of course, a will can be written on a bank check form, it is so unusual for anyone to do so when ample paper is available and there is no necessity to write a will on a bank check form, that when an alleged will so written is offered for probate it naturally excites suspicion as to its genuineness. Before it is accepted as a will there ought to be some plausible explanation as to why the alleged testator chose to write a will on such a small piece of paper, and on the side of it which contained printed matter instead of the side of it which was blank. The bank check form allegedly used for the writing of this alleged will was 6-% inches in length and 2-% inches in width. It contained about one inch from the top the printed words \u201cForbes National Bank.\u201d Near its right end and about an inch from the bottom it contained the word \u201cDollars,\u201d and about one inch above that word and a little to the left of it is a dollar ($) sign, and near the top are the words \u201cPittsburgh, Pa. No.\u201d and on the left side are the words: \u201cPay to the order of.\u201d Mrs. Lare, the alleged maker of this alleged will had had business experience and had been a \u201cskillful typist.\u201d From 1919 to 1929 she had been secretary to the General Sales Manager of a cement company. A person of ordinary business sense and experience would not be likely to use a blank check as a paper on which to write her will disposing of property of the value of $80,000, and if because of some unusual circumstance she did use a blank check for that purpose she would naturally use not the already partially occupied face of the check but the totally unoccupied back of it. There is probably not a single instance anywhere of any person using the face of a \u201cblank\u201d check containing the usual printed matter, on which to typewrite a will. Mrs. Lare, who had been a trained secretary, doubtless had plenty of paper available for the writing of a will in the usual form and would not have resorted to her. check book for paper on which to express her testamentary intentions.\n2. It was shown that Mrs. Lare had the habit of signing checks in blank. This fact was inferentially admitted by Lare who testified that he once told his wife he \u201cwould not give or take a blank check from Jesus Christ; it is too dangerous.\u201d This alleged will was evidently written on a blank check form on which Mrs. Lare had carefully written her name on the signature line, intending that the form should later be filled out as a check. The blank on which this \u201cwill\u201d was written was taken from the check book between May 13th and 16th, 1940. The will bears a date twenty months later, i.e., January 21,1942. Each check book of 201 checks which Mrs. Lare used, lasted about one year. She did not use a new book until all the checks in the preceding book were used. It is unthinkable that anyone writing a will on January 21, 1942, on a blank check, would use one from a book that had been depleted of all its blanks nearly two years previously? The obvious inference is that Lare had obtained possession of a blank but signed check of his wife\u2019s in 1940 and had carefully retained it for the very fraudulent purpose for which he used it twenty months later. The paper on which this alleged will was written shows unmistakable signs of having been kept for a long period (See \u201c#12,\u201d post).\n3. It is highly improbable that the decedent who inherited all her estate from her first husband who died in 1935, would leave all her estate to her second husband whom she married thirty-eight months before the alleged will was executed, to the exclusion of her two surviving brothers and one sister. One brother was in 1942 about 35 years of age, and the other about 52 years of age, and the sister was about 40 years of age. Mrs. Lare\u2019s relations with them were amicable. She had talked to her attorney, J. Kirk Kenner, and expressed her desire to make a will in which provisions would be made for her brothers and her sister and their children. Mrs. Lare\u2019s attorney testified that in one of the last of Mrs. Lare\u2019s many telephone conversations with him, she spoke of a plan to visit his office in Connellsville, as soon as she should recover from her illness, to carry out a plan to make a will providing for \u201cKatherine and the boys,\u201d meaning the three contestants who are appellees here, \u201cand their children.\u201d Lare himself admitted that Mrs. Lare \u201cthought warmly of her family.\u201d There was evidence that she expressed a belief that Mr. Lare \u201chad married her for her money.\u201d The court found that \u201cold, established friend of the decedent, who knew her well enough to learn from her that her life with Mr. Lare was a most unhappy one, [testified that] one of the principal causes of her unhappiness was that she was unwilling to forget her regard for contestants or to abandon her practice to make material provisions for them in the face of Mr. Lare\u2019s jealous and bitter opposition.\u201d\n4. Attorney Kenner had been the executor of the will of Mrs. Lare\u2019s first husband, who left all his estate to her. Mr. Kenner continued to do all her legal work until her death. She trusted him so implicitly that she sent him \u201cchecks signed in blank to be used after he filled them in, for the correct amount, to the proper payees.\u201d She wrote him and told him about her anxiety to make a will \u201cto take care of her sister and brothers.\u201d During the last three or four months of her life\u201d she talked to Attorney Renner on the telephone. Yet she never mentioned to this trusted attorney and personal adviser anything about the will which was offered for probate in this case and which bears the date, January 21,1942. In Young Estate, 347 Pa. 457, 32 A. 2d 901, one of the five circumstances we listed as tending to prove that the will challenged in that case was a forgery was the fact that at no time after the date of the alleged will (which was adjudicated to be a fraud) did the person whose name was attached to the will ever discuss that will with the attorney whom she consulted on her personal business affairs. We there said (p. 462): \u201cThe silence of this woman in the presence of the man whom she had consulted professionally during a dozen years, about a will these proponents declare she had executed six weeks previously and in which this man was named one of the executors, would generate even in the mind of the gullible a formidable doubt as to this declaration\u2019s veraciousness.\u201d If that was true in the Young case, it is equally true in this case.\n5. A most significant circumstance against the genuineness of Lare\u2019s claim that this blank check \u201cwill\u201d is his wife\u2019s will is the fact that after his wife\u2019s attorney, J. Kirk Renner, had told him \u201cIf I were in your position I would not attempt to probate that as Gertrude\u2019s will,\u201d that the \u201cwill\u201d was a forgery and to \u201ctear it up,\u201d he requested Mr. Renner to become his attorney and secure for him the probate of the paper as a will. Lare admitted in his testimony that Attorney Renner said to him: \u201cTear it up! I would not probate that will.\u201d Lare then became \u201cvery excited, jumped from his chair, began pacing back and forth\u201d and said: \u201cYou don\u2019t think I would do anything like that, do you? [evidently meaning to forge a will]. I put men in the penitentiary for less than that.\u201d After this interview with Attorney Renner, Lare waited two or three weeks, i.e., until July 31st, before offering the \u201cwill for probate.\u201d When asked why he held the will so long after this interview, Lare replied: \u201cI wanted him [Renner] to state in writing to me his position.\u201d\nIt is unthinkable that a man offering to engage his deceased wife\u2019s lawyer to help him probate an alleged will of the man\u2019s wife, would persist in requesting that lawyer to represent him after the lawyer had in effect characterized the will as a fraud, unless the man himself knew that the will was a fraud and hoped to stifle the lawyer\u2019s opinion of that will by engaging him as counsel. No man with an honest will in his possession would think of engaging as his counsel in the probate of that will a lawyer who pronounced the will spurious.\n6. Lare\u2019s testimony as to where the alleged will was found and how he found it greatly strengthens one\u2019s conviction that this \u201cwill\u201d is a fraud. Mrs. Lare had in her home a steel filing cabinet, with a lock on it, in which she kept stock certificates, fire and automobile insurance policies, title to car, war savings bonds and other valuable papers. Yet Tier will disposing of property worth $80,000 was not kept in this boa, but Lare found this will, so he says, \u201cin the last place in the world I would expect to find it,\u201d in her wallet. He found it there, so he says, when he was looking for her automobile registration card which he wanted in order to obtain the manufacturer\u2019s number of Mrs. Lare\u2019s automobile. He could easily have obtained this from the title certificate which he well knew was in the steel box to which he had the key. Though Lare quickly found the registration card in the wallet, he did not at once use the information thus obtained for the necessary inscription of the Federal Stamp Tax (his avowed purpose), but he kept on searching in the wallet and \u201cin the right hand compartment having the flap over it\u201d he found the \u201cwill.\u201d He says \u201che then sat there and started to bawl.\u201d It is indeed strange that Mrs. Lare would carry her will in her wallet, though all other valuable papers were carefully kept in a steel cabinet, and it is equally strange that she had never informed her attorney or even Lare himself or anyone else of the existence of this will, though she held frequent communications with her attorney after the date of the alleged will.\n7. Another circumstance which is highly condemnatory of Lare\u2019s good faith in this matter is found in the threatening language he used in an obvious attempt to discourage the contest of the \u201cwill\u201d he offered for probate. After Attorney Renner refused to represent Lare, the latter wrote Renner under date of July 17, 1942, inter alia, as follows (Rec. 3304a) : \u201cIn regard to the possibility of contest, I have nothing whatsoever to fear. ... In event of any attack you will of course be in a vulnerable spot for you will have to testify as to what ever you may know about anything. You will be in the mele\u00e9 even if you would like to stay out. While I will not push you I know that you will be pushed and plenty hard.\u201d Then he said: \u201cIt will be rather hard for them [his wife\u2019s brothers and sister] to hear their heritage from the mouths of the doctors and nurses who have attended Pat for the last few years. I cannot help that.\u201d The word \u201cheritage\u201d is a little cryptic, but apparently Lare was threatening disclosures which might embarrass the brothers and sister. This letter evidenced a desire on Lare\u2019s part to blackmail both Attorney Renner and the relatives into silence, so that he could reap the fruits of the alleged \u201cwill,\u201d which Attorney Renner had discredited. What this court said in McHugh v. McHugh, 186 Pa. 197, 203, 40 A. 410, is apposite here: \u201c. . . evidence of the misconduct of a party in connection with the trial is admissible as tending to show that the party guilty of the misconduct is unwilling to rely on the truth of his cause, or is conscious that it is an unjust one.\u201d\n8. When we consider that the established fact that Mrs. Lare was a skillful and experienced typist, this spurious \u201cwill\u201d shows on its face that it was never typed by her. As Judge Milholland aptly said in his opinion: \u201c. . . the contestants offered the testimony of two experts, Mrs. Grace Martin Cornelius and Mr. Nernberg. . . . Both of these experts working independently of each other, reached the same conclusion: that the typewriting on the alleged will could not possibly have been the work of a typist having professional training and experience, such as was possessed by the decedent, and that the errors and peculiarities of the typewriting on the alleged will were the same as those which consistently appeared in all the admitted typewriting works of Mr. Lare. The peculiarities referred to by both of these experts were the uneven touch reflected in the varying blackness of the letters in the alleged will; the awkward confusion of the word \u201call\u201d with the printed \u201c$\u201d; the peculiar single spacing after periods, which would never occur in the work of a typist having the training and experience of the decedent; the erratic misalignments in the body of the will; the inconsistent misalignment of the date and the punctuation of the closing sentence of the alleged will.\u201d That all skillful typists make two spaces after a period was proved and is obvious from the casual inspection of well typed letters. Appellant concedes.\u201cit appears in the record that Mr. Lare\u2019s typing does show the habit of making [only] one space after a period.\u201d Six samples of Lare\u2019s typing each show a single space after periods, as does the \u201cwill\u201d he offers for probate. A trained typist, as Mrs. Lare was, would leave two spaces after each period. Two experts on typing testified that it was Lare himself who typed this challenged paper and the reasons they gave for their conclusion are convincing.\n9. There are on the blank check form used for this will 12 printed words and a printed sign and the numbers 8-139. None of these had been obliterated. It is obvious that if a skillful typist used the face of this check form for the purpose of writing a will on it, she would have \u201cblotted out\u201d the above words and sign and numbers. No person of Mrs. Lare\u2019s long experience as a secretary would on such an important document as her will, allow tbe printed words \u201cForbes National Bank\u201d and \u201cPay to the Order of\u201d to appear in it when they serve no purpose there. These printed words would naturally induce a trained typist if she was going to use a \u201cblank check\u201d to write a will to use the bach of the check on which no printed words or signs or numbers appeared.\n10. Judge Milholland and the court en banc concluded from the testimony of several credible witnesses that though Mrs. Lare was a skillful typist, she during the latter years of her life avoided the use of a typewriter. It is therefore improbable that Mrs. Lare would revert to the use of the typewriter in order to write a 43 word will.\n11. On January 9, 19.43, at Mr. Lare\u2019s direction, his counsel addressed to Mr. Nernberg and Mr. Fearon (the expert witnesses employed by Lare) identical letters which purported to offer for their inspection several hundred specimens of his dead wife\u2019s handwriting, and which requested that the two experts compare these with the signature on the alleged will, and so determine whether the latter was or was not genuine. Neither of the experts employed by Lare offered any specimen of Mr. Lare\u2019s typewriting, or suggested the existence of any specimens of Mrs. Lare\u2019s typewriting, or the possibility of any comparison of either Mr. Lare\u2019s or the decedent\u2019s typewriting with that appearing on the alleged will. Though Mr. Lare engaged an expert, E. C. Leslie, and through the latter asked Lare to furnish him samples of Mrs. Lare\u2019s \u201cwork on the typewriter\u201d and though he repeated these requests during the months preceding the trial, Lare did not furnish samples of her typewriting, (except a few unsatisfactory carbon copies). As a result, Mr. Leslie was never able to form any opinion of the genuineness or forgery of the typewriting on the alleged will. His testimony indicates that he devoted himself to the study of Mrs. Lare\u2019s signature. He testified (2319a) that he saw some carbon copies of Mrs. Lare\u2019s typing and when asked whether these carbon copies were satisfactory he answered \u201cThey were satisfactory to the extent that I could not say whether Mrs. Lare typed or did not type the will, I could not honestly say she did or honestly say she did not.\u201d\n12. Another circumstance which stamps this \u201cwill\u201d as fraudulent is the fact that although the typing on this paper was comparably fresh, the paper itself showed age. It had lost most of its gloss and color and crispness. The court below concluded from the evidence that \u201cthe paper [the blank check] was old and worn when the typewriting was inscribed on it.\u201d\nThese twelve most significant circumstances by no means exhaust the evidence which convinces the court below as it does the writer of this opinion that Mrs. Lare never wrote this alleged will. This evidence is equally conclusive that it was Mr. Lare himself who wrote this alleged will, but we will not herein review this evidence which so certainly connects him with this palpable fraud. The court below could not reach any other conclusion than it did reach in this case and if the issue had been submitted to a jury, and if the jury had for any reason found a verdict in favor of this alleged will, no court could permit it to stand.\nThe majority opinion seems to be based upon the idea that the basic question in this case is whether or not Mrs. Lare\u2019s signature on the challenged will is a genuine signature or a forgery. This is not the basic issue. The basic issue is: is this proffered paper Mrs. Lare\u2019s will or is it spurious and therefore a fraud. If Mrs. Lare signed a check form not filled out (as was her custom) and if her husband came into possession of such a paper and if he over her genuine signature wrote a will, without her authorization, that will is a forgery. That this appellant, Marcellus E. Lare, Jr., did write, this alleged will over his wife\u2019s signature on a check which she probably signed \u201cin blank\u201d (as apparently was her custom) is to my mind conclusively demonstrated by the evidence now before us.\nThe majority opinion says: \u201cIf a jury were to believe the evidence of appellant, a verdict upholding the instrument as the will of Mrs. Lare would have to be sustained.\u201d The same thing could be said of the evidence of every fraudulent claimant in history. I cannot conceive of any honest and intelligent jury believing Lare\u2019s testimony. The chancellor and the court en banc did not believe Lare\u2019s testimony and characterized \u201cmuch of it\u201d as \u201cevasive and contradictory.\u201d Lare\u2019s claim that his wife and not he typed the \u201cwill\u201d is contradicted by an array of facts which proclaim the alleged will a sham. Lare had a strong motive to lie in this case for if his testimony is accepted he will receive not merely half of his wife\u2019s $80,000 estate under the intestate laws (which he gets in any event), but also the other half of her estate under a will which he undoubtedly criminally fabricated. As the court below said: Lare \u201chad the motive and the opportunity to take this means of obtaining the estate.\u201d\nIf the proponent of a paper testamentary in form but which so unmistakably reveals its fraudulent character as does the paper Lare produces is entitled to have his \u201cevasive and contradictory\u201d testimony in support of it submitted to a jury so that the latter may, if it chooses, declare it to be a will, it is difficult to see what logical limit can hereafter be placed on imposters who claim the \u201cright\u201d to have their forgeries masquerading as wills submitted to a jury. If an issue D.V.N. is to be awarded in a case so plainly a cheat as this case is, such issues should hereafter be awarded \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d\nThe evidence of the appellant as to the genuineness of Mrs. Lare\u2019s signature on this alleged will can be accepted without disturbing the conclusion which this evidence so imperatively requires that Lare came into possession of a blank check bearing Mrs. Lare\u2019s genuine signature and then fraudulently wrote above tliat signature what he now offers as her av\u00edII. The genuineness of Mrs. Lare\u2019s signature is not the real issue in this case.\nWe have repeatedly said that the decision of the court below in cases like this will not be reversed unless the decision was an abuse of discretion.\nIn Fleming\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 399, 109 A. 265, the facts were that an alleged av\u00edII was offered for probate and it purported to be witnessed by three persons. Two of these witnesses were dead at the time the will was offered but the surviving witness testified that the signature on the will Avas decedent\u2019s, and other witnesses testified to the genuineness of the testator\u2019s signature and of the signatures of the deceased \u201csubscribing witnesses.\u201d The Orphans\u2019 Court denied an issue to the proponents of the alleged will. It based its decision on the facts that the alleged will contained words and names inconsistent with decedent\u2019s education and knowledge, that it did not carry out his expressed intentions as to the disposition of his estate, that the story told to explain the delay in producing the will Avas highly improbable, that there was evidence of the spurious character of the signature of the second witness and that the signature of one of the subscribing witnesses was a forgery and that the presumptive beneficiary of the will Avas not the person the decedent had ever declared his intention to make his principal beneficiary. In that case this court affirmed the action of the court below, and said, inter alia: \u201cFraud, of which forgery is a glaring example, is one of the principal grounds of equity jurisdiction, and, as a general rule, equity may decree the cancellation of a written instrument found to be a forgery: 9 Corpus Juris, 1195\u201d and other authorities and cases. This court also said: \u201cWhen a court is considering the validity of written instruments as affected by undue influence, fraud, forgery or incapacity, it is considering equitable questions where in jury trials are not, and were not when our first state constitution was established, a matter of right; and its declaration that \u2018trial by jury shall be as heretofore,\u2019 has no application to cases where such trial was not then demand-able.\u201d (Citing cases). . . . \u201c\u2018Unless provided by statute the parties to a contested will case have no right to a trial by jury\u2019: 6 Am. & Eng. Enc. of Law (2d ed.), p. 979; and the same rule applies generally in probate courts: Ibid, p. 979; see also 24 Cyc. 104.\u201d\nThe case now before us differs from the case just cited principally in the fact that in the instant case the perpetrator of the fraud was clever enough to use what is probably a genuine signature; his fraud was in the typewriting which was done above the signature, clearly not by the wife, obviously by the husband, and whose effect is to give the entire estate of the wife to this husband of 38 months (when the \u201cwill\u201d was made) to the exclusion of the wife\u2019s two brothers and one sister. In Fleming\u2019s Estate there was at least one \u201csubscribing witness\u201d whose signature apparently withstood all attacks made upon its genuineness, and yet this court held that the Orphans\u2019 Court reached a right decision in refusing an issue. In the instant case there was no subscribing witness and all the facts and circumstances furnish conclusive proof of the fraudulent character of the will offered by Lare.\nIn Culbertson\u2019s Estate, 301 Pa. 438, 152 A. 540, Judge Gest of the Orphans\u2019 Court found as a fact that a will probated twelve years before was a forgery and set its probate aside. In sustaining Judge Gest\u2019s actions this court said: \u201cIt is needless, in passing upon the merits of the case, to refer to the unbroken line of authorities which hold that the facts as determined by the orphans\u2019 court are conclusive upon us where based upon sufficient evidence, and an examination of the record shows those made here to have been fully justified.\u201d\nIn Central Trust Co., Exr., v. Boyer, 308 Pa. 402, 162 A. 806, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Drew, said: . in the trial of an issue to determine the validity of a will, the judge sits as a chancellor . . . ; the evidence is addressed to him as to the jury, and he cannot permit the jury to do what he, as a chancellor, would not do.\u201d (Citing cases.) To the same effect is Wagner\u2019s Estate, 289 Pa. 361, 367, 137 A. 616, where we said that the probate of a will will be set aside \u201cwhen, in good conscience, a verdict of a jury, sustaining the will, could not be approved.\u201d Since the evidence in this case has been before a chancellor in the Orphans\u2019 Court and their opinion is unanimous that the will is a fraud, why should this case be retried before a jury when the chancellor and the Orphans\u2019 Court would in the exercise of their sound discretion set aside any verdict in favor of this will, should such a verdict be returned, for such action would be imperatively called for on testimony such as that now before us.\nIn Noble\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 490, 13 A. 2d. 422, this court said in an opinion by Mr. Justice Linn. \u201cIn Tetlow\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 486, 494, 112 A. 758, we said: \u2018It is the established law of Pennsylvania that, in cases of the character of the one now before us, the judge is vested with power to decide whether or not he shall submit oral evidence to the jury, even though it be conflicting. It is his right and duty, after weighing the whole evidence impartially, to refuse to present it to the jury unless he either feels the ends of justice call for a verdict against the will, or is so uncertain on this point that he could conscionably sustain a finding either way on one or more of the controlling issues involved.\u201d\nA study of this record convinces me that no other decision than that reached by the Chancellor and the court en banc is possible. Though the evidence is all in and a just conclusion reached, the majority opinion decides that this tedious case must be tried again by the Chancellor, in the presence of a jury. If the jury decides against this alleged will, the result will be the very result the court below reached. If the jury by any chance decides in favor of the will, the court below will set the verdict aside and again declare the will a fraud. What possible good can be accomplished by again taking testimony duplicating the 3,290 pages of testimony already taken, and which so conclusively proves that Lare\u2019s claim that his wife bequeathed him, to the exclusion of her brothers and her sister, all of her $80,000 estate by typing a will on the face of a blank check over her signature is spurious?\nThe paper offered by Lare as a will is an unmistakable counterfeit, and the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County saying so should be affirmed.\nLare bad been a bank examiner and presumably bad in bis work encountered forgeries.\nMen have been justly convicted of murder by circumstantial evidence no more conclusive than the circumstantial evidence offered in this case to prove the bank check \u201cwill\u201d a fraud.\nDare\u2019s eagerness to furnish specimens of his wife\u2019s hand,writing and his reluctance to furnish specimens of his wife\u2019s typewriting (already referred to in this opinion under No. 11) speaks loudly as to his confidence that his wife\u2019s signature on the alleged will is genuine, and as to his fear that a thorough comparison of his wife\u2019s actual typing with the typing on the alleged testamentary paper will expose the latter as a fraud.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Drew :\nI cannot support the decision of the majority which reverses the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County and grants an issue d.v.n. in this case. The learned Chancellor, Judge Milholland, did not abuse his judicial discretion and his findings of fact are supported by the overwhelming weight of the credible testimony, and are binding upon this Court. This is all the more true because the action of the Chancellor was sustained by the learned court en banc.\nIn any attempt to apply the rules of law governing the right to an issue in any case, it is necessary to determine what issues of fact have been presented to the Orphans\u2019 Court; and then to determine the extent to which these issues have been made by the evidence the subjects of any real dispute.\nAlthough the length of the record might suggest that this is a complicated case, the essential facts can be reduced to a very simple form. Since the Chief Justice, in his dissenting opinion, has marshalled the facts in a very thorough manner, I shall only touch upon them to the extent necessary to support my position.\nThe controlling issues here, and the Chancellor\u2019s disposition of each issue were as follows: First. Is the signature on the alleged will the handwriting of Mrs. Lare; and, if it is, did she sign the document before or after the typewriting was inscribed upon it?\nOn this point, Mr. Lare, proponent, relies wholly on the testimony of his expert, Mr. Leslie, corroborated by that of several lay witnesses, that the signature is in Mrs. Lare\u2019s handwriting. Mr. Lare offered no evidence tending to show that it was written in January, 1942.\nTo answer this, contestants showed, by physical comparisons of the questioned signature with admitted signatures of January, 1942, and of earlier years, corroborated by the testimony of their expert, Mr. Nernberg, that the questioned signature is quite different from genuine signatures of January, 1942, but very much like those of the earlier years \u2014 particularly signatures of May, 1940. These facts, as Mr. Lare\u2019s expert conceded, tend to show that the questioned signature was not written in January, 1942, and that it must, instead, have been written in May, 1940, or at some period similarly remote from the date of the alleged will.\nJudge Mili-iolland found, as a fact, that the signature could not have been written in January, 1942. This finding was of great importance, but it required the rejection of no evidence which had been offered by Mr. Lare.\nSecond. Was the typewriting on the alleged will the work of Mrs. Lare?\nOn this issue, Mr. Lare offered no evidence in the Orphans\u2019 Court. Since the hearing, and in this Court, he has attempted to compare the typewriting on the alleged will with that of Mrs. Lare\u2019s sister, Katherine M. Sayre, arguing that this comparison shows that the typewriting on the alleged will was the work of a skilled operator. This argument may be ignored, however. To justify its rejection, it is necessary only to observe that Mrs. Sayre was not a proficient typist; or to compare the typewriting on the alleged will with the work of an experienced typist on such a document as a Will or Deed.\nTo prove forgery of the typewriting, contestants showed that Mrs. Lare had been a highly proficient touch typist of many years\u2019 experience in business, but that she had avoided using the typewriter for any purpose during some years before her death \u2014 no sample of typewriting known to be her work was produced by anybody at the hearing. These things were not contradicted. Contestants offered also the testimony of their experts, Mr. Nernberg and Mrs. Cornelius, which was corroborated by the physical appearance of the typewriting on the alleged will, showing two things: that it could not have been the work of a skilled typist, and that its defects were the same as appeared in the many available samples of Mr. Lare\u2019s work produced on the same typewriter. This testimony was not contradicted by Mr. Lare\u2019s expert. It was contradicted only by Mr. Lare\u2019s denial, in rebuttal, that he had typewritten the alleged will; and the weight of this denial was lessened by the fact that, when he was required to operate the typewriter during the hearing, and so to provide samples of his work for comparison with that of the alleged will, Mr. Lare adopted a touch and a method of operating the machine which, as his own expert admitted, were most unnatural, and which tended to disguise and conceal the characteristics of his normal work.\nJudge Milholland found, as a fact, that the typewriting could not possibly be the work of Mrs. Lare; and that it was probably that of Mr. Lare. This finding was of the greatest importance; bnt it required the rejection of no evidence offered by Mr. Lare, except his denial of any part in the making of the alleged will, and Mr. Leslie\u2019s opinion that it is impossible to distinguish the work of skilled and unskilled typists.\nThird. Was the alleged will a forgery or was it genuine?\nTo support the alleged will, Mr. Lare relied wholly upon the testimony of Mr. Leslie that the signature was genuine; upon his own denial that he had typewritten the document; and upon the contention that the alleged will was a natural one; i.e., upon letters addressed to him by Mrs. Lare which expressed her affectionate regard for him \u2014 but which made no reference to any plan to give him any portion of her estate; upon the testimony of two hairdressers and a comparative stranger, concerning declarations of her plans to provide for him in her will; and, finally, upon argument (refuted by Mr. Lare\u2019s own testimony) that Mrs. Lare, by January, 1942, has become estranged from the contestants, and her former friends and business associates.\nTo prove forgery, contestants relied on the facts that the signature was not written in January, 1942; upon admissions and the conduct of Mr. Lare, which showed that Mrs. Lare\u2019s regard for contestants and her former associate had not diminished to the time of her death; upon the testimony of her attorney, Mr. Renner, and various of her friends, which tended to show that she had entertained plans, both before and after January, 1942, to give portions of her estate to the contestants; and \u2014 more particularly \u2014 upon a multitude of physical facts and admitted circumstances. Among these were such things as the facts that the alleged will was typewritten on a blank check, which had been removed from Mrs. Lare\u2019s checkbook in May, 1940; that she had, during her lifetime, given blank, signed checks to persons she trusted \u2014 to Mr. Renner, admittedly, and to Mr. Lare also, to judge by the appearance of Ms handwriting above her signature on a great many of her cancelled checks; that she had carried a blank, signed check in her purse at times shortly before her death; and that the alleged will had the physical appearance of an old, worn blank check on which a fresh, typewritten inscription had been impressed.\nJudge Milholland concluded that the alleged will was a forgery and that no jury verdict sustaining it could be permitted to stand. To reach this conclusion, he relied on the two ultimate findings just described \u2014 concerning the signature and the typewriting, plus a number of circumstances which were, without important exception, open to no dispute. In other words, to sustain a finding of forgery, it was not necessary to reject any significant testimony offered by Mr. Lare, except that of Mr. Lare himself.\nThus, since nobody else had access to the typewriter used to write the will, the Chancellor found that, if Mrs. Lare had not typewritten the document, it must have been the work of Mr. Lare. But if he typewrote it \u2014which followed from the finding of fact, discussed above, that Mrs. Lare did not \u2014 he was certainly guilty of perjury, and the alleged will was almost as certainly a forgery. Every other known circumstance of the case tended to corroborate that conclusion. Mr. Lare had the essential motive; his own testimony and his conduct at every stage of the matter showed that he desired greatly to obtain his wife\u2019s entire estate. He had the opportunity : it was conceded that his wife had not hesitated to carry and to issue checks bearing her signature, but otherwise in blank. The peculiarities of the instrument itself: those of its origin in the 1940 checkbook; those of its alleged discovery after Mrs. Lare\u2019s death; and those of Mr. Lare\u2019s attempts to maintain it, were all undisputed ; and they all pointed to the conclusion of forgery.\nThe Chancellor\u2019s findings of fact in this case have the quality and weight of the verdict of a jury.\nMr. Lare\u2019s argument implies that this Court can and should review the evidence and determine for itself whether the Chancellor\u2019s findings are correct or not. This is a wholly mistaken idea, for several reasons of which the first is based on a well-known rule of equity practice.\nIn Lowe\u2019s Estate, 318 Pa. 497, 178 A. 820, the decedent was an elderly woman, and the contestant her son. By an admittedly genuine will made in 1931, she had conferred many benefits on the son. After her death, a paper dated 1934 was produced and offered for probate as a later will. The son (who stood to lose much under the new instrument) contested probate, contending that it was a forgery, and also that, if it were genuine, the testatrix had lacked testamentary capacity, and had been subject to undue influence. There were conflicts in the evidence on all issues. For example, a number of lay and expert witnesses testified that the signature was not genuine; this being met by testimony of the same kind that it was genuine. The Chancellor found as facts that the testimony in favor of the alleged will was true, and the testimony against it therefore false; and refused contestant\u2019s request for an issue d.v.n. His findings were approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court en banc. This Court held that such findings of fact are conclusive here (Simpson, J., p. 501):\n\u201cOn the other two questions the hearing judge, later approved by the court in banc, said that, \u2018On consideration of all the testimony, we are of opinion that at the time she executed the will of January 13, 1934, testatrix Avas of sound mind and disposing memory, and it Ayas executed after mature deliberation and without any undue influence on the part of any one.\u2019 There was ample evidence to sustain this finding also, and hence it would probably be sufficient to say that it should be approved, because \u2018The findings of a chancellor (as the hearing judge is in such cases, if approved by the court in banc) are entitled to the weight of a jury\u2019s verdict, and, where supported by evidence, though in dispute, are controlling in the appellate court; and this is particularly so where (as here) the case depends on the testimony of witnesses, whose credibility must be weighed and passed upon\u2019 (Crick v. Paull, 287 Pa. 431; Phillips\u2019s Est., 244 Pa. 35, 47; Ligo v. Dodson, 301 Pa. 124, 130) ; especially if, also as here, the hearing judge saw and heard the witnesses, who testified for and against the views of the respective parties: Phillips\u2019s Est., 295 Pa. 349; Robb v. Stone, 296 Pa. 482; Karber v. Goldstrohm, 305 Pa. 470.\u201d\nIn Mohler\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 299, 22 A. 2d 680, the decedent was an elderly woman who made and signed a will at some time after she had been judicially declared a weak-minded person, and by which she gave her residuary estate to an employee of her legal guardian. After her death, it was contested by the beneficiaries of an earlier will, made prior to the period of her legal incompetency. In the Orphans\u2019 Court, the burden of proof of her testamentary capacity and of her freedom from undue influence was properly imposed upon the proponent. The evidence was in conflict. For example, the contestants produced the testimony of several physicians, which indicated that the testatrix had lacked the capacity to make a will. Nevertheless, the Chancellor found as facts, in an opinion affirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court en banc, that the testatrix had been mentally capable, and that the alleged will was valid; and refused an issue d.v.n. On appeal, this Court affirmed, saying (Maxey, J., p. 305) :\n\u201c. . . This burden the proponent of the will met to the satisfaction of the court below. That court declared that if an issue was awarded \u2018a verdict against the validity of the will could not be allowed to stand\u2019. This court has often said that \u2018in cases of this character, the findings of the chancellor supported by the court in banc must be considered just as binding on appellate courts as the verdict of a jury. Of course, if there is no evidence to support them or if it appears from the record that there is a capricious disbelief of evidence then the findings are worthless\u2019: Pusey\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 248, 184 A. 844.\u201d (Former italics added.)\nPusey\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 248, 184 A. 844, differed from the two cases just cited, in that the appellants failed to request an issue d.v.n. until after the hearing Judge had entered a decision against them, holding that the testator in the alleged will (of which they were proponents) had lacked testamentary capacity and had been the victim of fraud and undue influence. In this Court, they urged, nevertheless, that the Orphans\u2019 Court had been bound to grant an issue. This Court affirmed the Orphans\u2019 Court, saying (Kephart, J., p. 260) :\n\u201cAt the outset of this case we are confronted by a rule of this court which has the effect of a rule of law. We will not retry this case. The question for us to consider is, first, whether there is evidence to support the findings of fact and whether the findings of fact support the decree. The court below and the court in banc made a thorough review of all the evidence and arrived at certain findings. If the evidence supports the findings and the findings in turn justify the decree, the decree will not be set aside: Kahle\u2019s Est., 307 Pa. 212; Phila. & Reading C. & I. Co. v. Directors of the Poor, 311 Pa. 236; Dible\u2019s Est., 316 Pa. 553; Taylor\u2019s Est., 316 Pa. 557; Lowe\u2019s Est., 318 Pa. 497.\u201d\n(p. 261) :\n\u201cIt must be thoroughly understood that, in cases of this character, the findings of the chancellor supported by the court in banc must be considered just as binding on appellate courts as the verdict of a jury.\u201d\n(p. 267) :\n\u201cIt is argued that the court should have awarded an issue and it was in error in stating it had no power to award one. The matter is governed by the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, section 21(a) and (b). The court had power to award an issue if it were expedient to do so. See Gross\u2019s Est., 278 Pa. 170. In denying itself this power the court committed no error prejudicial to appellants. Counsel had opportunity to request that an issue be awarded if it desired one. If the court had refused an issue d.v.n., the question for us would have been limited to determining whether this was an abuse of discretion [italics added]. See Dible\u2019s Est., 316 Pa. 553; In re Doster\u2019s Est., 271 Pa. 68; In re Mark\u2019s Est., 298 Pa. 285; In re Fink\u2019s Est., 310 Pa. 453.\u201d\nThis Court will reverse a decision refusing an issue d.v.n. only if it appears that the chancellor has been guilty of an abuse of judicial discretion.\nJudge Milholland's findings of fact are conclusive in this Court, if they be supported by substantial evidence \u2014 the effect of the presence of conflicting evidence will shortly be considered. Under a closely related rule, this Court treats with equal respect the conclusions of the Chancellor from the evidence; and will reverse a decision denying an issue d.v.n. only if it appears that the Chancellor has committed an abuse of judicial discretion, by capricious refusal to pay attention to the evidence, by the application of some improper conception of the law, or in some other recognized way.\nIn Noble\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 490, 13 A. 2d 422, an elderly, retired widower made a will, shortly before his death, by which he gave his residuary estate to a young man, not a relative, who probably stood in a confidential relationship to him and who was scrivener of the Avill. The will Avas contested on the grounds of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence. The Chancellor refused an issue d.v.n. On appeal, this Court said (Linn, J., p. 491-492):\n\u201cThis is not a common law action. In Tetlow\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 486, 494, 112 A. 758, we said: \u2018It is the established law of Pennsylvania that, in cases of the character of the one noAV before us, the judge is vested with power to decide whether or not he shall submit oral evidence to the jury, even though it be conflicting.\u2019 . . . In Dible\u2019s Estate, 316 Pa. 553, 554, 175 A. 538, the rule was stated to be: \u2018We have repeatedly held that in reviewing a chancellor\u2019s refusal of an issue devisavit vel non the question for the appellate court to decide is not whether it would have reached the same result had it been acting as chancellor, but rather whether a judicial mind, on due consideration of the evidence as a whole, could reasonably have reached the conclusion of the chancellor: Tetlow\u2019s Est., 269 Pa. 486; Fink\u2019s Est., 310 Pa. 453. As we said in Tetlow\u2019s Estate, \u201cWhen the answer to this question is in the affirmative, the judgment appealed from will not be disturbed.\u201d In other words, the chancellor\u2019s decision will not be reversed unless an abuse of discretion on Ms part appears [Italics added] : Doster's Est., 271 Pa. 68; Mark\u2019s Est., 298 Pa. 285; Fink\u2019s Est., supra.\u2019 \u201d\nThe same rule is stated in similar language in numerous other cases. Among them: Morris Will, 349 Pa. 387, 37 A. 2d 506 (Patterson, J.): Kish v. Bakaysa, 330 Pa. 533, 199 A. 321 (Drew, J.); Pusey\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 248, 184 A. 844 (Kephart, J.); Fink\u2019s Estate, 310 Pa. 453, 165 A. 832 (Frazer, J.); Mark\u2019s Estate, 298 Pa. 285, 148 A. 297 (Frazer, J.); Doster\u2019s Estate, 271 Pa. 68, 113 A. 831 (Kephart, J.).\nThe existence of conflicts in the evidence, even on controlling issues, does not create such a substantial dispute as requires that an issue d.v.n. be granted.\nIt has been observed that, although Mr. Lare now contends that this case presented a \u201csubstantial dispute\u201d, such as would require the granting of an issue d.v.n., there is really no conflict or dispute about the evidence which supports the controlling findings of fact and the controlling conclusions of the Chancellor. Mr. Lare can point to no fact of controlling importance, except the fact that the signature on the alleged will is probably the handwriting of Mrs. Lare \u2014 which is true, Avith the qualification that it must have been written in 1940, or almost two years before the date which appears on the instrument.\nThis absence of any real conflict of evidence on any really important point of fact in the case is, however, not of any great legal importance on this appeal; for even if conflict of evidence did exist here, the decision of the court below would still be affirmed, in the absence of an abuse of discretion on the part of that court. The existence of conflicts in the evidence does not create a \u201csubstantial dispute\u201d, unless the Chancellor finds \u2014 or unless a conscientious Judge would be bound to find\u2014 that the credible evidence is so evenly distributed between the adverse parties that he would be obliged to approve a verdict for either party. In other words, if the Chancellor finds no difficulty in determining what evidence is credible and what is not, and therefore encounters no difficulty in finding the essential facts, he is bound to refuse an issue. This is the rule in Caughey v. Bridenbaugh, 208 Pa. 414, 57 A. 821, and in Phillips Estate, supra, two cases which have been cited in countless later decisions, and which will be mentioned again in this opinion.\nBefore discussing the cases in which serious conflicts of evidence have been presented, it should be pointed out that there is an important distinction between the status of an alleged will in a forgery contest and that of a document, genuinely executed, but attacked on other grounds. It is this: that if the signature and physical integrity of a will are not in dispute, those facts alone raise a strong presumption that the will is valid; whereas, in contrast, there is no presumption in a forgery contest that the alleged will is genuine.\nIn Cressman Estate, 346 Pa. 400, 31 A. 2d 109, a widower, almost eighty years old, made a will about a month before his second marriage, by which he gave a small portion of his estate to his fiancee and the rest to the children of his first marriage. A year later, on his deathbed \u2014 and less than a month before his death \u2014 he made a new will by which he gave substantially the entire estate to the second wife. It was written by an attorney, in the testator\u2019s bedroom, in the presence of the second wife and no other person. The will was executed later by witnesses whom she had procured for the purpose. Less than four weeks later, the testator died. The alleged will was contested on the grounds that he had lacked testamentary capacity and had been subject to undue influence. The Orphans\u2019 Court disbelieved evidence offered to show the exercise of undue influence, sustained the will and refused an issue d.v.n. This Court affirmed, saying (Maxey, J., p. 404) : \u201c. . . \u2018Where a will was properly executed in every particular, a presumption of testamentary capacity and lack of undue influence arises, compelling evidence to upset the will . . \u2014and holding that it requires clear and substantial proof, in contests charging lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence, to meet and overcome this presumption.\nBecause of this presumption, the fact that a will is admittedly the act of the testator \u2014 that it is not a forgery, is nearly always (but not invariably) sufficient to entitle its proponents to an issue at least, if not to an Orphans\u2019 Court decree sustaining it without any trial by jury. But there is no such presumption where the issue is forgery. In other words, there is no presumption that the instrument involved here is the genuine act of Mrs. Lare. The burden of proving its genuineness rested upon the proponent, Mr. Lare, at the beginning of the hearing in the Orphans\u2019 Court; and, for the same reason, his right to call upon this Court to award him an issue must depend wholly on the strength of the case he presented in the court below, under all of the evidence: he has no presumption to support him, as he would were the contest based on the other grounds.\nIn Lowe\u2019s Estate, which has been cited above, this Court said (Simpson, J., p. 502) :\n\u201c \u2018In a will contest the judge sits as a chancellor, and must consider all the evidence; and the question is not whether a part of the evidence, standing alone, would support a certain verdict, but whether it would if considered as a whole. The right to an issue under the statute, depends upon whether there is a substantial dispute upon a material matter of fact, and, unless there is, the proponent is no more entitled to an issue on the question of forgery than is the contestant on a question of testamentary capacity. The statute does not confine the dispute to any particular question\u2019: Fleming\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 399. (Italics added.)\n\u201cIn such cases a chancellor \u2018cannot permit a jury to do what he, as a chancellor, would not do\u2019: Central Trust Co. v. Boyer, 308 Pa. 402.\u201d The language italicized appeared originally in Fleming\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 399, 109 A. 265. It was quoted also in Wagner\u2019s Estate, 289 Pa. 361, 137 A. 616, (Sadler, J.).\nContestants have cited in their brief three of the four decisions in which this Court has passed upon the precise question presented here: where, that is, an Orphans\u2019 Court has denounced a will as a forgery and refused the request of its proponent for an issue d.v.n.; and the proponent has appealed. These three cases are: Kane\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 531, 168 A. 681; Fleming\u2019s Estate, supra; McAndrew\u2019s Estate, 206 Pa. 366, 55 A. 1040. The fourth such case is Culbertson\u2019s Estate, 301 Pa. 438, 152 A. 540, which will shortly be discussed.\nIn all of these cases, the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court was affirmed. And, what is important here, the evidence in all four eases created disputes of fact of considerably more difficulty and legal substance than any which appear in this case.\nThus, in Kane\u2019s Estate, supra, the signature on the alleged will was admitted. The genuineness of the document established by the testimony of two subscribing witnesses, by expert testimony, by the testimony of the alleged scrivener, and by unquestioned evidence that the testatrix \u2014 a widow without close relative \u2014 had been on the most intimate terms with the principal beneficiary. Probate of the alleged instrument was, however, set aside and proponent\u2019s request for an issue denied, because there was physical evidence \u2014 -which the chancellor accepted, although its effect was disputed \u2014 that the original first page of the two-page typewritten instrument had been removed, and another page substituted for it; and \u2014 more particularly, because there was strong evidence that the proponent had indulged in acts of suppression and fabrication of evidence.\nIn spite of the substantial conflicts in the evidence, and although the proponents were able to explain the suspicious circumstances to an extent far greater than Mr. Lare has been able to explain those of this case, this Court affirmed the Chancellor\u2019s decision, holding the document a forgery and refusing its proponent an issue.\nKane\u2019s Estate, supra, settled the principle relied upon by the court below in this case: that even the presence of an admittedly genuine signature on an alleged will is insufficient to justify or require that an issue be granted, if tbe contestants offer circumstantial evidence sufficient to satisfy the conscience of tbe Chancellor that tbe instrument \u2014 considered as a whole \u2014 is a forgery.\nIn Fleming\u2019s Estate, supra, it was tbe signature which was held bad; but tbe case settled tbe underlying principle; that circumstantial evidence of forgery may justify tbe refusal of an issue, even though tbe facts be genuinely contested in tbe evidence. Tbe genuineness of tbe signature of the alleged will was verified by tbe testimony of one subscribing witness; by tbe relatives of two other subscribing witnesses; by that of a.recognized expert; and by that of a large number of highly respectable people \u2014 bankers, lawyers and businessmen. However, circumstantial evidence showed that tbe document was a forgery: tbe signature was an exact duplicate and evidently a tracing from tbe testator\u2019s genuine signature on a receipt which was in evidence; and tbe proponents\u2019 alleged discovery of tbe will and their conduct of tbe matter (like those of Mr. Lare) were peculiar and suspicious. Tbe Orphans\u2019 Court rejected tbe evidence in favor of tbe alleged will; held it a forgery; and refused proponents\u2019 request for an issue. This Court affirmed.\nIn Me Andrew\u2019s Estate supra, tbe situation was very much tbe same. Tbe genuineness of tbe signature of tbe alleged will was attested by a subscribing witness, and supported by other testimony concerning tbe preparation, custody and discovery of tbe paper. However, tbe conduct of tbe proponent was suspicious; bis credibility was impeached; and it was shown that tbe subscribing witness, although an honest woman, bad not known tbe decedent, and that tbe account of tbe discovery of tbe will was improbable. Tbe Orphans\u2019 Court refused proponent\u2019s request for an issue; and this Court affirmed.\nIn Culbertson\u2019s Estate, supra, tbe same rule was applied, although tbe complexity of tbe facts may obscure its part in the decision. Testatrix was an elderly widow, who was survived by a number of children. Sometime after her death, two of her sons \u2014 Augustus and James\u2014 produced and secured probate of a paper which appeared to be her will, signed by her mark, and to bequeath the larger part of her large estate to James. Twelve years later, a fight between the brothers ended when both were taken to the police station; where Augustus declared that the will was a forgery, which he had manufactured in conspiracy with James.\nThis led to a contest between James, as proponent of the paper, and his brothers and sisters as contestants. In the Orphans\u2019 Court, Augustus repeated his assertion \u2014or confession \u2014 that he had written the will in his own hand and forged the signatures of the subscribing witnesses, after his mother\u2019s death, at James\u2019 instigation. James contradicted this; and offered lay and expert evidence of genuineness. So far, the case required\u2014 principally \u2014 a choice between the testimony of a self-confessed forger and that of an apparently honest man ; but the circumstantial evidence favored a conclusion of forgery. James\u2019 account of the discovery of the will was suspicious \u2014 it was almost exactly like Mr. Lare\u2019s account of the discovery of the alleged will here; and the Culbertson will, if genuine and properly dated, had appointed as executor a twelve-year-old-boy. The Chancellor ( Gest, J.) held the paper a forgery, set the will aside, and refused proponent\u2019s request for an issue; and the appeal to this Court followed.\nThen the case took a turn which shows the importance and weight of the rule concerning circumstantial evidence, established in Fleming\u2019s Estate. While the appeal was pending, the proponent, James, obtained leave to reopen the hearing in the Orphans\u2019 Court; and at the reopened hearing offered the testimony of a respectable lawyer that, although he had no recollection of its preparation or final disposition, the body of the alleged will was in his handwriting. This testimony, which the Chancellor did not doubt, showed that Augustus\u2019 claim of his authorship or forgery of the paper \u2014 the only direct evidence of its forgery \u2014 must be false in large part. In spite of that, the circumstantial evidence of forgery, though much less forceful or conclusive than that available here, was still sufficient to convince the Chancellor. The Orphans\u2019 Court accordingly reaffirmed its original decision refusing an issue; and this Court affirmed that decision, saying (Sadler, J., p. 443):\n\u201cThe parties were personally heard by Judge Gest, and his findings of fact, attesting the truth of the statements heretofore set forth, approved by the court in banc, fully cover the contentions raised by the respective parties. It is needless, in passing upon the merits of the case, to refer to the unbroken line of authorities which hold that the facts as determined by the orphans\u2019 court are conclusive upon us where based upon sufficient evidence, and an examination of the record shows those made here to have been fully justified.\u201d\nIn each of these four forgery cases, the Chancellor was required to decide bitterly contested issues of fact, from evidence containing conflicts far more substantial and difficult \u2014 and much less one-sided \u2014 than those presented by this record. In each of the four, the Chancellor was, nevertheless, convinced by the evidence that no verdict of genuineness could be a true verdict, and being so convinced he rejected the proponent\u2019s evidence, refused proponent an issue, and set aside the alleged will. This method of treating such cases simply applied the rule in Caughey v. Bridenbaugh, supra, and Phillips Estate, supra; and, when we affirmed the Orphans\u2019 Courts, in all four cases, this Court simply applied that rule, and the related rules which have been discussed.\nDeLaurentiis' Estate, 323 Pa. 70, 186 A. 359, cited by the majority, in no way conflicts with the views I have here expressed. There the court below refused an issue and we reversed on the ground that there was a breach of judicial discretion, because the evidence showed that no Chancellor conscientiously could have found that there was not a substantial dispute. Here, however, the manifest weight of the evidence clearly shows that the purported will is a forgery and the Chancellor properly so found. No judicial mind, in my judgment, could have reached any other conclusion. His findings are overwhelmingly supported by the evidence and therefore should be binding on this Court.\nThere is nothing in our cases which cast any doubt upon the two rules of law I have defined and illustrated; first, that a Chancellor is required to grant an issue d.v.n. only if after a conscientious study of the evidence as a whole he is not certain of the truth of matters in controversy; and that he can and should refuse an issue and decide the case, if the evidence, considered as a whole, has convinced him that one side of the case is right and the other wrong; and, secondly, the rule that this Court will not, in such a case as this, overrule or reject any finding or conclusion of fact, or reverse any decree, which has been based by an Orphans\u2019 Court Judge upon a conscionable, lawful appraisal of the competent evidence.\nIn this case, there is no substantial conflict or dispute about the evidence required to sustain Judge Mil-i-iolland\u2019s essential findings that the signature on the alleged will was not written in January, 1942; that the typewriting cannot have been the work of Mrs. Lare; and that the physical characteristics of the paper and the other relevant circumstances, shown by the evidence, all indicate that the document is a forgery.\nSince such findings of fact will not be reviewed in this Court, and since in law they justify the refusal of an issue d.v.n. the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court should be affirmed.\nIn Phillips Estate, 244 Pa. 35, 90 A. 457, a leading ease, this Court said (Moschzisker, J., p. 42) : \u201c. . . The \u2018absolute right of the parties\u2019 to a trial by jury depends upon \u2018the strength of their evidence,\u2019 and to determine that, on an application for an issue, the Orphans\u2019 Court must hear and weigh the proofs as a whole.\u201d\nIn Brennan\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 335, 168 A. 25, the alleged will was made by an elderly woman who had been judicially declared insane. It was contested on the grounds of lack of testamentary capacity. The contestant\u2019s request for an issue d. v. n. was denied; and this Court affirmed. It appeared that the contestant had made some efforts to forge a will, and to buy favorable testimony. This Court said (Kephabt, J., p. 342) : \u201c. . . This evidence was not impeached on cross-examination, and was denied by appellant only. It is scarcely necessary to comment on the effect of this testimony on contestant\u2019s credibility as well as on the good faith of this proceeding. Such' conduct may entirely destroy what might otherwise be a strong ease.\u201d",
