        "text": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff complains that his amended bill was dismissed on preliminary objections filed by both defendants : Equity Rules 48 and 49. The defendants are \u201cMorris Augenblick, individually, and as executor of the Estate of Jacob Augenblick, otherwise known as Jack Augenblick\u201d and Edward K. Tryon Co., a corporation.\nProm the bill and the amendment, we gather (1) that plaintiff and his wife, for his account, \u201cadvanced\u201d money to Jacob Augenblick, defendant\u2019s testator, to enable Augenblick to engage in stock speculation for the equal benefit of, plaintiff and Augenblick; (2) that Augenblick had applied for or had obtained a patent for an invention of fishing tackle and, on September 21, 1938, after the joint stock speculation had been going on for some time, discharged his obligation to plaintiff to repay the \u201cadvances\u201d made for speculation, by agreeing to pay him \u201cone-half of any net proceeds that [Augenblick] received from the earnings\u201d of the patent; (3) after Augenblick\u2019s death, his executor sold the fishing tackle business and the patent to Edward K. Tryon Co. for $3,000, which plaintiff alleges to be an inadequate price.\nAugenbliek died February 1, 1944. His estate is being administered by Ms executor. The plaintiff prays for a receiver for a partnership and for an accounting but there is no averment of facts that would support a finding that a partnership had existed: compare Kirshon v. Friedman, 349 Pa. 171, 36 A. 2d 647. If the executor committed a devastavit, as the plaintiff alleges, he may complain to the Orphans\u2019 Court which has jurisdiction of the executor\u2019s administration: Mauser v. Mauser, 326 Pa. 257, 192 A. 137; Slagle\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 552, 7 A. 2d 353; Real Estate Savings, etc., Co. v. Lewis, 340 Pa. 86, 16 A. 2d 13; Landis v. Landis, 343 Pa. 252, 22 A. 2d 908. While a creditor may proceed in the common pleas in a proper case to establish the amount of his claim, he must aver it. Other objections need not be referred to.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.",
