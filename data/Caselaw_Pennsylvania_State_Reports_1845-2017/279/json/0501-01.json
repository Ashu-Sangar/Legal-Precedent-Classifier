        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Kephart,\nGrubnau Brothers were depositors in appellant\u2019s bank. Healey, plaintiff\u2019s employee, forged two checks, using his employer\u2019s name: one on this appellant, the Centennial National Bank, for $4,000, the other on the Corn Exchange National Bank for $1,200. Both checks were paid. When the books were balanced and the forgeries discovered, the banks were duly notified. Grubnau Brothers carried insurance with the \u00bfEtna Casualty & Surety Company in the sum of $5,000 for loss arising from the misconduct of their employees. Claim was made against the Surety Company for loss for embezzlement under the policy. The \u00bfEtna Company paid the full amount of the policy, $5,000, in turn taking an assignment of all Grubnau Brothers\u2019 claims against the banks. It brought this suit as use-plaintiff against the appellant, naming Grubnaii Brothers as plaintiff. Judgment was recovered in the court below, from which this appeal has been taken.\nThe case was left to the jury on the single issue of forgery, and decided against appellant. The court below overruled the other contentions, which may be stated thus: first, Grubnau Brothers had recourse against two persons to recover loss and as it could only be made whole, the extent of recovery from one must be accounted for in an action against the other; second, having elected to collect from the surety company for embezzlement, thereby adopting the forger\u2019s act, and treating the money secured by him as Grubnau\u2019s money, by so doing Grubnau Brothers invoked one of two inconsistent remedies, and it, with its assignees, cannot now proceed against the bank on the other remedy, both plaintiffs being barred from any further action; third, the equities of the bank are superior to those of the insurance company.\nIt is stated in Howes v. Scott, 224 Pa. 7, 12, and restated in Stern Mfg. Co. v. Geo. W. Smith & Co., 273 Pa. 39, 41: \u201cThe right to maintain this action does not depend upon the interest which the use-plaintiff may have in the result. It depends solely upon whether the legal plaintiff has a cause of action against the defendant. If he cannot maintain the action, the use-plaintiff cannot do so.\u201d See also Blue Star Navigation Co. v. Emmons Coal Mining Corporation, 276 Pa. 352. The bank received plaintiff\u2019s money for deposit, which it was under contract to return when called for. In honoring the forged check it used its own money, not the depositor\u2019s, Grubnau\u2019s. The insurance company indemnified the legal plaintiff against misconduct of its agents. Grubnau\u2019s legal status was not that of the holder of a claim against two indemnitors, where payment of damages by the one may be offset in a suit against the other. It was a claim against, first, an insurer; second, a company refusing to pay money in violation of the terms of its contract. The remedies cannot surely be considered in the same right. The insurance was not in ease of the bank\u2019s mistake. It would be a novel proposition to hold that an insurance contract could reach out to indemnify a stranger, in no way a party to the insurance, whose wrongful act caused the insurance company to pay loss to the insured which would not have occurred but for the wrongful act. Such protection would be given without cost or contractual relation,, merely because the person wronged chooses to collect from the insurance company first, rather than the bank which afterwards disputed the claim on this and other grounds connected with the forged check.\nAs to Grubnau\u2019s deposit, the wrongdoer was the bank in placing and maintaining a forged check as a credit against Grubnau\u2019s account. Whatever may have been the legal relations between the insurance company and Grubnau, they did not affect the debt owed by the bank to its depositor. The use-plaintiff, the insurance company, is now suing on an assignment of that debt or right in the legal plaintiff to collect from the bank its deposit. While ordinarily a double recovery for the same loss should not be permitted (and here it is not), the claim under which such rule is enforced must be in the same right, \u2014 so interrelated that a recovery from the one affects a hardship on the other which would not occur except for the recovery. No hardship was occasioned the bank by the insurance company paying. It has in its possession $4,000 of Grubnau\u2019s money; it ought not to be a hardship to give it back.\nIt is urged, the charge of forgery involved the assertion of an inconsistent remedy. But a criminal action such as that cannot be so held in a civil action where, for the purpose of recovering money, or as relating to the claim against the bank, a suit similar to the one under consideration is brought. Nor would a demand on the insurance company, based on the charge of embezzlement, have that effect; neither, in law, would estop plaintiff from asserting his right under contract with the bank. Until the present one was entered, no suit had been brought testing that right.\nAs to the negotiation for settlement of the claim between Grubnau and the insurance company, and regardless of how they may have viewed the forgery or the money procured from the banks, it is sufficient, in final settlement, that the insurance company took a straight assignment of the legal plaintiff\u2019s claim against the bank. The parties, by so doing, regarded the money obtained through the forged instrument as the property of the bank. They thus repudiated ratification of the forgery and its adoption by the legal plaintiff, if such thing were possible, and nothing in their conduct precluded this action.\nIndeed, so far as the bank is concerned, we do not understand how it would be in a position to hinder Grubnau from following both remedies, regardless of supposed inconsistency of demand; nor are we sure the policy does not cover the precise misconduct here practiced. Had the insurance company permitted plaintiff to use both remedies, assuredly the bank could not have complained. If the insurance company had presented the money to Grubnau as a gift because of Healey\u2019s act, the bank could not have taken advantage of it. If there was an election to be made, the insurance company was to make it. Instead of sending the parties to court to establish loss, it took over what might have been a debatable claim through purchase and assignment. The rights are not inconsistent, in that they are of the same quality or cover the same subject-matter. A mere statement of the facts shows this: National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Mellon National Bank, 276 Pa. 212. What has been stated disposes of the question of mitigation of damages.\nNor is it a case of subrogation, wherein the equities of the bank may be said to exceed those of the insurer. Any person could have purchased the depositor\u2019s right against the bank, and there was no reason why the insurance company should not do so. The court below was clearly right in directing judgment to be entered for appellee.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Where a bank pays a check forged by a depositor\u2019s employee, and the depositor is paid the amount thereof by the surety on the employee\u2019s bond, whereupon the depositor assigns his claim against the bank to the surety, the surety may recover in an action brought in the name of the depositor to the use of the surety, against the bank, the amount of the deposit wrongly paid.\n2. In such case the bank, when it honored the forged check, used its own money and not that of his depositor.\n3. The remedies of the depositor against the surety and the bank were not in the same right.\n4. The bank cannot allege that, as the depositor had recourse against two persons from whom to recover the loss, and as it could only be made whole, the extent of the recovery from one must be accounted for in an action against the other.\n5. Nor can the bank allege that, as the depositor had elected to collect the money from the surety for the embezzlement of the depositor\u2019s money, it invoked one of two inconsistent remedies, and that therefore both it and its assignee are barred from any further action.\n6.
