Its practice in buying was to apply to the <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>J. H. Huston Co., a representative of the Refining Company, which here sues, and the former, as selling agent of the latter, had the orders forwarded, accepted, and filled. In three instances, between July 1 and July 15, 1920, — there being at the time difficulty in securing an adequate supply, — the broker made reservations of a number of barrels for subsequent delivery to the defendant. The allotments were evidenced by a writing, not signed by the purchaser, in which the price was fixed on the basis of the value of granulated, and, for other grades, a variable rate was chargeable, though the controlling differential was not expressly set forth therein. This paper, upon its face, showed the merchandise to be “sold by J. H. Huston Co., Inc.,” and a copy was furnished to both plaintiff and defendant. The same form was used as referred to in Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v.

The two remaining involved 225 barrels, and a refusal to accept, with a consequent loss to the plaintiff, was charged. The affidavit of defense interposed was held insufficient, and judgment entered for plaintiff, but, on appeal, it was reversed: Franklin Sugar Ref. Co. v.

A verdict for plaintiff was directed for the full amount claimed. Judgment was entered, and from it this appeal is taken, it being contended here that section 4 of the Sales Act of May 19, 1915, P. L. 543, bars a recovery. It provides: “A contract to sell or a sale of any goods or choses in action of the value of five hundred dollars or upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the buyer shall accept part of the goods or choses in action so contracted to be sold or sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in part payment, or unless some note or memorandum in writing of the contract or sale be signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf.” Admittedly, there was no partial delivery or payment on account to take the case without the statute, but plaintiff insists there was a writing signed by the defendant which effected this result and that its requirements were sufficiently met by the proof offered.</p>

Kane Milling Co., <a href="/pa/278/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="278 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1080608" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0105-01">278 Pa. 105</a>, in which the same question was considered, and an opposite view held.

If, therefore, a recovery can now be had against defendant, some other writing must appear, by which it is. made evident the party to be charged agreed to purchase on the terms named in the <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>paper signed, by Huston &amp; Co., and on which the present action is based.</p>

It is true, correspondence by which it is referred to may be sufficient, even though accompanied by a disclaimer of responsibility, but, in such case, the fact that an agreement was consummated must clearly appear, its terms be recognized (27 C.

It may be noted these essential requirements were present in Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v.

    <p id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[313,953,1151,1076]]]'>Looking at the letters set forth above, we find a writing admitting the fact that sugar had been reserved for the proposed vendee, but no assumption of any liability to receive the amount specified, or any part thereof, or a fixed agreement on terms of payment, if there were any deliveries. In the communication of plaintiff, dated August 4th, reference is made to the “contracts,” and, in reply, defendant used the same word, but did not promise to carry out the alleged understanding, or acknowledge any had been entered into. On the contrary, any such thought was negatived when it stated an intention to take five barrels “every time we buy.” This is not a ratification, by the party to be charged, of a purchase of the full number named in the Huston orders, at the prices therein fixed. There is no admission of the completion of an agreement as now insisted on, — at most it was a promise to the vendor to purchase sugar from it to an amount not exceeding 225 barrels,— and this being so, the writing cannot be said to satisfy the statute, and hence is not enforceable.</p>
    <p id="b132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[307,2040,1154,369]],["BL_133.1",133,[98,341,1158,746]]]'>Having reached this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to consider the second proposition presented in the court below and argued here. An effort was made in this instance to meet the difficulties indicated in the Howell and Kane Milling Company Cases, above referred to, arising from the lack of clearness in the statement of the price as designated in the allotment order. Evidence <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>was offered to establish the trade meaning of the term used, and to explain the understood effect of the language employed, by proving a custom to apply fixed differentials to the base named, so that the cost of each grade of sugar could be determined. A discussion of the law controlling, under such circumstances, will be found in the opinions of this court, to which attention has already been called, and the thoughts therein expressed need not be repeated or elaborated. It may be observed, however, that when such evidence was produced, depending, as it did here, on oral testimony, the question became one for the jury, and binding instructions could not be given, though the defendant presented no witnesses to contradict the assertions made.</p>
