Domachowski, a minor, filed its bill to secure the cancelling and setting aside of a lease and a contract made by the minor for the purchase of a moving picture theater and the repayment, with interest, of the amount paid defendant by the minor. The court below found that in response to an advertisement in a daily newspaper Domachowski, a boy eighteen years of age, called upon defendant’s agent who informed him, in substance, that the theater had a seating capacity of 450, contained a pipe organ costing $7,250, picture machines, electric fans, chairs and all equipment necessary for operating a moving picture theater and that the business returned between $150 and $250 “clear money” each week. The price named was $10,000; payable, $500 hand money, $6,500 on taking possession of the property and the balance in monthly installments of $300 each. Relying upon these representations the minor executed two agreements, one a bailment contract for the purchase of the moving picture theater equipment on the terms above set forth and the other a lease for the premises for the term of seven years at the monthly rental of $100. The court further found that the representations made by defendant’s agent as to the cost of the organ and the amount of the receipts and profits of the theater were false, and directed that both contracts signed by the minor be cancelled and that defendant return to plaintiff, as guardian, the amounts paid, with interest, together with loss <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>sustained while operating the theater, in all aggregating $9,649.80. On plaintiff’s appointment as guardian for Domachowski on May 7, 1921, it tendered to defendant the keys of the theater, assignment of the two contracts and demanded a return of the money paid by its ward, with interest, and also damages to the extent of the loss sustained by the minor while operating the theater. On refusal of defendant to accept the keys and return the money, the bill in this case was filed and from a decree in plaintiff’s favor this appeal follows.</p>
