Much testimony was then produced by appellant, who is decedent’s only daughter, and by proponents. In a masterly opinion, the trial judge reviewed it fully, and advised a dismissal of the petition for an issue devisavit vel non: (1st) Because appellant was estopped from making the contest, since she had received from decedent much money and property (which she still retains, and has not offered to return) during the very period in which she now alleges he was wholly incompetent and without lucid intervals; and (2d) Because, in any event, a verdict against the will could not be sustained, since the evidence overwhelmingly establishes the fact that decedent was fully competent. The court in banc adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the trial judge, and decreed a dismissal of the petition; from this the daughter now brings her present appeal.</p>
    <p id="b87-8" data-blocks='[["BL_87.12",87,[62,2200,1152,206]],["BL_88.1",88,[329,352,1154,532]]]'>We do not deem it necessary to review the decision on the question of estoppel, as we are all clearly of opinion there is no room for doubt as to testator’s competency. In considering this latter point, we shall <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>quote, so far as may be, the basic facts, as found by the trial judge, instead of restating them in our own language, since the exceptions and argument challenge only the ultimate conclusions of fact, which cover the entire case; the contest, as now made, being over the alleged failure to give full effect, at this stage of the case, to the reported findings. We have read, however, the entire 1,438 pages of evidence, some of it several times, and see no reason to change any of the court’s conclusions regarding the second ground for its decision.</p>
    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[329,895,1153,963]]]'>At the outset we are again faced with the perennial contention that because the imperative “shall,” appears in section 21 (b) of the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, 382, an issue must be awarded, if there is any evidence upon which a jury, sitting as at common law, could find a verdict against the will. A jury is not, however, the only arbiter of the facts in this class of cases, and for nearly a century we have consistently so held. It suffices to refer to Phillips’ Est., <a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>; Tetlow’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="269 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1063497" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0486-01">269 Pa. 486</a>, and Doster’s Est., <a href="/pa/271/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="271 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="295637" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0068-01">271 Pa. 68</a>. While there is ample authority for the proposition that, if contestant’s evidence makes out a case for the jury, an issue should be awarded, unless proponent’s is so strong as to render it clear that, in conscience, a verdict against the will could not be sustained; yet it is the chancellor’s conscience, and not a jury’s which is to be satisfied in the first instance. When his enlightened conscience stands in the way of an issue, it should never be awarded.</p>
    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[328,1867,1153,540]],["BL_89.1",89,[86,359,1154,744]]]'>In the instant case it is not claimed that testator was unduly influenced in making his will, or was imposed upon by any one; it is only alleged that he lacked testamentary capacity. This materially limits the scope of the inquiry, for “no very great share of reason is necessary to validate a will, where there is no fraud or imposition”: Heister v. Lynch, <a href="/yeates/1/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="1 Yeates 108" data-case-ids="6772138" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0107-01">1 Yeates 108</a>, 114. Furthermore, there is here no attack upon the integrity or capacity of the two lawyers who drew the will and codicil, nor on the honesty of the survivor, when he says <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>testator was not only competent when he executed those papers, but also fully understood what he was doing at the numerous consultations during their preparation. The will is long, and to some extent involved; it names certain friends, relatives, charities and faithful employees whom testator wished to and did reward by legacies; it sets forth of what his estate consisted; refers to his business, and how in detail he wished it conducted after his death; and how the trustees were to manage his estate until the termination of the trust, which was to continue during “the life of my said son and daughter, and not exceeding twenty years thereafter,” unless the “executors shall find [it] practicable to make an earlier distribution.”</p>
    <p id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[86,1124,1165,1289]]]'>Assuming the truth of the unchallenged testimony of. the subscribing witnesses, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find another testamentary disposition, which, within itself, tends more clearly to show that the testator must have had “a full and intelligent knowledge of the act he is engaged in, a full knowledge of the property ha possesses, an intelligent perception and understanding of the disposition he desires to make of it, and of the persons and objects he desires shall be the recipients of his bounty,” — the test fixed by the law for determining the validity of a will, even when attacked on the ground of undue influence as well as that of lack of testamentary capacity: Wilson v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa/101/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="101 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="500898" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0495-01">101 Pa. 495</a>, 502. Apparently, appellant’s only objection to the present will grows out of the fact that her equal share of the estate is left in trust, while those of her mother and brother are given absolutely. This, however, is a very common provision for a daughter; and is, moreover, exactly the course which testator had pursued, when he made distributions during his lifetime, because it was the method he had determined to follow ever since she was a little girl; and to this manner of disposition he always adhered, despite the repeated solicitations of herself and her counsel.</p>

The petition filed for this purpose sets forth thirty-five particulars, in which it is averred appellant has “assumed to decide for herself, the meaning, force and materiality of certain portions of the evidence, and, contrary to the rules of the court and the statute [Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 279], has, in printing the record, misdescribed, abridged, garbled and misstated the same.” The answer of appellant denies most of these averments, and particularly the final one, but it admits she made no attempt to comply with Eule 55, so far as relates to certain of the exhibits offered at the trial, stating they “were not printed in full in this record [because they] contained much matter which is not necessary for a proper consideration of this cause; the printing of all of their contents would have been burdensome and very expensive; and, if they had been printed in full, much time would have been required to cull from them such facts as may be supposed to be material here.”</p>
    <p id="b105-6" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[97,1982,1154,424]],["BL_106.1",106,[307,341,1150,857]]]'>These averments of the answer may be, and probably are, true; but it must be clear, beyond all controversy, that contestant had no right to decide for herself how much “is not necessary for a proper consideration of this causé,” much less to fail to print the whole of any exhibit, because, in her opinion, only some part of it is material. If this right were accorded to an appellant, he could, in this class of cases, for instance, omit all <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>countervailing evidence, because in Ms opinion, the “shall” in the Wills Act, necessarily determines that only such evidence as tends to make out a prima facie case in his favor, is “necessary for a proper consideration of this cause.” Justice could not be judicially administered if a litigant was permitted to decide this or any other disputed question. Rule 55 was adopted for the purpose of enabling the record to be abbreviated on appeal, so far as properly might be done; but it gives to no one the right to determine for himself what shall and what shall not be printed. The parties may agree upon this; but, if they cannot, the court must decide, as in all other disputed matters. We ought not to be required to say that Rule 55 is mandatory and must always be obeyed; but since counsel appear to think this is not so, we now emphatically state that it is.</p>
    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[308,1210,1148,98]]]'>The decree of the court below is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed at the cost of appellant.</p>
