This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the written agreement with the maker, attached to the affidavits of defense, simply states that plaintiff “will not press ......for immediate payment of the notes” by the maker, reserving, however, the right to forthwith proceed against the endorser; which reservation of course invalidates the attempted defense of the endorser that his liability ended when plaintiff gave time to the maker: Section 120, clause 6, of the Negotiable Instruments Law of May 16, 1901, P.

If it was meant to aver that plaintiff had actually converted the property to his own use, the facts touching this should have been stated, in order that, assuming their verity, the court might decide whether or not there was in fact a conversion. For all that we are told, plaintiff is simply holding the property as collateral security, until the amount due him is paid.
