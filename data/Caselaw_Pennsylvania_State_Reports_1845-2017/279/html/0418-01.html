After defendant acquired it, plaintiffs made all interest payments thereon to Lawson, who receipted therefor as attorney for appellant. These payments, however, did not warrant appellees in paying the principal to him, even though he was constituted by the mortgagee his agent for the receipt of the interest. Creating one an agent to receive payment of the interest due on a-mortgage does not make him an agent to receive payment of the principal. “The fact that an agent is authorized to receive installments of interest as they become due on a note or other obligation <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>does not give him implied power to collect the principal”: 2 Corpus Juris 621.

Superior Ct. 401</a>, the court said, at page 406: “The position of an investor would be most precarious if the fact that he employs an attorney from time to time when making loans and authorizes him to make collections of interest, and in special cases of the principal due on securities, is sufficient to warrant a finding of authority generally to collect the principal of all his client’s mortgages and that, too, when the latter keeps possession of his obligations.”</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[327,939,1152,1296]]]'>At the time one of plaintiffs paid the principal of the mortgage on September 16, 1921, she testified the mortgage papers were in the possession of Lawson. This the defendant denied and said they did not get into Lawson’s hands until January 9, 1922. Defendant further testified that he turned the papers over to Lawson because the latter asked for them in order that he might prepare an assignment of the mortgage to a person who would take it, the obligation being past due, and he, defendant, having notified Lawson that it and other mortgages must be paid. After Lawson absconded, the bond and mortgage and other papers connected therewith were found in his law office in the customary filing envelope that he used, marked “Mortgage investments Jesse T. Hoekstra.” Mere possession of the papers alone is not such a badge of agency as will warrant the conclusion by the mortgagor that the one holding the papers is the agent of the mortgagee to receive payment of the principal. It may be a circumstance in connection with others which may lead to the conclusion of agency. “The mere possession by an agent of notes or other securities evidencing an indebtedness, although a fact to be considered, does not of itself, confer authority upon such agent to receive payment thereof”: 2 Corpus Juris 623.</p>

To meet this testimony, defendant denied his signature to the assignment and set up that it was a forgery, but the notary public who took the acknowledgment to it testified that defendant had executed the assignment in his presence, that he had taken his acknowledgment thereto, and that the signature resembled other admittedly genuine signatures of the defendant with which he compared it. The chancellor found, on comparison of the denied signature with those admittedly genuine, that it. was in defendant’s handwriting. This, and other misleading statements of defendant, led the court to the conclusion that his testimony could not be relied on and we are not convinced there was error in so adjudging. It was also shown defendant knew prior to the time plaintiffs paid the mortgage that Lawson was a defaulter; that he had misappropriated moneys belonging to the/defendant himself.</p>
