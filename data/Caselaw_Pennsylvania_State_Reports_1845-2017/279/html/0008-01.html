At first blush, this contractual liability of Arnold to the plaintiff makes the situation look as though the former should be classed as a witness with an adverse interest, but on further consideration we realize that, should plaintiff (who is the party calling the witness) win the verdict on the main issue here involved, — namely, the fact of the existence of a partnership between Arnold and the two defendants, — Arnold, if ever obliged to pay, will in all likelihood be asked for no more than one-third of the amount recovered, and that demand (if made at all) will not be by the present plaintiff but by one or both of the defendants, who will be fixed through such a verdict as partners of the witness, entitled to contribution from him; or, in the event of a verdict against defendants and their failure to pay, should Arnold, as one of the alleged firm, subsequently be compelled to pay in full, he would be entitled to recoup himself by contributions from his partners. On the other hand, if defendants win, thereby establishing the fact of the nonexistence of the alleged partnership, the witness alone will be liable to plaintiff, and, in all probability, eventually will be asked to pay the entire <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>damages, as the only one obligated under the contract in controversy.</p>

Moreover, by calling this witness for such a purpose, and then offering evidence to contradict him, several items of proof were introduced which otherwise would have been unavailable to plaintiff, and he thus gained an undue advantage over his opponents.

This writing contained statements of the existence of the partnership in question and of other facts contended for by plaintiff, who introduced the paper both to discredit Arnold’s denial of the partnership and expressly to prove the truth of the other particular facts asserted therein, or, in the words of the offer, to show “that the other things [‘set forth in the paper’] were said and done.” In charging the jury, the trial judge instructed to the effect that the declarations of Arnold, claimed as being contained in this exhibit, should not be considered in determining whether defendants were members of the alleged firm; yet the judge had improperly admitted the writing, and since his vaguely phrased admonition to disregard it as original evidence was not made until four days later, this must have been, at best, of doubtful curative value: Heron v.
