All of the trustees named likewise died, — the last in 1917, — during the life of the widow. The account now filed is that of the Guarantee Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Company, and the adjudication of it led to the controversy as to the right to the residuary estate. The fund was awarded to the University of Pennsylvania as substituted trustee to carry out the charitable use contemplated by the decedent, as shown by his will. Legatees of the daughter now claim it, insisting the provision made for the medical school violated the rule against perpetuities, and, therefore, the principal passed to them under the intestate laws in force at the time of Hunter’s death. It was urged in the court below that no power exists to name a new trustee for those originally designated, to whom had been given peculiar and personal powers, and, further, that the gift was dependent on the granting of a site for the building proposed, making it contingent upon such action by the university, and the requirement had not been complied with.</p>

Thaw, <a href="/pa/246/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="246 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1006208" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0348-01">246 Pa. 348</a>, is unnecessary in view of the opinion of the present Chief Justice in Toner’s Est., <a href="/pa/260/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="260 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1040280" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0049-01">260 Pa. 49</a>. Starting with the Act of 1855, we find a fixed purpose of the legislature to protect and conserve charitable bequests, though in conflict with the rule against perpetuities, unless the same are void “for uncertainty, or the object of the trust be not ascertainable, or has ceased to exist,” in which case the estate reverts to the next of kin by the terms of the Act of 1885, supra.</p>

Objections made in the present case, other than to the substitution of a trustee, which is without merit, resolve themselves into the effect of the provision in the will that “a proper piece of land” should be supplied by the university, on which the proposed building could be erected, and it is insisted this was a condition (Phila. v. Girard’s Heirs, <a href="/pa/45/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="45 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="9502081" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0009-01">45 Pa. 9</a>) which might not be carried out within a life or. lives in <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>being, or twenty-one years thereafter, and thus the bequest was defeated. The answer to this must be found in the determination whether or not the residuary estate was vested in some charity, and the furnishing of the land merely a condition as to the manner of carrying it out (Lawrence’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="136 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="819995" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0354-01">136 Pa. 354</a>; Lilley’s Est., <a href="/pa/272/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="272 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1068386" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0143-01">272 Pa. 143</a>), for the general rule against perpetuities has no application to vested estates: Johnston’s Est., <a href="/pa/185/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="185 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="898030" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0179-01">185 Pa. 179</a>.</p>
