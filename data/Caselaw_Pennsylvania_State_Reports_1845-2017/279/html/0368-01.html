Kemble, who died September 16, 1891. The exact terms of so much of the will and codicil as are involved in the present case will be found in the notes of the reporter, published in connection with this opinion. The court below decided that appellants, the widow and the executors of a deceased grandchild of testator, took no interest in a share of income which had been enjoyed by the grandchild during his life, and that such income vested, at the <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>death of the grandchild, in his sister as the survivor of a class.</p>

The codicil states that, if any of testator’s children die, his or her surviving husband or wife are to be paid, for life, one-third of the income bequeathed to the children of such deceased child, and “the remaining two-thirds only [are to] be distributed among my grandchildren” as provided in the will.</p>

When carefully read, the words of the residuary devise sufficiently show this intent, and the terms of the codicil reenforce the construction of the will adopted by the learned court below. For instance, as previously pointed out, testator includes as beneficiaries of income only those grandchildren who survive their parent, the child of testator; if he wished to vest the interests of his grandchildren for the entire period of the trust, and thus provide for their respective spouses, why should he have discriminated as between grandchildren who survived and those who might predecease their parent? Then, testator failed altogether to provide for possible grandchildren born after his death; it seems unlikely, with these ignored, that he intended to provide for the husband or wife, heirs, creditors or assigns of grandchildren born in his lifetime. His scheme of distribution also rebuts an inference that he contemplated, in any contingency, strangers to his blood, after the death of a grandchild, becoming distributees of his bounty, since he stipulates that the trustee shall make “even quarterly payments as near as may be” to his wife, children and grandchildren, as they respectively become entitled to their shares of income under the will, and he confines the distribution so far as grandchildren are concerned, not to those born in his lifetime, but impliedly to those so born and still living when the shares of income allotted to them become distributable; for grandchildren living at testator’s death take under the will “the share the parent would have been entitled to thereunder” if he or she had been alive at the time of payment, and the provision is <em>“to pay said child </em>[grandchild] <em>or children </em>[grandchildren] the income in question. A legacy cast in the form of the present testamentary disposition, — a direction <em>to pay </em>at given times to designated classes,— <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>while not always conclusive evidence that the payee or payees are intended as the sole beneficiaries, to the exclusion of others claiming through him or them, is a circumstance showing a purpose not, in any manner or degree, to treat the legatee or legatees as sources of succession. Then, again, the will states that, on the death of a child leaving children [living at testator’s death] the latter are to be paid the income the parent would have received if he or she were alive at the time of payment, not that each child of a child shall take share and share alike with his brothers and sisters, but, rather, that such children, as a class, shall take their deceased parent’s share of income; evidently meaning that each grandchild is to take subject to a right of survivorship in the others, or for life only. There is further indication of lack of intent to vest the income in a grandchild for a period beyond his life, in the failure to vest the remainder of the principal of the estate either in grandchildren or in their descendants except as the latter might be testator’s heirs at law at the time of the decease of the last survivor of the children and grandchildren living at his death. Finally, aside from the provisions therein contained for the surviving spouses of his children, the language of the codicil strongly suggests that, after his wife and children, testator had in mind, as distributees of income, grandchildren and grandchildren alone; directing that this income was to “be only distributed among” them, his “grandchildren,” as provided in the will, or, in other words, as members of a class.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[109,1935,1156,478]],["BL_398.1",398,[304,349,1151,904]]]'>When the terms of the will and codicil are considered as a whole, it appears that, after providing an income for his widow, testator’s real interest was centered on his children, and his grandchildren living at his death. His desire was to benefit these persons, known to him (and to a limited extent the surviving spouses of his children), by the income from his residuary estate; his descendants generally, or those then entitled as his heirs under the intestate laws, to recéive the principal at the <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>death of the last of these primary beneficiaries. This, the scheme of his will, is expressed with sufficient clearness to be understood without the aid of rules of construction or the citation of authorities. Accordingly, on the death of the widow, the income was payable to two sets of beneficiaries, — children, and grandchildren of testator living at his death who might survive their parents, these latter, in each instance, taking, between or among, them as a class, the share of their deceased parent; such being his manifest purpose, the present distribution must be so confined. Thus, Florence Kemble, appellee, a grandchild of testator, became entitled to the whole share of income of her deceased father, after the death of her brother, and the orphans’ court was right in denying the claims to participate with her in this share made by the executors and the widow of the brother.</p>
