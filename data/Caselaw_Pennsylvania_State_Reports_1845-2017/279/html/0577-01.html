He was notified in writing of his intended discharge. The reason in the notice read “political activity contrary to section 23, article XIX, P. L. 1919,” with the specification, “you have been politically active according to your own admission, and after your attention had been called to section 23, article XIX, P. L. 1919, by your superior officer, in the presence of others, you expressed an intention to continue to be politically active, contrary to the stipulation of the act <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>of assembly.” To the charge, it was replied, “I deny that I have engaged in any political activity,” and to the specification “I deny that I have made any admission of political activity on my part to any person or persons, and I further deny that I have expressed an intention to continue to be politically active......Therefore I now make demand for an immediate hearing of this said above charge.”</p>

In all such cases the reasons and the answer shall be given to the Civil Service Commission for record as a public document. We pointed out in McCoach v. Phila., <a href="/pa/273/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="273 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1070870" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0317-01">273 Pa. 317</a>, the difference between the part of the section applicable to this class of officers and the one governing police officers and firemen. While the evident purpose of the article was to prevent the removal of city employees from improper motives, there is nothing in the act which specifically defines or determines the form of notice to be given an employee in the classified service. Any sufficient reason which moves the conscience of the governing head is ground for discharge. . There is no limitation as to the reason .which may form the basis of just cause, except that it may not be religious or political, and it should be one that, in the official’s judgment,, renders the accused unfit for service <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>(Truitt v.

The law states its violation should be met by dismissal. The section named above recites many different kinds of political acts, but it deals generally with political activity, and, in using the language quoted as a reason for dismissal, the director covered the ground.

While care should be taken to protect the men in the employ of a municipality under civil service, too much stress cannot be laid on the efficiency necessary through strict discipline; if the power to discipline is taken away, efficiency for most purposes is lost.</p>
    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[108,951,1153,483]]]'>When appellee acknowledged he had been politically active, assuming that he did, he not only openly defied the director in the enforcement of discipline, but deliberately asserted the violation of an act of assembly and indicated his intention to continue to violate it. When notified of the charge against him, he did not ask for specific facts; no doubt he knew very well what the facts were; it is only when the case gets into court on mandamus that we hear anything about specific charges.</p>
