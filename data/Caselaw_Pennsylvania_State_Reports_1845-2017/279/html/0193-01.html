This $200,000 was obtained by him from the treasury of the company. He claims to have received it by virtue of a resolution of the executive committee adopted at a meeting held December 28, 1916. This resolution recited: “Whereas Samuel Dempster has purchased the property in the Second Ward of the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, known as the Homeopathic Hospital property, <em>which property it may be necessary that this company may hereafter desire to acquire from Samuel Dempster......now, therefore, </em>be it resolved that $200,000 of the money of this company be loaned and advanced to 'the said Samuel Dempster at four and one-half per cent interest, taking as security therefor a mortgage on the property known as the Homeopathic Hospital property purchased by him.” In a conversation with the minority director when inquiry was made as to the reason for the purchase of the property, Dempster stated, so this director testified, that it would be necessary for the company to move, and, that he thought it a matter of foresight to have a property on which the company could erect a building and continue its business without interruption. In a letter dated March 21, 1921, Dempster stated: “Your information in reference to the mortgage on the Second Avenue property not being recorded is <em>correct......The title to the property is vested in an individual, </em>the money being advanced for the purchase of the property to be secured by the instrument heretofore mentioned......It has been intimated that the directors did not authorize the purchase of this property which is true and it is also true that during the past several years it has been neces<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>sary for me to take over many other pieces of property, ;......this has been the procedure for many years and any such transactions have never been questioned <em>as they have all been made in the interest and for the profit of the </em>institutionAnswering a request submitted by the defendants, the court found: “It was considered at the time the corporation might desire to purchase a property at sometime in the future, if it should be compelled to abandon its present location.”- Dempster executed the bond and mortgage to the company for $200,000, with interest at ; it was never recorded. No interest was paid thereon. These papers have been held by him in a safe of the company since they were signed. The excuse given by him for not recording the mortgage was what he termed “trade reasons.” These alleged “trade reasons” are not clear to us or valid, except the one which avows an endeavor to conceal income; in the main, they amount to the assertion that he did not want the company’s customers or competitors to know it had so much money thus invested, — why he does not make plain. We think they are not the real reasons for keeping the mortgage off the record. In our view, he was speculating in the property with the company’s money, not a dollar of his own having gone into it; if the property increased in value, he intended to profit at the company’s expense; if it did not, his purpose was that it should take the property off his hands. His position of complete domination enabled him so to speculate at the corporation’s expense without danger to himself.</p>

They filed their bill October 1, 1921. There can be no laches in view of this action, even if laches <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>could be set up in such a case as this. The basis of the court’s finding of laches is that the minority stockholders knew in 1917 that Dempster claimed he had purchased the property for himself. They did not know the terms of the resolution of December 28, 1916, reciting the future needs of the company for the property, and furthermore they were all women, unfamiliar with business, who would not realize what was contemplated to be done by him until he came to execute the plan of selling the property to the company at a large profit to himself. The court refused to find that the property was purchased by Dempster with the funds of the company and for it with the expectation of transferring title to it at some future time when business demands would require the construction of a new building. This we think was palpably erroneous when all the facts are taken into account.</p>

Shortly after this action by the majority stockholders, a resolution was adopted by the board of directors authorizing the purchase at a price to be fixed by appraisement, the directors to appoint one appraiser, Dempster to appoint another and the two so selected to choose a third. The director representing the minority voted against the adoption of this resolution. No appraiser was appointed by the board. In determining the value of the property, the appraisers fixed it as of the date of their appraisal, which was after a proceeding in which benefits had been assessed against it. The appraisers placed the value at $404,277, <em>the vendor to pay all assessments. </em>At the meeting of the stockholders held September 23, 1921, a resolution was adopted (the minority stockholders present voting adversely) to purchase the property for the sum of $404,277, <em>the company </em>

We are not disposed in the slightest degree to minimize or weaken these principles.
