    <p id="b135-11" data-blocks='[["BL_135.12",135,[103,1002,1154,1240]]]'>This appeal by plaintiff is from the trial court’s refusal to take off a compulsory nonsuit, granted in his action against the defendant railroad company for personal injuries sustained by him while in its employ as a brakeman. Such refusal was error. Defendant has a freight yard along the south side of its main tracks at East Liberty, where, on the evening of August 27, 1921, plaintiff was engaged with other members of a local crew in making up an out-going train. For that purpose they had placed cars (herein called the line) on a siding and were attempting to add two others by an engine pushing them back against the line. When they got within about two hundred feet of the latter, the engine and the two cars were stopped that plaintiff might alight and turn a switch on the north side of this track. Then, while standing outside of the track, he attempted to adjust the automatic coupler on the end of the car facing the line, by the use of the lever, but it would not operate, so he stepped in between the rails and adjusted it by hand. Then he attempted to step off the track to the south, where his duty called him, but before he could do so, was hurt by a sudden movement of this car, caused by an unexpected push of the engine.</p>

Plaintiff’s claim is stated in the alternative for injuries sustained either in interstate or intrastate traffic; while the proofs may not make out a prima facie case for the former they do for the latter. True, the original Safety Appliance Act of Congress of March 2, 1893, ch. 196, 27 Stat. L. 531, embraced interstate commerce only (Brinkmeier v. Missouri P. Ry.

In the instant case it may well be so considered, for it was Sims’ duty to adjust the coupler, and its defective condition rendered it necessary for him to go close behind the car, where he was struck, which otherwise he need not have done. The unexpected movement of the car was rather the condition than the cause of the accident. There is necessarily more or less movement connected with the act of coupling cars, but that does not excuse where an employee is compelled to put himself in a place of danger because of a defective appliance. In Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. v. Layton, supra, Mr. Justice Clarke, speaking for the court, says: “The language of the acts and the authorities we have cited make it entirely clear that the liability in damages to employees for failure to comply with the law springs from its being made unlawful to use cars not equipped as required,— not from the position the employee may be in or the work which he may be doing at the moment when he is injured. This effect can be given to the acts and their wise and humane purpose can be accomplished only by holding, as we do, that carriers are liable to employees in damages whenever the failure to obey these safety appliance laws is the proximate cause of injury to them when engaged in the discharge of duty.” In such case courts are prone to attribute the injury to the defect. <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>See Fegley v. Lycoming Rubber Co., <a href="/pa/231/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="231 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="973943" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0446-01">231 Pa. 446</a>; Krutlies v.

The result is not changed in the present case because plaintiff was adjusting the coupler half a block from where it was to take effect, so long as his act was intended to accomplish the coupling; he ran less risk there than he would if between the cars at the place of contact. McCalmont v. P. R. R., <a href="/f/283/0736-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="283 F. 736" data-case-ids="3593657" data-case-paths="/f/283/0736-01">283 Fed. 736</a>, cited by appellee, is inapplicable because the intention in the instant case was to make a coupling presently by letting the cars run down the track. The trial court here was not justified in holding as matter of law that the defective appliance was not the proximate cause of the accident; at most it was a question for the jury. See Moyer v.

Nor was he precluded from so doing because he might contradict the testimony of a witness previously called by him. In other words, a party to the record is not precluded from giving his version of a transaction because one of his witnesses had testified differently even though the latter had refreshed his recollection from a book entry. See American Mfg. Co. v. Smith Co., <a href="/pa-super/33/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="33 Pa. Super. 469" data-case-ids="868676" data-case-paths="/pa-super/33/0469-01">33 Pa. Superior Ct. 469</a>. The correct rule is stated in 17 Cyc. at page 482: “The contents of bills of lading cannot be proved by parol under the best evidence rule. But the receipt of goods by a common carrier [here the movement of a car] can be proved by parol without producing the bill of lading or accounting for its absence.” The evidence excluded was important only as tending to show plaintiff at the time was engaged in interstate commerce, and that was not a vital question in the case.</p>
