Ward Company, being engaged in the distribution of paper in Philadelphia, established a department of its business at 619 Ranstead Street, known as the “papeterie department,” for the manufacture and sale of stationery. Alexander Ehmling, the plaintiff, was manager of this department from October 12, 1918, until April 21, 1921. Thereafter he brought this suit in assumpsit, claiming one-half of the net profits of the department during his management, which one-half he averred amounted to $26,198. Defendant denied plaintiff’s right to share in the profits and also denied that any net profits were made during such management. Plaintiff recovered a verdict for $20,-538.45, and from judgment entered thereon defendant brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b552-6" data-blocks='[["BL_552.8",552,[302,1480,1150,427]]]'>The case turned largely on questions of fact. Plaintiff testified that, by an oral agreement made with D. L. Ward, defendant’s president and general manager, he (plaintiff) was to have for his services a salary of $150 a month and in addition one-half of the net profits of the department. Mr. Ward denied that the agreement included any share of the profits. Each was to some extent corroborated and the jury found against the defendant.</p>

The entries in the books were written by one clerk and later by another, both of whom seem to have left the jurisdiction and neither was, nor, so far as appears, could have been produced at the trial. Plaintiff testified, however, that the books were accurately kept under his personal supervision; also that they were open to and from time to time inspected by the defendant’s <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>officers. In view of this testimony their admission in evidence was not error: see Nichols v.

It seems, however, that the jury are not bound by the results thus ascertained, but may make their own calculations from the books and papers in evidence”: 22 C. J. 1017; 17 Cyc. 511. Defendant kept a set of books, embracing this department, which was also received in evidence, together with oral testimony. Plaintiff’s statement avers the entire receipts of his department were $169,412.94, which is admitted in the affidavit of defense. The dispute, as to this branch of the case, was as to the total expense which plaintiff said amounted to $128,556.13, while defendant contended it was, all told, over $200,000, and that, after making al<a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>lowance for increase in inventory and all other possible credits, left a net loss of over $8,000.

Both sides submitted their proofs and accounts to the jury and it was its duty to pass upon them, difficult though the task might be. The Act of April 4, 1831, P. L. 492, 1 Purdon, 13th ed., 230, expressly empowers the jury to settle the accounts and find the amount due in actions of account render; this they may do without a formal judgment of quod computet being first entered: McLean’s Executors v.

A like power exists where, as here, the parties voluntarily submit their accounts to the jury in an action of assumpsit.
