The remaining part on the north was separated by a fence then standing. Along and to the south of it, a street, to be known as “Phillips,” was marked off, though never opened for use. Five of the parcels sold called for the proposed highway as a boundary, and, in two instances, the courses named in the conveyances extended the lines across it, though the reservation was made therein that they were subject “to the said thirty-foot street.” The purchasers, or some of them, erected fences to join with that of the grantor, and these have been maintained for thirty years, and owners have used the intervening space for gardens, and the growing of shrubbery.</p>

In 1919, Jessie Mitchell, complainant here, acquired title to the north portion of the farm, erected a dwelling on it, and then demanded the proposed road be opened. The lot owners refused to accede to her request, and this bill was then filed to compel the removal of the obstructions on the street, called for in the plan. The facts involved were not disputed, and this appeal is.directed to the refusal of the court below to grant the relief asked.</p>

This was done without objection, then or now, by the buyers of lots. Ordinarily, a servitude created by deed can be removed only by a grant of like dignity, but where the abandonment of an easement can be established, the holder of the privilege, or those claiming through him, cannot thereafter complain: Erb v.

Plaintiff holds under the original owner, and not through a purchaser whose deed refers to the plan, and acquired only such privilege as the possessor of the dominant estate to the north had when it was conveyed. Those in her line of title surrendered any claim, as noticed, and she cannot now revive and assert it. Under some circumstances, the right to an easement never actually enjoyed “may be barred by a possession and use adverse and inconsistent with the right for twenty-one years” (see opinion by President Judge Rice in Whitney v.
