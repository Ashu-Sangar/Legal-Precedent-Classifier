    <p id="b312-7" data-blocks='[["BL_312.8",312,[320,838,1154,968]]]'>Plaintiff was a conductor on a trolley car running south on Fourth Street, Philadelphia, crossing Willow Street. On the latter street there are steam railroad tracks, and it was the duty of plaintiff, whenever his car was about to cross these tracks, to go on the railroad right-of-way to see if there were any trains approaching. On the day of the accident, January 19,1921, at 5 p. m., when it was “neither light nor dark, about dusk,” plaintiff’s car came to a stop some eight feet north of the Willow Street tracks; plaintiff left the car on the right-hand side, near the front, and proceeded to walk south on the street-way, for the purpose of looking up and down the railroad tracks. Willow Street had been in “bad condition” for several weeks, in the sense that its pavement, of Belgian blocks, was uneven. Plaintiff stubbed his toe against a block which projected about three inches above the surface of the pavement, -and was thrown to the ground.</p>
