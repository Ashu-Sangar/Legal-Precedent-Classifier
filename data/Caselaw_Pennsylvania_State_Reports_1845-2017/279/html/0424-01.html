It is of course obvious that, as this will was executed before July 1, 1897, the Act of July 9, 1897, has no application, and it may be conceded that, under the well settled law prior to that act, the word ‘issue’ in a devise like this means prima facie heirs of the body, and is to be construed as a word of limitation, but it is equally well settled that this construction will give way if there be in the instrument itself sufficient to show that the words were intended to have a less extended meaning, and to be applied only to children or to descendants of a particular class, or at a particular time (Miller’s Est., <a href="/pa/145/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="145 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="825887" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0561-01">145 Pa. 561</a>), and not to the whole line of succession: Taylor v.

Taylor, 63 Pa., at page 484, ‘No declaration could well be more express to show that by “issue” the testator meant children.’ The same learned judge, in the later case of Hill v. Hill, <a href="/pa/74/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="74 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1034750" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0173-01">74 Pa. 173</a>, referred to Taylor v. Taylor as showing that the meaning of the general word ‘issue’ was controlled by the subsequent reference to their mother; and we may also cite the later cases of O’Rourke v. Sherwin, <a href="/pa/156/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="156 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="844893" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0285-01">156 Pa. 285</a>, and Oliver’s Est., <a href="/pa/199/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="199 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="922777" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0509-01">199 Pa. 509</a> (neither being affected by the Act of 1897), in which the similar word ‘parent’ was employed.”</p>
