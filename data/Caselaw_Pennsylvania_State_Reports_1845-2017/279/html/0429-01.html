In further trust, upon his death to pay, assign, transfer and set over the principal of his said share unto such of his brothers as may then be living and the descendants then living of such of his brothers as may then be dead, in equal shares, per stirpes, upon the principle pf representation.” Dan-forth, Edward and George were brothers, Barrington was their cousin, the son of another brother of testatrix.</p>

The reason for the court’s decision was thus summed up by the auditing judge: “All surviving except Danforth Phipps Wight, whose share was given in trust for him for life, with remainder to such of his brothers as might be living at his decease. His death accelerated the remainders and as it appears that his surviving brothers now are Edward P.

    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[298,539,1153,1568]]]'>This is the sort of will that is construable from its language alone. As we said in Long’s Est., <a href="/pa/270/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="270 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1066009" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0480-01">270 Pa. 480</a>,487, “When the intent of the testator, and by that is meant his actual intent, can be fairly gathered from his words, the fact that another testator had used the same words with a different meaning is of no avail. Neither precedent nor rules of construction can overcome the testator’s expressed intent.” Tested by this standard of the testator’s actual expressed intent as manifested from the words of the will, we find that the devise was to <em>“such </em>of my four nephews [naming them] as may be living at the time of my death” and such an one Danforth was not, as he was not alive at the time of her death. As was said by the learned President Judge of the court below in his dissenting opinion, “The gift here was not to four nephews by name, but to such of four named nephews as should be living at the time of the death of testatrix” and therefore, “as his share never existed, those who succeeded upon his decease to his share, necessarily take nothing;......those who answer the description or designation of ‘such of my four nephews’ were the three named living nephews.” While this may not be strictly speaking a gift to a class, the reasoning which applies where the first takers are a class is certainly most persuasive. “If the original gift be, not to the class generally, but to <em>such </em>of them only as survive the testator, a contingent gift engrafted thereon in case of the death of any of them can only mean death happening after the death of the testator”: 2 Jarman on Wills, 6th ed., p. 705.</p>
