When a transfer is made or intended to take effect either in possession or enjoyment after death, and the settlor or grantor retains a grasp of the entire estate, as long as he lives, it cannot be said possession and enjoyment in the beneficiary takes effect prior to death; under such circumstances the Commonwealth is entitled to a tax on the transfer.</p>

The trustee, in full possession, looked after the securities with the same authority that extended to trust property of any <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>character, exercising for the beneficiaries complete rights of ownership. This was for the benefit and enjoyment of the three sons. These children had the same right to protect the trust property as any beneficiary in a trust estate, and, had the trustee become delinquent, with the mother incapacitated, they could have invoked the aid of the court for its protection. During the life of Mrs. Dolan the trustee paid the income to the sons. The income received prior to the death of the mother came through this deed, not as a testamentary document, but as an effective deed of trust. The death of the mother, without additional act, did not change either the character of this payment or the document under which it was paid, remoulding it from a deed to a testament during the mother’s life. The estate in the children was fixed and definite. The annexation of the power of revocation does not affect the grantee’s power of enjoyment, or prevent the sale of the property, privately or judicially, though the grantee takes the estate with the possibility of its being divested by the happening of an uncertain event, to wit, the exercise of the power of revocation. Through the exercise of that right reserved, the property may be recalled. But the right to revoke, unexercised, is a dead thing. Its presence in a deed does not alter the character of the instrument or estate granted; to all intents and purposes, title and possession pass just as effectively as any deed or grant could make it, continuing in that state so long as the power of revocation lies dormant.</p>

Mrs. Dolan did everything possible in 1908 to divest herself of the specific property. When she died in 1920 there was nothing for her, the law, or anyone to do to complete the act.
