Defendants being unable to obtain a release of this easement, plaintiff rescinded the agreement of sale, and sued to recover back the hand money he had paid. He obtained a verdict, and from the judgment thereon defendants now appeal.</p>

The rule thus invoked has no applicability to private alleys, however; in such cases this class of agreements cannot be enforced by the vendor, if the covenant is implied, and the vendee did not know of the existence of the alley (Wilson v. Cochran, <a href="/pa/46/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="46 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="420626" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0229-01">46 Pa. 229</a>); and, if it is express, the same conclusion is reached even though he did know: Evans v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/177/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="177 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="883654" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0286-01">177 Pa. 286</a>; Strong v.

Moreover, <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>a private alley has none of the incidents of a public road. From Kirkham v.

    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[326,784,1150,426]]]'>We are not much concerned here, however, with the covenant against encumbrances, but with the express agreement that “the premises are to be conveyed free and clear of all......easements.” The right of the abutters to use this alley is an easement, from which, under such a contract, defendants were bound to obtain a release, if they wished the agreement to be carried out: Patterson v. Freihofer, <a href="/pa/215/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="215 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="948394" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0047-01">215 Pa. 47</a>.</p>
    <p id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[325,1220,1151,752]]]'>It is finally contended that, since the agreement of sale does not specify the size of the lot to be conveyed, but only stipulates that it shall include the “brick house and garage known and situate at No. 1903 Wynnewood Road,” this description will be fully answered by conveying back to the line of the alley, without including any part of it. Appellants could equally well argue, from this language, that it contemplates only so much of the property as is occupied by the house and garage, and excludes all the ground not under them. If this contention were to be given weight, therefore, the necessary conclusion would be that the land is so inadequately described as to make the contract unenforceable: Weisenberger v. Huebner, <a href="/pa/264/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="264 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1048552" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0316-01">264 Pa. 316</a>, 320.</p>

In the instant case, the only evidence as to the depth of the lot to be conveyed, <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>was the deed to defendants from their immediate grantor. This they gave to plaintiff, or some one representing him, in order that a deed from them to him might be drawn; and, in their affidavit of defense, they aver that they “offered to execute the deed for the said premises, which deed plaintiff had prepared and presented to them at the settlement......[and] defendants are still willing to execute said deed.” Both those deeds include, as part of the property No. 1903 Wynnewood Road, the five feet in the bed of the alley, which plaintiff was entitled to have, and which was subject to the rights of the owners abutting on the alley.</p>
    <p id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[91,989,1153,535]]]'>It thus conclusively appears that defendants could not convey to plaintiff all the land they contracted to deliver to him “free and clear of all......easements.” For this reason it is unnecessary to consider the other points raised in the briefs; but since appellants think plaintiff’s “real reason” for rescinding the contract may have been different from the one above considered, we should perhaps add that, as he had a right to cancel the contract, his reasons for so doing are wholly immaterial: Orth &amp; Bro. v.
