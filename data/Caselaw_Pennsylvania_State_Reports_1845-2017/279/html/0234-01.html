If not so, then this question suggests itself, and is touched upon in the briefs: Is the particular position held by, or the work performed by, any of these employees shown to be unconstitutionally provided for?</p>

Therefore, after adjudging the matter of the general constitutionality of the act, if there is room for further inquiry, it must necessarily be limited to a review of those parts of the statute on which depend the existence of the departments or agencies employing the services of the payees named in the warrants here in controversy.</p>

These warrants, for salaries of state employees, covered by requisitions, were signed as follows: (1) by the secretary of the Commonwealth as head of the Department of State Finance; (2) by the secretary of Forests and Waters, as the head of the Department of Forests and Waters; (3) by the secretary of Welfare, as <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>the head of the Department of Welfare; and (4) by the secretary of Property and Supplies, as the head" of the Department of Property and Supplies.

The act, in order to accomplish this, its real purpose, provides for certain new administrative agencies, the reframing or rearranging of others, and, to that degree, the rebuilding of the structure of the Executive Department.

While the Constitution of Pennsylvania recognizes the “executive” as having individuality as one of the three departments of government, it also provides that “No bill......shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title”; hence matters of substantive law <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>that one would not expect to find under the designation of “administrative work” (the subject of the present statute) cannot be incorporated in such an act without breaching this constitutional provision; nor can matters, even though administrative, which belong or pertain to the legislative or judicial departments, as distinguished from the executive department, be legally included in an act purporting to deal alone with the latter branch of government.</p>

Here, since the act purports to deal with the executive and administrative work of the executive department, its provisions, to be constitutionally valid, must concern the structure of that branch of the state government or have some legitimate relation to the kind of work or duties of the executive department suggested by the title.</p>

Turning to the record, it is quite clear that all the governmental agencies, which issued the requisitions for the warrants under consideration, are such as could properly be used in the executive and administrative work of the executive department; and, no matter what might have been shown to the contrary, there is nothing before us to indicate that any of the employees named in the requisitions were performing other than routine duties of a purely constitutional character for such agencies; finally, there is nothing in the title of the Administrative Code to mislead one in any particular so far as the portions of the act here shown to be directly involved are concerned.</p>
