The jury also found against appellees and in favor of defendant Marjorie Hosfeld, M.D., on allegations of joint liability. The trial court thereafter added damages for delay pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 238. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, <em>per curiam. </em>We granted review to consider appellant’s claim concerning Rule 238.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>The facts of the instant action are as follows. The wife-plaintiff was originally injured in an automobile accident, resulting in the loss of motor function in both legs. After four months of treatment at other facilities, she was transferred to Magee Memorial Rehabilitation Center, under the care of Dr. Marjorie Hosfeld. While receiving treatment there, Mrs. Craig suffered injuries when she sustained a burn as the result of coming into contact with an air blower which was being utilized in the treatment of a decubitis ulcer. This occurred in May of 1974.</p>
    <p id="b107-4" data-blocks='[["BL_107.9",107,[164,802,1141,736]]]'>In April, 1976, plaintiffs instituted suit against the Magee Center and Dr. Hosfeld. However, it was not until December, 1980, that the case came to trial. A mistrial was occasioned at that time, and it was not until January, 1983, that the case was tried to conclusion before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. The pre-trial record of the litigation reveals frequent and lengthy postponements, delays and requests for continuances, many attributable to appellees, plaintiffs below. The trial ended in the vindication of Dr. Hosfeld. However, the jury found the Magee Center liable and awarded the above mentioned verdict. Since the jury’s verdict exceeded the defendants’ last offer of settlement by more than 25%,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> delay damages of $16,450 were imposed pursuant to Rule 238.</p>

It was a bold experiment that seemed reasonable, salutary and equitable. It was reasonable because it sought to clear dockets cluttered by unreasonable refusals to pay what was owed. It was salutary in that it provided a penalty for profiting by denying what was due. It was equitable because it compensated for loss caused by an unreasonable refusal to correct a tortious injury.</p>
    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[263,959,1139,302]]]'>It was an experiment. The <em>Laudenberger </em>Court faced a challenge shortly after the promulgation of the Rule. They faced, as we face now again, an attack on the Rule upon grounds of Equal Protection, Due Process and the contention that this Court slipped, under procedural cover, into definitive substantive law.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.7",108,[263,1287,1138,362]]]'>The <em>Laudenberger </em>Court accepted as an underlying reason for the Rule that there was deliberate, profitable delay on the part of tortfeasors. If one accepts that a refusal to settle is always prompted by such motives, then no wrong is done a wrongdoer, and the rationale of <em>Laudenberger </em>would have settled the argument presented for then and always.</p>

The facts here are the obverse of the coin: the defendant below argues that there was delay, but not his; that the delay was the fault of the plaintiffs below. Appellant does not argue that the sanctions of Rule 238 may not be reasonable, salutary, and equitable.</p>

Neither is there point in arguing that a procedural rule that punishes a defendant <em>qua </em>defendant does not smack of a substantive enlargement of duties owed. We do not overrule the rationales of <em>Laudenberger, </em>for they have vitality of their own in the context of the ends sought. We today suspend the Rule because experience shows that the ends sought run too tight a gauntlet through Due Process, by denial of a forum to assess fault for the delay sought to be avoided. In short, Rule 238 has become an uncontestable presumption that all fault lies with a defendant. There are too many reasons why such is not always the case; and what is not always so may not be irrebuttable when a penalty follows.</p>

These are the same arguments that we considered and rejected less than five years ago in <em>Laudenberger v.

In <em>Laudenberger </em>we held that Rule 238 did not invalidly abridge, enlarge or modify substantive rights, nor did it violate equal protection or substantive due process. Today the majority states: “We do not overrule the rationales of <em>Laudenberger, </em>for they have vitality of their own in the context of the ends sought.” (At p. 65). The meaning of this indistinct statement is not readily apparent. It is clear though that the majority embraces previously discredited arguments and holds, directly contrary to <em>Laudenberger, </em>that Rule 238 is inequitable and offends due process.

A plaintiff, through dilatory motions, continuances and other tactics, may be responsible for causing delay in a claim coming to trial. It may be incontrovertible that a plaintiff wilfully engaged in conduct precipitating a lengthy delay. If, however, early in such a case the defendant makes a reasonable offer of settlement which remains open to the plaintiff until the commencement of trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> the running of pre-judgment <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>interest under Rule 238 is tolled.

Further, under such circumstances, the same would be true even where the defendant, through dilatory motions and tactics, delays resolution of the claim. The assessment of pre-judgment interest is not punishment for the delay in reaching trial.

Without the operation of Rule 238 and the assessment of pre-judgment interest, it behooves defendants not to settle early, but to retain funds earmarked for claims settlement as long as possible so that revenues may be generated from investment of those funds.
