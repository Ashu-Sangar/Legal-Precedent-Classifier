Pursuant to that ordinance, an incumbent mayor can seek only one term of reelection. We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that a reasonable limitation on the mayoral term of office is in harmony with the scope of authority granted to third class cities by the Code and the Charter Law. To limit the mayoralty to two terms in no way denies the right of reelection to an incumbent mayor, rather it provides, prospectively, a reasonable limit to the number of consecutive terms he can serve as mayor of a third class municipality. Therefore, we reverse the Order of the Common Pleas Court.</p>

He shall be eligible to succeed himself for <em>only one additional term.” </em>City of Bethlehem, Ordinance 2389 (Oct. 18, 1973) (emphasis added). Paul M.

Here, however, we do not have a patent conflict. The first issue is whether the right to reelection under section 701 requires an unrestricted number of opportunities for reelection of an incumbent mayor.</p>
    <p id="b51-5" data-blocks='[["BL_51.5",51,[162,923,1143,1218]]]'>Appellee argues that the Legislature, in retaining exclusive jurisdiction over the Office of Mayor in third class cities, has determined that under section 701, <em>supra, </em>an incumbent mayor has an unrestricted right of reelection as long as a majority of the electorate votes in his favor. Section 701, indeed, expressly extends the right of reelection to municipal offices. Nothing in the statutory language, however, indicates that the term “reelection” connotes an infinite number of successive opportunities of election to the same municipal office. Section 701 of the Code merely provides, <em>inter alia, </em>an express guarantee of the <em>right </em>of reelection. To read that right of reelection as requiring unrestricted opportunities for reelection is to read the language broader than the words of that section would require on its face. Such an interpretation would require a finding of an unstated, implicit qualification to the power granted under section 303(1). A limitation upon the terms of office an executive may hold is considered by many to be salutary, in that it encourages a fresh approach and tends to prevent stagnation and/or corruption that may follow an administration that may overstay its productivity. U.S. CONST, amend. XXII, § 1; 351 Pa.Code § 3.3-400. We will not restrict this option by implication.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
