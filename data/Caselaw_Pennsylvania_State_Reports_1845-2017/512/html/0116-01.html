Beginning in April, 1978, however, Robinson engaged in a series of transactions which led to the embezzlement of Three Hundred Forty-six Thousand, Two Hundred Forty-seven Dollars and Seventy-five Cents ($346,247.75) of the escrow funds. The embezzlement was carried out in three separate operations. First, on April 5, 1978, Robinson redeemed a certificate of deposit and placed the proceeds in the escrow passbook account.</p>

A treasurer’s check was prepared as directed, and delivered to Robinson. Second, on May 4, 1978, Robinson redeemed another certificate of deposit. He directed that the proceeds of the second certificate be delivered to him in the form of a check payable to BEDCO. Continental followed Robinson’s instruction and delivered to him a check in the sum of One Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($140,000.00), payable as requested. Third, on January 2, 1979, a third certificate was redeemed; and a check for the proceeds in the amount of One Hundred Six Thousand, Two Hundred Forty-seven Dollars and Seventy-five Cents ($106,-247.75), payable to B &amp; P as escrow agents, was delivered to Robinson pursuant to his instruction. In each of these three transactions the certificate was redeemed and the proceeds disbursed without the signature of any of the B &amp; P partners, but rather solely upon the oral instructions of Robinson. The proceeds from those certificates of deposit, totalling Three Hundred Forty-six Thousand, Two Hundred Forty-seven Dollars and Seventy-five Cents ($346,247.75), were subsequently embezzled by Robinson and applied to his own use.</p>

Such an agreement should not be easily implied and the Act’s standard of good faith should be the standard used in any doubtful case.
