Appellee lived in a one and one-half story brick house with a large enclosed redwood porch in the front and a smaller one in the rear. His house is located in Hamilton-ban Township, Adams County. On July 13 at approximately 7:15 a.m. three state troopers arrived to execute the search warrant. The officers approached from the rear. They opened the unlocked porch door and entered the porch area, but did not search it. One of the officers knocked on the door to the house proper; appellee answered. The officer identified himself and informed appellee that the police were there to execute a search warrant. Appellee allowed the officers to enter; no force was used. The officers confiscated cocaine, marijuana, various pieces of paraphernalia and a sawed-off shotgun.

Trooper Helwig testified that he did not believe that the occupants of the house could hear a knock at the porch door; he could see that the porch was not occupied, and was used for storage. Therefore, he and the other officers entered the porch and knocked on the door to the house proper. No search was conducted on the porch after they entered. After identifying himself, Trooper Helwig explained his purpose and appellee allowed the officers to enter the house.

The officers entered the porch to effectively announce their presence and purpose, not to begin a search. Indeed, Trooper Helwig and his colleagues believed that the rule’s purposes could not be served by knocking at the porch door. The officers’ conduct once inside the porch belies any malignant intent or desire to flaunt the “knock and announce” rule. No force was used in entry and breach of peace or injury was unlikely since the porch was unoccupied. They did not enter the house proper, the occupied area, without permission. No evidence has been presented that their failure to find and use the door bell was anything but an oversight. Therefore, considering its purpose, we hold that Rule 2007 was not violated on this record and suppression of the evidence seized was improper.</p>

All the circumstances, the good faith of the officers and the rights of those searched must be balanced in making reasonable sense of the rule.</p>
