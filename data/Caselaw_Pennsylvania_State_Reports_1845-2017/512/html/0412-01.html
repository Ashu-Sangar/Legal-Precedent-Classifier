This dispute arose when the City refused to pay the Police a COLA based on the 1980 CPI beginning in 1981, after the contract had expired. The police filed an action in mandamus in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County alleging a mandatory duty on the part of the City under the agreement to pay such a wage increase. A non-jury trial was conducted during which the Police presented two members of the City’s Police Department who were permitted to testify as to the intention of the parties with respect to the COLA provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The trial court ruled in favor of the Police and, after dismissing the City’s exceptions, entered a judgment in favor of the Police in the amount of Twenty Thousand Three Hundred Forty-Five Dollars ($20,345.00). The City appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed on the opinion of the trial court. <a href="/citations/?q=345%20Pa.%20Super.%20630" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="345 Pa.

The words relied upon by the trial court merely recognize the possibility of delay in the publication of CPI figures and provide for a retroactive adjustment in the event that such a delay prevents the computation of the COLA on January 1, 1979 and/or January 1, 1980. To accept the trial court’s interpretation it would be necessary to read into the contract a provision that COLA would be payable on January 1, 1981, based upon the CPI for the entire calendar year of 1980 when the agreement clearly covers the terms and conditions of employment only for the years 1978 through 1980. Such an interpretation is manifestly unreasonable and would amount to a judicial rewriting of the agreement. Obviously the parties could have provided for COLA in 1981 based on the increase in the cost of living in 1980; they simply did not do so and we decline to do it for them. Finally, the fact that the agreement is intended to cover all aspects of remuneration for a three-year period is of no avail to appellees’ position. The contract provided for an across-the-board increase effective in 1978, to be followed by COLA increases in 1979 and 1980. The fact that the agreement does not <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>provide for a COLA increase in 1981 is hardly incongruous when one considers that the agreement expired on December 31, 1980. A wage increase based on the 1980 CPI would clearly be a subject to be addressed in bargaining for a new agreement, just as the increased cost of living in 1977 must have been in the negotiations over the instant contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

It necessarily provides for retroactive pay of COLA’s since the CPI is not known until the end of the year. The contract, although written by the plaintiffs, is the product of laymen, and while it is simple and clear for the most part, it has a degree of ambiguity in one respect.</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[173,631,1142,999]]]'>In explaining the computation of the COLA’s the contract specifically refers to their calculation for the years 1978 and 1979 without mention of any calculation for 1980, although the two sentences which cover this calculation conclude with the phrase “and continuing thereafter.” Then following a sentence which limits consideration of the CPI to six points, it then goes on with a two-sentence paragraph which is ambiguous on its face. The first sentence is “The COLA’s called for herein are payable on January 1, 1979 and January 1, 1980” which certainly, standing by itself, provides for only two COLA’s as contended by the defendant. However, the second sentence reads “Because the monthly CPI figures are not published until the next succeeding month for the month in question, any COLA due hereunder shall be retroactive to January 1, 1979, and January 1, 1980, when and if it becomes necessary to wait beyond such dates for applicable figures needed to compute any COLA.” This latter sentence is clearly to the effect that a COLA was contemplated for the year 1980.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[171,1648,1141,629]]]'>As is stated in plaintiffs’ brief, citing <em>Ludwig Honold Manufacturing Company v. Fletcher, </em>404 [405] F.2d 1123, the paramount question in the legal construction of all contracts is a determination of the real intention of the parties. When, as here, you have a three-year contract covering all aspects of remuneration of employees, it is unlikely that it would be intended to cover cost of living adjustments for only two of the three years while covering everything else for three years. More importantly, however, the actual words of the contract when considered as a whole, as they must be, weigh considerably in favor of the plaintiffs’ position.</p>

      <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>Reference is made to alleged error in permitting testimony of plaintiffs’ representatives in regard to the intention of the parties. This question of law need not be discussed because the decision of the Court at the time of the trial, and presently in dismissing the Exceptions, is based solely upon the contract itself.</p>
