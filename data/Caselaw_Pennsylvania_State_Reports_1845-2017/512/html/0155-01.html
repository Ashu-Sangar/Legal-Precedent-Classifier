In addition to the retroactivity question, the Commonwealth urges that we take this opportunity to reexamine <em>Tarver, </em>in light of recent United States Supreme Court decisions, and our own recent decisions which make plain that the Double Jeopardy clause relied upon in <em>Tarver </em>plays no role in multiple sentencing analysis. The Commonwealth asserts that these decisions indicate that the proper focus of the question of whether to permit multiple sentencing in the felony-murder area is upon legislative intent, and that the <em>Tarver </em>rule should be abandoned. I begin the analysis with the question of whether the Superior Court erred in giving <em>Tarver </em>retroactive effect.</p>

At the time of the commission of these crimes, the crime of first degree murder was governed by the Penal Code of 1939, which encompassed both willful, deliberate and premeditated killing as well as felony-murder involving five enumerated felonies, including robbery and burglary. Appellee’s first degree murder conviction was of the felony-murder type, based on the underly<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ing felonies of burglary and aggravated robbery. We affirmed Appellee’s conviction of murder of the first degree on direct appeal three years prior to our decision in <em>Tarver. </em>However, the issue of illegal sentences was never raised on direct appeal.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[159,531,1141,572]]]'>The controlling law, at the time <em>Tarver </em>was decided, was <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, no double jeopardy problem was posed, because robbery and murder were separate offenses. <em>Sparrow </em>was overruled by <em>Tarver, </em>which for the first time applied double jeopardy principles to felony-murder sentencing.</p>

As in the instant case, Tarver was convicted under the Penal Code of 1939 of murder of the first degree, and also of the underlying felony which was aggravated robbery. A life sentence was imposed on the first degree murder conviction and a ten to twenty year consecutive sentence on the aggravated robbery conviction. On P.C.H.A. appeal, this Court vacated the aggravated robbery sentence on the grounds that the underlying felony of robbery was a constituent offense of the felony-murder, and, therefore, double jeopardy prevented the trial court from exceeding its legislative authority and imposing multiple punishments. We held that since the Appellant had raised the sentencing issue at all stages of the proceeding, and since we had not previously ruled on the merits of the claim, it was properly preserved in his P.C.H.A. appeal. Thus, Tarver was entitled to have his robbery sentence vacated where he also received a life sentence for felony-murder. We very carefully pointed out in <em>Tarver </em>that the <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>Appellant was entitled to relief in his P.C.H.A. appeal because he had preserved the issue at all stages of the proceeding. Since Tarver’s sentence was legal when imposed, such analysis would have been irrelevant had we intended our ruling to be retroactive. We have consistently declined to modify sentences retrospectively in P.C.H.A. appeals by similarly situated defendants. <em>Commonwealth v.

Prior to <em>Tarver, </em>multiple sentences for felony-murder and the underlying felony were not only permitted, but were the law, since Pennsylvania adopted the felony-murder rule in 1794. The 1981 decision was a significant departure from prevailing law; thus there was considerable justification for the trial judge’s reliance on the existing law in 1975 when these sentences were imposed. In view of this reliance, in the instant case and hundreds of other cases like it throughout the Commonwealth, the effect of a retroactive application of <em>Tarver </em>on the administration of criminal justice would be considerable. The Commonwealth points out that the unfairness of retroactive nullification of a sentencing decision is most apparent when the actual sentences imposed in the older cases are examined. For example, in the instant case, the trial judge, unable to anticipate the <em>Tarver </em>change in law, suspended sentences on two bills, conspiracy, and the weapons conviction, a decision he obviously would not have made if he could have forecast <em>Tarver.</em>

When one of the two statutes involved is a necessarily lesser included offense of the other, application of the test will always raise the presumption that the statutes involve the same offense, because the lesser offense will never have an element not required by the greater offense.</p>

But, if one looks to the facts of the case and the evidence required to prove the crimes charged, proof of the predicate crime is necessary to establish the compound crime and under the test the compound and predicate crimes are presumptively the same offense.

Since there is no multiple punishment prohibition in the felony-murder or robbery statutes, and since the general purpose of the Crimes Code contemplates that a sentence will be imposed for each offense, there is nothing to indicate a legislative intent to preclude <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>concurrent sentences. Further, prior to <em>Tarver, </em>at the time the 1972 Crimes Code was enacted, multiple sentences were the law.</p>
    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[152,418,1140,450]]]'>The Commonwealth also argues that it is inconceivable that the Legislature intended that a defendant who has committed a felony-inspired killing should then be permitted to rifle through and steal all of the victim’s belongings with total immunity. This, however, is the effect of our <em>Tarver </em>holding. I do not believe that such a result was intended by the Legislature. Accordingly, to the extent that <em>Tarver, supra, </em>is inconsistent with this opinion, I would expressly overrule it.</p>
