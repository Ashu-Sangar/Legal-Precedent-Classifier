Appellant expressed concern as to whether the proposed rate increases were adequate and whether a proposed “freezing” technique used in Blue Shield’s “profile” calculations was appropriate for dentists. Appellant claimed that it had the right, under the due process clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to insist that Blue Shield submit its underlying data to the Department, and that Appellant had the right to review such data before commenting on the proposed rate increases.

The Department, through its Deputy Insurance Commissioner, who was presiding at the hearing, orally rejected Appellant’s request to intervene on the theory that the hearing was informal in nature rather than being a formal one (R. 51a). By rejecting the petition to intervene, the Deputy Insurance Commissioner implicitly rejected Appellant’s complaint that it had been given insufficient information in order to be able to file meaningful comments. The Deputy Commissioner also orally responded to the objection that the Department had obtained insufficient information to perform rationally its own duty to approve or disapprove the requested rate increase pursuant to 40 Pa.C.S. § 6329(b):</p>

Commonwealth Court thought that at the root of the motion to quash for timeliness was the assumption (incorrect, as it were) that Appellant received timely notice of the Department’s decision to approve the filing. Commonwealth Court thought that this assumption ignored the very question raised by the Petition for Review, <em>viz., </em>is the nature of the Department’s decision and Appellant’s interest in the decision such that procedural due process safeguards mandate that Appellant be granted party status in the proceedings with a concommitant right to written notice of the Department’s decision? Commonwealth Court concluded that Appellant was <em>not </em>entitled to party status and that, therefore, it would <em>not </em>have been entitled to (and, in fact, did not promptly receive) notice of the Department’s decision; hence, the motion to quash for timeliness was determined to be inappropriate.</p>

In the briefs submitted, and the oral arguments heard before this Court, the parties to this appeal have also dealt with the standing issue determined by Commonwealth Court in that part of the case that invoked their appellate (rather than original) jurisdiction.

It is not used to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion in a particular way, nor to direct the retraction or reversal of an action already taken. See, <em>Wilbur v. United States ex rel.

Obviously, the Insurance Department acted in a way which Appellant did not like, but broadly speaking, the Department did not fail to act either in carrying out its mandatory duties (specifically, to hold a hearing and rule on the rate increase) or in exercising its judgment and discretion with respect to the issues and requests directly presented to it by Appellant in the form of filing the petition to intervene.

Appellant’s petition to intervene was essentially for the purpose of moving the Department to require Blue Shield to submit to the Department all the underlying documents, studies and data supporting its proposed rate changes, and to give Appellant the opportunity to review <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>such material before offering its own comments on the rate changes.

    <p id="b277-8" data-blocks='[["BL_277.10",277,[152,1255,1141,835]]]'>I dissent. Mandamus should be available to appellant in this case. The Department of Insurance had the duty to afford the Pennsylvania Dental Association a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments, pursuant to 40 Pa.C.S. § 6329(b). By denying access to the data requested by the Pennsylvania Dental Association, the Department of Insurance rendered the right of reasonable opportunity to comment under the statute illusory. The right to notice and an opportunity to be heard “must be granted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.” <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em><a href="/us/407/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="407 U.S. 67" data-case-ids="9136631" data-case-paths="/us/407/0067-01">407 U.S. 67</a>, 80, <a href="/us/407/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="407 U.S. 67" data-case-ids="9136631" data-case-paths="/us/407/0067-01">92 S.Ct. 1983</a>, 1994, <a href="/us/407/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="407 U.S. 67" data-case-ids="9136631" data-case-paths="/us/407/0067-01">32 L.Ed.2d 556</a>, 570 (1972) (citations omitted). Without access to any of the information serving as a basis for Blue Shield’s payment application, the Pennsylvania Dental Association could in no real way comment meaningfully. Comments in the abstract are irrelevant to a defense to a rate increase.</p>

It was not necessary for appellant to intervene in <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>order to protect its rights under the statute. Therefore, appellant is not required to appeal the denial of its petition to intervene. The only real avenue of relief for the Pennsylvania Dental Association would be in mandamus.</p>
