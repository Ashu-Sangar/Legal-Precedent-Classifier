The trial court denied the petition and dismissed the objections. On June 10, 1982, the court entered orders approving the overall settlement. The court then, however, severed group three from the others for separate disposition due to the possibility of Neyhard’s appeal on the intervention question. On appeal the Superior Court reversed, thereby ordering intervention. From that order State Farm sought allowance to appeal, which we granted. We now reverse.</p>

The court also emphasized that the adequacy of group three’s representation negated any need for Neyhard to intervene on its behalf.

This contention is premised upon the ruling by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, <em>supra, </em>fn. 4, that Neyhard lacked standing because his individual claim was barred by the statute of limitations. This fact is certainly important since the Superior Court relied on Neyhard’s representative status in the Philadelphia action in finding a “legally enforceable interest” in the present action. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 2327(4). Obviously, by employing that rationale, Neyhard’s elimination from his action in Philadelphia<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> would significantly diminish his standing in the instant matter. However, for present purposes we will not rely upon this standing issue as dispositive, since we find the more germane issue to be whether, on the merits, the trial court erred in denying Mr. Neyhard’s petition to intervene.</p>

On March 26, 1986, subsequent to the Superior Court’s ruling in the instant matter, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County granted State Farm’s motion for summary judgment due to the fact that Neyhard’s <em>individual claim </em>was barred by the statute of limitations. The significance of this ruling will be addressed in conjunction with our discussion of the Superior Court’s holding in the instant case.</p>

In it she contends that she was misinformed as to the settlement before the trial court and now seeks retribution through the respresentation of Neyhard. In reviewing the denial of Neyhard’s intervention into the Harrisburg suit, our focus is on the state of the record as it existed at the time the trial judge was asked to rule on Neyhard’s petition. There is no evidence that at that time any of group three’s members were registering complaints. To the contrary, the individual who now complains had executed a release with respect to the group three settlement. Her present allegation that she was misinformed is irrelevant to the issue before us in the instant matter: whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Neyhard’s petition to intervene.</p>
