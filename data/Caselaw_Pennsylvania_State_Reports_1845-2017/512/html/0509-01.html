    <p id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[164,753,1141,1208]]]'>Appellee, Bruce Carsia, an attorney, was arrested and charged with bribery,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> obstructing the administration of law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> conspiracy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and solicitation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> by agents within the office of the Attorney General. The charges arose from an alleged attempt by appellee to bribe two police officers relating to a pending matter before a District Justice in West Mifflin Township, Allegheny County. Appellee, after preliminary hearing, was held under bond for trial. Thereafter an information was prepared and filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, by the office of the Attorney General. On December 1, 1982, appellee filed a petition which asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the information should be quashed because the Attorney General was without authority to bring the prosecution. The petition was granted and the criminal information was dismissed. An application for reconsideration was subsequently heard and denied. An appeal from that order was taken to the Superi- or Court. After ruling that the appeal was not interlocutory the Superior Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>affirmed the dismissal of the information, holding that the Attorney General can only investigate and prosecute criminal actions set forth under section 205 of the Act. <a href="/pa-super/341/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="341 Pa.

Seizing upon the italicized portion of the above provision, the appellant argues that the term “law” refers to the pre-existing body of legal principles. This argument fallaciously assumes that the phrase “as may be imposed by law” refers to common law precepts and excludes statutory law. In our view, the use of the language “as may be imposed” clearly shows an extension of power to the legislature to statutorily define and regulate the powers and duties of the Attorney General.</p>

If there is any doubt that the Commonwealth Attorneys Act is the sole source of the Attorney General’s powers, such doubt must be dispelled by the Final Report of the Joint State Government Commission Task Force on the Office of the Elected Attorney General.

Appellee Carsia, besides arguing in support of the order here for review, had also filed a motion urging our Court to dismiss the appeal on the ground of mootness. The mootness claim was based on an assertion that, because Carsia was committed by order of the trial court to a drug treatment program in lieu of prosecution, pursuant to section 18 of the Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, <em>as amended, </em>35 P.S. § 780-118, such an order was tantamount to disposition under 18 Pa.C.S. § 109, thus barring further prosecution. However, we will not address the mootness question. Clarification of the issue raised in the underlying appeal is essential to the efficient operation of our law enforcement system; therefore, we have elected to decide that issue on the merits.</p>
