Appellant claimed that Zehring had an obsessive interest in appellant’s marital problems and had conceived a marked dislike for appellant’s wife. As a result of this bizarre reaction, Zehring had threatened to harm either appellant, his wife, or his son unless the money was paid. Appellant testified that he paid $5,000.00 to Zehring in an effort to keep Zehring from harming anyone in his family, and completely denied that he solicited Zehring to kill his wife.

By order dated September 18, 1984, the trial court denied the motion for new trial. Appellant appealed from that decision to Superior Court.

Moreover, at the time of his trial appellant was aware that Zehring was in custody awaiting trial for his participation in this matter and thus subject to subpoena if the defense had chosen to call him as a witness. The explanation for failing to call Zehring was that at the time of the trial it was believed that Zehring would be uncooperative because of his, Zehring’s, personal situation at the time. The failure to present Zehring was not due to his unavailability, but rather a considered tactical judgment not to use that witness during the trial.</p>

Second, it must be noted that although Zehring’s testimony would have corroborated appellant’s claims of duress and coercion, Zehring’s proffered testimony contradicted appellant’s trial testimony as to a critical point. As previously stated, at trial appellant testified that he did not solicit the killing of his wife but rather paid the $5,000 to avoid harm to her. Zehring’s version indicated the money was paid for the purpose of his killing appellant’s wife, albeit allegedly as the result of Zehring’s urging. Additionally, only $3,000 dollars was paid before the killing and the $2,000 balance was paid after the murder. The $2,000 payment clearly could not have been made to prevent Zehring from harming appellant’s wife since appellant was aware that the deed had been accomplished when that payment was made, according to Zehring’s version. Thus, Zehring’s statement corroborated in an important aspect the pre-trial statement appellant had given to the police at the time of his arrest and which he, appellant, contradicted and attempted to avoid at trial. It is therefore hard to conceive how the admission of this testimony would have been likely to result in a favorable verdict for appellant.</p>

The testimony of the proffered witness, Zehring, although it contradicts the underlying defense that was offered at trial, does in fact corroborate appellant’s assertions of duress. Additionally, since it is coming from the individual accused of exerting the pressure, there is naturally an added indicia of reliability that would be inherent in such testimony. Nevertheless, since appellant is proceeding in a collateral proceeding, our law requires that eligibility for relief in such a posture is limited to the statutorily prescribed rules of eligibility for relief set forth in section 9543. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543. The lynchpin for eligibility in this instance is section 9543(3)(xiii). Thus appellant is still faced with the fact that the proffered testimony of Zehring does <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>not qualify as after-discovered evidence for the reasons previously stated.

Although the testimony for this purpose corroborates the fact of duress, nevertheless the intrinsic character of the testimony is such that it would be unlikely to influence the jury and thus occasion a favorable decision for appellant. As previously stated, the circumstances upon which this belated statement was made is in and of itself just cause for questioning its validity. Moreover, the sentencing court before whom Zehring appeared in his case recognized that Zehring was a paranoid schizophrenic, a fact fully supported by the record and acknowledged in the opinion of this Court on direct appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v. Frey, <a href="/pa/504/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="504 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1787710" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0428-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/504/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="504 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1787710" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0428-01">504 Pa. at 444</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="504 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1787710" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0428-01">475 A.2d at 708</a>.

There has been some question whether 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h), providing for automatic and direct review by this Court of sentences of death, is applicable to collateral appeals that may follow a direct appeal to this Court. We attempted to eliminate this uncertainty in <em>Commonwealth v.

We note that the action by the Superior Court directing this appeal to this Court (July 12, 1985) was prior to the filing of our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Lesko, <a href="/pa/509/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="509 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1795366" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0067-01">supra,</a> </em>(November 12, 1985). Although we accepted the appeal in this case to avoid unnecessary delay in disposing of this matter, we reiterate that a collateral appeal, even where the judgment of sentence is death, is to the Superior Court.</p>
