Feingold, Esquire, filed a complaint in trespass against appellees, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and Darrell Kenneth Duncan,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in May, 1975, as a result of an automobile accident which occurred between the parties on September 17, 1974. SEPTA did not contest its liability, so the issues for trial were reduced to appellant’s alleged aggravation of pre-existing voice and throat problems and his alleged loss of earnings as a lawyer. The complaint was amended in March, 1976, to include a count for punitive damages.</p>

On November 14, 1980, the trial judge awarded $28,048.14 in delay damages, bringing the judgment in its entirety to the amount of $296,048.14.

Based on the <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>ensuing reasons, we affirm the order of the Superior Court, and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>

Appellant listed Dr. Joseph P. Atkins, Jr., as a treating physician and expert witness. Furthermore, appellant stated that the witness and exhibit list submitted in the pre-trial statement were incomplete as of that date. Neither party certified that discovery was complete and the trial court never entered a pre-trial order limiting the number of witnesses each party would be allowed to call. Appellant did not call Dr. Atkins to testify at trial, admitting through counsel that he was aware of the conflicting nature of the doctor’s testimony with respect to his proposed theory of liability. SEPTA’s attempt to call the doctor in its case in chief was thwarted by the trial court because of the absence of his name from SEPTA’s pre-trial statement. Appellant thereafter entered the doctor’s records into evidence.</p>

This contention falters under close analysis of the procedural matrix of the instant case. The local rule excuses the listing of a witness if he or she is to be offered in rebuttal or as impeachment.
