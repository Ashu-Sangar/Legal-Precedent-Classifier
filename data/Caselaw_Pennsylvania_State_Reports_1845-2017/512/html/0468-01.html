One possible inference arising from his failure to cross-examine the investigating officer on the key date supplied by the alibi witness and his rejection of the trial judge’s express suggestion he read the relevant part of the report to the jury is that it was his conscious choice. It is difficult for us to believe that an experienced criminal trial counsel who has demonstrated the abilities otherwise shown on this trial record would make that choice without a reason. The only reason apparent from the present record is the creation of an ineffectiveness argument against a likely adverse verdict. Of course, being human, counsel may simply have erred, through inadvertence. This is the other possible inference. We are unable to make a choice between the competing inferences of conscious choice or inadvertent error on this record. The Post Conviction Hearing Act court, on remand, is best equipped to do so. This may require a further hearing and inquiry into the reasons for counsel’s failure, if thought necessary by the parties.</p>

They encompass those cases where counsel has erred inadvertently as well as instances in which counsel has chosen one alternative course of action, exercising professional judgment. These guidelines do not, however, reach the situation in which counsel has consciously chosen to forego a course of action which, although unquestionably in his client’s interest, is not in and of itself a guarantee against an adverse verdict which the atmosphere of a trial leads experienced counsel to believe likely. In such instances, if the record otherwise shows able, competent representation by an experienced counsel, it is unfortunately possible to infer a decision to open an escape route via ineffectiveness. When that occurs, the fact finder considering the ineffectiveness issue must deal with the question, distasteful as that may be. If the fact finder concludes there was a deliberate unethical choice, it must weigh the advantage thus obtained against the opportunity deliberately foregone and in so doing determine whether the apparent ineffectiveness was not, in fact, reasonably designed to advance the defendant’s interest.</p>

Appellant relied upon alibi and Officer Beels’ unimpeached testimony flatly contradicted appellant’s alibi witness’s testimony. The Commonwealth’s case against appellant was not overwhelming and this area of testimony was crucial to both parties. Confrontation of Beels with the contradiction between his report and his testimony was called for.

Thus, a fact finder could infer that either in the midst of all the details which counsel must keep in mind in a fairly lengthy criminal trial with approximately three dozen witnesses, he simply failed to notice the contradiction in the statement or its importance or that he sought insurance against an adverse verdict.
