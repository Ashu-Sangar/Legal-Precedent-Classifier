The comment to Rule 319 states that the terms of a plea agreement as contemplated by the rule include promises of a charge reduction, the dropping of charges, and the promise of “a recommendation of a lenient sentence.” Numerous references to the court’s sentencing discretion during the guilty plea colloquy served to put appellee on notice that a “tougher” sentence was not an unlikely outcome, but such reference does not remove the promise of a sentence recommendation from the application of Rule 319(b)(3).

The Rule is simply a directive to the <em>court </em>that if the court does not concur with the terms of the plea agreement and a defendant petitions to withdraw the plea in a timely manner, the court <em>must </em>permit the withdrawal of the plea. Defendants are capable of deciding for themselves whether or not they are satisfied with the sentence imposed, and the law requires that they voice any dissatisfaction within the time and in the manner prescribed by rule.
