Prior to trial the Appellant filed a motion in limine requesting that the court exclude evidence of seminal acid phosphatase found in a pair of black panties worn by the victim the night of the alleged rape and the testimony of the emergency room physician who examined the victim and found her to be internally bruised. The purpose of the motion was to exclude this evidence because of the Appellant’s perception that the Rape Shield Law, Act of May 18, 1976, P.L. 120, No. 53 § 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3104 barred the explanatory <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>testimony required to rebut the Commonwealth’s evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Prior to the commencement of trial, counsel for the Appellant and the Commonwealth requested a hearing on the motion, specifically for the court to consider the testimony of a witness who allegedly had sexual relations with the victim around the time of the alleged rape.

Where, as here, a defendant offers evidence of intercourse close enough in time to the act with which he is charged that it is relevant to explain the presence of objective signs of intercourse, the protections afforded to the complainant by the Rape Shield Law do not apply. Such evidence should be admitted, subject to the usual rules of admissibility of evidence, in particular the balancing of probative value against prejudicial effect.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b648-6" data-blocks='[["BL_648.6",648,[323,982,1097,796]]]'>Such an interpretation is consistent with the goals of the Rape Shield Law in protecting the victim’s reputation and does not deny the defendant’s right to introduce relevant evidence in his own defense. Cases where consent is genuinely “at issue” are treated according to the exception set forth in the statute. However, in cases such as that which we have here, where denial of the act, not consent is at issue, evidence of consensual intercourse between defendant and complainant is limited to evidence of an act close enough in time to account for the objective signs of intercourse and is further limited to the purpose of explaining the presence of those objective signs. However, a defendant cannot engage in the wide-ranging and harassing cross examination the statute legitimately prohibits.</blockquote>

Although the Commonwealth now argues that the offer of proof in support of the Appellant’s motion is insufficient to meet the test set forth in <em>Majorana, </em>it did not do so before the trial court. Instead, the Commonwealth indicated that a hearing would be necessary to determine the credibility of the Appellant’s witness who allegedly had sexual relations with the victim near the time of the incident. The sole contention of the Commonwealth was that this witness did not in fact have sexual relations with the victim. Thus, the Commonwealth was arguing that the court would have to determine the credibility of the testimony offered.</p>

The majority is sufficiently impressed with appellant’s offer of proof that an individual was alleged to have had sexual relations with the victim <em>“around the time </em>of the alleged rape,” at 603 to remand the case to the trial court to hear testimony on this issue. However, as Justice Papadakos makes clear, “around the time” in this case meant <em>possibly </em>on the same weekend although the individual <em>“couldn’t remember </em>whether he had sexual relations with her that weekend or not.” Dissenting op. at 608. That nebulous offer — that someone else allegedly <em>may have had </em>sexual relations with the victim that same weekend, <em>but maybe not </em>— may be enough, the majority reasons, to override the explicit and unambiguous protections for the rape victim enacted by the Rape Shield Law, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3104, an enactment that was long overdue and <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>apparently soon to be forgotten.

I fear that by remanding to the trial court with instructions to apply <em>Marjorana, </em>thereby possibly permitting the introduction of vague assertions of the victim’s alleged past sexual conduct in this case (where the trial court found those assertions to be lacking in reliability and probative value), the watering-down of the Rape Shield Law begun in <em>Majorana </em>will become a torrent that will likely erode that law beyond recognition and render it impotent. The ease with which such a “defense” (consisting of vague assertions of the rape victim’s sexual activity roughly near the time of the alleged rape) may be fabricated by a desperate defendant and his friends subjects every rape victim to “the travesty of presenting a noisome stream of defense witnesses testifying to the sexual propensities, often sordid and sometimes fanciful, of the complaining witness.” <em>Commonwealth v.

In Majorana, we substantially limited the use of evidence of this nature by requiring that it be related close enough in time to the alleged rape and mandating that the evidence be relevant to the incident in question. The proposed evidence is vague and tentative, at best, and does not even establish that another sexual act occurred. <em>Majorana </em>dictates that evi<a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>dence of a victim’s prior sexual relations “should be admitted, subject to the usual rules of admissibility of evidence, in particular, the balancing of probative value against prejudicial effect.” <em><a href="/pa/503/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="503 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="1785960" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0602-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/503/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="503 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="1785960" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0602-01">503 Pa. at 611</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="503 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="1785960" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0602-01">470 A.2d at 85</a>. To permit the Appellant to introduce evidence of such a vague and unspecified nature would result in substantial prejudice to the victim and would reintroduce the very evils which the Rape Shield Law was designed to prevent.</p>

There was no abuse of discretion or error of law committed by the trial court. There is ample support in the record for the trial judge’s determination to deny Appellant’s offer of proof contained in his motion in limine and in the notes of testimony at pages 3 to 15. The offer is insufficient in that it lacks a relevant, material connection between the alleged intercourse prior to the rape and the presence of internal <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>bruising and seminal acid phosphatase in the victim’s panties, the offer was, therefore, properly rejected.
