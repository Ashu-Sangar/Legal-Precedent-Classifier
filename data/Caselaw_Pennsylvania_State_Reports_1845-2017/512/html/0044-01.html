Thus, on remand of this matter the Board must take into account the four-year delay which occurred in determining whether the Board had failed to exercise due diligence and whether Kindle had been prejudiced thereby.</p>

Commonwealth Court performs a unique and important function in our system in that it has direct responsibility for supervising most administrative agencies and boards in the Commonwealth. See, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 761-764. Maintaining a proper relationship between that Court and the agencies or <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>boards is, therefore, crucial. Commonwealth Court should not be hamstrung in its efforts to carry out legitimate supervisory functions when it acts within reasonable parameters. One need not subscribe to certain elaborate theories <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> to recognize that it is often essential for courts to confine agency discretion through the adoption of explicit guidelines, or by requiring that agencies themselves adopt rules or adhere to fair and regular procedures. That is what Commonwealth Court attempted to do here. When its prior messages were ignored, Commonwealth Court felt compelled to send a message to the effect that where there was an unexcused delay of the length that occurred here, prejudice would be presumed <em>per se, </em>and laches would be applicable on the face of the record. We should ordinarily permit them to so rule. <em>Commonwealth Court has not established its own statute of limitations </em>because a delay of less than what occurred here may or may not constitute laches, and a greater delay may still be permitted where a valid excuse is presented or appears in the record, or where the presumption of prejudice is rebutted. In other words, Commonwealth Court did not establish a laches <em>per se </em>rule, which might well be the equivalent of a statute of limitations. All that Commonwealth Court did was to determine that under the facts of this case, the lengthy delay here would be presumed to have established the fact of prejudice to Appellee, <em>per se.</em>

Historically, of course, Commonwealth Court’s <em>per se </em>rule, which it adopted here, is not unusual or unprecedented.
