As noted in our first opinion in this case, the fact that the trial court chose to impose a jail term on only one of the convictions, which was the oldest of the charges being challenged on statute of limitations grounds, invites the conclusion that the court did not intend Goldhammer to serve a jail term at all. On the other hand, review of the transcript from the hearing on the motion to modify sentence manifests a clear intention that Goldhammer serve a jail term. The motion to modify was primarily an attack upon Goldhammer’s sentence to a term of imprisonment. While the court did modify one sentence from a term of imprisonment of 1-5 years to a term of 5 years’ probation, the sentence of imprisonment on the other information was modified from 1-5 years to 2-5 years. The reason given was the court’s belief that this modification would accelerate Goldhammer’s eligibility for parole consideration. The court, emphasizing that the circumstances of the crime called for punishment, rejected the plea that Goldhammer be spared any imprisonment. Under the circumstances, we accept the Commonwealth’s invitation to remand the matter to the sentencing court for reconsideration in light of Gold-hammer’s discharge, on appeal, on the only information where a jail term was imposed.</p>

The Superior Court denied relief and the Commonwealth filed a petition for allowance of appeal in this Court, which was granted. The Commonwealth’s primary argument on appeal concerned the statute of limitations issue. In the alternative, however, the Commonwealth requested, as it had in the Superior Court, a remand for resentencing on remaining valid theft convictions. This Court affirmed the Superior Court on the statute of limitations issue and also held that the requested remand would violate double jeopardy. <em>Commonwealth v.

We have never recognized a right to appeal a legal sentence. In the instant case neither side has at any point contended that the sentencing scheme established is illegal or involves an improper exercise of discretion. In his appeal to the Superior Court Mr. Goldhammer sought to challenge only his underlying theft and bribery convictions. Moreover, at the time of sentencing there was no statutory authorization for an appeal <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>challenging the discretionary aspects of a sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Thus, under the laws in force in Pennsylvania when Mr. Gold-hammer was sentenced, the Commonwealth was not entitled to appellate review of the sentences in question.</p>
    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[293,471,1138,1212]]]'>The above conclusion is critical in answering the United States Supreme Court’s second question, <em>i.e., </em>whether <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">supra,</a> </em>is applicable under the circumstances of this case. <em>DiFrancesco </em>concerned a challenge to a federal statute which permitted the government to seek enhancement of a sentence imposed upon a “dangerous special offender” by authorizing an appeal to the court of appeals. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203576" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 3576">18 U.S.C. § 3576</a>. The United States Supreme Court held that the statute did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const, amend. 5. The rationale expressed by that Court for that conclusion was that the defendant could have no legitimate expectation of finality in the original sentence because it was subject to a government appeal. <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">supra</a> </em><a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">449 U.S. at 136</a>, 101 S.Ct. at 437. Pennsylvania had no comparable statute and, as noted above, there was no authority in our statutes or case law for an appeal of a sentence within prescribed limits. Where the defendant appeals his conviction but does not challenge the sentence imposed thereon, only the conviction is exposed. Thus, unlike the defendant in <em>DiFrancesco, </em>Mr. Goldhammer was entitled to rely on the finality of his sentence absent a determination on appeal that his convictions were invalid.</p>

    <p id="b644-4" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[284,435,1140,949]]]'>In addition to the double jeopardy violation, there are two adequate and independent state grounds for reinstating our order in this matter. First, the Commonwealth is precluded from complaining that Mr. Goldhammer should be resentenced on the suspended counts by this Commonwealth’s well-established doctrine of waiver. <em>See Commonwealth v. Clair, </em><a href="/pa/458/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="458 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="479736" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0418-01">458 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A.2d 272</a> (1974). When the sentencing court suspended sentence on <em>110 </em>of Mr. Goldhammer’s convictions, the Commonwealth, although undoubtedly aware of the statute of limitations issue raised in this case, stood mute. <em>See </em>RR130a (N.T. April 8, 1981, at 57). Then, after Mr. Goldhammer’s statute of limitations challenge was sustained by the Superior Court, the Commonwealth questioned, for the first time, the propriety of the suspended sentences. It is settled law that an issue will not be considered for the first time on appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> Pa.R.A.P. 302; <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.6",644,[274,1411,1150,683]]]'>The second, and even more fundamental, state ground barring the Commonwealth from demanding resentencing is the fact that the Commonwealth prevailed in the Superior •Court on the convictions that were not barred by the statute of limitations. Given the present posture of this matter, the Commonwealth must be viewed as attempting to appeal a decision in its favor. We have not in the past permitted such an anomaly. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Vanders Richardson, </em>No. 1412 E.D. Allocatur Dkt. 1985. The convictions on which sentence was suspended, which were not appealed to this Court, are not properly before us. Therefore the Commonwealth can establish no predicate for relief under Pennsylvania Law.</p>
