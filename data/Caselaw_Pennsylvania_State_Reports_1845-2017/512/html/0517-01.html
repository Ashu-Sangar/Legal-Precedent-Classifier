The panel vacated the order of the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas and remanded the case with directions to enter a decree terminating appellant’s parental rights. On December 30, 1980, Catholic Social Services of the Diocese of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Inc. (appellee) petitioned for involuntary termination of appellant’s parental rights to Baby Boy A. pursuant to Section 311 of the Adoption Act, Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, 1 P.S. § 311.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Common Pleas concluded that <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>appellee had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that appellant’s conduct justified a termination of his parental rights.

Therefore, as a matter of law, appellee has met its burden of proof on the issue of abandonment. It could not show more than appellant’s total failure to act. Because this inaction persisted for a period of time beyond the statutory six months, Common Pleas erred in determining that appellee had not shown abandonment. Furthermore, on this record there, is no evidence that the child’s interests are better served by continuing appellant’s parental rights. Accordingly, the order of Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

Although appellant’s illiteracy hindered his meaningful participation in his child’s life while he was in prison, we are unwilling to hold that the law expects nothing from him at all. We are mindful that the fact-finding function is reserved to Common Pleas; however, the record shows that appellant did nothing to even attempt to fulfill his parental responsibilities prior to his release on parole.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Even an illiterate prisoner can show some interest in his child’s well-being and we now hold the law of Pennsylvania requires him to do so if he wishes to retain an absolute right to parental status unaffected by the consideration of how ill-served the child’s interest is by that tie.</p>

This Court has frequently held that parenthood is an active occupation. It is not enough that a parent declines to relinquish parental claim to a child; a parent must affirmatively demonstrate love, protection and concern. A parent desiring to retain parental rights must exert himself to take and maintain a place of importance in his child’s life. <em>In re L.A.G., </em><a href="/pa/490/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="490 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1763837" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0085-01">490 Pa. 85</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="490 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1763837" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0085-01">415 A.2d 44</a> (1980).

    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[163,430,1141,1270]]]'>Common Pleas found that appellant’s efforts in late 1980 served to defeat appellee’s position and apparently excused the prior period of inaction on the basis of the obstacles facing appellant. However, “[i]t is well established that once the statutory period of abandonment has passed, mere renewal of interest and expression of desire for the return of a discarded child do not negate the abandonment.” <em>In re In the Matter of J.F., a Minor, </em><a href="/pa/487/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="487 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1759091" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0115-01">487 Pa. 115</a>, 123-25, <a href="/pa/487/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="487 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1759091" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0115-01">408 A.2d 1382</a>, 1387 (1979). The wise requirement that a parent’s right to a relationship with his child can only be terminated on clear and convincing evidence does not make parents owners of their children, free to cast them aside, as unwanted toys, for more than six months and then pick them up to play with again when the fancy strikes them. Instead, it arises out of our deep conviction that the bond of family love will enable most parents to give better care to their children than the best that anyone else can provide. Our confidence in that conviction is lost, however, when a parent exhibits no sign of interest in his child over extended periods. Thus, appellant’s efforts during his release on parole<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> do not serve to nullify the inaction of the prior fifteen months. This is especially true because those efforts were primarily directed toward finding the child’s mother, not the child.</p>

Common Pleas, having determined that appellee had not met its burden of proof, did not consider the interests of the child. We conclude, however, that on this record it would be an abuse of discretion to find that the child’s welfare justified continuation of appellant’s parental rights. The hearing on the termination petition was held on July 23, 1981, and the Decree Nisi was filed on July 13, 1982. On February 10, 1984, Common Pleas filed its Opinion Sur Exceptions dismissing appellee’s exceptions and making the decree final. Superior Court filed its opinion on December 21,1984. The child is now more than seven years old and there is no evidence that there has ever been any relationship between appellant and the child. Following appellant’s abandonment of his child, there was, in fact, no evidence of any relationship which served the child’s interest and, therefore, should be preserved. <em>See In re William L., </em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">477 Pa. 322</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">383 A.2d 1228</a> (1978) (children had been in foster care for several years and disruption of the family had already occurred; Court refused to continue to keep children in uncertainty of foster care). As we did in <em>Adoption of David C., </em>we conclude on this record that there is no evidence showing that the child’s welfare is better served by continuing appellant’s parental rights beyond the time of abandonment in light of his failure to perform his parental duties.</p>
