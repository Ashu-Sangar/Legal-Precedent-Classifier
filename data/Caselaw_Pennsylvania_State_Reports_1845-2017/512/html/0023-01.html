South Hills Village is a large enclosed shopping mall in suburban Pittsburgh.

It was opened in 1964; appellee has owned it since 1982. The mall has a uniform policy of forbidding all political solicitation and appellants’ request was denied. Rather than risk criminal prosecution by soliciting signatures in the face of this policy, appellants filed a complaint in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. They sought to enjoin appellee from enforcing its no political solicitation policy on the ground that it violated their speech and petition rights under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Pa.

Both statistics and common experience show that business districts, particularly in small and medium sized towns, have suffered a marked decline. At the same time, shopping malls, replete with creature comforts, have boomed. These malls have begun to serve as social as well as commercial outlets for the communities they serve. Young people often come to a mall to socialize with their peers. Older people come to enjoy the parklike atmosphere offered in many malls or to view displays erected in the corridors. Members of the community have an opportunity by chance or design to mix, meet and converse. However, these social benefits are ancillary to the commercial purpose of shopping malls and do not involve organized campaigns on particular issues by political or special interest groups. Law and sociology are not coextensive. Though shopping malls may fulfill some of the societal functions of the traditional main street or town market place, we do not believe that this makes them their legal equivalent. Nor does it yet require them to provide a political forum for persons or groups with views on public issues, so long as the owner does not grant unfair advantage to particular interests or groups by making his premises arbitrarily available to those he favors while excluding all others.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

This statute expresses the legislative judgment, of the type discussed above, that <em>in some conditions </em>private property interests are not protected by the power of the state to impose criminal penalties.

I am skeptical, however, of the step in the reasoning of <em>Tate </em>by which the Court assumed that “lawful conditions” imposed by an owner of private property must necessarily be consistent with the limitations on government action dictated by the First Amendment and Article 1, § 7. <em>See </em><a href="/pa/495/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="495 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1770779" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0158-01">495 Pa. at 174</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="495 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1770779" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0158-01">432 A.2d at 1390</a>.

I join in the conclusion that “[tjhese rights are specifically reserved to the people; <em>each inhabitant of </em>
      <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>
      <em>the Commonwealth, </em>____” (emphasis added). At 31. Thus, the limitation in federal constitutional decisions to matters involving “state action” is not applicable in an analysis where it is alleged that one of these rights conferred under our constitution has been violated. <em>See Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. v. Insurance Commissioner of Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/505/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="505 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1788868" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0571-01">505 Pa. 571</a>, 585, <a href="/pa/505/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="505 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1788868" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0571-01">482 A.2d 542</a>, 549 (1984). (Language of Pennsylvania Constitution, not “state action” test, controls its applicability.) To this extent, I am in complete agreement with the view expressed in the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[171,847,1141,628]]]'>My departure begins with the statement, “[t]he adjustment of these rights among private parties, however, is not necessarily a matter of constitutional dimensions.” At 1335. When it is applied in this situation, where the issue requires a definition of the right in a given context, it is obviously a question of constitutional dimension. Once a constitutional right is recognized, any claim that its protection has been denied requires a determination of the breadth of that protection. The most frivolous claim of an illegal search, denial of free speech, deprivation of due process, etc., still requires decisions with constitutional implications.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.6",87,[170,1492,1140,511]]]'>This initial disagreement occasions my further departure from the suggested analysis employed by the plurality in adjusting these constitutional disputes between individuals. As recognized in <em>Commonwealth v. Tate, </em><a href="/pa/495/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="495 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1770779" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0158-01">495 Pa. 158</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="495 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1770779" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0158-01">432 A.2d 1382</a> (1981), a balancing process is required which should attempt to maximize each side’s enjoyment of the respective rights claimed. Such an accommodation requires careful analysis. An implied premise that private ownership must prevail is antithetical to the objective that should be achieved.</p>
    <p id="b87-7" data-blocks='[["BL_87.7",87,[170,2029,1139,254]],["BL_88.1",88,[264,276,1140,737]]]'>Private ownership is a generic term for many different relationships. For instance, it embraces residences, nonprofit ventures, and purely commercial ventures; it also encompasses different levels of public involvement. In this instance we are faced with the type of private ownership <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>which is comparable to the main commercial area in a given community, a place that has traditionally been an accepted forum for the appropriate expression and exchange of ideas, political and otherwise. The mere fact that it is privately owned should not be the controlling factor in the judgment to be made in this decision. Political expression, even though it may be unpopular at any given time, is certainly one of the rights that fall within the penumbra of rights articulated under our Declaration of Rights. When it is established that it is done in an unobtrusive and orderly fashion, without harrassment to those who do not wish to engage in such an exchange, I do not find the basis for concluding that the mere fact that the area is privately owned would necessarily preclude the activity.</p>
    <p id="b88-4" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[266,1035,1137,150]]]'>Accordingly, I believe that we should direct our trial courts to employ the balancing test in future cases such as these to attempt to accommodate the competing interests.</p>
