Sentencing was deferred pending the filing and disposition of post-trial motions which were argued before a court <em>en banc </em>and denied on November 2, 1983. Appellant was sentenced to death on the homicide conviction, ten to twenty years on the burglary conviction, two and one-half to five years on the weapons conviction, and ten to twenty years on the rape conviction.

That meeting never took place. After completing the phone conversation, since Nicky’s mother had left for work, Nicky locked the door, as she had routinely done every morning. From a vantage point across the street, Appellant saw Nicky’s mother leave for work. He proceeded across the street and was let in the Caserta home by Nicky. Appellant was well known to Nicky because he and Nicky’s aunt were living together nearby. Appellant asked Nicky to go upstairs and look for a pair of pliers for him. As soon as Nicky went up the steps, Appellant locked the front door and followed her. Appellant then grabbed Nicky and when she began screaming, forced tissue in her mouth, wrapped a sweater around her face, and had sexual intercourse with her. Upon completing this crime, Appellant commanded Nicky to dress. Due to the child’s hysterical state of mind, she put her parochial school uniform on backwards, sending Appellant into a violent rage which resulted in him dragging the child to the basement.</p>

Upon arriving home from work, Paul and Marie Piccone noticed that their house was in complete disarray, their daughter’s lunch money and house keys were untouched, and a chair had been placed against the basement door. Further investigation revealed the child’s body. The police were summoned immediately. Police investigators found the body with a T-shirt and an electrical cord wrapped tightly around the neck, multiple tears to the vagina and rectum, and eighteen stab wounds to the chest area. Dr. Fillinger, the medical examiner, confirmed these findings and ruled death by homicide.</p>

Ms. Kelleher phoned Appellant and requested him to come to the Sex Crimes Unit for questioning regarding this rape allegation. Appellant agreed and upon his arrival fifteen minutes later, he gave his name and asked someone in the hall who he was supposed to see. Officer Carol Keenan then approached Appellant. She testified that he had no difficulty walking or talking, nor did he appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. While Appellant was speaking with Officer Keenan, Detective Chitwood and Sergeant Rosenstein approached Appellant and advised him that there were two warrants for his arrest on charges of rape.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> However, they did not, at this time, tell him the names of the victims.</p>

Both <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>Officers also testified that Appellant appeared normal, not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and he was generally alert and responsive. At 10:51 p.m., background information was obtained from Appellant and he was advised that he would be questioned about the homicide of Nicky Caserta, as he was the prime suspect. Appellant was fully advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He was told that he had the right to remain silent and not say anything at all, anything he said could be used against him, he had a right to speak to an attorney <em>before </em>questioning and to have an attorney present during questioning, if he could not afford an attorney, one would be provided free of charge, if he chose to give a statement, he could stop at any time he wished.

Upon completion of the written statement, Detective Chitwood read it back to Appellant and then gave it to Appellant to read. The Officers required Appellant to read portions of the statement out loud to assure themselves that he, in fact, could read.

The gist of section 9711(d)(8) is the separate intent to inflict pain as well as the intent to take a life. Such an intent can be determined either by the express admission of such a purpose or can be determined circumstantially from the events surrounding the killing.

In <em>Pursell, </em>we held that torture encompasses the “infliction of a considerable amount of pain and suffering on a victim which is unnecessarily heinous, atrocious, or cruel manifesting exceptional depravity.” <em><a href="/pa/508/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="508 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1794003" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0212-01">Id.,</a> </em>508 Pa. at 239, 495 A.2d at 196. The <em>Pursell </em>definition requires the pain and suffering imposed on a victim to be <em>unnecessary, </em>or more than needed to effectuate the demise of the victim. Moreover, in <em>Pursell </em>there was circumstantial evidence in the form of mutilation from which an intent to cause unnecessary pain or distress could be inferred. Such evidence is not present on this record. As Mr. Justice Zappala points out in his dissent, the lack of intent does not make the present crime less heinous or horrible. The <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>legislature however, has defined the aggravating circumstance in question by the term “torture” instead of the broader and more flexible term “heinous.”</p>
    <p id="b363-5" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[174,442,1142,951]]]'>The instant case poses the problem whether the actions of a bumbling murderer, unable to quickly realize his ghastly scheme, constitute torture. Appellant finally stabbed his victim to death after attempts at strangling with his hands, a T-shirt and a cord had failed. Albeit gruesome, the steps taken by the appellant were calculated solely to kill the victim. Accordingly, the <em>Pursell </em>definition of torture, requiring unnecessary pain and suffering, has not been satisfied. The record here excludes mitigating circumstances. The presentation of an improper aggravating circumstance to a jury, required to return a death sentence if aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, necessarily introduces an arbitrary and possibly unconstitutional factor into the determination of death. <em>Commonwealth v.

I dissented from this characterization of torture because it impermissibly expanded the limited circumstance provided for by the Legislature in § 9711(d)(8). I continue to believe that the definition of torture must be more carefully circumscribed. The importance of distinguishing between offenses committed by means of torture and acts which are heinous, atrocious, or cruel is demonstrated by the jury’s finding of the aggravating circumstance of torture in the instant case.</p>

As I noted in <em>Pursell, </em>the legislature specifically rejected an amendment phrasing the aggravating circumstance in terms of the murder being “especially heinous,” and opted for the present terminology, that the offense was “committed by means of torture.” I reiterate my observation that these two categories are not co-extensive. While all torture may by definition be considered to be heinous, atrocious, or cruel, not all heinous, atrocious, or cruel conduct is torture. This Court exceeds its authority by ignoring the restrictive terms chosen by the General Assembly and making the death penalty applicable to a broader range of cases. In addition to usurping the legislative prerogative of defining the narrow circumstances appropriate for the imposition of capital punishment, by allow<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>ing for an expansive definition of statutory language the Court rapidly approaches a point where the aggravating circumstance is applied without meaningful guidance. Although the statement by the Appellant cited by the majority demonstrates that the Appellant intended to cause the death of the victim, he did not act with the intention to cause pain and suffering through the continued or prolonged infliction of physical or mental abuse upon the victim. Until such a distinction is drawn, juries will continue to impose the death penalty upon a finding of torture for particularly gruesome and offensive murders, as it did in the instant case. As a result, this Court will have created the very risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action by juries which the Constitution forbids and which the Legislature painfully sought to avoid by carefully delineating the circumstances under which the death penalty may be imposed.</p>
