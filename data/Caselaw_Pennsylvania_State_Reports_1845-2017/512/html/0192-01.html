The DER was informed that a sludgey solid waste was being dumped on appellee’s property, where a few months before some oily waste had been deposited. The inspectors had no way of knowing, therefore, whether the waste was “hazardous” or “non-hazardous,” “residual,” “agricultural,” or “municipal” as those terms are defined in the Act. 35 P.S. § 6018.103. That was one of the critical reasons why inspection was so important. Moreover, the definitions of the various recognized types of waste are not mutually exclusive. “Hazardous waste” includes “sludge from an industrial or other waste water treatment plant” and “solid, liquid, semisolid or contained gaseous material resulting from municipal, commerical, industrial, institutional, mining or agricultural operations,” and “solid waste” includes “municipal, residual or hazardous wastes” of “solid, liquid, semisolid or contained gaseous materials.” <em><a href="/us/452/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="452 U.S. 594" data-case-ids="1313625" data-case-paths="/us/452/0594-01">Id.</a> </em>The “affidavit for issuance of process” accompanying the criminal complaint in this matter states that the DER had received information that “material (presumably sewage sludge)” had been dumped on appellee’s property. “Sewage sludge” is certainly “solid waste” within the definition of that term, and could also be “hazardous waste” if, “because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical or infectious characteristics may: (1) cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality ...; or (2) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. ...” 35 P.S. § 6018.103. Because of appellee’s actions in refusing to allow DER inspectors to take samples on April 22, 1982, there is no way of knowing whether “sewage sludge” had in fact been dumped and, if so, whether it was “hazardous” or, as the majority phrases it, “ordinary solid waste.”</p>
