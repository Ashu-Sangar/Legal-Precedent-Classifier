Officer Young of the Wellsboro Police Department observed a Chevrolet traveling in gross excess of the posted speed limit at 12:40 A.M. on January 30, 1983, in Wellsboro. He entered his cruiser and gave chase. As the pursued vehicle was entering a curve about a quarter of a mile ahead of him he saw its brake lights go on and observed that it was over the center line of the highway. On rounding the curve he saw that the pursued vehicle had collided with a vehicle in the oncoming lane. He entered the Chevrolet first and observed Mr. Griscavage. He was slumped over the wheel and bleeding profusely from a severe laceration of the forehead. The <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>officer talked with him and noticed “an odor of alcohol emanate from his person.” An ambulance arrived and removed both seriously injured drivers to a hospital for treatment. The officer remained and observed skid marks approximately fifty feet long which crossed the center line and ended at the point of impact in the oncoming lane. He observed that the road surface was dry and that there had been some overcast that evening. At some time between 1:19 A.M. and 2:32 A.M. Officer Young spoke to Mr. Griscavage in the emergency room of the hospital. He informed him of his rights and requested that he submit to a blood/alcohol test. During the brief conversation the officer asked if he had been drinking. To which he replied that he had “had a few”. He also asked appellee why he had been traveling so fast. He responded that he guessed he was “in a hurry to get home.” <em>Griscavage, </em><a href="/pa-super/336/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="336 Pa.

Similarly, the court considered the .09% blood/alcohol test result in isolation and concluded that "A result between .05% and .10% therefore indicates at most that the person had been drinking. It does not allow an inference to be made that the person was under the influence.” <em>Commonwealth v. Griscavage, </em><a href="/pa-super/336/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="336 Pa. Super. 141" data-case-ids="622211" data-case-paths="/pa-super/336/0141-01">336 Pa.Super. 141</a>, 152, <a href="/pa-super/336/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="336 Pa. Super. 141" data-case-ids="622211" data-case-paths="/pa-super/336/0141-01">485 A.2d 470</a>, 476 (1984). The text of the statute with respect to that degree of alcohol toxicity states that it: "... shall not give rise to any presumption that the person tested was or was not under the influence of alcohol <em>but this fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol.” </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(d)(2) (emphasis added). The Superior Court in failing to recognize the statute’s qualification mischaracterized the import of the statute. A correct construction is to the effect that when combined with other competent evidence of the person’s drinking, including observations of witnesses, admissions and the manner in which the person operated the automobile, a blood/alcohol test result higher than .05% but less than .10% allows the trier of fact to find that a defendant was "under the influence” beyond a resonable doubt.</p>
