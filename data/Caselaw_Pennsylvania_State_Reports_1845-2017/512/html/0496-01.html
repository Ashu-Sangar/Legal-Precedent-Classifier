This difference is of no significance, however, because the basis for the decisions in those cases, the constitutionally established structure of the relationship between the Board and the Court, requires the same result here. The Board is an independent body. Its only contact with the Court, aside from the power of the Court to appoint certain of its members and to prescribe rules of procedure, is the recommendation of disciplinary action accompanied by the filing of the record of the proceedings <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>leading to that recommendation. Absent a recommendation for the Court to act the Board presents no matter or proceeding for the Court’s consideration.

In fact, it is argued, disclosure of the records would better serve some of these interests. The Commission observes that according to the Rules of Procedure governing matters before the Board, once an investigation has proceeded beyond the preliminary stage, the judge in question must be notified of the complaint and the identity of the complainant. The judge may also attend all proceedings, where he would have the opportunity to become aware of the identity of other witnesses. Where, as here, all proceedings before the Board have been <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>completed, there is said to be no further need to protect the complainant and other witnesses against reprisal.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[137,380,1140,780]]]'>As for the protection of a subject judge from publicity surrounding unfounded complaints, it is argued that this rationale for keeping Board proceedings confidential is no longer meaningful after the time when frivolous complaints are separated from meritorious ones. Once the Board has found cause to proceed beyond a preliminary investigation to a formal hearing, the complaint can no longer be viewed as “unfounded”, even if the charges ultimately are disproved. The publication of purported excerpts from the proceedings in the case at bar, is said to further undermine this reason for continued confidentiality. Indeed the reason is argued to be better served by disclosure of the full record, to counter possible misconceptions caused by the incompleteness and potential inaccuracy of the excerpts published.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.6",547,[137,1180,1139,679]]]'>Finally, it is likewise argued that concern for public confidence in the judiciary as an institution is no longer a reason for barring disclosure of disciplinary proceedings once it has been determined that the claims are not groundless. It is further argued that the Board’s insistence on keeping its records confidential, in the face of published reports on some testimony indicating judicial misconduct, has itself generated public concern, suspicion, and distrust. According to this argument release of the full body of information leading to exoneration would further the goal of maintaining public confidence in the judiciary, whereas continued secrecy can only frustrate that goal and perpetuate destructive suspicion founded on ill-informed rumor.</p>

This Court may not routinely examine the purposes and policies underlying the law as enunciated in the Constitution to determine whether that law should be applied or not. It is only when a <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>constitutional precept contends with a precept of equal or greater authority that such an analysis becomes appropriate. Then it devolves upon the Court to discern which should control the facts presented, by, among other things, assessing the purposes and policies underlying each. The Commission here asks us to set the express constitutional mandate of confidentiality against <em>its own </em>supporting rationale. Were we presented with a rule of law developed in the courts, we would of course be acting in the best spirit of the common law tradition in testing the rule against its reason. The requirement of confidentiality of Board proceedings, however, was established by the people of the Commonwealth as a constitutional rule of law and must be enforced as written until it is either amended or repealed by the appropriate constitutional process. We may no more refuse to apply this provision because it might appear to some to be no longer wise or purposeful than we might ignore the speech and debate privilege of members of the General Assembly found in Article 2, Section 15, or the right of individuals not to be compelled to give evidence against themselves, established in Article 1, Section 9. All are equally established in the fundamental statement of the law of the Commonwealth and all must be equally respected.</p>

The Commission claims that the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice requires the privilege of confidentiality to yield.

Only by overstating the breadth of the holdings in these cases, however, can the Commission bring this case within their authority.</p>

Although by the nature of the subject matter of its grant of authority the Commission may come under the umbrella concept of the state’s “interest in conducting law enforcement efforts,” it is by no means the equal of other interests under that umbrella such as a grand jury, or a prosecutor, or even a criminal defendant seeking access to information for use at trial. Stripped to its most basic elements this case presents a conflict between a constitutionally based privilege and a general statutory right of access.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In the framework of our governmental system it is clear that the constitutional rule of law is more fundamental and must prevail.</p>

The court suggested that the Commission might (a), report its findings to the Legislature along with recommended actions for statutory or constitutional changes; (b), conduct its own investigation and report to the Board with recommendations for further Board action or administrative relief; or (c), report its findings to the Attorney General or other appropriate prosecutor for fur<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>ther action. The Commission argues here that the first and last of these options are meaningless because without the record of the hearings before the Board, there can be no further investigation and thus no findings to report. The second option is said to miss the mark of the Commission’s purpose in conducting this investigation. The Commission points out that it is pursuing an investigation into public corruption in the hearings before the Board, not investigating charges of judicial misconduct. The Board record is argued to be the best evidence for the former purpose, while a separate inquiry into the same allegations pursued by the Board would be outside the scope of the Commission’s investigation.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[280,964,1139,1321]]]'>The Commission’s claim that “[t]he only possible avenue available for the Commission to pursue is to obtain the record of the Board’s proceedings to examine what certain persons said and did during those proceedings” (Brief at 42) rings hollow. In view of the fact that the Commission need not meet any burden of proof as would a prosecutor trying a case, but need only prepare a report of its findings and recommendations, any evidence which the Commission can obtain through its own investigation can serve a purpose. The Commission errs in assuming that it cannot fulfill its duties without ferreting out <em>all </em>evidence before reporting to the Legislature or executive agencies. Even if the “best evidence” is unavailable, and the evidence which is available would not suffice to sustain criminal charges, the investigative/reporting function of the Commission can be served. In this regard we observe that the Commission already has access to what are purported to be substantial portions of verbatim transcripts of the Board proceedings from the Philadelphia Inquirer. Though not the “best evidence” of the matter under investigation, these transcripts and others which might be obtainable from the Inquirer, along with other evidence the Commission might gather through independent investigation, could nevertheless be the basis of a meaningful report for other appropriate governmental units to act upon.</p>

The Commission argues that the court erred in both granting the motion to quash filed before any enforcement action was taken, and denying the petition for enforcement of the subpoena. Because the matters were consolidated for hearing and decision, the court unquestionably had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the subpoena.
