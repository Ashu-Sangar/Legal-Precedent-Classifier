      <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>The primary issue to be addressed in the instant appeal is whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony of the Commonwealth’s expert witness, a board certified pediatrician, as to the veracity of eight year old children who claim to have been the objects of sexual abuse. The issue arose in this case because the eight year old victim had testified to sexual contacts initiated by appellant. Specifically, the pediatrician testified that she had, during the preceding four years, treated approximately 90 to 100 cases per year of alleged sexual abuse. Following that testimony, the prosecutor posed to the pediatrician the following question:</p>
    <blockquote id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[209,909,1096,205]]]'>Based upon your experience and your pediatric specialization, does the medical literature say anything about children of the age of eight in giving complaints of sexual abuse or rape as far as their veracity?</blockquote>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.6",485,[165,1147,1138,357]]]'>Counsel for the defense objected to this question, and the court sustained the objection insofar as the reference to medical literature, but the court allowed the witness to answer the question with the proviso that the answer be based upon the witness’ own knowledge and experience alone. When the question was rephrased in this manner, the witness testified as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.7",485,[206,1532,1097,741]],["BL_486.1",486,[301,269,1096,421]]]'>I think there is a couple of points to be made and to be objective about this. The first is, do children lie when they are put under stress with members of the family? It is very unusual that a child would lie about sexual abuse. Having said that there are many articles I could bring in and submit to the court. Prepubertal children, which she fits into the category of essentially that, do not lie. The sexual abuse literature is fraught with articles, and prepubertal children usually do not lie about matters of sexual abuse no matter how chaotic or uncomfortable their home situation is, one, because they don’t know how to lie about it. They don’t know what to say. It’s not part of the life experience, so everything they say is something they have seen or experienced. It would be <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>very unusual for them to lie. I have seen one child in the four years that I have been doing this that I think was lying. She was a 16 year old girl, and I think she was lying for reasons of placement and so on, but I have not seen any younger children lie, and the articles, the medical literature articles bear that out. Even if she did, it would be very atypical. I can’t imagine if she was going to make up a lie that it would be about____</blockquote>
    <p id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[258,714,1138,470]]]'>Thus, although the physician persisted in making reference to the medical literature in her response to the question, the essence of her response was that, based upon her own experience, young children usually do not fabricate stories of sexual abuse because they do not have sexual knowledge sufficient to supply details regarding sexual encounters. Thus, the testimony consisted of expert opinion as to the veracity of the class of potential witnesses of which the victim was a member.</p>

For example, if testimony as to the veracity of various classes of people on particular subjects were to be permitted as evidence, one could imagine “experts" testifying as to the veracity of the elderly, of various ethnic groups, of members of different religious faiths, of persons employed in various trades and professions, etc. Such testimony, admitted as evidence, would encourage jurors to shift their focus from determining the credibility of the <em>particular </em>witness who testified at trial, allowing them instead to defer to the so-called “expert” assessment of the truthfulness of the class of people of which the particular witness is a member.
