Here, while the professional license itself is not an issue, the ability to participate in Medicaid is challenged on the same grounds. However, the Department here does not attempt to use the plea as a judicial admission of the fact of fraud. Rather, the conviction entered upon the plea itself is the operative fact which authorizes suspension. This evidence of the conviction itself is not affected by the procedure leading up to the plea, and it is admissible in this administrative proceeding.

In 1983, the Department changed its terminology to termination to reflect this. 13 Pa.Bull. 3655. Appellee was also prohibited from participating in the Medicaid program for three years for improper recordkeeping and billing practices, and for five years because the federal Department of Health and Human Services suspended him from Medicare. The three-year prohibition began on October 30, 1980. It was not contested in the Commonwealth Court proceedings and is therefore not before us. The five-year state prohibition based on the federal suspension was not part of this proceeding below. That period began on July 12, 1984. By its terms, appellee cannot participate in Medicaid until the federal authorities reinstate him in the Medicare program and in no event before February 18, 1987, when the prohibition based on the conviction expires. The separate appeal from that order, docketed in Commonwealth Court at No. 2899 C.D. 1984, has been discontinued. Thus, the only issue on this record is the five-year penalty based on appellee’s plea to the mail fraud charges. This period continues until February 18, 1987.</p>
