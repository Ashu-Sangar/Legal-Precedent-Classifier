In response to a motion filed <em>“ex proprio motu”, i.e. </em>“of his own accord”, by the District <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>Attorney of Lycoming County, Common Pleas issued a rule to show cause and then ordered appellant to appear at the office of the District Attorney for the purpose of submitting to a handwriting exemplar examination as requested by the Commonwealth. Because appellant raises a question of the court’s jurisdiction to entertain such a motion, we granted leave to appeal. We now hold that, while Common Pleas has jurisdiction to determine controversies of the general class to which this case belongs, it lacks the power to act until that jurisdiction has been invoked in accordance with the pertinent rules of criminal procedure. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 101.</p>

The juvenile testified that appellant had written the address of the place to be entered on a piece of paper, which was subsequently discovered on those premises by the police. Based on this testimony, the police continued to investigate the robbery and the District Attorney for Lycoming County served a “Motion to Compel Handwriting Exemplar” on appellant in order to compare his handwriting with the handwriting found at the victim’s residence.</p>

The court in <em>Gilbert </em>concluded that the taking of exemplars was not a “critical stage” of the criminal proceedings entitling petitioner to counsel. “Putting aside the fact that the exemplars were taken before the indictment and appointment of counsel, there is minimal risk that the absence of counsel might derogate from his right to a fair trial.” <em>Gilbert, </em><a href="/us/388/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="388 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="6168184" data-case-paths="/us/388/0263-01">388 U.S. at 267</a>, <a href="/us/388/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="388 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="6168184" data-case-paths="/us/388/0263-01">87 S.Ct. at </a>1653 (citing <em>United States v.
