On June 2, 1983, a criminal complaint was filed charging appellant with criminal homicide, robbery, burglary and theft by unlawful taking. A district justice conducted a preliminary hearing on those charges on June 15, 1983, and appellant was arraigned on July 22, 1983.</p>

The Commonwealth’s pretrial motions included a motion for consolidation of the escape charge with the homicide and related charges. The Court of Common Pleas of Hunting-don County granted a change of venue on September 21, 1983 and this Court directed that a jury be impanelled in Franklin County.

After deliberation as to the sentence to be imposed on the murder conviction, the jury returned a verdict of death, finding that the homicide was committed in the perpetration of a felony, and that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances proven by appellant. The Court of Common Pleas subsequently denied appellant’s post-verdict motions and sentenced him to death, four to ten years’ imprisonment on the robbery and burglary convictions, to be served concurrently but consecutive to the death sentence, and three to seven years’ imprisonment on the escape charge, to be served consecutive to the other sentences.

Prior to the escape another inmate, Earl Bortz, at the request of Donnie Summers, a third inmate and a friend of appellant’s, had telephoned Rodney Greenawalt of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, indicating that Greenawalt would be visited by “a friend from California.” Some time on March 25, 1983, appellant arrived in Lincoln Township, Huntingdon County, some fifteen miles south of SCIH. The details of the homicide which followed were provided by David Parks, another SCIH inmate, who had discussed the matter with appellant while occupying an adjoining cell. Appellant broke into and ransacked the cabin of the victim, Terry Hatch, while Hatch was out, and found a 16-gauge, single action shotgun on the premises, which he test-fired into a pillow, retrieving the shell casing. When Hatch returned, he was “ambushed” by appellant, who shot him in the back and again, after Hatch fell to the floor, in the neck/shoulder area. Appellant was able to find only one of the two shell casings produced by the shots.</p>

That evening appellant approached Laurie Gamber, a woman who had dated Donnie Summers, in a bar in Columbia, Lancaster County. Appellant told Gamber, who subsequently identified him at trial, he had escaped from SCIH and asked her to write to Summers. Appellant arrived at Rodney Greenawalt’s home in Potts-town the following day and remained there for about a week. During that time Greenawalt arranged, at appellant’s request, for the sale of the victim’s car and shotgun. At trial both Greenawalt and his wife, Sherry Ann, con<a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>firmed that they had received phone calls from Earl Bortz and identified appellant as their visitor.</p>

The police observed a trail of blood leading from the front porch of the victim’s cabin, around to the back steps, up the steps and into the bedroom where the body was found. The police retrieved the spent shell appellant had been unable to locate and the pillow into which appellant had initially fired the victim’s shotgun. It was determined after an autopsy that the victim died as a result of a massive hemorrhage caused by two large gunshot wounds.</p>

While there he read in the Huntingdon <em>Daily News </em>that the State Police were searching for a car, which matched the description of the one he had purchased, in connection with a murder. On April 3, 1983, after returning to the Pottstown area, Otter contacted the police and turned over the vehicle, providing the police information that led to appellant’s arrest on escape charges at a bar in Pottstown that same day. It was later established that the vehicle in question has been registered in the victim’s name. Appellant was taken to the State Correctional Institution at Graterford, where the police seized the blue jeans and athletic socks appellant had been wearing. A maroon jacket identified as belonging to the victim, which appellant had left at the bar where he was arrested, was subsequently turned over to the police. The shotgun sold by Green-wait at appellant’s request was also recovered and determined by ballistics experts to be the murder weapon.</p>

Nevertheless, appellant attempts to speculate that, because one prospective juror failed to respond during the group voir dire that he had prejudged the case, other jurors ultimately selected may have been untruthful as to their impartiality.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In view of defense counsel’s opportunity for the thorough examination of all venirepersons during individual voir dire, which did not exclude further inquiry into areas touched upon in the group questioning, we find this complaint to be without substance.</p>

The jury was sequestered upon arrival in the latter county.

Appellant claims that the consideration of mercy or leniency is precluded by the statute’s direction that the court instruct the jury that “the verdict must be a sentence of death of the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(iv). Although it is true that the Pennsylvania death penalty statute does not allow a jury to avoid imposition of a death sentence through the exercise of an unbridled discretion to grant mercy or leniency, the statute permits the defendant to introduce a broad range of mitigating evidence that can support the finding of one or more mitigating circumstances which may outweigh the aggravating circumstances found by the jury.

It must be noted first that the premise itself is false because, although the prosecution may ask the jury to find, on the basis of the evidence already adduced at the guilt-determination phase, that the first-degree murder was committed in the perpetration of a felony the commission of which the prosecution has already established, the crucial aspect of the aggravating circumstance, i.e., that the murder was committed in <em>perpetration of that felony </em>is not an essential element of the jury’s verdict of first degree murder.

The first argument appears to be based on the assumption that the legislature intended to limit the applicability of aggravating circumstance six to the felonies enumerated in the section of the Crimes Code defining second degree murder. <em>See </em>18 Pa. C.S. § 2502(b), (d). In the instant case the jury was instructed that it could consider only the robbery and burglary convictions. Both felonies fall within the definition of second degree murder. Thus even if appellant is correct he is not entitled to relief. “It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that a challenge to a statute may not be raised in the abstract but must find its basis in an injury to the party seeking to have the enactment declared constitutionally infirm.” <em>Commonwealth v.

This argument ignores the qualitative distinction between first and second degree murder. The essential element which distinguishes first degree from lesser grades of murder is specific intent to kill. <em>Commonwealth v.

This does not cause the system to be standardless any more than the jury’s decision to impose life imprisonment on a defendant whose crime is deemed insufficiently serious or its decision to acquit someone who is probably guilty but whose guilt is not established beyond a reasonable doubt.
