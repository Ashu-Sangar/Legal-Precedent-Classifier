These factors included the failed plea arrangement, defense counsel’s motion to strike the case from the January trial list and to have appellee formally arraigned and the shortage of judges available for trial in Erie County due to the illness of two judges and a vacancy on the bench. Hearings were held on February 9, 12 and 13, 1981 on the petition for extension of time. At these hearings, appellee testified that he was a college student; that he had read and signed the statement; and that, although he did not understand the statement he signed waiving his Rule 1100 right, he had sought assistance from no one while completing the A.R.D. application, including his father, who had accompanied him to the District Attorney’s office.</p>

The A.R.D. program is for the benefit of the defendant. After acceptance into and successful completion of the A.R.B. program, a defendant’s “slate is wiped clean.” The processing of A.R.D. applications by a district attorney’s office is an administrative task that is inherent in the program. To have a situation exist where a defendant seeks the benefits of A.R.D., but the processing time of the A.R.D. application runs against the Commonwealth, would preclude the use of the program. Therefore, we find that an applicant for A.R.D. can waive the processing time of an A.R.D. application and to that extent disapprove lancovetti.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

If after being advised of the right to counsel an A.R.D. applicant chooses to forego that right, we will not require a district attorney to assure that counsel be provided for the A.R.D. process. Again, the A.R.D. program is for the benefit of the defendant. Imposing the burden, on the district attorney, of assuring legal representation to every A.R.D. applicant would make the program logistically and financially burdensome to administer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
