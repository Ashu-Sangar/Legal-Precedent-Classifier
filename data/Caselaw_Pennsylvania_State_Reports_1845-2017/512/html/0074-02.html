The short and sufficient answer to appellees’ equal protection challenge is that sections 606(a) and 606(b) of the Act <em>do not create any classifications. </em>These provisions, on their face, apply equally and across the board to any and all potential violators of the substantive provisions of the Act. Section 606 sets forth a wide range of criminal penalties for violators of the Act, <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>ranging from summary offenses (with fines of $100-$1000 and imprisonment of not more than thirty days) to felonies of the first degree (with fines of $10,000-$50,000 per day per violation and imprisonment of two to twenty years). Sections 606(a) and 606(b) provide that a person or municipality who “violates any provision of this act, the rules and regulations of the department [DER], or any order of the department, or any term or condition of any permit” may, upon conviction, be found guilty of <em>either </em>a summary offense <em>or </em>a misdemeanor of the third degree, but, on their face, these provisions create no classifications. The provisions lie dormant unless and until a prosecutor or agency activates one or the other. Thus <em>the Act </em>does not, on its face, carve out classifications or single out any distinct class of persons for unequal treatment, but by its terms applies equally to all.</p>

In the former situation, once he determines that the proof will support conviction under either statute, his decision is indistinguishable from the one he faces in the latter context.

The legislature has reposed in the executive branch (DER, county health departments and municipalities) broad powers of and responsibilities for enforcement and has given the prosecutors a vast array of legal mechanisms with which to battle the tide of pollution and environmental catastrophe that has accompanied man’s “progress” toward a highly mechanized, industrial and disposable society. And, the legislature has instructed the courts that the “terms and provisions of [the Solid Waste Management Act] are to be liberally construed, so as to best achieve and effectuate the goals and purposes hereof.” Section 901, 35 P.S. § 6018.901. As one of the trustees of the public estate and this Commonwealth’s natural resources, we share the duty and obligation to protect and foster the environmental well-being of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Nevertheless, that Court itself has not expressly adopted the intermediate standard or three-tiered analysis except in cases involving gender based classifications. J. Nowak, R. Rotunda &amp; J. Young, <em>Constitutional Law </em>592-98 (2d ed. 1983). Absent an express adoption of this analysis and standard for federal constitutional purposes, I do not believe we should imply its adoption or consider it unless necessary to decide a particular case. Here it is no more necessary to the majority opinion than it was in <em>Fischer, Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board </em>and <em>Martin. </em>The majority correctly decides the case by applying the rational basis standard. I, therefore, join its reasoning, but disassociate myself from what I believe is unnecessary dictum concerning the general existence of three categories in analyzing equal protection cases.</p>
