In a felony murder I would hold that the murder and underlying felony are discrete, individual offenses, each punishable separately. If one comes, gun in hand, to rob and kill, or kills and then robs, he does two acts. Only fatuous lenity can excuse him for one and not the other.</p>

I write separately to indicate that authoritative decisions of the United States Supreme Court may require us, as a matter of federal constitutional law, to grant full retroactivity to a decision, <em>i.e., </em>apply it to cases on <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>collateral review, where the constitutional rights involved implicate the truth-determining process of the trial and where the later decision does not represent a clear break with the past. <em>See United States v.

Otherwise, I agree with Mr. Justice Larsen’s view that the <em>Cabeza </em>rule applies only to cases on direct appeal. Since the rule here involved does not come within the <em>Johnson </em>rationale, and <em>Cabeza </em>is certainly no broader, limiting the <em>Tarver </em>rule to direct appeals controls the result in this case. I therefore do not reach the issue of whether it is wrongly decided.</p>
