The guardian questions whether these infants’ placements are based upon financial rewards rather than a detached assessment of the relative merits of prospective adopters.

This case presents a pure question of law regarding the authority of the orphans’ court division, as protector of the adoption process, to disallow certain fees charged to adoptor parents by the intermediary agency. We will find an abuse of discretion where the lower court’s judgment is <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will, <em>Commonwealth v.

Firstly, the limitations ensure that children will be placed in homes that promote their needs and welfare, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2902. Although financial considerations are certainly a factor, placement of children in adoptive homes should not rest <em>solely </em>on the wealth of the adopters. Many homes with scarce financial resources are nevertheless adequate to provide the love, protection and support that children require. Secondly, the limitation upon expenses ensures that children are not bought and sold like commodities. As noted supra, sales of children contravene the public policy of this Commonwealth, and cannot be sanctioned by our courts. Thus, payments to or for natural parents by adopter parents are permissible when the payments are for services which directly benefit the child, such as medical expenses directly related to the birth. See, <em>Gorden v. Cutler, </em><a href="/pa-super/324/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="324 Pa. Super. 35" data-case-ids="595415" data-case-paths="/pa-super/324/0035-01">324 Pa.Super. 35</a>, <a href="/pa-super/324/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="324 Pa.

Such expenses are paid to ensure a safe birth and healthy infant, and not for the benefit of the mother, although the mother certainly receives an indirect benefit. Payments by adopter parents which do not directly benefit the child are impermissible.</p>
    <p id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[274,1820,1137,256]],["BL_499.1",499,[173,252,1138,203]]]'>As noted supra, expenses, which were charged to adopter parents and disallowed by the orphans’ court division, include fees for “counselling” natural mothers.

In some cases the exact dollar amounts were not available at the hearing, because they had not yet been billed.</p>
    <p id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.6",499,[171,489,1139,1057]]]'>The intermediary agency argues such charges to adoptor parents ought to be permitted on grounds the counselling benefits the child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The benefit to the child, it is argued, is the stability which will come from the natural mother’s settled decision to relinquish parental rights. While we cannot ignore the difficulties endured by children whose homelives are unsettled, we must conclude that any benefits from counselling natural mothers inure to the direct benefit of the natural mother and not to the child. The child is benefitted, if at all, only indirectly. Thus, payment by adoptive parents for counselling natural mothers in preparation for relinquishment of parental rights falls outside the guideline that permissible payments directly benefit the child. Moreover, one is left to wonder whether the same adoption agency can objectively counsel both the natural mothers and prospective adopters, as will be discussed infra, where the counselling fees seem to be connected to the adoption process. For these reasons, we cannot say that the orphans’ court division abused its discretion in disallowing such charges to adoptive parents.</p>
    <p id="b499-6" data-blocks='[["BL_499.7",499,[171,1570,1139,461]]]'>Some adoptor parents were also charged for expenses of transporting natural mothers to Pittsburgh and of housing the natural mothers for periods of up to ten and one-half weeks prior to the birth. Room and board were charged in two of the cases sub judice. In both cases, the natural mother’s home was outside the Pittsburgh area. Again, the intermediary agency argues that room and board were medically necessary; however, the record does not support this claim.</p>

      <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>Room and board were charged at the rate of $50 per week. Although the exact amounts of charges to adopters for these expenses are not included in the record in each case, it is interesting to note that in no case did the adopter couple house the mother of the infant they were to adopt. Of course, were adopter couples to house the natural mother whose child the adopters awaited at the adopters’ expense, such could arguably constitute a payment to the mother in anticipation of the transfer of the child in contravention of the criminal statute proscribing dealing in infants, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4305. Moreover, such an arrangement would raise questions about the voluntariness of the natural mother’s decision to relinquish parental rights. Therefore, adopter couples housed natural mothers of infants who were to be placed with different adopter couples. The costs of housing a natural mother were, however, borne by the adopter couple who would later obtain that mother’s infant. The lower court’s recognition of this attempted subterfuge and order that adopter parents be reimbursed by the agency for payments made on account of natural mothers’ housing expenses is a proper exercise of that court’s discretion.</p>
    <p id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[279,1446,1137,361]]]'>Other expenses paid by adopters for services to the mother include medical expenses wholly unrelated to the birth<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>, Lamaze classes, pre-natal care and sonograms. These expenses were all disallowed. Again, these expenses are not directly connected with the birth, and, thus, are outside the parameters of the traditional allowable expenses in adoption.</p>
    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[279,1828,1137,257]],["BL_501.1",501,[154,247,1140,999]]]'>Modern medical science is making great strides toward determining ideal developmental conditions for a fetus in útero. With the relatively recent understanding of nutrition, appreciation for the value of vitamins in the daily diet, and studies of the effects of cigarette smoking and alcohol <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>consumption, for instance, modern notions of ideal pre-natal care for infants are expanding. Are we then to sanction provision by adoptive parents of a halcyon environment and delectable foods for expectant mothers on the grounds these are beneficial to the child? If medical science were to determine that stress during pregnancy was inimical to the fetus, and an expectant mother’s employment was causing her stress, would prospective adopters be expected to employ an agency to find the mother a happier work environment, or perhaps simply support the mother during her pregnancy lest the added stress inhibit the baby’s development or effect his insufferable disposition? We think not. Services such as these, which directly benefit the natural mother, would naturally tend to influence the mother’s decision whether to relinquish her parental rights. This we cannot allow. The fact that the child may enjoy an indirect benefit from these services cannot provide a basis for permitting their provision for the mother at the expense of prospective adopters.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[155,1263,1139,892]]]'>Most adopters participated in infertility counselling and adoption counselling in a two-step process. First came infertility counselling. If, at the conclusion of the infertility counselling, the infertile couple desired to adopt, adoption counselling followed. Adoption counselling consisted of advice regarding advertising availability to adopt newborn children and warnings about a “black market” in adoptions. Although some of the adopters testified that this counsel-ling was a regular part of the adoption service, other adopters testified that counselling was optional. The court resolved this conflict in favor of a finding that counselling was required. One adoptive parent testified that the costs of adoption counselling were only billed to persons who adopted. Thus, the so-called counselling expenses are clearly an agency fee for an adoption, and not a fee for counsel-ling as such. Costs for counselling adopter parents range from $50-$75 per case.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.6",501,[157,2177,1139,97]],["BL_502.1",502,[288,266,1138,461]]]'>The intermediary agency argues the fees for counsel-ling prospective adopters are proper because Department of <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>Public Welfare regulations for licensed adoption agencies mandate the availability of counselling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> However, ensuring the <em>availability </em>of counselling to those who seek it does not mean <em>compelling </em>adoptive parents to avail themselves of that counselling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Certainly, where potential adopters voluntarily seek counselling services, they should pay fair value for those services.

Advertising for adoption has not been barred by the General Assembly and is certainly a legitimate means, in this society, of making one’s availability to adopt publicly known. The form of the ads in the instant case does not appear of record. Thus, we cannot determine whether the ads simply announced the availability of adopters, or whether they promoted the agency itself as the guardian’s brief suggests. Thus, the record does not support the lower court’s determination that advertising fees were improperly charged to adopter parents by the intermediary agency, and, on this record, this determination must be reversed.</p>

What seems clear from such a sliding scale, however, is that agencies will naturally be motivated to place babies with the adopters who can afford to pay the highest fee, and not necessarily with the family that can provide the most loving and supportive home. The charging of a fee based upon the income of the adoptor parents is per se illegal. It is the function of the orphans’ court division of the courts of common pleas to guard that adoptions do not provide a profit, for, when they do, someone is surely “dealing in humanity” in contravention of the criminal statute. We are satisfied that the court has properly discharged this function in the instant case by disallowing such.

    <p id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.7",511,[147,1217,1141,692]]]'>Because of these problems, I, like Superior Court, would vacate the Orphans’ Court’s order and remand all six cases to that Court with instructions to hold further hearings consistent with this opinion. In this way the Orphans’ Court could determine whether the fees paid by the adopting parents promoted the child’s welfare under the circumstances. Under this standard some fees, such as lying-in expenses, would clearly benefit the child, while others, such as the sliding scale fee, would provide no benefit to the child at all. This analysis, however, would provide more flexibility to the Orphans’ Court to look at all the circumstances when dealing with fees for less conclusive services such as room and board.</p>
