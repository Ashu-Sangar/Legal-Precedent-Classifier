The prothonotary acknowledged under oath that, although the notice of mailing the order subject to the filing of exceptions was docketed on August 12, 1983, it was not mailed to Appellant until August 15, 1983. Within ten days thereafter, on August 25, 1983, Appellant\u2019s exceptions were filed. To dismiss them as untimely filed on the strength of an admittedly false entry in the prothonotary\u2019s docket, is incredible.\nThe injustice in allowing Appellant\u2019s rights to be limited by the prothonotary\u2019s admitted error is so overwhelmingly clear as to render inescapable a reversal of the courts below. I would enter a per curiam reversal.\nLARSEN and FLAHERTY, JJ., join this dissenting opinion.",
