        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI join in reversing the determination of the Commonwealth Court in this case which held that the warrantless inspection of appellee William Fiore\u2019s hazardous waste disposal facility violated the Fourth Amendment. That court correctly identified the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S. 594, 101 S.Ct. 2534, 69 L.Ed.2d 262 (1981), as controlling. Donovan delineated the elements that must be present in order to justify a warrant-less administrative search under the \u201cColonnade-Biswell exception\u201d to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. In finding this exception inoperative in the instant case under section 608 of the Solid Waste Management Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 35 P.S. \u00a7 6018.608 (Supp.1985), the Commonwealth Court held:\nBecause none of [the Donovan] elements are present in the provisions currently before this Court, it must be held that any warrantless search conducted pursuant to their authority is unreasonable and, therefore, unconstitutional. Consequently, DER [the Department of Environmental Resources, appellant] has no legal right to enter Fiore\u2019s premises without first obtaining a search warrant.\nBased on the foregoing, DER\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction is denied.\n88 Pa.Cmwlth. at 425, 491 A.2d at 288.\nWe reverse this determination by Per Curiam Order and remand for further proceedings in light of this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Lutz, 512 Pa. 192, 516 A.2d 339 (1986) (Nix, C.J., concurring; Flaherty, J., concurring; Larsen, J., dissenting, joined by McDermott and Papadakos, JJ.). In Lutz, Justice Hutchinson, in his Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, approved (in dictum) warrantless administrative searches of hazardous waste facilities under Donovan and section 608 of the Act; however, with Chief Justice Nix concurring on non-constitutional grounds, this Court invalidated the warrantless administrative search of appellee Lutz\u2019s property which was perceived to involve an investigation or search only for \u201cordinary solid waste\u201d or non-hazardous waste. See Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, 512 Pa. at 195, 516 A.2d at 340. Justice Flaherty agreed that the search was invalid under the Fourth Amendment but viewed any discussion of the validity of a search of a hazardous waste facility as \u201cunnecessary and ... beyond the issue in this case.\u201d This author and Justices McDermott and Papadakos would have gone further and would have allowed warrantless administrative searches of all solid waste disposal facilities, including non-hazardous waste facilities, under Donovan and the inspection provisions of the Act.\nIt is apparent that the critical element viewed by Justice Hutchinson as lacking in Lutz, (i.e., the increased risks associated with hazardous wastes and the concomitant diminishment of the reasonableness of the expectations of privacy held by one involved with the disposal of such wastes), is present in the instant case. Although it is not spelled out explicitly in the Commonwealth Court opinion, this case involves the search of a hazardous waste facility to ascertain whether appellee Fiore was in compliance with a consent order regarding illegally stored hazardous wastes. Thus, by our determination today reversing the Commonwealth Court and remanding in light of Lutz, at least five members of this Court have now upheld the constitutionality of warrantless administrative searches of hazardous waste facilities or for suspected illegal hazardous waste materials under the Act, the Fourth Amendment and Donovan. Accordingly, I join in reversing the Commonwealth Court and remanding to that court for further proceedings in light of Lutz.\nMcDERMOTT and PAPADAKOS, JJ., join in this concurring opinion.\n.
