    <p id="b263-3" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[125,627,1154,910]]]'>The agreement of sale does not specify the strip. The vacant lot therein referred to is to the north and east of the buildings named; the strip is to the west of them. In an endeavor to prove their right to have it, one of the defendants testified that, when he and one of plaintiffs were looking over the property, just before the agreement of sale was drawn and executed, they went “under the porch [of the west house, and] John [the plaintiff who was present] put his hand on an iron post holding the porch up, and said ‘The ground that the porch is built on is four feet.’ He said ‘This ground from here out goes with it.’ ” This statement was specifically denied by the plaintiff who is said to have made it, and was corroborated by no one. Standing alone, therefore, defendant’s testimony, being only oath against oath, is not sufficient to require its submission to a jury: Dick v.

The only other possible factor arises out of the porch above referred to. It is on other land of plaintiffs, and had been built by them long before the contract of sale. It occupied a small part of the rear of the disputed strip, and had been used in connection with the westernmost house agreed to be conveyed. If defendants had claimed only the ground covered by this porch, they would be in a much better position to maintain their appeal, because of the porch’s connection with that house. This they did not do, however, but based their contention on the alleged statement of one of plaintiffs, above quoted, and, both below and here, claimed the whole of the strip, not of the width of four feet named in their testimony, but of the width of four feet nine and three-quarters inches, specified in <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>their answer.

    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[233,449,1153,1614]]]'>Moreover, if the court were to attempt to specifically decree to defendants some right to the four feet wide strip, what could it give? The evidence does not state how it was to go. Was it to be in fee, or were defendants to have only an easement? After the agreement of sale, both parties used the strip, which would, at most, imply an easement in defendants. If we assume it was to be in fee, because the grant of the land was to be in fee, then it may be asked, where was the “here out” to end? No evidence attempts to answer this question. There are two streets in front of the property, but about twenty feet apart. The property line of the lot sold apparently goes to the more distant of those streets. Was the strip defendants now claim, to extend to the nearest or the farthest? If, as defendants now contend, the purpose was to give them an exit from the porch to the street, the nearest would séem to have been intended. These speculations make clear that, even assuming defendants’ story to be true, what was intended to pass was and is doubtful and uncertain. This also would defeat their claim, for there can be no specific performance of a contract, the scopé and extent of which are uncertain (Agnew v. Southern Avenue Land Co., <a href="/pa/204/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="204 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="927544" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0192-01">204 Pa. 192</a>; O’Connell v. Cease, <a href="/pa/267/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="267 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1057787" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0288-01">267 Pa. 288</a>), especially where, as here, the uncertainty is in an agreement drawn by one of defendants for both, and which must, therefore, be taken most strongly against them: Duncan v. Pittsburgh-Plorida Fruit Growers Association, <a href="/pa/282/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="282 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="1088371" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0498-01">282 Pa. 498</a>. As we have already shown, there is a like uncertainty in their evidence.</p>
