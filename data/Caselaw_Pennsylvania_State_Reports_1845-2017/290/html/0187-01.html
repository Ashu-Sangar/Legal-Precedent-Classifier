In 1922 the county commissioners procured the services of a mining engineer to examine the company’s mines, prepare maps and reports, and testify as an expert witness on behalf of the county if necessary, and acting on his report the commissioners increased the valuation of the property in question to more than eleven times the former assessment, or a total of $3,955,257, the valuation placed on the several tracts being as follows: Locust Mountain, $26,250; Locust Mountain (barren), $605; Ashland Estate, $804,502; Locustdale Estate, $3,025,830; Locust Gap, $98,070. At a hearing before the county commissioners, sitting as a board of revision and appeal, the company produced the testimony of two mining engineers who fixed the total valuation at $166,505.

If this view is correct, which is supported by the testimony of competent mining engineers, then we think we are not too low in our valuation, taking into consideration the initial cost of opening the mine.

It requires no extended argument to show that a definite number of tons of coal under one piece of surface may have a much greater or less value than the same number of tons under another tract, depending upon the accessibility of the coal, distance from market, cost of mining, etc.</p>

If it is land, the market value <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>is measured by the price usually given for such land in that neighborhood, making due allowance for differences of position, soil and improvement. Value may be very approximately estimated in that way, for it is not then founded upon the mere opinion of witnesses, but on the fact of a general market value......Moreover, the offer impliedly requires a degree of refinement in the measure of values, which seems to us totally incompatible with the gross estimates of common life. Though we might have the most accurate calculation of the quantity of coal in/the land, yet, without knowing exactly the expense of bringing it to the surface and carrying it to market and the amount likely to be lost in mining and conveying, and the times in which it would be brought out, and the market prices at those times, the quantity would not help us to value the land. The gross estimates of common life are all the courts and juries have skill enough to use as a. measure of value. All other measures are necessarily arbitrary and fanciful.” See also to the same effect, R. &amp; P. Co. v. Balthaser, <a href="/pa/119/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="119 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="558115" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0472-01">119 Pa. 472</a>, 482; Kemble’s Est., <a href="/pa/280/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="280 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1084432" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0441-01">280 Pa. 441</a>, 446.</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[247,1494,1150,467]]]'>The value fixed by the court below is fully sustained by the evidence. The opinions of witnesses varied considerably. Those called by the company estimated its value from $65,900 to $251,900, while witnesses called by the county placed the value at $760,000 and $806,575. The court adopted none of these estimates, but fixed its own valuation at $452,315. The conclusion thus reached is amply supported by the evidence and we find no cause for reversal.</p>
