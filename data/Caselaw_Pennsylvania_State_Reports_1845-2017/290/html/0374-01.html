We have already decided that a bequest to the Masonic Home at Elizabethtown is for charitable uses: Phila. v. Masonic Home, <a href="/pa/160/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="160 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="852141" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0572-01">160 Pa. 572</a>. We need not attempt to draw the line, however, as we are of opinion that Fred C. Miller yas a disinterested witness when he signed the will and <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>lienee whether the Odd Fellows Orphans’ Home is or is not a charity makes no difference so far as the result accomplished by our decision is concerned.</p>
    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[141,508,1151,738]]]'>As already stated, Miller was both a master mason and an Odd Fellow. Appellant urges these as the factors which should lead to the conclusion that he was not a disinterested witness so far as the Masonic Home is concerned. Title to the home is in five trustees, members of the grand lodge appointed by it. All contracts for the erection of buildings are made by the grand lodge which appropriates annually a sum for the estimated expenses required for its maintenance and upkeep, the money being derived by the grand lodge from an addition of $40 to the initiation fee paid by each new member of a subordinate lodge, and the grand lodge also assesses each subordinate lodge a per capita tax of $2 annually for maintenance.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[136,1267,1154,1072]],["BL_400.1",400,[221,365,1149,97]]]'>It is argued that, under Kessler’s Est., <a href="/pa/221/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="221 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="956212" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0314-01">221 Pa. 314</a>, Miller was not a disinterested witness so far as the Masonic Home bequest is concerned, because he was a member of the Masonic fraternity and had a present and future pecuniary interest in the home. It is difficult to see, when all the facts are considered which were brought out on the hearing, how it can be said that he had either a present or future pecuniary interest in the charity. He was not a member of the grand lodge which maintained and managed.it nor was he connected in any way with its organization, maintenance or administration. ■No master mason has an absolute right to be admitted to the home; in order to be received into it he must be dependent. Whether any person shall be admitted is a matter exclusively within the control of a committee of the grand lodge and then only on the application of the subordinate lodge of which the applicant is a member. If the committee of the grand lodge refuses admission, its decision is final. The only right that Miller’s membership in the masonic order gave him, so far as the home <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>is concerned, was the privilege to apply to his subordinate lodge for admission.</p>
    <p id="b400-5" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[219,472,1151,1394]]]'>The same argument is made as to the Odd Fellows’ institution. So far as Miller’s status as an Odd Fellow is concerned, the record discloses as to that organization the following: He was a member of a subordinate lodge, not of the grand lodge. The orphanage, to which the bequest we ax*e considering was made, is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth and is a subordinate body of the grand lodge of this State and subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by it. The details of administration of the orphanage are in the hands of local officers and its general policy is dictated by the grand lodge, which maintains it by a per capita levy upon all members of subordinate lodges. To secure admission to the orphanage one must be an orphan of a deceased Odd Fellow, who was a member of a lodge located in the home district and must be over three years of age and under twelve. Application for admission must be made by the lodge of which the parent was a member. The question of admission is determined by a committee of the grand lodge. While not important factors in our conclusion, the record discloses that when Miller witnessed the will he was more than forty years of age and hence not eligible for admission to the orphanage, was a bachelor and so remained until his death, so that no orphan can obtain admission to the institution through him.</p>

That is to say, he did not possess, but simply had the capacity of attaining, the legal right to share in the benefits of the home.” This we said “was too remote ah interest to disqualify him as an attesting witness, under the Act of 1855.” In Combs and Hankinson’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="105 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="454310" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0155-01">105 Pa. 155</a>, 158, we ruled that “a witness is not incompetent on the score of interest unless he has a certain, not a possible benefit.” In Jeanes’s Est., <a href="/pa/228/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="228 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="969928" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0537-01">228 Pa. 537</a>, we said (p. 541) : “Interest which, under the Act of 1855, disqualifies a witness from attesting a will containing religious or charitable bequests must be a present, certain and vested one.

L. 328, now replaced by section 6 of the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, must be read and understood in connection with the subject-matter of the statute, the evils to be avoided, the requirements being intended to safeguard the rights and property of persons approaching death, and the remedy to be provided in such case......The interest which will affect the capacity of an attesting witness must be in the' nature of a direct property right in the testamentary fund, or such immediate, certain, close and intimate connection with the legatee as leads to the inevitable conclusion that the witness will pecuniarily profit by the legacy.”</p>
