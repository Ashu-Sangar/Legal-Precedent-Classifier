A formal contract was executed by the city officials and the contractor, but the city controller refused to number or certify it, as he is required to do by article XII, section 4, of the Act of June 25, 1919, P. L. 581, 598, which provides that “Every contract involving an appropriation shall designate the item on which it is founded, and shall be numbered by the city controller in the order of its date, and charged as numbered against such item, <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>and so certified by Mm, before it shall take effect as a contract, and shall not be payable out of any other fund.” Plaintiff thereupon began the present proceeding to compel the controller to number and certify the contract; he answered the petition; plaintiff demurred; the demurrer was sustained and a peremptory mandamus awarded. From this judgment the controller now appeals.</p>
    <p id="b569-3" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[102,794,1152,966]]]'>Appellant does not challenge the good faith of,- or the method pursued by plaintiff, or the city officials, in the making of either the. councilmanie loan or the building contract, but confines his objection to the alleged fact that, without the consent of the electors, which was not given, the city had no right to make the loan of $4,-200,000. For present purposes, Ave may assume, without considering or deciding the point, that appellant is correct in his contention; but it is a wholly irrelevant matter in this proceeding. The Constitution limits the right of a city in borrowing money without the consent of the electors, but it gives to city controllers no power or duty in respect to that matter. To have any standing to attack the loan, appellant was bound, therefore, to point to some statute authorizing him, as controller, so to do The only statutory provision to which he refers us is section 2 of article XVII of the Act of June 25, 1919, P. L. 581, 606.</p>

In passing such ordinance the council shall be bound to accept the estimates of receipts and liabilities furnished to the mayor by the city controller, but shall have full discretion to determine the character and amount of expenditures to be made out of the estimated receipts of the city during the ensuing year.” So far as appears, all that this statute requires was duly done; but, it will be observed, there is nothing in the section which imposes any further duty on the controller, after he has furnished “the estimates of receipts and liabilities,” or which, indeed, limits the power of the city council to borrow other money than that referred to in the controller’s estimates, and to use it for any legitimate municipal purpose, which, admittedly,' constructing and equipping the City Hall Annex is. Appellant is, therefore, without statutory support in the position he assumes.</p>

No opinion or so-called discretion of the controller can justify him in withholding his certificate from such a contract.” And again, at pages 131-2: “No more can the collusion charged in connection with the bidding [for the contract] be made the subject of inquiry in this proceeding. The one question in the case is, shall the controller be required to certify this contract? It is his duty to certify all municipal contracts which have been entered into under and in compliance with statutory requirements. We have said this is such a contract. The fraud alleged does not go to the regularity of the contract—■ and by regularity we mean conformity to the positive requirements of the statute. The powers and duties of the controller are purely statutory; and, when one holding the office asserts the right to avoid or ignore a duty <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>plainly enjoined, nothing can vindicate such right short of a statutory provision equally explicit with that which enjoins the duty. If the facts with respect to the collusion be as stated in the answer, they furnish sufficient basis for a proceeding at the suit of the city or of a defrauded taxpayer to set aside the contract, as was done in Mazet v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/137/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="137 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="821431" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0548-01">137 Pa. 548</a>. ¡____but until the contract be judicially declared illegal by reason of the alleged fraud, it is not for the controller to assert its invalidity in justification of a refusal on his part to certify a contract which stands clear of all other objection.”</p>
