The order of ouster, dated March 7, 1927, was signed “By the court, W. S. McLean, Jr., Judge.” The right of Judge McLean to act for the whole court in making this order was not challenged in the court below, and the record indicates that, so far as these removals are concerned, the order was filed after consultation with certain of his colleagues, at least two of whom appear to have, in a measure, participated in so much of the order as deals with that subject, though not in the appointment of successors to the ousted directors. Under these circumstances, the question of the validity of the removal of the original board cannot be raised at this time, and, in point of fact, it is not attempted to be raised. As before stated, all the questions before us relate to the subsequent part of the order of March 7,1927,—that portion which makes the new appointments,—and additional orders, afterwards filed, removing the new appointees and naming others in their places; as to these matters, the right of the court below to act other than as a court in banc is challenged, and we think properly so.</p>

The subsequent order, of April 26, 1927, states that “a majority of the judges sitting in banc” refused to rescind the order of April 14, 1927, and the second order of April 26,1927, states that “a majority of the judges sitting in banc, after ouster, appointment and reouster, do appoint” the several persons named for the unexpired term of the original board. Whether, in the last two orders, this expression “a majority of the judges sitting en banc,” means that all judges of the court sat in banc and a majority of them acted, or joined, in appointing the last named board, or whether it means only that a majority of those sitting in banc acted, we cannot tell; nor can we tell from this record whether or not all members of the court below had a proper opportunity to consider and act as a body on these several matters. In short, we do not feel assured from this record that, so far as the appointment of new school directors is concerned, the court in banc has, in any instance, <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>acted in an assembled meeting of all the judges of that tribunal or of as many as were available, where the matter could be properly discussed, deliberated upon, and determined.</p>

On the contrary, all of the cases, as well as the definitions of a court in banc, plainly show that, in most matters, a single judge can act, though certain classes of things must be done by the court as a whole; and, as before said, the exercise of statutory powers like those here involved falls within such a class.</p>
