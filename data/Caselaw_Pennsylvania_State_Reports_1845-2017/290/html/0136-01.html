It holds a franchise as a member of the American League of professional baseball clubs and owns a baseball park known as Shibe Park, situated in the City of Philadelphia. All its players are paid and it charges the public an admission fee to see the games. In the summer of 1926, ap<a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>pellant announced that it intended playing professional baseball at its parks on Sundays, and on Sunday, August 22d, it did play a game of professional ball with another team of the American League, to which the public was admitted on payment of an admission fee. Thereafter the attorney general in behalf of the Commonwealth filed the suggestion for the writ of quo warranto in this proceeding, his averment being that the playing of the game of baseball on Sunday violates the Act of April 22, 1794, 3 Smith’s Laws 177, and that appellant is without power or authority of law, under the letters patent granted to it, to play baseball on Sunday. The answer of defendant denied that the playing of baseball on Sunday is a violation of the Act of 1794 or that it is without authority to play the game on that day and averred that the writ of quo warranto would not lie against it because the sole penalty for its so doing is the payment of the sum of four dollars as provided in the act. The attorney general having demurred to the answer, the court below after hearing sustained the demurrer and entered a judgment that defendant be ousted from any right, privilege or authority to maintain or conduct upon its grounds any game of professional baseball on Sunday and directed that a perpetual injunction issue restraining it from so doing; from the judgment and decree thus entered defendant brings to us this ajrpeal.</p>

To hold otherwise would mean that words do not have <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>their ordinary meaning. The statute says “If any person shall do or perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the Lord’s Day, commonly called Sunday, works of necessity and charity only excepted ......and be convicted thereof, every such person so offending shall, for every such offense, forfeit and pay four dollars, to be levied by distress; or in case he or she shall refuse or neglect to pay the said sum......he or she shall suffer six days imprisonment in the house of correction of the proper county.” The word “worldly” as here used means “concerned with the enjoyments of this present existence, secular,” “not religious, spiritual or holy.” Chief Justice Lowrie, speaking for the court in Com. v. Nesbit, <a href="/pa/34/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="34 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="417994" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0398-01">34 Pa. 398</a>, 409, said: “Very evidently, worldly is contrasted with religious, and the worldly employments are prohibited for the sake of the religious ones.” We cannot imagine in this sense anything more worldly or unreligious in the way of employment than the playing of professional baseball as it is played today. It is not only worldly employment which is forbidden, but business. There are businesses which are not trade or commerce: Hooper v. California, <a href="/us/155/0648-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="155 U.S. 648" data-case-ids="3580407" data-case-paths="/us/155/0648-01">155 U. S. 648</a>. Can any one hope to successfully contend that today’s professional baseball enterprises are not business? It was taken for granted by the Supreme Court of the United States that they are. “The business is giving exhibitions of baseball”: National League v. Federal Baseball Club, <a href="/us/259/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="259 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="423329" data-case-paths="/us/259/0200-01">259 U. S. 200</a>. We think nO' one would argue that conducting a circus is not a business or running a theater is not and yet there is no difference between them and playing professional baseball. In all three the participants are hired to give the exhibition and the public is admitted for a price! ^Pertinent to this line of thought is what was said by Mr. Justice Strong in Sparhawk v. Union Passenger Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/54/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="54 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1006299" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0401-01">54 Pa. 401</a>, 409, “Many might be found, doubtless, who would affirm on oath that theatrical representations are conducive to mental and bodily health, and that such recreation as <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>they afford is a necessity. Such a construction of the statute would make it but an empty sound. It would be losing sight entirely of the objects sought to be secured, the observance of a day of rest for the community, thereby enabling every one to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience, without distraction, and without disturbance, and thus giving a check to vice and immorality. A construction that leads to such an absurdity must be erroneous.”</p>

In answering the query as to whether the license authorized its holder to sell liquor on Sunday, it was said (p. 88) : “Certainly not; because the Act of Assembly of 1794 forbids any worldly employment...... on Sunday.” It would be a difficult matter to state a satisfying reason why the sale of liquor on Sunday is a worldly employment and the sale of admission to see a baseball game is not. In that case the license from the Commonwealth gave the right to sell liquor; in the one at bar the charter the privilege of conducting games of ball, but neither privilege from the State can override its laws. This same principle is announced in Johnston v. Com., <a href="/pa/22/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="22 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="413701" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0102-01">22 Pa. 102</a>. The Superior Court in Com. v.

Com., 11 S. &amp; R. 393) and its people are Christian people. Sunday is the holy day among Christians. No one we think would contend that professional baseball partakes in any way of the nature of holiness and when contrasted with things which do, it is bound to be categoried as worldly. Great emphasis is laid upon the fact, in appellant’s brief, that the baseball game was conducted without undue noise, that there were no disturbances, and altogether in a manner not to annoy in the slightest those living in the neighborhood of the ball park or to interfere with religious worship. It is not necessary that one, in carrying on a worldly employment on Sunday, should do any of these things before being guilty of a violation of the act, nor is it essential that there should have been a breach of the peace: Com. v. Foster, <a href="/pa-super/28/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="28 Pa. Super. 400" data-case-ids="858981" data-case-paths="/pa-super/28/0400-01">28 Pa. Superior Ct. 400</a>.

When its language is given its ordinary not a strained construction, its meaning we think is plain. It may be that those who do not wish to understand or abide by its provisions find them uncertain; surely those who wish to follow the custom of our people in Sunday observance do not so find the interdictions of the statute.

It was initiated by the attorney general, the chief law officer of the Commonwealth and necessarily has behind it the approval of the State’s highest executive officer, the Governor. The people’s mandate to him in their fundamental law (Constitution, article IV, section 2) is “The supreme executive power shall be vested in the Governor, who shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” This proceeding was brought to the end that this mandate should be, fulfilled.</p>

This may be admitted and yet there be no denial of the right to the writ which is one of inquiry: By what warrant are the acts done of which complaint is made? It does not avail to say to the Commonwealth, you granted me the privilege to do this thing, if it appears that what is being done under cover of the charter is unlawful. If all that was being carried on was unlawful, then there would be no warrant for its doing and no question of the propriety of the writ; if part of what was being carried on was lawful <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>and part was not, then there would he warrant only for that which was lawful; what was unlawful, not being justified, would have to cease. It would seem to be well nigh ridiculous to hold that by its writ of quo warranto the Commonwealth may interdict that which is entirely unlawful but cannot lop off that part which is not within the law. The use of quo warranto to inquire into particular acts of private corporations alleged to be unlawful is adverted to in High’s Extraordinary Legal Remedies, sections 677b and 677c. It was said in Com. v. Banks, <a href="/pa/198/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="198 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="920280" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0397-01">198 Pa. 397</a>, that quo warranto would be a proper remedy to restrain a business school, not having authority to confer degrees, from unlawfully claiming to be a “university.” It is argued that under its charter defendant has the express power granted to it to play professional baseball and nowhere therein is it prohibited from conducting this undertaking on Sunday. Neither was the innkeeper in the case heretofore cited prohibited in his license from selling liquor on Sunday, yet this court denied him the right. It would be an unthinkable proposition that the' Commonwealth would create organizations to break its own laws. Every corporation which it calls into existence by letters patent takes its charter subject like natural persons to the rule of and obedience to law. Its charter is a grant of lawful privileges, not a warrant to violate any law. Violation of the Act of 1794 is a crime: Com. v. Eyre, 1 S. &amp; R. 347; Com. v. Wolf, 3 S. &amp; R. 48; Com. v.

An individual, partnership, association, or joint stock company, is subject to no other penalty. The Act of 1806 means that the proceeding mentioned in the Act of 1794 is an exclusive remedy, and we so held in Com. v.

The authority cited for the action is the 3d section of the Act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 621. But this gives authority to' institute quo warranto only where the corporation proceeds “without lawful authority” or “exercises any power, privilege or franchise, not granted or appertaining to such corporation.” The Attorney General’s right to proceed is limited by the act. Appellant was organized and chartered to play baseball; this right ex<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>tended to every day of its corporate life. The power to perform its corporate function is there, but playing on a particular day is penalized by the Act of 1794.

Manufacturing establishments which do not properly guard machinery, the same concerns, or others, with large buildings, and hotel companies, not properly equipped with fire escapes, mercantile establishments, telephone companies and others that happen to employ labor illegally, or work them overtime; all may be proceeded against by quo warranto.

The penalty and also the appropriate remedy are provided in distinct and unmistakable terms by the Act of 1794 itself. Under well established rules of law, these provisions are exclusive, whether the offender be a corporation or otherwise. In Com. v. Smith, <a href="/pa/266/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="266 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="1056100" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0511-01">266 Pa. 511</a>, 515, 516, the State, as here, endeavored to enforce the Act of 1794 in a manner other than provided by the statute. We refused to permit this to be done, my predecessor in office, Chief Justice Brown, saying for a unanimous court, “If the playing of......baseball on Sunday is a violation of [the statute] the players are punishable under it......This proceeding is at the instance of the Commonwealth; the remedy for that of which it complains is to be found in the act......If the penalty therein provided is not a sufficient deterrent, it is for the legislature to provide another..... .The penal <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>law that is violated is provided with the machinery for punishing [transgressions against] it and to [this machinery] the violation must he referred.” This was said by us in a case where one authorized to proceed in the name of the Commonwealth was the principal plaintiff, and I cannot construe it to mean else than that neither an equitable nor any other remedy except that named in the Act of 1794 is available to the Commonwealth for the enforcement of this statute.</p>

Except as affected .by constitutional or express statutory provisions, the Commonwealth has like control over the social conduct of its individual citizens, officers of its corporations, including municipal officers, and the corporations themselves; but the courts should not permit it unwarrantably to coerce the conduct of one of them any more than of another. To my mind, the principle of Com. v. Smith (where the effort was to compel municipal corporate authorities to take a certain line of action), and the plain words in which our ruling is there expressed, mean, and in effect say, that the Commonwealth cannot by injunction in any form enforce the Act of 1794, but is confined for its enforcement to the penalty and remedy therein particularly provided.</p>
