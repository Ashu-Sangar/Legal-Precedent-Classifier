In Prenatt v. Messenger Printing Co. (No. 2), <a href="/pa/250/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="250 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1017022" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0406-01">250 Pa. 406</a>, we bad before us a case where a receiver of an insolvent corporation bad in bis possession a leased machine which be used in carrying on tbe business entrusted to bis care and it was determined that the claim for rent for tbe time the receiver bad possession of and used tbe machine was a preferred claim. “As a general rule a common law or chancery receiver appointed by order of tbe court <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>does not, by taking possession of leased premises, become personally liable for the rents reserved, as assignee of the lease. He holds as a mere custodian of the court and the title to the leasehold does not vest in him. A receiver of a lessee does not become responsible for rent merely by accepting the trust and receiving the assets, <em>unless he elects to take possession </em>of the leased property and assume the liability .to pay the rent <em>or do some act which is in law equivalent to such an </em>election...... Such an election is manifested by entering into possession of and occupying leased property”: 23 R. C. L., p. 75, section 81. “A receiver does not become liable upon the covenants of the lease because of his position as receiver, but because and only because of his own acts in respect thereto. He becomes liable when he has elected to assume the lease or has taken possession of the demised premises and continued in possession under such circumstances as in law would be equivalent to such an election”: Clark, The Law of Receivers, volume 1, section 521. “The mere acceptance by the receiver of the trust does not render the receiver liable for the rent of the premises, and he cannot be held liable under the lease until he elects to hold possession under the lease or does some act which is equivalent to such election”: Clark, The Law of Receivers, volume 1, section 528. “A receiver who enters into possession of and occupies leased property unequivocally manifests his election to recognize the lease and thereby incurs a liability for the payment of the rent”: <a href="/citations/?q=16%20L.R.A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="16 L.R.A. 90">16 L. R. A. 90</a>, note. In the instant case, not only did the receiver enter into possession of and occupy the property, but he did so in pursuance of the express order of the court and under a decree which forbade the landlord to assert its right in the property. “If the receiver......keeps the landlord out of possession of the premises with the sanction of the court, the funds in his' hands become equitably charged with the rent accruing during such occupation” : Fletcher, Encyclopedia of Corporations, volume 8, <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>section 5291. “Rent accruing after the appointment [of a receiver] is an expense connected with the administration of the estate and has such priority as may be accorded claims against the receiver himself”: Tardy’s Smith on Receivers (2d ed.), volume 1, p. 545. “The rental of leased property for which receivers are liable is regarded as an expense incident to the administration of the receivership, and, like other costs, is to be paid before the assets of the debtor are distributed among his creditors”: 34 Cyc. 352. In Lane v. Washington Hotel Co., <a href="/pa/190/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="190 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="905129" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0230-01">190 Pa. 230</a>, 235, it was said, speaking through Mr. Justice Dean, “There is no power in the courts in the interest of creditors and stockholders, to take possession of property, operate it as a hotel and deprive the owner of any legal right......[The lessor’s] right to enter upon the premises and distrain for rent on default being made in any monthly payment was unquestioned. The court could not by taking possession deprive her of this right, except by maintaining her status as landlord on any fund realized from the property subject to distraint. Admit the property of the hotel company, by the appointment of the receiver, went into the custody of the law and was no longer subject to seizure on a landlord’s warrant for default in payment up to that time, still her right to seize the property was merely transferred into a lien on the fund, which the court on distribution was bound to recognize......It is the rent payable by the receiver during the last months of his occupancy that constitutes her present claim. But he could have no other or more favorable exemption from her demand than his insolvent, the hotel company had; nor could the court give him any......No insolvency of her tenant nor action of the court in the interest of the tenant’s creditors could prejudice the landlord’s right to her rent, and this right continued as long as the receiver occupied her property under the terms of the hotel company’s lease.” We are not called upon in the pending case to determine the question of priority <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>as between rent during the time the receiver occupied the property and his own expenses, commissions and counsel fees, as the latter have been paid without objection. The tendency of the most recent cases is to prefer the receiver’s compensation and counsel fees: Bauer v. Wilkes-Barre Light Co., <a href="/pa/274/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="274 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1073035" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0165-01">274 Pa. 165</a>.

L. 54. The wage claims here are all within the terms of the act in the respect that they are for a period not exceeding six months preceding the sale and each is for less than two hundred dollars. It will be noticed that the act provides that money which may be due for labor shall be a lien upon the real or personal property of the employer and shall be preferred and first <em>paid out of the proceeds </em>of the sale of such real and personal property. “The proceeds” in the case of a receivership is what remains after payment of the costs and expenses of the receivership necessary to.the carrying out of the trust by the receiver as the hand of the court. The Act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 207, provides, “It is the true intent and meaning of the provisions of the Act of Assembly entitled ‘An act for the better protection of the wages of mechanics, miners, laborers and others’ passed the ninth day of April, 1872, [to which the Act of 1891 is a supplement] that the several classes of laborers in said act mentioned shall have a preference over landlords, in all claims for <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>rent......where the lessee or lessees are the parties employing the miners, mechanics, laborers or clerks.” Under this act there is no doubt but' that the wage claimants come ahead of claims for rent due prior to the receivership : Riddleburg Coal &amp; Iron Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="114 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="550048" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0058-01">114 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/114/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="114 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="550048" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0058-01">58</a>; </em>Trickett, Landlord &amp; Tenant, section 354.
