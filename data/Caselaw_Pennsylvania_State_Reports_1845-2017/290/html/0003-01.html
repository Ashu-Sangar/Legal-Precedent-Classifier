Where a testator bequeaths certain specific legacies, including one to his son, and gives his residuary estate to his three daughters, charging it with payment of the inheritance or succession taxes, and states that it is his intention to treat his children as nearly equal as possible in the division of his estate, the son will be chargeable with a pro rata part of the inheritance taxes, including the federal estate tax, where it appears that testator by a codicil directs that there shall be charged against the bequest to his son “a pro rata share of any and all taxes, including inheritance taxes, that may be chargeable against my residuary estate.”</p>

Under the Pennsylvania inheritance tax laws, each legatee is liable for the tax on his own particular legacy, and residuary legatees are likewise liable for the tax on their residuary interests. Under federal inheritance tax statutes, no legatees, specific or residuary, are liable to pay the tax on their particular interests; as the federal estate tax is not a tax on the interest to which some person succeeds on a death, but the interest which ceases by reason of death; and the tax is therefore on the transfer of decedent’s net estate: Edwards v.

Testator subsequently added a codicil in which he provided that: “In my said will in the ninth paragraph I provide that my son, Fisher Corlies Baily, shall receive a sum of money equal to one-fourth (14) of the amount to the credit of my account in the firm of Joshua L. Baily &amp; Company at the termination of the copartnership, <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>which would be at the end of the month next following my death. I hereby modify said bequest to the extent that there shall be charged against this bequest unto my said son, Fisher Corlies Baily, a pro rata share of any and all taxes, including inheritance taxes, that may be chargeable against my residuary estate. In all other respects I ratify and confirm my said will as heretofore written.”</p>
    <p id="b28-5" data-blocks='[["BL_28.4",28,[220,773,1149,261]]]'>The sole question before us for determination is whether the direction to charge against the son named his pro rata share of “any and all taxes” includes the federal estate tax. The court below held this tax was properly included. Fisher Corlies Baily appealed.</p>
    <p id="b28-6" data-blocks='[["BL_28.5",28,[216,1045,1152,1171]]]'>It is true, as argued by appellant, that the federal estate tax is not an inheritance tax or a tax on the interest to which a person succeeds on death of the owner, but on the interest which has ceased by reason of such death: Edmunds v. Slocum, 264 IT. S. 61. But to place a strict technical construction on the language used by testator would tend to defeat rather than aid the general expressed intent of testator to treat his four children “as nearly equal as possible.” Having directed in his will that “all collateral, inheritance or other succession tax or taxes” should be paid out of the residue, and having made the bequest to his son without mentioning the question of payment of such taxes, and given the residue to his daughters, testator evidently later discovered that the will might reasonably be construed to impose on the daughters all taxes “chargeable against my residuary estate,” hence added the codicil to remove doubt and charge his son’s portion with its pro rata share of “any and all taxes.” This term is sufficiently comprehensive to include the federal tax, and a careful reading of the whole will leads to the conclusion that testator so intended.</p>
