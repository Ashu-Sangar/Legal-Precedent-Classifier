The practice followed was for the agent of the seller to send notice to the buyer of the fact that a certain amount had been reserved, deliverable within a fixed time, accompanied by a request that the receipt of the allotment be acknowledged. The manner of doing business has been set forth in detail in Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. Howell, <a href="/pa/274/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="274 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1073020" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0190-01">274 Pa. 190</a>, where like dealings were considered, and a reference to that <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>case will obviate the necessity of repeating the steps followed, forms in nse, and the plan and effect of their execution. On five separate dates in June of 1920, the seller’s agent notified defendant it had directed to be set aside for it sugar covering “300 barrels or equivalent” to be delivered in each of the months of July, August and September, 250 barrels in October, and 100 barrels in November of the same year.</p>
    <p id="b511-3" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[128,783,1154,1508]]]'>The receipt of these confirmations, so called, was acknowledged in one letter, dated June 23d. Each contained the statement: “Basis 22.50,” and “Price 22.50,” but the kind of sugar to which the base applied did not appear on the face of the papers. The confirmation provided that notice of the grade of the goods to be assigned to the purchaser should be given before the first of each month named in the respective allotments, with right of the seller to make substitutions of other classes if necessary. The further stipulation was made that if no notification of the quality desired was given before the date designated, the seller could ship such assortment as it might have available. In pursuance of this arrangement sugar was furnished in July and August, and paid for. A part of that set aside for September was likewise delivered,—there is a dispute as to the number of barrels, which is immaterial, in view of the conclusion now reached as to the liability of the parties,—and the price charged paid. During that month defendant refused to accept further shipments, and the balance of the order, as well as that covered by the confirmations for October and November, was not delivered. This action for damages, to recover for the breach of contract was instituted, after demand, made in the following February, that the remaining allotment be accepted. Binding instructions were given for defendant, and a request for judgment n. o. v. refused. The plaintiff has appealed.</p>

L. 543), which requires that a memorandum be signed by the purchaser showing the terms of the understanding, if it is to be legally enforced. This court held that the requirements of the statute had not been met, and therefore no recovery could be had: Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. Howell, <a href="/pa/274/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="274 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1073020" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0190-01">274 Pa. 190</a>. Thereupon, an amended statement was filed averring the existence of a trade custom explanatory of the meaning of the words used, and also setting forth that a schedule of differentials was in force when the allotments were made, by means of which the price of the various grades of sugar was fixed. After a further holding by this court that the broker, under such contracts, was alone the agent of the seller, and could not bind the buyer by his signature (Franklin Sugar Ref. Co. v. Kane Milling Co., <a href="/pa/278/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="278 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1080608" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0105-01">278 Pa. 105</a>), and a declaration that the acknowledgment of the receipt of the confirmations, as here found, was not sufficient in itself to establish a binding contract to purchase (Franklin Sugar Ref.

It was set forth that a total of 650 barrels were delivered between June 14th and September 20th, and accepted at the price of 22.50 cents per pound. The failure of defendants to furnish a list of further assortments is alleged, as well as the readiness of plaintiff to fill orders had it been asked, though no tender was made by it of sugar of any grade. Damages for the loss occa<a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>sioned by the breach, in refusing to accept after request, were demanded.</p>

The foundation of the claim was a contract, and to recover thereon it was necessary that all of its essentials should appear: Swift &amp; Co. v.

In view of the decisions of this court in the previous cases réferred to, the position that a sufficient writing to bind the buyer appeared from a consideration of all the documents relating to the transaction was abandoned, but it is insistéd that the part performance by delivery of a portion of the sugar and its acceptance, took the case out of the statute, and its provisions can no longer be invoked as a bar. With this proposition we can agree, if there was any enforceable contract at all, insofar as the allotments for. <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>July, August and September are concerned (Producers Coke Co. v.

For the first two, deliveries were made and payment of the price in full allowed.

A contention, contrary to that now asserted, was made in both the original and amended statements of claim, it being then set forth that there were five individual agreements. An examination of each will show a different order, to which serial numbers were given, and that they were sent on different dates to the buyer, enclosed with five letters. The mere fact that an acknowledgment of receipt of all appears in one communication will not affect the fact that they were separate and distinct.

    <p id="b515-3" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[98,1212,1154,950]]]'>The difficulty of plaintiff does not arise in this case from the provisions of section 4 of the Sales Act, but is found in the fact that there was no proper averment or proof of any certain and definite agreement to purchase sugar. As already noticed, the statement of claim does not refer to any contract, oral or written, but relies solely on documents attached, nor does it allege that these constituted a binding undertaking to buy. An examination will show they refer to “basis 22.50,” and “bbls. 300 or equivalent. Price 22.50.” What is meant by “22.50” is not averred, nor is there reference made to any other waiting, which would clarify the defect. The kind of sugar forming the base is not made evident, nor is there reference to any differential, by which the price of any of the other grades of sugar,—there were twenty-seven, made up in various kinds of packages, from which the defendant might choose,—could be determined.</p>

Even its price of “22.50” is not made clear, whether referring to cents per pound <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>or dollars per barrel, nor is any trade use, by which a fixed differential could be applied, averred or established. It is true that the statement set forth that the sugar actually delivered was paid for on the basis of 22.50 cents a pound, and one letter, referring, however, only to the October contract, and not that of September, makes use of a like explanatory phrase covering that transaction. There was evidence to show a trade custom that “barrels” was intended to mean 350 pounds, though this was contradicted. The lack of certainty renders the transaction unenforceable as a contract, as held in the Howell Case, supra, where the same question was considered. There was a failure to show the character of the goods sold, or the price to be paid, which itself was variable from the list referred to, where shipments were to be made in less than barrel quantities.</p>

The differential, as referred to by the witness called, was in force at the time the allotments were made, “with certain exceptions,”—but what those were does not appear. The confirmations did not show the character of the sugar to which the base price referred, so that the differential,—insofar as appearing in the 13th paragraph,of the amended statement, and the only portion of that paper offered,—could be applied to the various grades of sugar and different kinds of containers, nor did it sufficiently appear that the differential referred to was in force when the acknowledgment of the confirmation was sent. Nor is aid given by the price list of June 11th, received in evidence for the purpose of showing that all charges were “subject to change by the seller, without notice and at the seller’s will.” The date of the September allotment, with which we are alone concerned, was prior thereto, and the schedule previously in effect,—though not shown to have been applicable on the date in ques<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>tion,—was rejected as evidence on objection from plaintiff’s counsel.</p>
