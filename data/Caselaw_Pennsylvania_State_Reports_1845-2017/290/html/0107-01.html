The title to the <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>land actually purchased was taken by one Tuit. The first named was unable to provide the necessary funds to pay for the undivided interest to which he was entitled, and Thompson agreed to see that the necessary sums were paid, and carry the property for the benefit of Mrs. Messmore, on condition that the grantee should deed the husband’s interest to him, for the benefit of the wife, on the payment of the amounts due. On February 25, 1898, Thompson entered into a trust agreement with Mrs. Messmore in which he contracted to hold, for her use, the undivided one-third interest in the land described.</p>
    <p id="b132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[216,1002,1154,964]]]'>It was provided that the moneys required to pay for the share should be obtained by the trustee, and this was done by taking the notes of the Messmores, which were discounted at the bank of which the former was president. The contract stipulated that Thompson would deed the property to the wife, if all interest, taxes, costs and expenses were paid within ten years, as well as a note upon which he was liable as surety. There was an additional stipulation, as follows: “It is further agreed that if the owners of the coal above described should find a purchaser or sell said coal at a price mutually satisfactory, then the said Thompson has full authority to make a deed for the same,” and, after making the proper deductions, the balance, if any, was to be paid to Mrs. Messmore. There was no reimbursement within the period mentioned, but no forfeiture of any of her rights is claimed by the trustee by reason of the failure to repay.</p>

This document described the coal' land held in trust, amounting, if the tract was divided, to about 169 acres, and directed that her executors (only one qualified ) should have entire control thereof “for a period of five years from my death [changed to three by a codi<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>cil],” and “my executors shall have power and authority and they are hereby authorized and directed to sell, within said [three] year period, as to them may seem proper and for the advantage of my children, at public or private sale......At the end of said [three] years said executors shall distribute all money in their hands to said children in equal shares......and whatever real estate at that time remains unsold shall be turned over to the control and absolute ownership in equal shares to my said children.” She left six survivors, one of whom died in 1912, and another in 1923.</p>
    <p id="b133-8" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[142,948,1154,1346]]]'>The court below has found that the coal land was sold for a large sum by Thompson in the spring of 1913, prior to the expiration, on August 10,1913, of the three years named in the will during which a sale was to be made, though the deed, in his own name and not as trustee or executor, was not executed and delivered until November 13th. This conclusion of the court is sustained by competent evidence. After the transfer, he consulted with two of the heirs as to the transaction, and fixed the price to be paid over on the basis of $700 an acre. At the hearing, on exceptions filed to his account as executor, it was his claim that he had then purchased the interests of all the children, on the theory that one, Sarah, stated, in the presence of another heir, that all would be satisfied to dispose of their shares at the price named. On January 12,1914, he made out a note for $118,222 for the full amount payable to the living children, due one year after date.- This paper was executed, as he testified, so that there might be some evidence of the amount he owed, and, at the suggestion of the daughter Sarah, it was kept in his possession. Later, he executed a second obligation, as of the same date, for $100,468.32, having deducted the advances made for Mrs. Messmore in the purchase of the property.</p>

The demand, represented by the note) was reduced to judgment, and assigned to a creditors committee for collection. Two dividends of five per cent each were declared, but these were not accepted until Thompson authorized the receipt of all dividends “without prejudice to the rights your said clients [the letter is addressed to the attorneys for the heirs] may have to assert any claim they may have against me as executor of Emma Messmore, deceased, or trustee under her will.”</p>
    <p id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[210,1052,1153,1237]]]'>A first and final account was filed by the executor of the estate. No debit for the proceeds of the sale of the coal land was included, and it exhibited an apparent overpayment by him. Exceptions were filed, and a hearing had. It was then insisted that Thompson had become the owner of the coal land by purchase from the heirs, and that his deed was made as such grantee. The consideration was alleged to have been the giving of the note of January 12, 1914, which obligation was subsequently reduced to judgment, and presented as a claim in the bankrupt estate. Any title by reason of a failure to repay the advances made for Mrs. Messmore within ten years was disclaimed, and it was denied that the conveyance was by virtue of the power to sell granted in the will. On appeal, an attempt is made to shift this position taken in the court below, it being now insisted there was authority to sell and convey under the original trust, and the transfer was made under that power. This is not the theory on which the case was tried, and appellant cannot now alter his legal position: Saxman v.

That he was so acting is evidenced by the credits which he claimed in his account for advances, which included payment of taxes to the time of final sale, surveying bill, and attorney’s fees for drawing the deeds. That he considered the holding of the land to be in trust for the estate is shown by the note which he gave as executor on November 21, 1911, the amount of which was deducted as an advance. Such payments are inconsistent with a claim of ownership by virtue of the trust agreement, and are to be considered in determining the true relation of the parties: Gates v. Keichline, <a href="/pa/282/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="282 Pa. 584" data-case-ids="1088330" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0584-01">282 Pa. 584</a>.

He was acting as confidential adviser to the children in 1914 when the obligation was given, and was bound to fully disclose all pertinent facts, so that those with whom he was dealing could act intelligently and advisedly. It does not appear that more than one, or possibly two, of the heirs ever knew of the note until the bankruptcy proceedings were instituted.

An attempt to enforce liability against an assignee for the benefit of creditors is not inconsistent with the right to enforce personal liability of the assignor: 20 C. J. 19; 7 C. J. 337., It will be noted that the dividends were not accepted for the estate until the executor in writing agreed they should be taken without prejudice. If such a statement had appeared in the proof of claim, there would arise no question as to estoppel by reason of a supposed election: Thomas v.

The reduction of the claim to judgment, and presentation in the bankruptcy proceedings, was in relief of the liability of Thompson, and not alone for the benefit of the heirs. The total indebtedness due by him in his fiduciary capacity was thereby cut down, but his responsibility as personal representative for the unsatisfied balance remained. The estate was entitled to its share of the fund in the hands of the trustee in bank<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>ruptcy, and it was proper, if not necessary, that the heirs endeavor to secure the portion awardable. In so doing there was no acceptance of the note in satisfaction of the legal liability of the executor, but an effort made to secure all available assets of the fiduciary, who had been declared bankrupt, thus reducing the amount payable by him, and the dividends received were accepted only with his consent.</p>
