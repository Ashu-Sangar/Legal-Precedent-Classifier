A verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiff; defendant moved for judgment n. o. v., and also for a new trial; the court below dismissed the first motion but sustained the second, and, in doing so, said, “We have satisfied ourselves that, under the evidence submitted at the trial......defendant could not be held liable [in damages] for the death of John Regan...... There is, however, proof......of a doctor’s bill...... which was incurred by reason of the injuries sustained by the said John Regan, and for which the defendant might be held responsible.” Finally, the court states: “The only way in which we can dispose of this case justly and equitably is......to allow a new trial.” Defendant has appealed. He complains of the refusal of his motion for judgment n. o. v. and also because the court below granted a new trial; though, as a matter of fact, he prayed the latter relief, and this he was not obliged to do under the act to which we are about to refer.</p>

True, the opinion of the court below fails to recite any other specific reason for granting the new trial, but it does not exclude the possibility of the existence of other reasons. On the contrary, the opinion, by stating that “justice” and “equity” require a new trial, suggests that more than the particular reason which we have mentioned must have impelled the court to enter the order now complained of; and we have heretofore decided that the mere fact of the discussion of only one reason does not necessarily determine that it was the exclusive cause which moved the court to enter a new trial: Class &amp; Nachod Co, v. Giacobello, <a href="/pa/277/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="277 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="1079570" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0530-01">277 Pa. 530</a>, 537. As before said, the opinion in this case states that the evidence “submitted at the trial” did not show defendant liable for the death of plaintiff’s husband; by this is evidently meant that the testimony of the doctors called by plaintiff does not measure up to the requirements of the rule, recently enunciated by us, as governing expert testimony, to the effect that such witnesses must definitely say that in their professional opinion the result alleged is due to the cause assigned; but a reading of the record rather suggests that the fault in this respect was largely due to the form of the questions put to the medical experts, which probably explains why the court indicated that justice and equity moved it to grant the new trial. Under the circumstances, we shall not disturb the order to that effect: see Grossman v. Bessemer &amp; L. E. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/289/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="289 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1103320" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0169-01">289 Pa. 169</a>.</p>

The present doctor’s bill has not been paid by plaintiff and there is nothing on the record to show that she is liable for it; therefore the amount cannot be recovered by her in this proceeding.</p>
