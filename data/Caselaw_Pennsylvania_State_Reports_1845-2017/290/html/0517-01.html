    <p id="b543-4" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[131,998,1156,965]]]'>In constitutional provisions and statutes fixing terms of office, the phraseology usually employed is, for example, “shall hold their offices for the term of four years, beginning on the first Monday of January next after their election” (section 2, article XIY, of Constitution of Pennsylvania, as amended November 2, 1909, 5 Purdon, 5202), or that the officer shall be elected “on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November ......to serve......for a term of three years” (section 1, Act of 1895, supra). It is obvious that, under such phraseology, the terms named can never cover an exact number of calendar years, that each term must comprehend more or less than a calendar year; and therefore, it is only reasonable to assume that, whenever the word “years” is used in legislation of this kind, official, and not calendar, years are meant. We are of opinion that the word “years,” as employed in the Act of 1895, means official years and not calendar years.</p>
    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.6",543,[130,1973,1152,424]],["BL_544.1",544,[203,356,1157,1126]]]'>In Paris v.

Swyer, 10 Barn. &amp; C. <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>486, 109 Eng. Reprints 531, 532, 533, the mayor of an English town was forbidden by law to be again elected to that office “within the space of three years next ensuing the end and determination of” his term. The time intervening between the expiration of the defendant’s term and the time he was reelected was less than three calendar years, but, nevertheless, covered three official years. The court said it was “of opinion that the word year [as used in the law governing the case] imports not a solar, but a charter year.” So, here, we are of opinion that the word “years” in the Act 1895 imports not calendar, but official years. If this were not so, then it would follow that because the first Monday of January, 1928, happens to come a little earlier in the month than the first Monday of January, 1926, the sheriff whose term expired in 1926 could not become county controller, by regular course of election, for six years, while a sheriff whose term expired in some other year might become county controller at the expiration of two years. The law should not be thus construed when there is a way to avoid it.</p>

In the first place, the use of the words “no person holding,” in the early part of the section, suggests that the words “shall be eligible to the office,” following thereafter, mean “shall be eligible to hold”; and, in the next place, if the legislature intended to provide as to eligibility to be elected, instead of eligibility to hold, it could have accomplished this by employing plain words, as it did in the case of county treasurers, when it provided by section 3 of the Act of May 27,1841, P. L. 400, that persons holding certain other positions therein named should not be “eligible to election as county <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>treasurer” during their terms of office or until the expiration of one year thereafter.</p>
    <p id="b545-3" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[126,465,1156,1400]]]'>We have not overlooked the provision at the end of section 2 of the Act of 1895, to the effect that a controller “shall always be eligible to reélection or appointment,” nor the argument of counsel for appellants that this shows it was the intention of the legislature to provide that a sheriff should not be eligible for election to the office of county controller for a period of two years after the end of his term as sheriff. We do not, however, agree with this contention. To our mind the above-quoted words can as well be used to sustain appellees’ contention as appellants’; for, if the phrase “eligible to reélection” is the proper expression to secure one’s right to be elected, it would seem to follow that the dissimilar phrase, “eligible to the office,” previously used in this section of the act, means something different from the right to be elected, and must mean, as we have construed it, the right to take and hold the office. The phrase “eligible to reélection” was, however, a simple and natural one for the legislature to use in ordaining that one holding the office of controller should be entitled to succeed himself notwithstanding the other provisions in the act which require a fixed lapse of time between the expiration of a sheriff’s term and his right to become a county controller; and therefore the use of that phrase has no special significance in construing such lapse-of-time provision.</p>

All that we really decided in Com. v. Pyle (as later explained by us in DeTurk v. Com., <a href="/pa/129/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="129 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="568043" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0151-01">129 Pa. 151</a>, 161) was that “a stockholder in a bank could not hold the office of notary public, because, by the Act of April 14, 1840, the legislature had so declared.” In fact, the opinion states: “We have only to determine......whether [defendant] is a stockholder in the bank”; and that fact was found against him. In DeTurk v. Com., we particularly explained that, in view of this finding of fact, all that Chief Justice Black said “with reference to incompatible offices,” or, in other words, his statement of the above-quoted general rule, “was not necessary to the determination of the question before the court” in the Pyle Case. If, however, we should accept what was written in the latter case as stating a proper rule, it has since been mentioned by us in only one other opinion: Com. ex rel. v.

As said in 22 Ruling Case Law, 402, 403, “The courts do not agree as to the time at which the eligibility or qualification of a person for public office must be determined. The question has arisen most frequently under statutory or constitutional provisions using the word ‘eligible’ in connection with certain qualifications or disqualifications for public office. One line of authorities holds that <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>the time of election is the proper time to test whether a person is qualified or eligible, and that it is immaterial that a person then disqualified removes, the disqualification before actually entering on the duties of the office. ......But the weight of authority appears to be that where the word ‘eligibility’ is used in connection with an office, and there are no explanatory words indicating that such word is used with reference to the time of election, it has reference to the qualification to hold the office, rather than the qualification to be elected to the office.”</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[130,940,1152,953]]]'>It may be, as decided in certain cases, that, where one seeking- nomination for, or election to, an office, is unquestionably ineligible for the position, owing to a disqualifying cause of which he, by some action of his own, may rid himself, the law requires him to take such action before his nomination or election; and this for the reason that it will not be assumed the electors intend to run the risk of the removal of the disability between the date of the candidate’s election and the day fixed for the commencement of his official term. But that reason is inapplicable to this case; here, the elector runs no such risk, for, in the poetic language of senior counsel for appellees, on the day of the election every one will know (as presumably was known theretofore) that, so far as the present question of eligibility is concerned, “the stars in their courses will have him [the candidate] qualified and ready wheii the time comes to take the office.”</p>

Woodside may lawfully be elected to the office for which he is a candidate and therefore his name may be printed on the ballots for the coming election, and the court below did not err in dismissing plaintiff’s bill; but, since the proceedings in this court have been treated by all parties to the record as if the appeal were taken to accomplish a public purpose, we shall not put the costs thereof on appellants.</p>
