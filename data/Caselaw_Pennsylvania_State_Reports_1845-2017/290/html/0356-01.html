With the consent of the Public Service Commission, the latter contracted to purchase, on April 1, 1918, all the property and franchises of the corporation, agreeing to assume its bonded indebtedness, pay claims outstanding to an amount not in excess of $9,000, and turn over $60,000 in cash. The sale was consummated at the time fixed, possession of the plant was taken in May, and it has since been continuously operated by the municipality. In September, the cash consideration paid,—after liquidating certain notes,—was, by agreement of all the stockholders, divided pro rata among them. The appellants, Kunz and Langdon, were two of those interested. Each owned shares of the par value of $5,000, and each received in liquidation $3,750. It was, at the time, believed that all claims due by the corporation had been satisfied either by direct payment, or provided for by the agreement of the borough to satisfy. On or before December 18,1918, the latter settled with outstanding creditors, but found, when its accounts were balanced in the May following, that it had paid out approximately $2,000 more than the $9,000 agreed on. No claim was made for the excess payment, as far as the record discloses, until suit was brought, on March 24, 1924, against the company, which had long since ceased to function. Judgment was obtained by the borough for the amount claimed, on the ground that the additional sum had been voluntarily advanced under mistake of fact, and the judgment is binding as to the amount thereof: Pocono Ice Co. v.

Two months later, and nearly seven years after the last bill was paid, the present proceeding was instituted to charge the defendants with the amount of the judgment, on the theory that they had improperly in their possession assets of the corporation. The provisions of the Act of April 14, 1828 (P. L. 439, <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>10 Sm. L. 213), were invoked, which legislation permits, under designated circumstances, the calling in of officers and members of a private 'corporation in default, to discover if they have concealed its effects for the purpose of avoiding the payment of debts. It further permits proceedings in the nature of a foreign attachment to be pursued against such parties if property is found in their hands belonging to the corporation. In this case, the plaintiff charged a concealment of funds, representing the balance of the purchase price, distributed in entire good faith among the shareholders, when it was believed all debts had been provided for. It was insisted that the division of the remaining assets was irregular, in view of the fact that there had been no formal dissolution of the corporation, and that the money paid still remained its property, the return of which could be demanded.</p>

However, we have here a j udgment against the corporation unappealed from. The effort is to charge the defendants with sums alleged to have been improperly obtained.

It would seem to have been supplied fully by the various sections of the Act of 16th June, 1836, and, though the process of sequestration given by the latter act is taken away by the Act of 1870, and a writ of fi. fa. is substituted for it, the act so amended appears to afford all the remedy that is intended by the Act of 1828.” No appellate decision construing the statute has been called to our attention, nor have we discovered one.

The word “conceal” is one of plain interpretation, defined as a hiding or withdrawing of something from observation, and implies some affirmative action more than a mere failure to disclose: 12 C. J. 373. Concealment means the act of “hiding or keeping secret, the improper suppression or disguise of a fact, circumstance or qualification, which rests within the knowledge of one only of the parties to the contract, but which ought in fairness and good faith to be communicated to the other, whereby the party so concealing draws the other into an engagement which he would not make but for his ignorance of the fact concealed......The term implies design and purpose.

The learned court below instructed the jury that the acceptance of a part of the purchase price by the defendants was in perfect good faith, but declared the mere receipt of a share of the assets before a formal dissolution constituted a constructive concealment with intent to hinder creditors, and, therefore, was within the statute. It held that had there been a formal winding up of the corporation and payment then made, no seizure in execution would have been possible, but, since this did not appear, the funds could be reached in the manner proposed. The fact was found that “there is absolutely no evidence in this case of any fraudulent concealing of property or assets of the Mount Union Water Company by these defendants for the purpose of avoiding the payment of its debts,” but, notwithstanding the. bona tides of the transaction, the court held the creditor might still invoke the provisions of the Act of 1828. We are unable to agree with this proposition. To do so would be to extend the statute beyond its expressed meaning, which is not permissible. The facts do not bring the proceeding within the terms of the legislation forming its basis, and it must therefore fail, and the judgment entered against both defendants be reversed.
