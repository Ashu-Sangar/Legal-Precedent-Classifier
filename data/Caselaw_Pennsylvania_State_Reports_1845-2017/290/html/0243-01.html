Mehard two loans of $2,000 and $800 respectively, each of. which they secured by bond and mortgage. The loans were obtained through L. M. Uber, an attorney, residing at the City of New Castle, the county seat of Lawrence County, who had, for many years, been acting as agent for Mehard, a resident of Wampum, nine miles distant from the county seat, in lending money on mortgage security. Interest was paid promptly by defendants to Uber, also payments made to him on account of principal amounting to $1,565. Upon Uber’s death, it was discovered he had not only failed to pay over to Mehard the installments of principal received by him from defendants, but also had defaulted in similar transactions between Mehard and others in which he represented the former. Later Mehard died, and a sci. fa. was issued for his executor to collect the two mortgages, the claim being for their full amount, together with unpaid interest. The defense was that Uber acted as Mehard’s agent and that payment to the former was payment to the latter, and consequently only the bal<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>anee of unpaid principal and interest was due on the mortgages. The jury found for plaintiff for the balance admitted, amounting to $1,542.40, the court below however subsequently entered judgment for plaintiff non obstante veredicto for the full amount of both mortgages without deduction for payments made to Uber, on account of the principal debt, on the theory that the proof offered was insufficient to sustain the finding that the attorney was authorized by Mehard to collect principal or any part of it secured by the mortgages. Uber made investments for Doctor Mehard from time to time, the total amount of money in the hands of the former for that purpose aggregating from twenty to thirty thousand dollars. The usual course of procedure in making loans or reinvestments, was for Uber to notify Mehard of the request received by him for a loan, whereupon Uber would inspect the property, examine the title and prepare the necessary papers, if the loan received the approval of Doctor Mehard. After settlement the attorney would mail the bond to Mehard and record the mortgage. When returned from the recorder’s office, the mortgage would either be sent to Mehard or .retained by Uber. The latter collected interest and remitted to Mehard from time to time and also repeatedly collected principal. Installments of principal were not always remitted but frequently retained by Uber awaiting opportunity to reinvest. Statements sent to Mehard at intervals showing principal and interest collected were admitted in evidence, these were at times accompanied by a check for the balance remaining in Uber’s hands. A ledger kept by him showing the collection and receipt of money on account of both principal and interest on mortgages was also admitted in evidence under objection, for the purpose of showing the course of dealing between Mehard and Uber, and as tending to show the latter acted as agent of the former in matters of the character here in controversy.</p>
