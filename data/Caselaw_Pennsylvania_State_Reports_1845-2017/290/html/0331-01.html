It was claimed that the paving within or along the <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>tracks of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, occupying the street by virtue of a grant to a predecessor, regularly acquired by the operating corporation, had become in disrepair, and, as a result, the steering wheel of the machine was wrenched from the driver’s hand with the resulting injury complained of. Suit was brought against the street railway in the courts of Philadelphia County to recover damages. The fact that it maintained its tracks under a franchise which required it to keep the street in proper condition, was averred, and the failure to perform this duty, with the amount of damage resulting, set forth in the statement filed. At the trial proof was offered to show the street surface was not defective, and therefore the charge of negligence was unfounded, and testimony produced of contributory negligence on part of the plaintiff. After a full and careful charge, the questions of fact were submitted to a jury, and a verdict rendered for the defendant, upon which judgment was entered, and no appeal taken.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[227,1374,1156,1019]],["BL_357.1",357,[133,342,1151,533]]]'>Later, the present action was brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County against the Borough of Darby, present defendant, based on the same cause of action as asserted in the suit against the transit company. The affidavit of defense, setting forth the record of the first proceeding, was brought to the attention of the court when the case was called, and counsel for plaintiff admitted that Brobston was “the same person who was plaintiff in an action brought in Philadelphia, that the action there brought was for the same injuries occurring at the place, and in the time and manner for which the action is brought in this court, now on trial, and that a verdict in that case, decided in Philadelphia, was entered by the jury in favor of the defendant.” The cause of action, and the facts upon which the right to recover rested, were the same, the only difference being in the name of the defendant. These stipulations were avowedly entered of record to enable the court to pass upon the legal question involved, as to the right of a plaintiff <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>to recover under such circumstances. Notwithstanding the formal admissions, counsel made an offer to prove the same facts, which the court refused, and, on motion, a nonsuit was entered because of the former adjudication.. Complaint is now made that the plaintiff should have been permitted to call witnesses to establish the matters already agreed to, but we see no merit in the complaint. All facts essential to the legal determination of liability were before the court, and had been voluntarily placed there by consent of both parties.</p>

There, the question of the effect of a former judgment for defendant, when sued by an injured guest, was held not to bar a later suit by the driver of the car which had been struck by another, where no previous record was produced disclosing what had been passed upon in the first proceeding, and the defense was not asserted until the motion for a new trial was presented. Under such circumstances it was held impossible to determine what issue was involved in the previous trial. A very different situation appears here, and the learned court below properly disposed of the merits on the record as made up by the parties. The motion to take off the non-suit, granted in the present case, was refused, and plaintiff has appealed.</p>
