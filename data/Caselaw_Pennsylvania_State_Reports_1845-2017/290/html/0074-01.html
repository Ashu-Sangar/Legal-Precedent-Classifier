In fact the power of attorney plaintiffs gave Mr. Meagher only permits him to settle or compromise with their approval. Furthermore, the attorney’s letter to Caskie purports to be on his own part and is a personal undertaking. As there was no proof of authority, or of ratification, the request for binding instructions for defendant was necessarily refused, as was his first point which omitted these elements of the case. So far as appears in this record, plaintiffs might have brought suit at any time against the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co. See Housenick v. Miller, <a href="/pa/93/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="93 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="442079" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0514-01">93 Pa. 514</a>. Of course, the clients might ratify the attorney’s agreement, but the undisputed evidence in the instant case is that they never did and knew nought of it until brought out at the trial. Ratification must be based on knowledge. See Whitesell &amp; Sons, to use, v. Peck et al., <a href="/pa/165/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="165 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="862061" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0571-01">165 Pa. 571</a>.</p>

As to this it is sufficient to say no such question was raised in the lower court, either at the trial or on the motion for a new trial, hence it cannot be considered here. This rule is so familiar and announced in so many recent cases as to make references thereto unnecessary. It would be unfair to convict a trial court of error on a proposition not brought to its attention. The question of granting a new trial is for the lower court’s discretion and, while its refusal here is assigned as error, it is not pressed or embraced in the statement of questions involved.</p>
