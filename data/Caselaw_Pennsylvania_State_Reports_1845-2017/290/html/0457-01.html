He authorized his trustees either tó retain his securities, or sell them and invest the proceeds, without being limited to those regarded as “legal investments.” The “rents, issues, income, dividends and revenue” were to be paid by the trustees to designated beneficiaries for life, and, at their death, the corpus was to pass to remaindermen. In September, 1920, the orphans’ court authorized the trustees to enter into an agreement with Erlanger and others by which leases of certain theaters were procured. Five corporations were organized for the purpose of operating the theaters. The trustees became owners of one-fifth of the stock in these corporations, their total financial interest, purchase price and loans, being about $21,370. This stock was sold for $170,000, and it is claimed that $40,000 of this sum represented income earned by the theater companies during the life of the agreement, and was distributable as such to the life tenants under the will. <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>The auditing judge held that the income must pass with the corpus, and, unless dividends were in fact declared, the rule should not he otherwise.

    <p id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[103,1000,1154,1395]],["BL_484.1",484,[243,346,1152,369]]]'>In deciding appellant’s case, we determine rights as between life tenant and remainderman where trustees sell shares of stock, receiving a price greater than the value of the stock at the time of testator’s death, the increase being due in part to an ascertained accumulated surplus from the earnings of the corporation. It is necessary then to review generally these rights where the subject of the trust consists of shares of corporate stock. We must carefully distinguish between the decided cases wherein these rights as they relate to income or earnings in certain aspects have been considered, and the situations which, it is argued, leave open other aspects of income and earnings in which the relative rights have not been ascertained, and evolve, if possible, from the former, a rule for the latter. For convenience we shall consider the subject under the following general heads: the judicial attitude, (A) where earnings qua earnings come into the hands of the trustee through an actual distribution by the corporation; (B) where the earnings are undistributed by the corporation, but their value is reflected in dollars in the hands of the trustee through a sale of the stock by him; and (C) where earnings hav^not been distributed by the corporation and the stock is unsold in the trustees’s hands. Earnings of a corporation may be divided into gross and net, and the net earnings may again be divided into (1) that por<a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>tion applicable to a usual or customary dividend at a fixed per cent or sum per share, paid at regular periods, and (2) extraordinary dividends which may assume an unusual form and amount, paid at irregular intervals from accumulated surplus or earnings. Both kinds of dividends must, of course, be declared out of earnings or profits.</p>

It is the general rule as to ordinary dividends, well established in Pennsylvania, that when the trustee receives, after the creation of the trust, money as earnings of the estate or income, its source being an ordinary dividend paid by a corporation, it belongs to the life tenants, regardless of how soon thereafter it is declared. The reason given for this rule is that dividends, unlike interest on bonds, are not earned de die ad diem, and, consequently, are not, in the absence of unusual circumstances, apportionable.</p>
    <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[234,1376,1152,420]]]'>2. When the earnings have been permitted to accumulate by a corporation and their proceeds invested in corporate property, in working capital, or retained as cash or its equivalent, and an extraordinary dividend is declared in stock or cash, the respective rights of life tenants and remaindermen have been variously adjudicated. Three rules prevail—the Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Kentucky rules.</p>

The effect of the rule is to give to the life tenant the income which has been earned since the trust came into being, but, at the same time, to preserve the value of the corpus as it was at the date of the death of the testator, or, to use a more convenient term, to preserve the intact value of the estate. This intact value includes the par value of the stock plus any accumulation of income earned before the death of the testator: Earp’s App., supra.

It makes no kind of difference whether this fund is secured by 540 or by 1,350 certificates. Its character cannot be changed by the evidences given to secure it.

Judge Henderson, speaking for the Superior Court, in Yeech’s Est., supra, distinguished Thompson’s Estate upon the ground that a dividend was declared by the corporation. This does not seem to be reconcilable with our opinion as written by Mr. Justice Simpson.</p>

The corporation has, undivided, an accumulation of earnings, profits or income, called surplus. It is rightfully divisible among the shareholders if the managers of the corporation should choose to distribute it. The trustees, as shareholders, in right of the estate, would be entitled to participate in such distribution. In McKeown’s Est., <a href="/pa/263/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="263 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1047499" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0078-01">263 Pa. 78</a>, one phase of accumulated earnings presented itself when the stock of one company was sold by its shareholders to another concern. What actually happened was a sale of stock by the trustee, but we treated it as a distribution by a corporation in the course of liquidation. A part of the proceeds was accumulated earnings; we held it should be distributed as though the company had in fact declared a dividend, and hence was payable to the life tenant, the intact value being unimpaired. The facts in that case, important to the instant case, were substantially as follows: Four thousand shares of stock of the Pure Oil Company at the death of testator had an intact value of $12.22 a share. It was sold for $24.50 a share to an Ohio company, which acquired all Pure Oil Stock. The book value at this time was $15.18, the difference, $2.96, being due to accumulation of earnings. The difference between the selling price and the then book value, $9.32, represented the inherent, intrinsic, or supervalue of the stock over and above its then book value, and was awarded, without objection, to the cor<a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>pus of the estate. The life tenant claimed the accumulated profits, or $2.96 per share. The court below refused to allow the claim, and was reversed by this court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Simpson. It may be well to state that, in reaching our conclusion in that case, it was necessary to consider generally the respective rights of life tenants and remaindermen in all situations similar to that which we were then called upon to determine, and also the general effect of that decision as bear- „ ing upon other similar situations of a slightly different nature emanating through similar channels. To strip that authority of its .persuasive effect in other disputes, is to deny the correct and logical foundation on which it is based, as well as its logical sequence. We will not detail the reasoning on which we reached the conclusion that accumulated earnings, not declared by dividends, but realized on a sale, belong to the life tenant, but will state the four primary rules evolved by Mr. Justice Simpson from the decided cases. “(1) An ordinary corporate dividend is usually payable in its entirety to the party entitled to the income at the time the dividend was declared. (2) An extraordinary corporate dividend is presumptively payable to the party entitled to the income at the time the dividend was declared; but this presumption must yield to proof of the fact, and if it appears that by such dividend the corporate assets are reduced below their value at the time the trust began, the principal must be made good before anything is awarded to income. (3) If stock is sold which belongs to the principal, ordinarily all the proceeds thereof also belong to the principal. (4) When a corporation is liquidated, those entitled to the income of the trust are to be awarded so much of the sums received for the stock as they show was income accruing after their right to income began, and the balance goes to principal; and this is so although the course pursued takes the form of a sale of the stock.” The auditing judge in McKeown’s Estate found the sale of the stock by the trustee, includ<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>ing accumulated and undistributed income as part of its value, amounted to a liquidation of the oil company and the distribution by it of the corporate earnings. The instant ease, though of slightly different aspect, is governed by the principle controlling the last of these general rules.</p>

Should it go to the life tenant or to the remainderman? Or, in other words, why should the minor liquidation of interest in a corporation by a member thereof in selling his shares of stock therein not be effective as a liquidation which reflects substantially a distribution by the corporation of its accumulated earnings and increment value by reason of that membership? It would seem the reasoning in McKeown’s Est., supra, and Earp’s App., supra, answers the general question in the affirmative. Earp’s App., supra, p. 374, states: “The managers might withhold the distribution of it for a time, for reasons beneficial to the interests of the parties entitled. But they could not, by any form of procedure whatever deprive the owners of it, and give it to others not entitled. The omission to distribute it semiannually, as it accumulated, makes no change in its ownership.”</p>

The capital stock is evidence of the estate’s ownership in the corporation; it is the estate’s certificate of membership in the association measured by so many ghares. These shares earn for the estate a proportionate share of the income, profit or earnings of the company. When a dividend rate is fixed, so much of these earnings, necessary for payment, are taken from the corporate stock, represented by income, and the balance is carried forward as <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>an accumulation of income, surplus or profits. This accumulation may be retained by the company to enlarge the business or to provide working capital, or as a reserve fund to provide against losses. These may be transferred into capital account, Avhere the evidence may be stock distributed as an extraordinary dividend. Where the earned accumulations remain in the company undisposed of, the shareholders’ interest therein and right thereto is undisturbed; no matter what such accumulations may be called by the corporation or what form they may assume, the names do not aid in determining the rights of the life tenant and remaindermen to such income.</p>

It includes the return earned by capital stock. It has a broader meaning than the term “dividend”; it includes profits. We said in Quay’s Est., <a href="/pa/253/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="253 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1024039" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0080-01">253 Pa. 80</a>, that profits included not only the' accumulations of earnings, but. the advances or increment in value. It is not necessary to include the latter in the definition. What the testator did was to give to the life tenant all this income. It included all the earnings which his membership in the company or ownership in stock are responsible for, or would bring about, but not the stock’s earning power. That inheres in the stock. Income of the corporation is a product of capital, part of which was furnished and OAvned by this estate: Com. v. Pitts., Fort Wayne and Chicago Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/74/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="74 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1034741" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0083-01">74 Pa. 83</a>, 90. Therefore every principle of justice demands that the direction of testator be fulfilled, and that life tenants should receive this income. There is not one single element of justice that speaks for the corpus of the estate to take the earnings. The mere fact that it is earned and retained by the company should not prevent the life tenants from ultimately receiving it unless that receipt does harm to <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>the corpus (intact value) of the estate. Where the intact value is in money in the trustee’s hands, as here $21,370, with the assumed accumulated surplus, $40,000, and the increment in value, $110,000, also in money, to hold that the corpus should be entitled to all would be to disregard the positive instructions of the testator; the income at least should be given to his life tenant beneficiaries.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[121,788,1154,1503]]]'>The argument most generally advanced is that as the accumulated earnings are definitely ascertained' as to time and amount by the corporation the managers alone are responsible for its division among members. They should be permitted freely to discharge that duty to théir fellow members by distributing the earnings in a manner and at a time which to them shall be deemed most advantageous for the corporation itself. This overlooks the really important question in this and other cases; it is not the right between the corporation on the one side and the life tenant and remaindermen on the other that we are discussing, but the right as between the latter two; as stated by Mr. Justice Simpson in McKeown’s Est., supra, p. 84: “That is a matter solely between the corporation and the stockholder, and does not necessarily determine the rights of a life tenant and remainderman in an estate owning such stock. If the company declares a dividend, whether of stock or cash, partially out of earnings and partially out of principal, a court of equity, made cognizant of the fact, will apportion the dividend between the life tenant and the remainderman, in such a way as to maintain intact the principal of the estate, only giving the balance to the life tenant. So also, if a corporation sells its capital and accumulated income for a gross sum, a court of equity should distribute that sum according to like equitable principles.” We are not interested in the conduct of the affairs of the corporation.</p>

Nothing is done that, in the slightest, involves the financial structure of the company. When a trustee sells the stock of a company and the profit represents an accumulation of earnings or surplus in addition to intact value, he has physical possession of the income apart from any other consideration. The only screen held up to defeat the life tenants is that the corporation did not formally declare it as a dividend, though it has every such quality, except the name, withheld by the company. In such cases, the sale, in substance and effect, amounts to a distribution, as in the case of liquidation of a corporation. The court will disregard the form, and treat it as a distribution of accumulated interest or earnings, keeping in mind always that the intact value of the corpus shall not be in any way depleted. Equity looks through the form and holds to the substance, and will distribute that sum according to equitable principles. In Quay’s Est., supra, the court went farther than is necessary for us to do, but the case illustrates the judicial leaning toward the rule that accumulated earnings should go to the life tenant and remaindermen in a just proportion as indicated in the distribution of stock dividends. In Peterson’s Est., <a href="/pa/242/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="242 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="998722" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0330-01">242 Pa. 330</a>, where there was a distribution of accumulated earnings worth many times more than the intact value at death, we said, (pp. 333-4) : “These earnings were income pure and simple; the fact that they were allowed to accumulate instead of being regularly distributed did not change their character in this regard. Being income, and so far in excess of the reasonable and legitimate requirements of the business of the corporation that its distribution could have been enforced at any time by those entitled to receive it, their permitting it to accumulate was on their part the assertion of ownership. <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>Mrs. Peterson was the undoubted owner in her own right of a share in these accumulations in the proportion that the 250 shares of stock in the trust fund stood to the whole issue of stock. This was hers to do with as she pleased; it was free from any trust; leaving it in the corporation was her own act, and the corporation thereupon became her debtor to that extent.” The income was undoubtedly Mrs. Peterson’s. When the company distributed it after her death, her husband was entitled to receive it regardless of the form it took.</p>

Until there has been such division, the life tenant is not entitled to any increase in the value of the principal of the trust fund, or the capital and assets of the corporation, shares of which constitute the trust fund. <em>But when there has been a division of the corporate property, no matter what form it may take, </em>that part thereof which consists of accumulated profits or earnings belongs to the life tenant and that which is capital to the remainderman.” In Schaffer’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=165%20N.Y.S.%2019" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="165 N.Y.S. 19">165 N.

Concededly, it represents in part accumulated profits earned during the lifetime of the trust, .■.....Otherwise,......the accumulated profits will go to the unlawful increase of the corpus of the estate and the enrichment of the remaindermen at the expense of the life beneficiary.” The life tenant had apportioned to him so much of the surplus as was earned during the trust.</p>

What these managements may do is corporation law. What the rights of the remaindermen and life tenants are in corporation shares is a question of what it may reasonably be found was the intent of the creator of the trust.” As the court intimates, there is not a single disposition which required the income to be subjected to the hard and fast rule of corporation law in the distribution of dividends. On the other hand, the Kentucky court, in Guthrie’s Trustee v. Aikers, <a href="/ky/157/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="157 Ky. 149" data-case-ids="4425275" data-case-paths="/ky/157/0149-01">157 Ky. 149</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20S.W.%201117" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="163 S.W. 1117">163 S.

Schaeffer’s Est., supra, is in line with the thought of this opinion, and wherever Connolly's Est. (No. 1), <a href="/pa/198/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="198 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="920354" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0137-01">198 Pa. 137</a>, touches the question, McKeown’s App., supra, overrules it. In Connolly’s Est. (No. 1), supra, p. 143, it is stated: “The increase in value of these stocks is no doubt due in part to surplus earnings retained by the corporation......also in part to the enhancement of their original value. ‘Such enhancement belongs not to the tenant for life but to the remainder-man’ : Eisner’s Est., <a href="/pa/175/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="175 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="880499" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0143-01">175 Pa. 143</a>; and as there is no evidence here from which the proportions of the increase due to the surplus earnings and to the enhancement of the original value of the stock can be found......Earp’s Appeal should not be followed.” The rise in the value of trust investments, where such rise has not been shown by one claiming as a life .tenant to be due to undistributed earnings, has always been properly regarded, like the rise in the value of lands held in trust, to be an accretion of the principal, and, therefore, belongs to the remainderman. See Park’s Est., <a href="/pa/173/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="173 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="875783" data-case-paths="/pa/173/0190-01">173 Pa. 190</a>.</p>

This is true regardless of the form, whether in stock after death, as in Peterson’s Estate, cash, as in this and McKeown’s Estate, or other corporate securities, is immaterial. There is one condition to which this rule is subject, wherein it would seem that part of the earnings should go to the corpus of the estate; this is where the stock is sold when an ordinary dividend is anticipated, but not paid. The fact that the price appears to have been enhanced by reason thereof, or that the price may represent, in part, expected dividends, does not entitle the life tenant to that increase. In McKeown’s Est., supra, it was held that the seven cents per share was in fact earnings which were to be declared as an ordinary, regular dividend and the sale of the stock by the trustee before they were payable permitted the new holder, the purchaser, to receive the dividend.

There is the amount set apart as earnings, divided into dividends paid and undivided as surplus which may be found in the “profit and loss” account. This may not be conclusive or the only method, but it is an illustration. However the accounts are kept, it is quite easy to strike a balance; but, even if it is difficult, “the difficulty of proving a fact,” as Mr. Justice Simpson observes in Mc-Keown’s Est., supra, “has never been held to deprive one of a right, growing out of such fact, if and when proved; <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>and as to the former it is sufficient to say that in a court of equity, as the orphans’ court is within the sphere of its jurisdiction, substance is never sacrificed to form,” even though the corporation may be of another state.

As to the first proposition, the answer must, of course, be in the negative. The stock, with its accumulated earnings and intact value and whatever other element of value which may attach to it, is subject to the vicissitudes of corporate life, and as such it must bear its share of-whatever comes and goes. Other property of the estate cannot be required to be set apart to pay life tenants the accumulated surplus retained by the corporation. The surplus and all other items of value remain, subject to debts, reverses, losses and decline in value because of business conditions. As long as the stock remains in the hands of the trustee, he is not required to account to life tenants for anything except the dividends received. Therefore, such requirements cannot be considered in the management of the estate; and in this connection we may say the increment of value in <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>the stock itself, or the intrinsic value of the stock, is the property of the remainderman. This refers, in the McKeown’s Est., supra, to the $9.32 above noted.</p>
    <p id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[209,496,1153,528]]]'>As to the right to compel the trustee to sell such stock through petition in the orphans’ court, we express no opinion. Generally speaking, it is subject to the same rules that govern any property in the hands of a trustee. Whether it be for the best interest of the estate to make a sale under given circumstances or not, is addressed largely to the discretion of the court below. As to the possible liability of the trustee for failure to make a sale, this, as we suggested above, is determined by the rules in the cases before referred to in this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[204,1037,1155,1339]],["BL_501.1",501,[118,329,1156,801]]]'>In conclusion we may summarize what has been said above. First, an ordinary dividend belongs entirely to the life tenant (McKeen’s App., <a href="/pa/42/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="42 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="481557" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0479-01">42 Pa. 479</a>, and see McKeown’s Est., <a href="/pa/263/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="263 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1047499" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0078-01">263 Pa. 78</a>, 85). Second, an extraordinary dividend paid out of accumulated earnings, presumptively belongs to the life tenant but, if it be shown that the distribution impairs the intact value of the estate, the court will make an apportionment (Earp’s App., <a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>). Third, where the corporation gives to the trustee the right to subscribe for new stock, the weight of the authorities in this State would seem to require that it be apportioned (see Wiltbank’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="64 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1021278" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0256-01">64 Pa. 256</a>; Moss’s App., <a href="/pa/83/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="83 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1050781" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0264-01">83 Pa. 264</a>; Eisner’s Est., <a href="/pa/175/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="175 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="880499" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0143-01">175 Pa. 143</a>; Thompson’s Est., <a href="/pa/262/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="262 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1044500" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0278-01">262 Pa. 278</a>. Fourth, where the trustee sells stock and the sale in substance effects a distribution, as in the case of liquidation of the company, the court will disregard the form and treat the sale as a distribution (McKeown’s Est., supra). Fifth, where the trustee sells stock and receives a price greater than the value of the stock at the time of the death of the testator, or at the time it was acquired, the profit being due to an accumulation of income, the court should apportion the proceeds. Sixth, where the. trustee sells stock and receives a price greater than the value of the stock at the time of the death of the testator, or at the <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>time it was acquired, the super value being due to the enhancement or increment of original value through the stock’s earning power or what may be termed its “good will” or its intrinsic value, this increased value is part of the corpus and belongs to the remainderman. Seventh, where the stock is held by the trustee, and its value is enhanced by reason of accumulated earnings which have not been declared in dividends, the life tenant is not entitled to payment out of other property of the estate. Eighth, where the trustee sells stock at a profit which is due to enhanced market value, and not to accumulated earnings, the increase must be regarded as a capital gain (Connolly’s Est. (No. 1), <a href="/pa/198/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="198 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="920354" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0137-01">198 Pa. 137</a>, 141, 143; and see Neel’s Est. (No. 2), <a href="/pa/207/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="207 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="933506" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0446-01">207 Pa. 446</a>; McKeown’s Est., <a href="/pa/263/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="263 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1047499" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0078-01">263 Pa. 78</a>).</p>

The sale price was $170,000, and it was assumed by Judge Gest and the court in banc that $40,000 of this sum represented accumulated earnings. It was on that basis the case was decided and evidently the court below was impressed with the fact that the accumulated surplus had been sufficiently proven. When we turn to the record we notice the statements of counsel that this was a fact, and appellee did not then controvert it. When the case was argued in this court by appellant, it was on the basis that such income did exist. This conclusion was strenuously resisted by the present appellees here, and, as we read the record, there is nothing which adequately supports a finding of $40,000 surplus. There was undoubtedly considerable confusion as to this primary fact evidenced by the manner in which it and other facts were stated. No doubt the court below felt that the statement of counsel had been accepted by appellees because of their silence. We could not reverse a judgment when the record is in this shape, but we realize that it is not entirely just to appellants who seemed to rely upon the fact that statements of counsel were apparently ac<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>cepted as proof. The only judgment we can enter here is one of affirmance without prejudice to the right of appellants to ask that the judgment be opened in the court below in order that satisfactory evidence may be procured to prove that the purchase price included $40,000 accumulated earnings.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[226,665,1151,96]]]'>The judgment is affirmed without prejudice, as last above stated, at the cost of appellants.</p>
