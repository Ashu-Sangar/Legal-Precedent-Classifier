The nearest tank is at present 900 feet from plaintiff’s land, but it is proposed by appellee to construct two tanks, one 83% feet, the other 417 feet, from the boundary line. Each tank will store 75,000 gallons of oil or its byproducts.

The gravamen of appellant’s bill lies in the charge that petroleum, or any of its by-products, is readily ignited from “a stroke of lightning, spark, flame, or the heat rays of the summer sún,” and it is “susceptible” to such ignition; and that because of this, the tank containing petroleum would be “an ever present, threatening, dangerous menace to the land, property and estate of the plaintiff.” Appellant does not aver that appellee’s business is a nuisance, her prayer for an injunction proceeds on the theory that the proposed use of appellee’s plant and equipment at this location becomes a nuisance to her as an adjoining landowner. It was, of course, necessary for her cause to show that the use is inherently dangerous to life and property at the particular place. The subject-matter of the claim is the power of the business to do harm. The subject-matter should speak dangei’, of itself, without intervening agency, unless the latter is reasonably certain, ox*, if it is not known as such dangerous agency and does not actually exist in fact, it should be so described that the result reasonably to be expected shows that danger; if this is done, the court may then open the door for hearing and proof.</p>

A nuisance per se, as relating to private persons, is an act or use of property of a continuing nature offensive to and legally injurious to health and property, or both. A given condition may be, at all times and places, a nuisance per se. As related to business, its inherent qualities or elements must be such that it must reasonably follow, in a particular locality or surrounding, that there will be an injury to property or a discomfort to the individual, with a resulting injury to property. The difference between a business, which, no matter how it is conducted, is a nuisance per se as to certain location and surrounding, and a business which is being so conducted as to become a nuisance, lies in the proof, not in the remedy. In the former, the right to relief is established by averment and proof of the mere act; in the other, proof of the act and its consequences is necessary: Dennis v. Eckhardt, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Grant%20390" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="2 Grant 390">2 Grant 390</a>. A given business is in itself a nuisance per se when it is generally known to be injurious to health and to cause legal damage to property in certain localities and surroundings, regardless of how it may be carried on. “The common experience of mankind, of which the courts take judicial notice, has found, in certain localities and surroundings, certain pursuits to be universally injurious to health and damage to property, no matter how carefully conducted.” Such pursuits are, in given places, nuisances per se. The following circumstances attending a business or property that give rise to a nuisance per se are, offensive or noxious odors or smells, undue noise of crowds, music, motors, gambling, improper construction of buildings, and the like, that are injurious to morals, life, health and property. As illustrating a business that is perfectly lawful, becoming unlawful and a nuisance per se as in a certain <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>locality, reference is made to those cases where it has been judicially determined that the business was unlawful near dwellings or in built up sections.</p>

Fertilizing Co., supra, the manufacture of bone fertilizer near the home of a farmer was held to be a nuisance per se because noxious odors and offensive smells were inseparable from the manufacture. This circumstance was a fixed fact, the knowledge of it was common to everybody, the court could take judicial notice of it. The same was true of the use of property in a city as a livery stable (Houghton v. Kendrick, <a href="/pa/285/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="285 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1095147" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0223-01">285 Pa. 223</a>) and a stockyard (Eckels v.

All of these uses were held to possess inherent qualities which, as to a given locality, have been condemned by the courts as nuisances per se. In other words, though the business be lawful, as, for instance, a powder mill in an outlying district (Dilworth’s App., <a href="/pa/91/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="91 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="487685" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0247-01">91 Pa. 247</a>), it becomes unlawful because of location and surroundings.</p>

In considering the question in this case, we must determine from the disclosed uses to which the property is to be put in the place described, not only whether it possesses the power to do harm, but whether injury will necessarily result from the proposed use, or whether the use subjects the property to such contact with outside agencies that its probable result will be dangerous.

True, it does say that petroleum and its by-products are highly explosive, readily ignited, and susceptible to ignition from lightning, spark, flame, intense heat of the sun, or internal combustion. It does not charge that the natural, the probable result of the building with its contents will be an explosion or a fire. It does not charge that this would be a “plainly manifest” result from placing oil or its by-product in the tank. It does charge that, because it is readily ignited and because it is susceptible to ignition, the result of the use of the building under the circumstances would be a constant menace and danger. All of this is purely problematic or conjectural. Of course, petroleum and its by-products, under the circumstances here existing, are readily ignited, but will they be ignited? Is that likely? Does common experience show it? Is the manner of use as described such that the probabilities are that they will be? The words “readily” and “susceptible” are words of anticipation, apprehen<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>sion or mere fear, or, as the authorities say, doubtful, eventual, or contingent.

Take, for illustration, gas containers or tanks, storage tanks for automobile use, automobiles, dynamite used in the conduct of business, paper companies using large quantities of paper, or hay in a field or a barn, all are readily ignited and susceptible to flame, sparks, lightning and combustion. To stamp them as nuisances per se without showing, not merely apprehension or anticipation, but that the reasonable and normal result of the use will be a fire and consequent destruction, would greatly widen the heretofore existing scope of equity jurisdiction and greatly hamper necessary business through groundless fears.</p>

Under these findings, it could not be determined otherwise than that the ordinance in question is unreasonable. It was conclusively shown that not the amount of gasoline stored, but the manner of its storage, determines the question of danger therefrom and that as here stored in modern scientifically constructed tanks it is not dangerous.
