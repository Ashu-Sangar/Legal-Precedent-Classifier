Hartig, was injured while working as an employee of a subcontractor in the construction of an ice plant for defendant, the American Ice Company. On the day of the accident, he was engaged in mixing paints on the first floor, some seven feet back from an open or exposed side of the building; this floor was about six feet above the ground level. Sometime <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>before, an automobile truck loaded with iron pipe had taken a position along this open side with its rear against the floor, near plaintiff. Hartig had his back to the truck, and, as he arose from a stooping posture, he was struck and injured by a piece of large pipe which the truck driver was unloading by pushing it from his car, lengthwise. Plaintiff brought this action against defendant ice company and also against two others, the general contractor and the plumbing subcontractor. At the close of plaintiff’s testimony, nonsuits were entered as to the latter parties, who were not shown to have had anything to do with the accident. A verdict was rendered against the remaining defendant, but, notwithstanding this, the court below subsequently entered judgment in its favor, and plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b46-4" data-blocks='[["BL_46.4",46,[232,1149,1155,1180]]]'>Hartig testified that the truck from which the pipe was being unloaded bore the name of defendant ice company. This testimony, and the circumstances that the accident occurred on defendant company’s premises and in the course of reconstruction of their building, that the driver of the truck, who unloaded the pipe, had been seen operating the car when it was driven into the yard, and some other testimony, on defendant’s side, from which the inference might be drawn that the pipe belonged to the latter, were the only facts connecting that company or its employees with the injury. Defendant, on the other hand, contended, and presented evidence tending to show, that it took no active part in the construction work, that its trucks did not haul pipes to the building, that it did not own a truck of the type described by plaintiff, and not more than one approaching that type; and, as to this last, defendant produced testimony which, if believed, might exclude it from consideration. These proofs and evidence to sustain an affirmative defense of the statute of limitations, to which we shall refer later and more at large, constituted defendant’s case.</p>

Defendant, on the contrary, claims that the mere presence of its name on the truck was not enough to warrant submitting the issues involved to the jury, in the absence of other supporting testimony, of which, it claims, there was none; but, in so contending, defendant entirely overlooks the other features of plaintiff’s case to which we have called attention in, the immediately preceding paragraph of this opinion.

While the ascertainment of the underlying facts and the drawing of the inferences and final conclusions therefrom, are for the jury, even where strong conflicting oral evidence is produced by a defendant, yet, in every such instance, a grave responsibility rests upon the trial judge to see to it that no verdict contrary to the weight of the evidence or shocking to judicial conscience is allowed to <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>stand, no matter how many new trials must be granted in order to effect the ends of justice; and this will always be so, until [if ever] the fundamental law, which ordains that trial by jury shall be as heretofore, is changed to give greater power, in the realm of fact, to the judiciary.”</p>

Then, however, he gave testimony as to his doings for some months following the accident, which tended to show it happened at an earlier date,—probably in February, 1923. Next, he admitted visiting the Workmen’s Compensation Bureau in March, 1924, and also that, after describing the accident to the official there in charge, he, plaintiff, was informed that the one year allowed in which to make claim under the compensation law, was up and he was too late. This, of course, would indicate that the accident must have occurred in March, 1923, or earlier, for plaintiff admitted also that he, at the time, agreed with the official with whom he was talking that it was too late to file a petition. But, later in his cross-examination, plaintiff said that he visited the Compensation Bureau in September, 1924, not in March. Defendant put in evidence a statement of claim, sworn to by plaintiff on January 14, 1925, in which he charged to another defendant the accident claimed for in the case now before us; in that pleading plaintiff said he was injured at the plant of the American Ice Co. “in or about March or April, 1923.” Plaintiff attributed this alleged misstatement of date to his attorney. Defendant produced other, oral, testimony of an interview with plaintiff in which the witness said Hartig had fixed a date for the accident more than two years prior to June, 1925. Defendant also showed facts from which it would appear that building operations in the erection of its plant had ceased prior to June 19, 1923. Finally, defendant produced the man in charge of the pay roll for Henry S. Rau &amp; Co., by whom plaintiff was employed <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>at the time of the accident, who testified that the pay roll records of that concern showed that Hartig did not work on the American Ice Company job in June, 1923; the last day he appears as working at this place was during the week ending May 2, 1923, and plaintiff was paid “no wages after that.” The testimony of this last witness seems strong indeed, but, unfortunately for defendant, the witness did not undertake his duties as custodian of the Rau &amp; Co. pay records till January 20, 1925. Again, he admitted that the records had been moved, when his company had “moved from one place to another,” and that he did not know “whether the person who put the records there [where he found them] had put them all there.” Defendant failed to provea the completeness of the records in question; and, moreover, it did not show the business organization of Rau &amp; Co. or its method of keeping records sufficiently to have the present pay records speak for themselves, under the modern theory as to records made in the regular course of an extensive business being documentary evidence in themselves. In short, all the evidence for defendant was of a character that had to be passed on by the jury.</p>

I believe this rule, when applied in full vigor at the trial of cases, aids the administration of justice, and that where the case of a plaintiff rests solely upon a presumption, the presumption should go down before evidence of facts to the contrary given by witnesses whose integrity is not assailed. In my opinion, “There can be no presumption as against facts which are clearly proven”: Zotter v. Lehigh Valley R. R.
