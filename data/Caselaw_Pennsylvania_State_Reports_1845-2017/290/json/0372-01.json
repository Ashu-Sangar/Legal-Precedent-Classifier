L. 23; it did not do so however until the case had proceeded to Anal hearing. The question of jurisdiction under this act must be raised preliminarily and therefore appellant\u2019s petition' came too late: Wilson v. Garland, 287 Pa. 291. The course prescribed by the act must be pursued: Stamper v. Kogelschatz, 289 Pa. 94.\nIt follows that this appeal must be and it accordingly is dismissed at the cost of the appellant.",
