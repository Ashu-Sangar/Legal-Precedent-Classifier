        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nMike Tree, plaintiff and appellant, complains because the court below refused to restrain the American Lime & Stone Co., first defendant, from leasing to Robert Charles, second defendant, certain premises owned by that concern at \u201cShoenberger Station\u201d; and also, because the court refused to enjoin Charles from erecting a building on the property in question, and from \u201cengaging in mercantile business [on such land] at Shoenberger Station,\u201d in competition with plaintiff.\nOn April 15, 1924, defendant company and another corporation entered into a contract with plaintiff, which recites that the company owned \u201cconsiderable property in the Village of Pemberton\u201d; that Tree proposed to lease from the company \u201ca small tract or parcel of ground in the Village of Pemberton,\u201d on which to erect a storeroom or building wherein to conduct \u201ca general mercantile business in said Village of Pemberton\u201d; that the arrangement between plaintiff and defendant company was made \u201cin order to properly provide necessary and requisite facilities and accommodations for the workmen at the manufacturing plants\u201d of the company. In this contract it is mutually agreed that the two companies \u201cwill neither finance nor permit to be operated any other store or mercantile establishment upon any property belonging to either of [them], for [the term of the proposed lease and renewals thereof].\u201d\nIn pursuance of the above contract, a lease was made for a piece of ground, 100 feet front, on the main road \u201cin the Village of Pemberton,\u201d wherein it was stipulated that \u201csaid lot......shall be used by [Tree] as a site upon which......to build a suitable storeroom or building......in which......to conduct and only to conduct an orderly general mercantile business,\u201d the terms of the lease to run for five years from April 21, 1924, with an option for an additional term of five years.\nPlaintiff claims that the first-named defendant violated its contract by entering into an agreement with the second-named defendant, whereby, on August 1, 1925, it leased to the latter \u201ca piece of land at...... Shoenberger Station,......about one and one-half miles from [plaintiff\u2019s] place of business at Pemberton\u201d for the purpose of enabling Charles \u201cto erect a store building and to sell goods and conduct business in direct competition with him,\u201d plaintiff.\nThe court below found as a fact that \u201cShoenberger Station is a separate railway station and is distant from the store building of plaintiff approximately from three-quarters to one mile\u201d and that it is \u201centirely outside of and away' from the Village of Pemberton.\u201d It also found that the American Lime & Stone Co., \u201cin addition to the lands owned by it at and in the Village of Pemberton, owns large tracts of land\u201d at various other places in Blair, Center and Huntingdon Counties, \u201cat which places it operates large quarries and employs a large number of men.\u201d Another material finding which the court made was that plaintiff, in addition to erecting a store building on the property leased to him, had \u201calso erected on other parts of said lot gasoline and oil tanks,\u201d and, in addition to conducting his general mercantile business in the building erected by him on the leased property, is \u201cconducting a general gasoline and oil service station\u201d; that defendant Charles had erected on the property which the company had leased to him \u201ca gasoline and oil station and a small building which is used as a rest room, and, in connection with said rest room, he sells bread, sandwiches, ice cream, candy, soft drinks, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes and emergency automobile accessories,\u201d constituting the competition complained of by plaintiff. The court likewise found that, when the contract and lease was made with plaintiff, \u201cthe operation of a gasoline and oil station at Pemberton by plaintiff, for the accommodation of the traveling public, was not mentioned or in contemplation of either of the parties.\u201d\nOn the above findings the court below concluded that the lease to Charles \u201cdoes not constitute a violation of the agreement between Tree and defendant company,\u201d and that Charles \u201cis not operating his business at Shoenberger Station in violation of the agreement just above mentioned.\u201d We agree with both these conclusions.\nAs well said by the learned chancellor who wrote the adjudication in this case, while defendant company agreed that it would not finance or permit to be operated any other mercantile business upon any property belonging to it, the contract as a whole plainly shows that by the phrase \u201cany property\u201d the parties undoubtedly meant property in the Village of Pemberton, and not to include all the land and holdings of the corporation. In addition, the court below states in its opinion that there is no \u201creal competition\u201d between plaintiff and defendant Charles \u201cfor the trade of the employees of the [two] corporations\u201d that entered into the contract with plaintiff, but that the real competition between them is for the trade of the travellers on the highway, which trade \u201cwas not within the view of the parties\u201d when the contract and lease between defendant company and plaintiff was executed.\nAll assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the court below is affirmed at cost of appellant.",

Where a lease of land in a village, on which to erect a building wherein to conduct a general mercantile business in the village, contains a covenant by the lessor not to finance or permit to be operated any other mercantile business on any property belonging to it, the lessee cannot restrain the lessor from leasing land to another, situate about a mile from the village for use as a store, where, in a bill for an injunction, the court found, on sufficient evidence, that such land was completely' outside of the village, and that the competition feared by the lessee and for which he sought the injunction was not the conduct of a mercantile business, but the operation of a gasoline station, which was not in the minds of the parties when the lease was executed.\nArgued April 21, 1927.\nBefore Moschzisker, C.
