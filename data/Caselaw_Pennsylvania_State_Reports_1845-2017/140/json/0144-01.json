They were not a part of the res gestee. The remaining assignments refer to the charge of the court., and are not sustained. The facts of the ease were submitted to the jury under an adequate charge.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.",

The plaintiff and defendant both testified as witnesses. In the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief, she identified a letter received by her from the defendant, dated April 12, 1886, reading literally as follows :\n\u201c Bart will Susana A Cain 1 must in Form you that that money of Dr Martins must be Paid on site I seen Rober Mc-Cloor to Day he must have it on site I told hih I would Rite to you Consuming hit I must here By Return Mail or I will have to see Jacob Heyberger Conserning it J.

Being asked: \u201cWas anything said by her at that time, in regard to ill-treatment, her husband not being present ? \u201d \u201c When she came to your house in November, 1885, did she say anything in regard to ill-treatment of her by her husband, as being the cause which brought her down there ? \u201d \u201c When Susan Cain came to your house in 1885, did she complain of any ill-treatment on the part of her husband, John?\u201d These offers being objected to by the defendant, they were refused; exceptions.2 3 4\nThe plaintiff offered in evidence depositions of Lee D. Triol and Josephine C. Triol, wherein were given declarations made by the plaintiff to the witnesses, when at their house in November, 1884, not in the presence of the defendant, as to acts and conduct of her husband towards her. These portions of the depositions being objected to by the defendant, the objections were sustained; exceptions.5 678\nOther like offers on the part of the plaintiff were refused.\nAt the close of the testimony, the case was submitted to the jurj^ by Wbakd, J., and a verdict returned in favor of the defendant.
