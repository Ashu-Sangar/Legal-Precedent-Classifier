Her sister Kate became a member of the family some years afterward, when she also was a little girl, and so remained when she was married to John R. Ash about 1879. She continued to live in the family several years after her marriage, and her eldest son was born there. Mrs. Ash died in July, 1887, leaving four children, William H., Samuel G., Henry D., and John St. Clair Ash. Mr. Green had no children of his own, and though not formally adopting Josephine and Kate, he had always treated them as though they were his own daughters. In the controversy before the auditor, wherein the Solicitors’ Loan &amp; Trust Company appeared as the guardian of three of said children, who were minors, the question was, whether Josephine Lukens was entitled to one half the funds, the children of John R. Ash taking among <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>them the other half, or whether she was to take for life but one fifth of the funds, sharing equally with the said children in the division.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[203,561,1161,86]]]'>Upon the facts stated, the auditor’s report upon this question was as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[203,664,1162,707]]]'>In determining the first vital question in controversy, in the case, we must decide whether the testator intended to put the Ash children into a class, and to give the class no more than he gave to Miss Lukens. In deciding it, we must follow the rule laid down by Justice Trunkey, in Porter’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=94%20Pa.%20886" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="94 Pa. 886">94 Pa. 886</a>, where he says: “ The intention of the testator is the prevailing consideration in applying all rules of construction. It is the intention of the testator, expressed in the will, that is to govern, and this is to be judged of exclusively by the words of the instrument as applied to the subject-matter and surrounding circumstances.” Applying this rule to the case in hand, the auditor is of the opinion that Miss Lukens is entitled to one half of the fund for distribution, and each of the Ash minors to one eighth, and that the gift to her is an absolute one.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b277-7" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[201,1379,1165,908]],["BL_278.1",278,[288,365,1167,87]]]'>It is fair to presume that the testator used the word “ between ” in its usual, proper, and ordinary signification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a> Worcester gives as one of the definitions of the word, <em>“ </em>bearing relation to two; from one to another.” In explaining the difference of meaning between the two words, “ between ” and “ among,” he says “ between is used in reference to two things, parties, or persons; among in reference to a greater number.” Webster says that “ between ” applies properly to only two parties. Applying this well-understood distinction to the direction of the will that the half should be “ divided equally between Josephine Lukens and the children of John R. Ash,” it is obvious that, in drawing the line, he put on one side of it Miss Lukens, and on the other side he arranged the Ash children as a class. If he had intended each of them to have an equal share with her, he would have used other language, probably directing a division “ amongst Josephine Lukens and the children of John R. Ash, each to take an equal share.” To adopt the language used in Risk’s App., <a href="/pa/52/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="52 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1002222" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0269-01">52 Pa. 269</a>, “ had he meant <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>the children to take per capita, he doubtless would have named them.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[283,469,1171,1007]]]'>If the gift had been to them as individuals and not to the class, and any one of the number had died during the lifetime of the testator, there would have been an intestacy as to the share of the one so dying. But the gift to the class guards against the lapsing of any individual share. The further provision, that in the event of the death of Josephine Lukens, her share should go to the children of John R. Ash, without naming or in any way individuating them, is additional evidence that he intended to treat them as a class, and that, whether at his death it might consist of one or of four members who should take. The danger of intestacy as to any part of his estate was then guarded against, except in the improbable contingency of the death of all the Ash children before his own decease. This construction is in harmony with the fact that Mrs.-Ash and Miss Lukens occupied the relation practically to him of daughters, and the Ash children of grandchildren. He gave to his wife the portion which the intestate laws would have given her, and the balance he divided as the intestate laws would have divided it, if the relationship above referred to had actually existed.</p>

The auditor is not able to agree to this view. He does not find that the will was made when the testator was expecting to die, nor that he did not have in contemplation the possibility of Josephine Lukens dying in his life<a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>time. While Mr. Ash states that in the early period of his attack testator complained that if he continued on in this way he could not live until morning, yet when the doctor came he was in an improved condition, and the doctor says that he was in “ comparatively pretty good shape ” when the will was written. It is fair to be inferred from the evidence that the testator contemplated the probability of Josephine Lukens dying in his lifetime, and that when the news of: her condition was communicated to him he deemed it best to add another clause to his will to guard against this contingency. The will speaks as of the time of his death nearly two months later.
