The commonwealth did not challenge, but stood aside one of the jurors in the box, and passed the list to the defendants, who struck off one, when another juror was called in his place. The list was then returned to the commonwealth’s counsel, who, without challenging, stood aside a second juror, and passed the list to the defendants, who struck off another. When this course had been repeated until the commonwealth had stood aside four jurors from the box, and the defendants had challenged four peremptorily,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a> James McGovern was called in the place of the last juror challenged by the defendants:</p>

This is a motion on the part of the commonwealth to stand aside a juror called in answer to a peremptory challenge. The defendants object to the standing aside of the juror on motion and application of the commonwealth, the fact being, as will be exhibited by the record, that as the jurors were called the commonwealth stood aside four that answered to their names as they were called. The process of selecting a jury was continued until there were twelve jurors placed in the box. The commonwealth was then called upon to exercise its right of challenging, in answer to which it waived its first challenge, its second challenge, its third challenge and its fourth challenge. The defendants exercised their right of challenging, and this juror, McGovern, was called in answer to the defendants’ fourth challenge. It is objected, that the right to stand aside must be exercised as the jurors are called, and before any peremptory challenges are made. If the commonwealth allow the twelve jurors to be seated in the box, the only lawful challenge which can be made afterwards, is the four peremptory chal<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>lenges given by law and such further challenges for cause as they*may have the right to exercise.

The answers to the questions on the printed form were inserted by Foley, on the examination of Charles O’Brien in the presence of James O’Brien, a son of Charles O’Brien. At this time, Charles O’Brien was about seventy years of age, and was of infirm health, afflicted with “ miner’s asthma; ” but his age was put down at fifty-seven, his condition of health good, the agent certifying that he had personally seen and questioned the applicant and recommending the company to accept the risk. Foley afterwards left the application with the company’s medical examiner, at Mahanoy city, saying that Charles O’Brien would call to be examined. Some one did call, at the time appointed, and personated Charles O’Brien, with whom the examiner was unacquainted. It was claimed that the person personating Charles O’Brien was Patrick Gallagher, but the medical examiner was unable to identify him with certainty. The latter made his report to the company, and on June 27, 1887, a policy was issued on the life of James O’Brien for <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>$1,000, for the benefit of James O’Brien, and transmitted to the latter, who paid the weekly dues thereon until the death of the assured, on April 12, 1889, from acute bronchitis.</p>

It is claimed on the part of the commonwealth that he was much older than represented in the application. The answer to the question of age in the application was fifty-seven years. It is claimed that Charles O’Brien could not have been the man that made that answer; that it must have been somebody else, for the reason that the commonwealth alleges that he was much older than fifty-seven years at the time this application was made in 1887. As a part of the evidence on that point, there is produced here a sworn application made by Charles O’Brien in 1885, for relief from the county, in which it is set forth that he was then sixty-eight years of age. That was in 1885. This application for insurance was dated in 1887. If it is the fact that he was sixty-eight in 1885, it would neces<a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>sarily follow that he was seventy in 1887; and, as he did not die till April, 1889, he would be two years older at that time, which would make him seventy-two. This application for county benefits was received as a declaration on the part of Charles O’Brien as to his age in 1885. We are asked to say to you in a point, and we do so say to you that neither Gallagher nor Foley were parties to that application. There is not a single particle of evidence to connect them with that application. There is no evidence here that they knew anything at all about it. There is no evidence here that, at the time the application was taken by Foley, he knew that Charles O’Brien was as old as he represented himself to be in this application to the county. But it may be the duty of the agent to ascertain the age of the applicant, and if Charles O’Brien was really at the time of his application seventy years of age, and Mr. Foley had known him before, as I believe he testifies he had, it would be a proper inference that he should have taken notice of that fact, or that he was careless or negligent about the matter. That would not amount to conspiracy. But, if this were actually Charles O’Brien, and he knew Charles O’Brien, and could judge from his appearance about his age, it would be a circumstance in the case to be taken into consideration by the jury. The paper itself was not admitted as any evidence against the other two defendants, but it was admitted simply to show how old Charles O’Brien claimed he was at the date of that application.] 8</p>
