It was then made to appear that Emanuel Bast, up to October 4, 1884, was a partner with Jeremiah Taylor in the business of mining coal, and Frederick A. Potts &amp; Co. were engaged in buying and selling coal and dealt with Jeremiah Taylor &amp; Co.; that about October 4, 1884, Emanuel Bast assigned what interest he had in the firm of Jeremiah Taylor &amp; Co. to Jeremiah Taylor, but no notice of his ceasing to be a member of the firm was given to Frederick A. Potts &amp; Co. before their purchase of the note in suit; that up to that time Frederick A. Potts &amp; Co. received bills in the name of the firm of Jeremiah Taylor &amp; Co., and paid such bills with checks drawn to the order of Jeremiah Taylor &amp; Co.; that said Emanuel Bast, on January 2, 1885, made the note in suit to his own order, signed the name of Jeremiah Taylor &amp; Co. thereto, “per E. Bast,” indorsed it, and applied the proceeds of it to his own use; that said Frederick A. Potts «Se Co. purchased said note for value before maturity, paying the sum of §2,432.70 therefor; that Jeremiah Taylor usually transacted the business of his firm, but there was no evidence that Frederick A.

It was not seriously denied that Bast was a member of the firm <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>of Jeremiah Taylor &amp; Co. up to October 4, 1884; that no notice of the dissolution of the firm had been given; and that the plaintiffs were holders for value of the note in controversy, before maturity. This would entitle the plaintiffs to recover, unless notice in some way had been brought home to them that Bast was making an improper use of the firm name. No such notice in fact was alleged, but it was contended there was enough on the face of the note, with other circumstances, to put Frederick A. Potts &amp; Co. upon inquiry. The fact that the latter had previously received several bills from the firm, all of which were in the handwriting of Jeremiah Taylor, amounts to little. The fact that the note was drawn to the order of Bast, amounts to less: Haldeman v.
