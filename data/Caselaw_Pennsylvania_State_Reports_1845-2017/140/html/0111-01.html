    <p class="summary" id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[179,706,1173,650]]]'>Without further multiplying citations, it remains only to apply the principles as laid down by our Supreme Court to the case in hand. Have the plaintiffs made out a case showing irreparable injury to their business ? If so, have they further shown that such injury is continuous and accumulative ? And, further, that such injury could not be readily measured in an action for damages in a court of law ? It would seem that an affirmative answer must be given to each one of these queries, in order to warrant the relief prayed for. If such an answer could be given, then the defence that the neighborhood is devoted to manufacturing and that the works of the defendant have been arranged and are carried on with the utmost skill, would be of no avail.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[178,1374,1165,757]]]'>The rights of property owners to the full and free enjoyment of their land, subject only to such restrictions as the requirements of the community make necessary, cannot be invaded on any such grounds. But none of the evidence, here, discloses the existence of such injury to the plaintiffs as would warrant the enjoining of the defendants from the use of their hammer shop. It is true, some evidence was adduced tending to show that the walls of the plaintiffs’ building have been cracked and the mortar loosened by the vibration caused by the defendants’ hammers; but this evidence is not so clear and satisfactory as to prove that the injury may not have arisen from a defective construction of the foundation walls, or indeed that it is of a serious character at all. Even if it were so, it can be readily measured in damages, and an action at law would afford ample opportunity to recover them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-7" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[177,2139,1166,298]],["BL_138.1",138,[309,399,1171,756]]]'>Much evidence was offered to show that, in this case, as in Demarest v. Hardham, the annoyance and discomfort caused the plaintiffs, might be obviated without serious expense or inconvenience to the defendants, by changing the location of their machinery and hammers, so as to take the latter from their present position along the party wall to another part of the <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>defendants’ works. If the evidence on this point were direct and satisfactory, it might be that a court of equity would interfere and require a change of the existing arrangement, for the reason that the continued maintenance of the hammers in a position where they were the source of great annoyance to the plaintiffs, without being of any special advantage to the defendants, would savor of wantonness and malice. But a careful study of the testimony of the witnesses best qualified to pass upon this matter, has satisfied the master’s mind that the present arrangement could not be changed without entailing a heavy expense upon the defendants and the serious crippling of their business. That such a change is physically possible, by a complete re-arrangement of the defendants’ works requires no demonstration, but this fact would not warrant a chancellor in granting an injunction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[310,1162,1170,1263]],["BL_139.1",139,[159,378,1167,596]]]'>The fact that the defendants have erected their works at a large expense and for the express purposes of their business, should not of course be of controlling weight in determining the question under consideration. They deliberately took the risks of an injunction when they disregarded the written protest that the plaintiffs served upon them, while the alterations which brought their hammers to their present position were being made. Nor would it be any argument against the plaintiffs that they had erected their office and wareroom subsequently to the defendants, having voluntarily come into the neighborhood knowing that the hammer works were there. A business may be lawfully carried on at one time which subsequently by reason of changes in the locality will become a nuisance and be restrained; but here, there has been no decrease in the number of manufacturing establishments in the neighborhood, and the defendants have violated none of its traditions in maintaining their steam hammers; nor does there seem to be any probability that for a long time in the future there will be anything unreasonable in the maintenance of them. Certainly, the plaintiffs could not have expected with any reason that they would have found the same peace and quiet on Otter and Richmond streets as might have been found in another part of the city. The testimony shows that some years previously Disston &amp; Co., had steam hammers on the opposite side of the street; and, although their establishment has since been <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>moved to Tacony, the neighborhood retains its previous character. It would seem that the defendants could hardly have chosen a locality in Philadelphia where the inevitable annoyance of their hammers would be less liable to restraint from a court of equity. It is not necessary, in order to decide this case, to minimize in any degree the annoyance and discomfort that the plaintiffs suffer from the noise and vibration resulting from the use of the defendants’ hammers. The weakness in their case is the fact that they have shown no substantial pecuniary damage. Not that if they had done so they would necessarily have been entitled to relief in a court of equity, but that without this element such a court never would interfere.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[161,992,1166,1421]],["BL_140.1",140,[269,379,1173,147]]]'>It is alleged in the bill that unless the hammers are stopped, the plaintiffs will be compelled to move. Perhaps it would be unfair to deduce any argument against the effect of this statement, from the fact that they have been, during the somewhat lengthy progress of this litigation and still are, carrying on their business, because it may well be believed they are waiting only for the final determination of the case; but the fact that the hammers, as at present arranged, had been in operation for two years prior to the filing of the bill, and without any further complaint than that implied in the filing of the notice of protest set forth in the bill, certainly warrants the inference that the discomfort and annoyance are not intolerable. Moreover, no evidence has been offered to show that they have lost a single customer since the hammers were in operation, or that their business is any less prosperous than it was before they were placed where they are now. It can be readily believed that the keeping of books and other office work is far from agreeable amidst the crash and din of ponderous steam hammers and the rattling of vibrating iron, but the fact remains that this work has been done and is now being done at whatever cost of physical discomfort. No doubt it is convenient to the plaintiffs to have their office and wareroom in the same building, but it would not seem impossible for them to move the former to a more quiet locality. Certainly, if one deliberately seek a manufacturing locality to establish an office for the keeping of accounts, or any similar occupation requiring comparative quiet, he would not be permitted through an appeal to the courts to change the occupation of its inhabitants, to obtain the condi<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>tions necessary for the successful prosecution of his business. The plaintiffs, so far as their office work is concerned, must submit to the exigencies of the neighborhood.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[265,532,1177,555]]]'>It is not altogether clear that the faulty construction of the plaintiffs’ wall may not be one of the principal reasons for the annoyance to which they are subjected. On this point, the testimony is not conclusive, but there is enough doubt to cause hesitation in tracing out the causes that lead to the condition of which they complain. Whether or not the noise and vibration would be entirely stopped were the foundations carried down to the solid ground beneath the superficial deposit of ashes, does not clearly appear; but it would seem that they cannot complain of the consequences, if their building has been improperly constructed.</p>

    <p id="b141-7" data-blocks='[["BL_141.7",141,[173,1243,1174,910]]]'>We see no sufficient reason why we should disturb the decree of the court below. We have no doubt the appellants have been and are annoyed by the noise and vibrations of defendants’ machinery. But the business of the latter is a lawful one, and the noises referred to appear to be an inseparable and necessary incident thereof. It is not alleged that they are either negligent or malicious in their manner of conducting their business. It is an important feature in the case that their works are located in a neighborhood exclusively devoted to manufacturing purposes. In such a location there must necessarily be much noise and jarring, caused by the operation of the machinery, -with perhaps smoke and unsavory smells, the result of the various industries. Admittedly the business of the appellants has not suffered by reason of the acts complained of, and, so far as the annoyances are concerned, they are to be expected in such a neighborhood, and must be endured with the best grace possible, unless valuable industries are to be sacrificed for the sake of quiet.</p>
    <p id="b141-8" data-blocks='[["BL_141.8",141,[436,2160,905,94]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>
