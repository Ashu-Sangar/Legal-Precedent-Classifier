The defendant claimed that, under the pleadings, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show a compliance with the provisions of the statutes. The act of March 24,1870, P. L. 546, was particularly referred to. On the other <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>hand, the claimant contended that it was sufficient for him to put the claim in evidence and rest. He relied upon § 4, act of March 11, 1846, 3?. L. 115, whereby such claims, in suits thereon, may be read as evidence of the facts therein set forth. The defendant urged that there was not an adequate showing, of facts in the claim, taken alone. On reference to the claim it is seen that the only material facts therein set forth were, that the paving had been duly petitioned for by a majority of the owners of property fronting upon the said Bowman street within the space or distance so paved, which petition had been presented to the select and common councils of the city: that thereupon the councils had passed the ordinance of June 21, 1882; and that the cost of the work was properly assessed and charged in the claim filed, agreeably to the provisions of the acts of assembly relating to municipal claims for paving. These averments were not sufficient as affirmative evidence on all the issues raised by the pleadings. So far as they were sufficient, the defendant admitted that the claim constituted a prima facie case; so far as they were insufficient, the defendant insisted that affirmative evidence under those issues was lacking, and that inasmuch as it was lacking, the claimant had failed to make out a ease; so that the defendant was entitled to a verdict under instructions from the court.”</p>
