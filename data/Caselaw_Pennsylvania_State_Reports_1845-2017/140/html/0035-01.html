Admitting that it is usual to refer questions of distribution to an auditor, the court had an undoubted right to distribute the fund itself, and as the fund was small, neither party desired a reference to an auditor in this case. The doctrine of subrogation has no application to the appellants’ claims. They were mere volunteers in paying Tinker’s debts, if they did pay them, and were thereby carrying out the fraudulent scheme to hinder and delay other creditors, by obtaining control of all executions against him prior to their own.</p>

    <p id="b62-7" data-blocks='[["BL_62.5",62,[249,1296,1170,1006]]]'>If the court below was right in awarding the feigned issue, the distribution of the fund is also correct, as it was made in strict accord with the finding of the jury. ■ The application for the issue was made by Kohl, as trustee for certain judgment creditors of Charles F. Tinker, and the ground of it was that the judgment confessed by Tinker to the appellants was collusive, and given for the purpose of hindering and delaying the creditors of Tinker. The jury have found that it was given for such purpose. It was urged, however, that the judgment creditors had no standing to claim an issue, for the reason that they had no lien upon the fund made by the sheriff and paid into court. It is true the appellee’s judgment was not obtained until after the sale of the personal property by the sheriff; but we are of opinion that the fieri facias issued upon appellee’s judgment bound the fund in the sheriff’s hands. It was the money of the defendant in the execution, not money made by the sheriff upon an execution in which he was the plaintiff. Money of a defendant, not on his person, may be seized and taken in execution: See § 23, act of June 16, 1836 ; also, Herron’s App., <a href="/pa/29/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="29 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="982773" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0240-01">29 Pa. 240</a>; Rudy v.

These payments were made by the appellants the better to enable them to perpetrate the fraud found by the jury; that is, to hinder and delay the creditors of Tinker. Under such circumstances, the law will not help them. It is true these payments have increased the fund for distribution, and to this extent the appellee is benefited. It is equally true the appellants intended no such result. On the contrary, the money was paid in an attempt to prevent appellee from getting his honest dues.
