Deaves filed with the register of wills a petition, verified by her affidavit, averring that the petitioner’s husband, Lewis Deaves, died on October 18, 1889, leaving a widow, the petitioner, and one son, George Deaves, a minor, having as his guardian Florence Lockwood; that the decedent in his lifetime duly executed a will in writing whereby in substance he bequeathed to his said son, George Deaves, one hundred dollars, payable at majority, and devised and bequeathed all the residue of his estate to the petitioner, appointing William D. Jones as the executor of said willthat said will was never revoked by the decedent, but became lost during his lifetime, and diligent search, both before and after his decease, failed to discover any trace of it; praying that the petitioner be allowed to make probate of said will, and that letters testamentary be granted to the executor therein named. <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>A citation having been issued and service thereof accepted by the guardian of George Deaves, hearings were had before the register, at which testimony was taken showing, in substance, the following facts:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[228,585,1170,1211]]]'>The testator executed a will some time in 1887, and after-wards placed it, with his other papers, in a bureau drawer to which no one but himself and his wife had access. His death occurred on October 19, 1889, caused almost instantly by a fall from a farm wagon which broke his neck. About six months before his death, when looking in the drawer for some other paper, he informed his wife that the will was missing. She then looked for it and could not find it. She told him to make another will, and he said that he would do so when he got a little time; when he got through with some of his work. At different times between that date and the date of his death, he said to other persons that he had lost his will and would have to get another made. Several witnesses testified to conversations with him, about three weeks before his death, respecting the loss of his will. To one witness he said that, the first chance he got, he proposed to go and have another will prepared, but would make a further search first, to see if he could find the lost one. To another witness he said that he must get his wife to look for the will again; and, a day or two afterward, he said to the same witness that he had not found it and must get another made at once. To a third witness he said he must attend to having another will drawn. For about three weeks immediately before his death, he was busily engaged in farm work.</p>

The evidence also showed clearly that the will remained in the possession of Lewis Deaves, and that, notwithstanding the fact of its loss being known to him for a period of time long enough for him to make another will, and that it was his expressed intention to so act, in point of fact he never did replace the one alleged, to have been lost, and, so far as his expressed belief was concerned, died without any will. Nor does the testimony in any manner go to prove that the decedent still desired the provisions of the alleged lost instrument to remain of force and virtue. On the contrary, the presumption points to a revocation of the will by the decedent, either by its destruction or, if actually lost, by neglecting, during a period of several months, to replace the document with a new one.</p>

Mr. Kinsey, who had written the will, and. who reproduced the same from recollection, had no knowledge that the instrument had ever been duly executed. Hannah B.

When such a case is sufficiently proved, the loss or accidental destruction of the will does not differ from other cases where the admission of secondary evidence of solemnly executed writings is admitted. The weight and credibility of the testimony, in such cases, is to be judged of by the register, who had the witnesses before him and could better appreciate their several statements than the court can by simply reading what they said. It may be that a will lost during the lifetime of the decedent, under some circumstances, could be reproduced; but if it should appear that the testator knew of the loss or destruction of the instrument, and had ample time to make another but did not do so, it would seem very <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>clear that the proof ought to be irrefragable.

He knew that if he should die without making another will his estate would be distributed under the intestate laws of the state. If he saw proper to take the chance, we cannot question his right to do so. Suppose his house and all his papers, including his will, hád been burned two years before his death, of which he had full knowledge. Would a court of equity permit him to prove the contents of the destroyed paper, for the purpose of perpetuating its contents ? Such a proposition would be absurd. The answer of the chancellor would be, Make a new will yourself. If he should refuse to write a new will, the beneficiaries under the destroyed one could not be permitted, after his death, to come into court and reproduce his lost will; but, if the supposed fire had occurred so short a time before his death as to make it practically impossible or unreasonable for him to re-write his will, the court might permit its contents to be proved.</p>

The crucial part of the present case is in connection with the third, to wit, the necessity of showing that the will had not been revoked by the testator. The register decided adversely to the petitioner, on the ground that where a lost will is not traced out of the possession of the testator before his death, it is presumed to have been revoked by him. It is true that this presumption has been recognized by the courts, but its effect is merely to cast the burden of proof upon the proponents. It is a rebuttable presumption and gives way to evidence producing a conviction to the contrary, and showing that the testator continued to rely only upon the will as a disposition of his property : Davis v. Davis, 2 Add. [Addams ?] <em>226; </em>Minkler v. Minkler, <a href="/vt/14/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="14 Vt. 125" data-case-ids="2352727" data-case-paths="/vt/14/0125-01">14 Vt. 125</a> ; Sugden v. St. Leonards, L.

Sehillinger, 2 Stockt. 196. Whether the will was actually in existence at the testator’s death is unimportant, as affecting the question of revocation, for it may have been destroyed without his knowledge. The important question is, did he, believing the will to be irrevocably lost, revoke its provisions: Schultz v. Schultz, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20N.Y.%20658" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="35 N.Y. 658">35 N. Y. 658</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=91%20Am.%20Dec.%2088" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="91 Am. Dec. 88">91 Am. Dec. 88</a>).</p>

Remembering that the presumption of revocation is merely a presumption that the decedent destroyed the will himself, it is clear that this presumption is absolutely rebutted in the present case, down to a period of two or three weeks before his death, by the proof that he was then looking for the lost will. The suggestion so dishonoring to his memory made by the court below, that he may have said, merely as an excuse to his wife, that the will was lost, is not founded on anything in the case. It is clear that he thought the will was lost, not destroyed, and was searching for it, under the belief that he would eventually find it, and intended, if he did not discover it, to make assurance doubly sure by executing another. There was no revocation, because there was no animus revocandi: Giles v. Warren, L. R. 2 P. &amp; D. 403. The fact that he spoke of mak<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>ing another will, which the register and the court below found so important, is not proof of the animus revocandi: Brunt v. Brunt, L. R. 3 P. &amp; D. 37. It does not show that he intended to make a different will. The only reason given for that intention was the failure to find the old one, and the purpose evidently was to reproduce it.</p>
    <p id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[273,674,1169,1212]]]'>3. The case narrows itself, then, to the rebuttal of the presumption of revocation during the two or three weeks preceding the testator’s death. No testimony is produced to indicate any change in his mind: Sugden v. St. Leonards, supra. His death was a sudden one; and the three weeks in question were at a time of the year when a farmer has no time for anything except his farm. These and other facts rebut any presumption of an animus revocandi during that period. The register erred in regarding what he calls the practical non-existence of the will, and its revocation, as one and the same thing. The distinction between the loss of a will, in which case it may have a legal, although not a “ practical ” existence, and the testator may have abundant expectations of its recovery, on the one hand, and its destruction on the other, is clearly brought out in Schultz v. Schultz, <a href="/ny/35/0653-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="35 N.Y. 653" data-case-ids="16907" data-case-paths="/ny/35/0653-01">35 N. Y. 653</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=91%20Am.%20Dec.%2088" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="91 Am. Dec. 88">91 Am. Dec. 88</a>). It is questionable, however, under the facts of this case, whether a presumption of revocation ever arose: Foster’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="87 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1057812" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0067-01">87 Pa. 67</a>. As. to the proof of the contents of the will, the register does not fairly state the testimony. While some of the witnesses had some little doubt as to the amount of the legacy to the son, the doubtful ones thought it was $100, and the certain ones said it. But this is unimportant as affecting the gift to the appellant. -It is not necessary to prove the whole of a lost will: Sugden v. St. Leonards, L. R. 1 P. &amp; D. 154.</p>

There is no doubt that when it is shown that the will of a testator was in existence, unrevoked, at the time of his death, and was afterwards lost or de<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>stroyed, its contents may be proved by parol, and the will, as thus reproduced, may be admitted to probate. So much was decided in Foster’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="87 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1057812" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0067-01">87 Pa. 67</a>. The weak spot in the appellant’s case is that there was no proof that the testator left behind him an unrevoked will, or any will whatever. On the contrary, it is an admitted fact that the will, which it was alleged the testator had executed, was lost or destroyed in his lifetime, and that its loss was known to him months before his death. There was proof of his declarations that he intended to make another will, possibly containing the same provisions, but he never did so. Knowing that he had no will, he declined or neglected to make one. From this a presumption of revocation may fairly be inferred. It would not be safe to place too much reliance upon the declarations of a testator under such circumstances. For anything we know, he may have destroyed his will because he was not satisfied with its provisions, and yet have desired to conceal the knowledge of that fact to avoid importunity.</p>
    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[209,1235,1170,1106]]]'>Aside from this, the evidence was very slight to establish the will. The register finds: “ The testimony'- upon this point was by no means conclusive. George Zell, the only disinterested witness who had read the will and was aware of its due execution, had reád the document but once, and had made no special effort to impress upon his memory its contents; and, while he testified that, to the best of his recollection, the provisions of the will were in substance as set forth in the petition, yet he was not positive as to any one provision of said document.” No question of the sufficiency of the proof arose in Foster’s Appeal, supra. This appears from the opinion of Mr. Justice Acknew, where he said: “ That the contents of this will are clearly and fully proved, both by testimony and by written memoranda in the testator’s own handwriting, is equally plain, and no question arises as to the number of witnesses, the contents being proved by two, as well as by the memoranda furnished by the testator himself.” The proof should be very clear to probate a lost will, especially when it is attempted to be set up in part at least by the testimony of interested witnesses. We refer to this subject merely to avoid being misunderstood, as we decide the case upon the ground first above stated.</p>
