It was when we first met in the club. The club talked of buying a yacht in Boston, but did not have the money. I told them that if I was properly secured, I would loan them the money. They agreed to do it. They drew up a note similar to this, with the yacht as collateral security, and Mr. Austin and Mr. Yanderslice, another member of the club, agreed to indorse the note and become personally responsible for the payment of the debt, in case the yacht was destroyed or lost. This was in the early part of 1876. I think iri May. [Notes previously given, called for, and shown witness.] Those are notes given before the one in evidence. As they bécame due they would be renewed. The interest was paid, from time to time, and on some of them no interest was paid. Mr. Yanderslice was one of the original members; he went out in 1880. He refused to be on the note any longer. Mr. Austin then said he would be alone responsible along with the yacht. He said he would be responsible in case the yacht was lost. $200 was paid on account and the note was renewed for $400, until I got the present note. I spoke to Mr Austin about the note and he said he would not renew it. It was then protested. I spoke to him several times, but he would not recognize me. On December 14, 1887, I asked him what had become of the yacht. He said he had sold it to a man by the name of Perrine, at Barnegat, for $575. I said: ‘We had better have a settlement.’ He said: ‘If you think there is any money owing to you, sue me.’ His wife came along, and he went away. I saw him several times after that ,• he said, ‘ If you think you are entitled to anything sue me for it.’ ”</p>

It was unincorporated. Each member had a share. I was president of the club. We all had an equal interest in the property of the club outside of my money. The ground I loaned the money on, was upon being properly secured by the note and yacht. From 1876 to 1882, the note was renewed from time to time by order of the club, and interest paid. In case the yacht was lost, Mr. Austin was to be responsible. The only writing was the note itself. I don’t know when the yacht was sold. I heard of it on December 14, 1887. There was a committee appointed to get bids for the sale of the yacht. I presided at the meeting when this committee was directed to get bids. I don’t remember any meeting when Mr. Austin was directed to sell the boat, when I presided. I don’t know that I made any claim at that meeting that the money was to come to me. Mr. Austin was treasurer of the club. The club had no other property than this.”</p>
