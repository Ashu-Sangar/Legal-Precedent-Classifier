This work was done in a negligent and unskilful manner ; and after the railroad company had received the wheels, and had set up the locomotive on which they were to be used, it was found to be necessary, on account of the defective character of the work done by the plaintiff, to take the locomotive apart again and send the wheels back to the defendant’s shop to have the defects remedied. The expenses thus incurred by the railroad company amounted to $36.09, which sum was collected by it from the defendant.

The plea is simply non-assumpsit; and, therefore, as there is no plea of set-off in the case, I take it that that question in this state of the record does not arise.] 1 But there is this in the case: If the plaintiff, Glennon, did this work in dispute, imperfectly, — negligently, as is substantially conceded, — if the jury find that to be the fact, then the defendant would not be obliged to pay him for doing that work, if the injury done thereby to the defendant was greater than his wages. For instance, if, under ordinary circumstances, they would owe him $10 for doing this work, and he had done it so badly that it had cost them $20 to set it right, then of course they would not be compelled or obliged to pay him the $10 which he claimed for doing this worthless, or at least this imperfect work.</p>

There is an item of $2.55 which was paid to another employee for turning the wheels over again ; and then there is another item of about $36, which was paid by the company because of the imperfect turning of these wheels. You recollect the testimony on this subject. There is no denial of these facts. There is no denial, either, of the fact that these sums, so stated, truly represent the loss occasioned by this work. The contest on the part of the plaintiff is that that cannot be set off. Now, in response to that we say, and I will repeat it just at that . point, that in the present state of the record of this case, I do not think the question of set-off arises; but I instruct you, if you find that he did this work imperfectly and badly and without proper skill, and if the damages to the defendant were greater than the amount of the wages claimed, then there can he no recovery on that account — that is, for those five or six days’ work done by the plaintiff upon those wheels.] 3.....</p>

It was not disputed that the plaintiff did certain work so unskilfully as to cause a loss to the defendant. The learned judge held that this loss could not be set off against the plaintiff’s claim for wages, further than to the extent of the five or six days during which he was engaged upon <em>the </em>work which was so unskilfully done. It was contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that such set-off could not be allowed, because, if the appellant (defendant) was injured by the imperfect work on the wheels, through the carelessness and negligence of the plaintiff, it is a wrong, a tort; and redress cannot be obtained in this action of assumpsit by means of a set-off.</p>

This is not such case. The plaintiff is a machinist, and was employed in defendant’s machine shop to do certain mechanical work for a compensation agreed upon. From this contract, the law implies faithful service on the part of the employee, and an amount of care and skill proportioned to the character of the work which he has engaged to perform. If he perform it negligently and unskilfully it is a breach of contract; and when the employer is sued for wages earned under the contract, he can defend by showing a failure on the part of the servant to properly perform his part, in consequence of which he has sustained damages.

All our decisions say he cannot so recover. The defendant, if he can prove any facts which go to show that the plaintiff did not perform his part of the contract, or from negligence, or want of skill, performed it in such a manner as that the defendant suffered loss, may have the amount of that loss, as ascertained by the jury, deducted from the amount of the plaintiff’s claim.”</blockquote>

It yvas there held that in an action to recover compensation for services as a housekeeper, and for goods sold and delivered, evidence that the plaintiff was guilty of malfeasance in the execution of her trust and embezzled the goods of the defendant, is not admissible by way of set-off, but it may be received under the plea of non-assumpsit, to defeat the action. To the <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>same point are Nickle v.

This is not only good law, but it is good sense.

This position cannot be sustained. The plaintiff was suing upon an entire contract. A separate suit could not be maintained for each day’s work: Logan v.
