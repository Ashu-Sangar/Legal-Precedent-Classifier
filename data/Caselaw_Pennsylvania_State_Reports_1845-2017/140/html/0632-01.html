The petition averred that the road as laid out would be useless and burdensome to the public; that it was projected in the interest of one Schoonmaker, for the purpose of developing his private property; that before any part of it had been opened, a petition for its vacation was in circulation among the inhabitants of the township, and that, for the purpose of defeating this petition, Schoonmaker induced one Brink, at that time a supervisor, to open that part of the road located upon Sehoonmaker’s property; that proceedings to vacate the unopened residue were afterwards held at Nos. 4 January Term 1888, and 7 October Term 1889, of the court below, the report of viewers in each of said proceedings being set aside by the court; that one of the viewers who laid out the road was the owner of a lot on or near the road; that said viewers made their report hastily, without fully complying with their duties, having failed to request J. S. Miller over whose property the road was located, to release damages; and that the road was not located at the termini named in the original petition, and was so negligently laid out by courses and distances that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the supervisors to open and make the same.</p>

The road was thereupon opened in part, but proceedings have been pending since then to obtain the vacation of the balance of it. These proceedings having been unsuccessful, an order to open the road was issued and served upon the supervisors of the township April 24, 1890. On May 8, 1890, the supervisors petitioned for a stay of this order, and to have all the proceedings leading up to it set aside, but this the court, after due consideration, May 26, 1890, refused to allow. From this refusal, the supervisors, on June 12th appealed to the Supreme Court, and in support of that appeal a writ of certiorari has been sued out and served upon us. In the meantime, a rule was entered upon the supervisors to show cause why they should not be committed for contempt in not complying with the order to open the road. The only answer which is made to this rule is the presentation of the writ of certiorari, and the question, therefore, now is as to the effect which is to be given to that writ.</p>

There is a well-recognized exception, however, to this rule, and that is, that where proceedings have been begun before the writ is received, to carry out the judgment of the court, the certiorari will not stay them. Thus, where a fieri facias had begun to be executed by the sheriff, before the service of the writ, he can go on and finish it, and the court below may even award a venditioni exponas for that purpose: Charter v.

It is now over three years since the report of the viewers in favor of the road was finally confirmed, and a part of the road has been actually opened. Now, when an order to open the balance of the road is served upon the respondents, and after they have failed to secure a stay of the order, the present writ of certiorari is lodged in this court. It is too late. The order to open the road has gone out and must be executed; the certiorari does not stay the proceedings upon it. Granted, that it removes the record, and arrests the fur‘ther course of the case, still it finds the case with the order to open outstanding and in the hands of the supervisors for execution, with the present proceedings instituted to enforce it. This is analogous to an outstanding execution in the hands of the sheriff instanced above. My opinion is that the writ is not a supersedeas, and that the respondents have shown no sufficient reason for not complying with the order. The rule for an attachment is made absolute.</p>

The assessed valuation of said township for the year 1890 was $66,053. We believe we have no authority to incur an indebtedness, without the assent of the electors, as provided in § 8, article IX., of the constitution of Pennsylvania, where such indebtedness exceeds the sum of two per cent.

We understood that the certiorari was a supersedeas; and would stay the proceedings in the lower court. Had that not been the case, a full answer would have been filed before.

    <p id="b660-12" data-blocks='[["BL_660.12",660,[260,2102,1172,197]]]'>This case is entitled an appeal, and has been argued as such. It is not, however, for no appeal lies in such a case. It is a certiorari, and brings up nothing but the record. We must examine it by what appears therein.</p>
    <p id="b660-13" data-blocks='[["BL_660.13",660,[258,2306,1172,95]],["BL_661.1",661,[191,381,1176,506]]]'>The appellants are the supervisors off Roaring Brook township, and were ordered by the court below to open a road in <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>said township. The report of the viewers upon said road was finally confirmed January 24, 1887. The order to open was issued June 24, 1889, and served upon the supervisors April 24, 1890. Between these dates there appears to have been an unsuccessful attempt to have the road vacated; and the record contains some evidence, as is not infrequent in road cases, of a local wrangle over the matter. The supervisors neglected or refused to open the road, whereupon the court below awarded an attachment against them as for contempt. It is this order of which they now complain.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[189,894,1175,149]]]'>In their answer to the order or rule for the attachment, the supervisors set forth their reasons for not opening the road, the principal of which are the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[190,1050,1175,199]]]'>(a) That the road is not necessary; or, in their precise language, “ on examining the road ordered to be opened, we say, upon our oaths, that we do not and did not think it necessary or convenient for the traveling public.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b661-7" data-blocks='[["BL_661.6",661,[188,1257,1176,146]]]'>(5) That to open the said road would involve an expense of at least two thousand dollars, which would increase the debt of the township beyond the constitutional limit.</blockquote>
    <p id="b661-8" data-blocks='[["BL_661.7",661,[183,1410,1183,709]]]'>The sixth section of the act of June 18,1836, P. L. 556, provides that “public roads or highways laid out, approved, and. entered on record as aforesaid, shall, as soon as may be practicable, be effectually opened,” etc. Under this act it is the duty of the supervisors to open a public road as soon as practicable after it has been laid out and confirmed. N ot opening a highway, or refusing and neglecting to keep it in repair, is an injury to the public, and is indictable as a public or common nuisance: Graffins v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pen-w/3/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 502" data-case-ids="1827581" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0502-01">3 P. &amp; W. 502</a>. The supervisors are enjoined by statute to open and repair public roads ; and it is essential to the convenience of the public that the remedy to enforce compliance on the part of these officers should be emphatic, and at the instance of the public authorities of the state: Edge v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/7/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="7 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="957846" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0275-01">7 Pa. 275</a>.</p>
    <p id="b661-9" data-blocks='[["BL_661.8",661,[178,2128,1177,292]]]'>With this brief reference to the law, we will consider the reasons given by the supervisors for their neglect. The first does not require discussion. The law does not make them the judges of the necessity for the road, nor does it clothe them with power to reverse the finding of the jury and the order of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.3",662,[243,370,1183,1225]]]'>
      <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>Nor do we attach much weight to the second reason. The order of court which they have refused to obey does not require them to increase the debt of the township beyond the constitutional limit. It appears that a portion of the road has been already opened, and that only a small part thereof remains to be opened. It was stated at bar, and not denied, that a responsible party had filed in the court below an offer in writing to open the balance of the road in a satisfactory manner, for the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars. Be that as it may, the supervisors admit funds in their hands, without stating how much, but allege that they are needed for other purposes. In other words, they propose to apply such moneys in their own way, and in disregard to the order of the court. They are clothed with the power of taxation, and there is nothing to show that they have exhausted it, or have even the disposition to lay such taxes in the future as may be necessary to enable them to obey the order. We may assume that the court below would grant them any reasonable indulgence rendered necessary by the financial condition of the township, were they engaged in a bona’ fide attempt to carry out the order. No such attempt appears, however; no move has been made in that direction, although months have elapsed since the order was served upon them. Their position is not one of obedience, but of defiance, to the court. This cannot be permitted.</p>
    <p id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[243,1605,1175,147]]]'>It is proper to say that no question was raised as to the power of the Quarter Sessions to issue the attachment. We decide only what is before us.</p>
    <p id="b662-7" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[1087,1758,286,33]]]'>Order affirmed.</p>
