The term of the lease was not for any definite number of years, but it was provided that the lessee should mine 50,000 tons of coal annually, beginning January 1, 1881, until the merchantable coal should be exhausted, and should pay twenty-two cents per ton royalty in cash, on the first day of April, July, October and January, for coal mined during the three preceding months.

But, in the lease in question, the parties saw fit to introduce a stipulation with regard to the taxes, which must now control them. It,is there agreed that “ the parties of the first part (the plaintiffs here), their heirs and assigns, shall pay all taxes on lands hereby leased, and the party of the second part (the defendants), their succesors and assigns, shall pay all taxes on their buildings and improvements; also, all special state or national taxes that may be levied upon coal after it is mined.”</p>

The lands leased, therefore, either include the whole body of the property, both coal and surface, or, if confined to anything less must be applied to the coal which, strictly speaking, is the subject of the lease or conveyance. In either event, by the stipulation referred to, the taxes thereon are to be paid by the plaintiffs, the defendants having to pay only the taxes on their buildings and improvements and any special state or national taxes upon the coal after it is mined.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b648-7" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[279,929,1178,1006]]]'>This lease was executed before the case of Sanderson v. Scranton determined that an instrument of this character amounted to a conveyance and sale of the coal, vesting the ownership of it in the lessees. It was candidly admitted by plaintiffs’ counsel that at the time it was executed, the agreement with regard to the taxes would by the common understanding be taken to mean just as we have now construed it. This is perhaps of no vital importance; and yet, it may be pertinent to ask, how has that decision in any way affected this construction ? It is possible, that had the decision preceded the agreement, and the liability of such lessees, as owners of the coal, for the taxes thereon, been then established,, the plaintiffs' might not have inclined to assume the burden of them. But, because that decision has enlarged their legal vision, they cannot therefore expect to remodel their contract. The defendants have accepted a lease of the coal, and agreed to mine and pay for it upon certain terms and conditions. One of these is that the taxes upon the lands as leased shall be paid by the plaintiffs. This is the bargain and it must be adhered to.</p>

The severance of the ownership of the coal from the ownership of the surface no doubt warranted this assessment; but that does not affect, of course, the agreement of the parties; and the defendants having been made liable for the taxes which the plaintiffs were bound to pay, could recover the same by action, or may do as they have done, deduct them from the royalties which would be otherwise due to the plaintiffs.
