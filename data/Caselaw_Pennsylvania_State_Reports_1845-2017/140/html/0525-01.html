In construing the general borough act of 1851, it was held by the Supreme Court that, although the word “ vacate ” does not appear among the enumerated powers of the borough officers, yet the fourth clause of the second section, which declares that those officers “ shall regulate the roads, streets, lanes, alleys,” etc., and they “ shall have all other needful jurisdiction over the same,” did confer upon the borough authorities the power to vacate a street or alley. We think it would not be a strained construction to give the same effect to the language employed in the act of 1831.</p>

S. V. railroad, on Coal street in said borough, and the construction of a public street and a bridge from a point in Washington street near to the intersection with Coal street, to Centre street, all of Union street in said borough, from the eastern side of Railroad street to Coal street, had been practically abandoned, and become useless, inconvenient and burdensome, as well as unsafe for public travel.

No evidence is before us on the subject of dedication. It is indisputable that Union street has long been one of the public streets of the borough, under the control of and kept in repair by the borough authorities. Granting that the part proposed to be vacated was originally laid out by private parties, does it necessarily follow that the borough must forever keep it open, although it may have become useless, burdensome and dangerous?</p>

If this position is correct, then, inasmuch as the legislature can no longer give relief, Pottsville and other boroughs similarly situated are in a helpless condition. In Paul v. Carver, <a href="/pa/24/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="24 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="9503887" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0207-01">24 Pa. 207</a>, the Supreme Court said: “ To open new highways, whether streets or country roads, and to vacate those which are useless, inconvenient and burdensome, is a power which must reside somewhere in every well regulated government. In our own, we have many laws conferring this power on courts and county and township officers, on city and borough councils, and on special commissioners.....Every function of government may be injudiciously exercised, but still we must trust it with somebody.

Both contain a repeal of all former acts or parts of acts which were altered and supplied. The directions of the act of 1854 have been followed ever since 1860 in this county, including the borough of Pottsville. Section 2 provides that “ in all cases of the appointment of viewers in said counties, to view the site of any bridge, or to view and locate, vacate, or change and supply any public or private road,” notice must be given, etc. This act has been strictly followed in the present proceeding.

L. 410, vacated a part of Eailroad street, in said borough, “ with like effect as if the same had been legally vacated by a decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill county.” So, by the act of March 29, 1872, P. L. 654, a part of Third street, in the borough of Pottsville, was vacated, “ with like effect as if the same had been legally vacated by a decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill county.” This was followed by the act of April 2, 1872, P. L. 723, which is sufficient in itself to confer jurisdiction, if it did not already exist. Its title is “ An Act relating to the opening or vacating of streets in the borough of Pottsville.” It reads as follows: “That, from and after the passage of this act, all petitions to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill county, for the appointment of viewers to vacate or lay out any street, alley or lane in the borough of Pottsville, shall be first submitted to the town council of the said borough of Pottsville for approval, and no viewers shall be hereafter appointed by the said court, or by any court, upon any petition which shall not be so approved by the said town council of the borough of Pottsville.” All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this were repealed.

In view of the great danger of loss-to life and property at this crossing, both these companies, as-we are informed, are favorable to its vacation. To obviate the inconvenience that might occur from its abandonment, both these companies have joined with the borough of Pottsville in defraying the expenses of the erection of a substantial overhead bridge, which spans the tracks of both railroads. This bridge is but a short distance from that point on Union street sought to be vacated. The contest is not about the form of the vacation, but a denial on the part of the exceptants of a power existing anywhere to authorize- the vacation.
