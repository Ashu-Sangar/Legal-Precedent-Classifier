Joseph Woomer, named as executor therein, declined to act, and letters of administration with the will annexed were granted to W. H. Livingood on February 14, 1887. On February 15, 1887, Elizabeth Moyer, formerly the widow of said Samuel Machemer, deceased, executed a writing under seal, setting forth that said Samuel Machemer had died seised of a certain tract of land in Wayne township, containing twenty-nine acres, more or less, and had provided by his will that “ in case my wife desires the land shall be sold, my executor may sell the same ; ” expressing her desire that the said land should be sold, and requesting said W. H. Livingood, .administrator, etc., to sell it “ under and by virtue of the provisions of the will aforesaid.” The auditor further found that Elizabeth, the widow of Samuel Machemer deceased, accepted the provisions made for her in her said husband’s will; that subsequently she married one Moyer, and at her death left a will, dated July 31,1883, in which she devised and bequeathed all her estate, real and personal, to John W. Smith, and appointed him the executor of her will.</p>

Heffner, referring to Samuel Machemer’s will, said: “It may be that there was no technical conversion of the realty into personalty; this we are not called upon to decide. The question here is one of title, not of distribution. Whether there was or was not a conversion, it is unnecessary to say,” etc. The court held, however, that by the will “ the real, as well as the personal estate was for the use and support of his widow, and was to be occupied and possessed by her during her widowhood. If at any time during that period, however, she should signify her desire to have the land sold, the testator intended that the executor should comply with her request, and thereafter pay to her the interest of the proceeds.” This negatives the proposition that <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>the effect of the sale was to make Mrs. Moyer the absolute owner of the proceeds.

We have yet to be convinced that anything contained in his will would work such a result.</p>

It reviews the former decisions on this subject and discusses it at length. It was there held that a delay of over three years on the part of a widow, in exercising her right to take $300 in money or property of her deceased husband’s estate under the exemption law of 1851, is fatal to the right and conclusive evidence of a waiver. Her right to have any exempted property depends entirely upon her claiming it. If she does not claim it, she never has it. If she neglects unduly to make her claim, she loses her right to do so. The right under the statute is a privilege to retain, and not an absolute transfer of part of the estate. There is no evidence before us to show that Elizabeth Machemer ever made any claim for the benefit of the widow’s exemption act while the widow of Samuel Machemer or afterwards. On the contrary, she accepted the provisions of the will, and this would estop her from afterwards asserting a claim to any portion of her husband’s estate outside of what it provided for her: Bradfords v.
