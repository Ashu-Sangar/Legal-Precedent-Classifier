The entire width of Mont<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>gomery Avenue was sixty-six feet, but the macadamized roadwajiwhich the defendants were building occupied only a space of eighteen feet in the middle of it, leaving a summer road at each side. The steam roller, when not in use, was kept standing at one edge of the completed roadway; and on Sundays, it was covered with canvas, tied down and fastened to the framework. On Sunday, October 16, 1887, it stood on the road at a point near Libertyville, the work of construction being at that time in progress in that neighborhood. It was covered with canvas on that day, as usual, and stood at the northern edge of the hard roadway. The machine was eight feet in width and occupied a little less than half the width of the stoned road, the rest of which together with the summer road south of it, afforded abundance of room for driving past. The roller could be seen at a considerable distance, by persons approaching on the road from either direction.</p>

Stadelman, the secretary and treasurer of the turnpike company, being called by the plaintiffs in their case in chief, testified in substance that on account of the weight of the roller it could not be removed from the hard roadway and brought back again, without the use of side tracks or expensive appliances adapted for the purpose, and that, in his opinion, to have moved the roller further north, so as to let it stand on the dirt -road, would have made no practical difference as to its being likely to scare passing horses, and the only effect of it would have been to give them more shying ground. A witness for the defendants testified that the roller could have been moved off the road and upon private property, by building a causeway, on a, curve with a radius of 150 feet, either of macadam or of heavy planks, strongly bolted together; or that a “ switch ” might have been made of the same materials to carry it upon the side road. In rebuttal, the plaintiffs called a witness who testified that the machine had been left standing upon the summer road on at least one occasion in October, 1887. Testimony for the defendants in sur-rebuttal tended to disprove this statement. One of the defendants’ witnesses testified that the roller could have been moved to another section of the road below Merionville, and kept there over Sunday, at a place where the road was wider and the banks at the side of it not so high as at the place where it was kept. The testimony <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>tended to show, however, that if the machine were to be left standing anywhere on the Libertyville section of the macadamized road, the place used for that purpose was the best that could be selected.</p>

Mr. Keeley, who was driving, first noticed the roller when he was from one hundred to two hundred yards away from it. He testified that at that -time there was nothing about it which led him to believe that his horse would frighten at it; that he first noticed that it was likely to frighten the horse, when he was within one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet of it, and he then pulled over to the summer road on the south side of the avenue, and gradually slackened the horse’s pace so that by the time he reached the machine the horse was about at a walk; that the only sign of fear the horse showed, until he came right up to the roller, was that he looked at it, but when directly opposite the horse turned his head and looked at the machine and just then the canvas upon it was flapped by the wind, whereupon the horse became frightened, made a spring upward and jumped to one side, overturning the buggy and throwing .the plaintiffs out, both being injured. The buggy and harness were broken, so as to require extensive repairs:</p>

When I got close up to the machine and the flapping of this canvas, that helped to frighten him, I suppose. Q. Do you believe the horse would have frightened if the canvas had not flapped ? A. I rather think he would have frightened anyhow at the engine, because when he came up on the side of this engine it looked so large it was <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>enough to frighten any animal, I think..... Q. Did you do anything then to keep control of him ? A. I held my line tight and guided him as much as I could. Q. Then, just at the point when you were just opposite the machine, you say the canvas flapped? A. Yes, sir. Q. That was the occasion of the spring ? A. That was the occasion of his spring. He sprang right in the air, reared right up and then sprang to the side..... Q. Then you apprehended no danger until the actual danger happened ? A. No, sir. Q. If you had gotten out of your wagon and led your horse past, could you have avoided the accident? A. I suppose I might have avoided it if I had gotten out and held on to him..... Q. What I want to know from you is, whether you say, under your oath, that it was the machine that scared the horse, or whether it was the flapping of the cover of the machine ? A. I think it was both. Q. Then, why did not your horse get scared before he got right opposite the machine? A. I do not know why he did not get scared, but the object did not look as large as when he got right opposite ; when he got right opposite it looked like an elephant on one side.”</p>

It was for the jury to determine what care and caution a man of ordinary and reasonable prudence would have exercised in circumstances similar to those in which Mr. Keeley was placed: West Chester etc. R.

    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[219,514,1172,1678]]]'>The defendants were the contractors for building a turnpike road on Montgomery A venue, in Montgomery county, and were using in this work a large steam roller, weighing about twenty tons, which the terms of their contract required them to use in the construction of said road. The accident by which the plaintiffs were injured occurred on Sunday, the sixteenth of October, 1887, in broad daylight. The roller had been left the Saturday evening previous at the place where the accident occurred. It was on one side of the macadamized part of the road, leaving a clear space of about thirty feet between the machine and the south gutter line. It was covered with canvas, and the canvas was tied at the sides or corners. The place where it was left appears to have been the safest one where it could be placed when not in use. It could not be run off on the soft earth by reason of its great weight, and to have constructed platforms or lateral turnpikes on which to run it off from the road under construction would have been impracticable. The plaintiffs were driving along the road on the Sunday in question with a horse which the plaintiff Keeley had owned for some months. The roller was in full view, and was seen by the driver when distant therefrom some two hundred yards. Keeley testified that he thought it was an object that would frighten any animal, yet he appears to have taken no other precaution except to reduce the speed of his horse to a slow trot, “ almost to a walk.” The horse showed no signs of fear until about opposite the machine, when he looked at it, reared, overturned the buggy, threw out the plaintiffs, and occasioned the injury complained of. We do not, of course, know what particular feature of the machine frightened the horse. It was alleged to be the flapping of the canvas cover. This, however, is mere surmise, as the cover was fastened down, and the fright of a horse cannot be measured by any known rules.</p>

Under the circumstances detailed, were the plaintiffs entitled to recover? In other words, were the defendants guilty of such negligence, in permitting the <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>machine to remain where it was over Sunday, as rendered them liable in damages to a person whose horse became frightened at the obstruction, ran away, and thereby caused an injury ?</p>
    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[238,523,1170,1833]]]'>I think it may be conceded that had the roller been left upon an ordinary highway, not in course of construction or repair, the defendants would have been liable. We think there is a marked difference between the case of a finished public highway, thrown open to travel, and a road, be it a turnpike or an ordinary dirt road, in course of repair or construction. In the latter case there must necessarily be.inequalities, heaps of stone, and other materials upon the ground necessary for such operations. The defendants were lawfully engaged in the construction of this road; the steam roller was a machine necessary for its construction. Its use, therefore, was lawful. When in operation it was a much more formidable looking object, and far more likely to frighten horses, than when at rest. The act of June 80, 1885, P. L. 251, provides for the moving of steam machines upon public highways. When in motion, “ upon the approach, in either direction, of all persons traveling in vehicles or in charge of teams,” it is made the duty of the person controlling it “ to move such machinery as far as practicable to the right or left of the road, to a position where the said approaching vehicle or team may pass with the greatest safety, and stop the same before such persons.....shall have arrived within three hundred feet of such machinery, and the owner qr owners, or persons in charge of such machinery, shall assist such passing vehicle or teams until they are safely by the danger,” etc. These provisions apply only to the operation of the machine; the act is silent as to the duty of the owner when his machine is at rest at night and upon a Sunday. What, then, is the duty of the defendants in the latter instances? Clearly, to place their machine in as favorable a location as possible with a view to avoid accidents; to locate it near one side of the road, so as to give the traveler all the space reasonably convenient to pass by it. The law does not exact impossible or unreasonable things. In our view, the defendants appear to have done all that was practicable to avoid accident to others, and when no negligence is shown on their part there can be no recovery.</p>
    <p id="b244-8" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[282,2360,1120,47]],["BL_245.1",245,[213,366,1171,918]]]'>The plaintiffs, as before stated, were in full view of the <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>machine for some distance before they reached it. It was well calculated to frighten tneir horse, and they were aware of it. If they did not know it, they either possessed less than average intelligence, or they must have been utterly ignorant of the nature and disposition of horses, neither of which is to be presumed. Coming, then, to the presence of such an object, an ordinarily prudent man would probably have done one of two things; either to turn back and take another road, and thus avoid the obstruction, or get out of. the buggy and take his horse by the head. In the one case the danger would have been wholly avoided; in the other, it would have been reduced to the minimum. The plaintiffs did neither. Mr. Keeley evidently relied upon his horse, or his ability to control him. He certainly had the right to proceed in the way he did. But when one approaches a known danger, which he might easily have avoided, it is not just to charge the consequences of his rashness upon others who have not participated in it, nor been guilty of any neglect of duty.</p>
