    <p class="summary" id="b212-8" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[242,1195,1172,753]]]'>Wharton Barker is on trial before you for the offence of committing and maintaining a nuisance. It appears that the defendant, Mr. Barker, is the owner of certain property in the township of Cheltenham, in this county, which abuts on the public road known as Wyncote Lane. On one portion of this property there was erected a dwelling-house that was occupied by a Mr. McCall. On the side of the road there was an elevation, varying in height from two to three feet, and in width, in some places, two feet, and in other places more than two feet. This elevation or embankment had been for some time used by the traveling public as a sidewalk. For certain purposes, which are unimportant here to mention, Mr. Barker constructed on this elevation a board walk, which was thrown open for public use. You have heard the manner of its erection, the character of the material used, and the extent of the travel thereon.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b212-9" data-blocks='[["BL_212.7",212,[240,1960,1171,456]]]'>He afterwards sold the house, that had been occupied by Mr. McCall, to Mrs. Smith, the wife of the prosecutor in this case. Afterwards, he removed that portion of the board walk in front of the property which still remained his own. It is now claimed by the commonwealth that he interfered with the rights of the public in so doing, and was guilty of so doing, in the first place, by the removal of the board walk, and secondly, on account of the condition in which he left the surface of the ground underneath the board walk by its removal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.3",213,[153,370,1169,400]]]'>

L. 110, without the consent of the supervisor, Mr. Barker would have had no right to place down this sidewalk, but, having put it there with the consent of the supervisor, either implied or granted, it was lawful, and any person traveling on that road bad the right to use it. And, having put it there, it was incumbent upon Mr. Barker and the supervisor to keep it in repair. Subsequently, it appears, Mr. Barker removed this board walk.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[155,780,1167,452]]]'>[The first point for you to consider is, was he guilty of any offence by the removal of the board walk ? It is contended, on behalf of the commonwealth, that, having placed it there for the public use, and it having been used by them, this was a dedication to the public, and it therefore became public property ; and that neither Mr. McCall nor Mr. Barker had the right to take it away. The court will dispose of this branch of the case, and instruct you that Mr. Barker had the right to remove the board walk.]1</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[155,1241,1167,451]]]'>This was a sidewalk in a township. There was no obligation on the part of the supervisor to have it there, nor was there any obligation on behalf of the defendant. The rule is different which governs townships and boroughs ; and this being a township, having been a merely voluntary act on the part of Mr. Barker and the supervisor, there was no obligation on the owner to maintain it perpetually; and in removing it, I charge you, he was not guilty of any offence, he having voluntarily placed it there.....</p>

If the jury find that the board walk in question was built within the highway, with the intention upon the part of the builder that it should be permanent, and that it was fixed into the soil in a clearly permanent manner, this establishes a dedication by the builder.</p>

This is true, so far as the right of the public to use the board walk is concerned, but it would not be such a dedication as to prevent the owner of an abutting property, who had placed it there, from removing it.8</p>

The fact that it was used by some of the neighbors on their way to the railroad station, would not constitute an acceptance of it. Had there been such acceptance, it would then have been the duty of the supervisor to keep it in repair. As the matter stood, there was no such duty on the part of the township. On the contrary, had it become dangerous and an accident occurred by reason thereof, Mr. Barker might have been responsible in damages.
