Leisenring in a sum exceeding $6,000, took out a policy of insurance on his debtor’s life, in the defendant company, for the sum of $6,000. The annual premium reserved was $153.90. Jacob Riegel died on January 4, 1880, and after his death the premiums continued to be paid by his administratrix, the present plaintiff, until April, 1889. Leisenring, the debtor, on whose life the policy was taken orrt, left Philadelphia in 1876, after which his whereabouts became unknown. The payment of annual premiums having become burdensome to the plaintiff, and the fact being unknown whether Leisenring was living or dead, the plaintiff on March 20, 1889, made an agreement with the defendants, whereby the original policy was surrendered by her, and the company in consideration thereof issued to her in lieu thereof a paid-up policy for $2,500. Some time after this, it was ascertained by the plaintiff that Leisenring had died on or about March 10, 1889, and before the new agreement had been made or the new policy issued. The plaintiff, therefore, claims that the new agreement with the defendant was made under such a mistake of fact as entitles her to be relieved against it in equity, and to have the original contract of insurance re-instated and enforced.</p>

The reason of the doctrine is well stated by Gibson, J., in Perkins v. Gay, 3 S. &amp; R. 331, where he says that in such cases the parties proceed under an idea that the fact which is the inducement to the agreement is <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>in a particular wajq and give their assent on conditions that ¡are falsified by the event; and he cites from the old reports, ;as illustrations, the cases of Turner v.

    <p class="summary" id="b218-7" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[304,1139,1175,1212]]]'>Every wager, every policy of insurance, and every compromise of a doubtful right depends, as he well adds, upon this principle. I have not seen the doctrine anywhere more succinctly or more clearly stated, than in this opinion of Gibson, J., in our own case of Perkins v. Gay. In Miles v. Stevens, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Pa.%2037" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Pa. 37">3 Pa. 37</a>, it is said it is not every mistake which will enable the party to avoid the contract; for, to have this effect it must be of its essence, the sine qua non of the contract; or, as it is expressed, the efficient cause of its concoction. A court of equity relieves in such cases upon the ground of a material mistake going to the essence of the contract: Geiger v. Cook, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20270" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 270">3 W. &amp; S. 270</a>. Thus, for example, if one sell a messuage to another which was at the time swept away by a flood or destroyed by an earthquake, without any knowledge of the fact by either party, a court of equity will relieve the purchaser: Hitchcock v. Giddings, 4 Price 135. Yet even ignorance of a material fact will not in every case enable a party to avoid a contract, as in the case of Fox v, Mackreth, 2 Bro. C. 420, (1 White &amp; Tudor’s Leading Cases, 72,) where A, knowing that there was a mine in the land of B of which B was ignorant, bought the land, without disclosing the fact to B,for a price in which the mine was not taken. into consideration; because from the nature of the transaction A was not bound to disclose to B what he knew about the land.</p>

Where both parties treat upon the basis of the fact being doubtful, and the transaction shows that both parties took the risk of the doubt, equity will not interfere, but will leave the parties where they were. This is the result of the numerous and varied eases upon this subject, very many of which are cited in 1 Story’s Eq. J., § 140 to § 152, and the notes thereto. The Pennsylvania cases are all to the same effect. I may mention, in addition to those already cited: Bellas v. Hays, 5 S. &amp; R. 427; Horbach v.

    <p class="summary" id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[131,1331,1164,910]]]'>In the case now before us, as it is presented in the plaintiff’s own narrative of the facts in her bill, we fail to see that the contract to substitute a new paid-up policy in the place of the old one, which required the payment of annual premiums in order to keep it alive, was induced by any such mistake of the facts as constitutes in equity a ground for relief. There is not in the bill any allegation of any such mistake, but only that “premiums were becoming burdensome” and “noinformation could be had whether Leisenring was living or dead.” That is the reason she gives for making the new contract. In this doubtful state of the facts, she thought it to the advantage of the estate to get a paid-up policy for a less sum, in consideration of being relieved from the payment of future premiums. It is precisely the case, therefore, put by the court in Perkins v. Gay, 3 S. &amp; R. 881, where the parties treat upon the basis that the fact which is the subject of agreement is doubtful, in which case the contract is to be held valid, there being no concealment or unfair dealing by the opposite party.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b219-6" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[130,2250,1161,144]],["BL_220.1",220,[277,361,1177,1683]]]'>The new contract, here, was not founded upon any mistaken fact or belief regarding the then condition of Leisenring, but was, according to the plaintiff’s own showing, based upon the <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>doubts which were entertained upon that subject. It does not appear that she had any belief about it, one way or another, but, being in a state of doubt upon the subject, and not knowing how long that doubt might endure, she came to the conclusion that it would be advantageous to stop future premiums by taking out a paid-up policy for a smaller sum. It does not appear that the defendants had any more knowledge than she had about Leisenring, or that she was induced by any persuasion of theirs to substitute the new contract for the old. It was therefore a novation for which there was a valuable consideration moving to each of the parties. Both parties, by means of it, diminished their liabilities, she for the future premiums, they for the amount insured. Both were willing to take their chances with the doubts surrounding the facts. Neither had any advantage over the other. It was like an insurance of a ship, lost or not lost, in which both parties treated upon equal terms and at arms length, and each was willing to stand the hazard of the chances. [That Leisenring was dead when they made their contract, cannot now annul the contract,] 3 any more than the fact that the ship was lost when the insurance was made can avoid the insurance. [It was not a contract induced by a mistake about the facts, but a contract made in view of doubtful facts, and because of the doubtful facts.] 4 [It was in the nature of a compromise, founded upon the doubts which existed, not upon any mistake of the facts.] 5 Such a case does not fall within the category of cases entitled to relief in equity, for the reason that to relieve against it would be to undo a perfectly valid contract, a contract which cannot, in any sense, be said to be unconscionable or against equity, which was as fair for one side as the other, and upon the performance of which the defendants can insist without being subject to any charge of bad faith, or of taking any undue advantage.</p>

The illustration mentioned by the learned judge, of the insurance of a ship, lost or not, wholly destroys his argument on this point; for, in the case of such an insurance, the policy always contains the words “ lost, or not lost; ” and if the parties in the present instance had agreed that the new contract should stand, whether Leisenring was then dead or alive, the agreement should have been so expressed in the new policy.

Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/88/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="88 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="1061172" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0133-01">88 Pa. 133</a>, the court said broadly that where there is no mistake, or fraud, a voluntary payment cannot be recovered back on the mere ground that the one party was under no obligation to pay and the other party had no right to receive. Under that rule, if the insured had died immediately upon taking out the policy, and the plaintiff, in ignorance of that fact, had regularly paid the premiums for thirteen years, no one would suppose that she could recover them back. Yet that would be a case which, compared with the present one, might well appeal to our sense of justice. And the plaintiff’s <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>bill exposes her to the charge of extreme negligence. In view of her speedy ascertainment of the facts, after the transaction was closed, it is fair to suppose that she made no inquiry before that, and that had she done so she would have discovered enough to put her on her guard.</p>

The mistake was in relation to the fact of Leisenring’s death. Both parties evidently supposed, and acted on the supposition, that he was alive, and that the annual premiums upon his life, which had become burdensome to Mrs. Riegel, must be continued indefinitely until his death should take place. As it had become difficult for her to pay these premiums, the only way in which she could be relieved from them was to surrender her policy and accept a paid-up policy for such smaller sum as the premiums already paid would purchase. Rather than take the risk of losing the entire amount of the policy by her inability to keep up the annual payments, she surrendered her policy for six thousand dollars, and accepted in lieu of it a paid-up policy for two thousand five hundred dollars. This was the contract she made while in ignorance of Leisenring’s death. At the time she made it she was already relieved from the burdensome premiums, and the entire amount of the policy was honestly due her from the company. What was the effect of the mistake upon her ? Simply to take from her the difference between the two policies and give her absolutely nothing for it. She surrendered a policy for six thousand dollars, on which the liability of the company was already fixed, and received one for two thousand five hundred dollars to secure relief from a burden already removed. The company parted with nothing. She secured nothing. The whole transaction was a mistake, and, if the decree of the court below stands, the result will be <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>to take three thousand five hundred dollars from Mrs. Riegel, and give it to the insurance company.</p>

Among the more recent cases, however, in which the subject has been discussed and relief granted, are Babcock v.

He treats the arrangement made between Mrs. Riegel and the company on the twentieth of March as a compromise of a claim against the company for the alleged death of Leisenring, which Mrs. Riegel was unable to establish, because unable to show the death. As the fact of the death, and the consequent liability of the company on the policy, were uncertain, it was a case for the application of the doctrine that the adjustment of a doubtful claim constituted a valid consideration for the surrender of the policy, and the acceptance of the new one, and upon this theory the decree was entered. But it nowhere appears that Mrs. Riegel made any claim on the company, or supposed that she had any. She was asking relief from future payments of premiums on a policy on which she supposed future payments would have to be made, and to get this relief she was willing to sacrifice more than one half of the sum insured. The company was willing, in consideration of the large reduction of its liability, to give her a policy for what her payments would purchase, and relieve her in future. This is an exchange often made, and adjusted by well-settled rules. It was a compromise of nothing. We do not doubt the correctness of the rule applied by the learned judge in cases to which it is fairly applicable, but this is not one of them. The plaintiff distinctly avers that she did not know of the death of Leisenring until some ten days after the exchange of policies was effected, and that “ both parties to the transaction were acting in respect thereto on the basis that Leisenring <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>was alive.” She distinctly avers that the object of the arrangement was to secure relief for herself from the indefinite payment of premiums that had become burdensome to her; that the new policy was accepted for that reason, and the old one surrendered, at a time when, had she known the fact, she was entitled to demand the entire sum upon which she had so long and so steadily paid the burdensome premiums. Upon these facts, if the attention of the learned judge had not been diverted from them, we feel sure that he would have reached the conclusion that we have reached, that it would be grossly inequitable to hold the plaintiff to a bargain made under the influence of a mistake of facts like that before us. This mistake the demurrer admits. If there had been any circumstance which the defendant could have set up to show that a correction of this mistake at this time would be inequitable, it should have been shown to the court by answer. If such circumstances do exist, they may yet be presented, as this case goes back to enable the defendant to take defence upon the merits.</p>
