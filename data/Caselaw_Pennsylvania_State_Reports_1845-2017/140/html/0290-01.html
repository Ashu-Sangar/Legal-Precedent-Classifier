    <p id="b315-12" data-blocks='[["BL_315.10",315,[211,1503,1167,912]]]'>1. It is difficult to understand why the court refused to enter judgment for the plaintiff. The contracts between the plaintiff and the defendant being in writing, their construction was for the court: Forrest v. Nelson, <a href="/pa/108/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="108 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="539268" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0481-01">108 Pa. 481</a>. These leases are the same in all formal parts as the one which was held by this court, in Rowe v. Sharp, <a href="/pa/51/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="51 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="999837" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0026-01">51 Pa. 26</a>, to create a bailment for use; and, even if the contracts now in question were to be held conditional sales, as to creditors, they would be good as bailments, between the parties : Brunswick Co. v. Hoover, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20Pa.%20512" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="95 Pa. 512">95 Pa. 512</a>. The bailment of a chattel for use, with a provision for a sale in case the price of the chattel is fully paid, includes two distinct contracts, the one taking effect, if at all, when the other is spent, and such contracts are valid: Rowe v. Sharp, <a href="/pa/51/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="51 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="999837" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0026-01">51 Pa. 26</a>; Enlow v.

As the lessee in this case failed to comply with the conditions of the contracts, the matter remained a bailment throughout: Edwards’ App., <a href="/pa/105/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="105 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="454216" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0103-01">105 Pa. 103</a>.</p>

      <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>2. The leasing of a chattel is analogous to the leasing of a house, and it will not be pretended that when a landlord enters for default in the payment of rent, he is barred from recovering the rent which accrued during the tenant’s possession. Such entry suspends only the rent of the current month, quarter, etc., and leaves unimpaired the landlord’s title to rent previously accrued, and his right to sue therefor: Kessler v. McConachy, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20R.%20485" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 R. 485">1 R. 485</a>; McCleary v. Allen, <a href="/pen-w/2/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 144" data-case-ids="8877612" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0144-01">2 P. &amp; W. 144</a>; Tiley v. Moyers, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20410" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="43 Pa. 410">43 Pa. 410</a>. If he be not barred, then by parity of reasoning the plaintiff should not be barred from recovering the rent in this case. It may be argued that as the defendant has already paid $1,100 for the rental of the presses, which if he had performed his part of the contract would have been credited upon their purchasing value, and that as he would then be entitled, upon payment of the sum of $10, in addition to all the instalments of rent, to receive a bill of sale for the presses, it is a hardship on him to make him pay any more after the plaintiff has re-taken them. The answer to this would be:</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[289,1357,1173,911]]]'>3. <em>(a) </em>The defendant had the use of the presses during the time covered by the payment of the $1,100, and also the time covered by the instalments now sued for, and has profited thereby. (5) The contract is in writing, and therefore its legal effect must be gathered from the writing itself, and it must be enforced according to its plainly expressed written terms, unless it is contrary to public policy, which is not the case in this instance; Tufts v. Spengler, 20 W. N. 62. (e) By his contract, the defeiidant agreed that the rental named in the lease was fair and proper, and having failed in the fulfilment of his part of the contract, the loss or hardship if any, has been occasioned by his default and not through any fault of the plaintiff. (d) The plaintiff not beiDg in default, should not be punished for the default of the defendant; yet if the decision of the lower court be sustained, the plaintiff will suffer a loss, as the presses are now second-hand machinery, and therefore, like all other machinery which has once been used, depreciated at- least one third in value.</p>

There may be some analogies between the leasing of a <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>chattel and of a house as stated by the plaintiff, but the anal °gy will fail when, as in the present case, the consideration named in the lease is the full value of the chattel, and the monthly rental is a fractional part thereof, so arranged as to complete the full payment of said consideration in a definite number of months. In the case of the renting of a house, the rent is not fixed .with a view to ultimate purchase, and, therefore, represents only a certain interest which the landlord charges; but, in the present lease, the rent is a fixed part of the purchasing price, and is larger than would be charged if rent in the ordinary acceptation was intended.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[229,933,1170,653]]]'>2. The plaintiff claims that the written contract must be enforced, and it stands upon its terms. If so, as it has not provided for the probability of suit upon the notes, nor fixed any method of ascertaining its damage by depreciation of the presses, its case must fall. The contract only contemplates a recovery of the presses, if default is made in payment of the notes, and allows “reasonable use and wear;” and for this reason the plaintiff’s statement, “ that the presses are depreciated, like all machinery that has been used, at least one third in value,” cannot be accepted as fixing the damages incurred, because “ reasonable use and wear ” is allowed by the lease, and there has been no evidence given of any greater damage: Brunswick Co. v. Hoover, <a href="/pa/95/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="95 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="492935" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0508-01">95 Pa. 508</a>.</p>

Nor was the price per month for the hire fixed in terms at any definite sum. In form, the writing plainly imports a bailment of the property. The Campbell Printing-Press &amp; Manufacturing Company are styled lessors, and Hickok a lessee; the presses, rollers, etc., were, in terms, “ let and hired ” to the defendant for a “ term,” at a specified gross sum, payable monthly, with a provision for a surrender or return of the property by the lessee to the less<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>ors at the expiration of the term; the entire rent or hire was fixed at $3,000, payable in monthly instalments of $100 each, and it may be implied, perhaps, that the “ term ” was thirty months, for, at the end of that period, if the instalments were all promptly paid, the lessee had the option either to surrender or to purchase the property upon the payment of ten dollars, the payment of this sum being declared a condition precedent to the purchase. But the right of the lessor, during the term, to re-possess himself of the property upon the lessee’s default in payment of any of the instalments, did not rest in any general principle of the law of bailment, but was exercised by reason of the agreement to that effect.</p>
