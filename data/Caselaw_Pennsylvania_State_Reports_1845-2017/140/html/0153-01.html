It is equally plain that by “ heirs of my said wife,” he meant heirs generally, and not children or any particular heirs. In the first item, he describes his own heirs to be his brothers <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>and sisters and their children, and, when referring to his wife’s heirs, he undoubtedly meant any who might stand in the same relationship to her. This being so, they take through her qua heirs by descent, and not as purchasers. Having thus discovered the intention of the testator as to how they were to inherit, the rules of law must apply, even if the general intention of the testator be defeated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[283,731,1167,1011]]]'>He undoubtedly intended to benefit the heirs of his wife, by providing for them after her death; and this he meant to do by limiting the estate given to her, for her life, and then to her heirs. In the first item, however, he gives to his wife one half of his estate absolutely. This refers to both real and personal, for in the third item he directs his executors to sell all his real and personal property, subject to his said wife’s moiety, meaning the share given to her in the first item. After thus providing for a sale, he attempts to provide for his wife’s heirs after her decease, and thus cut down the estate previously given to her. He does not, however, provide for a failure of heirs, nor for the disposition of the income of his wife’s moiety during her life. Unless, therefore, she has an absolute estate by the first item, or a life-estate by implication under the third item, he would die intestate as to the one half of the real estate during her life. 2 Jarman on Wills, *582, lays down the rule that “ It has become a settled distinction, that a devise to the testator’s heirs after the death of A, will confer on A an estate for life by implication; but that under a devise to B, a stranger, after the death of A, no estate will arise to A by implication.”</p>

A more reasonable construction, and one more consistent with the testator’s intention, would be that he intended a life-estate for his wife with remainder to her heirs. But we would then have a freehold in the wife, with remainder to her heirs, which would vest as an executed estate of inheritance in the ancestor. That this may defeat the intention of the testator can make no difference. “If the intention of the testator be that the remainder-men should take as the heirs of the grantee or devisee of the particular freehold, instead of themselves becoming the root of a new succession, the rule is applied, although it may defeat a <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>manifest intention that the first taker should have but an estate for life: ” Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>; Doebler’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="64 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1021310" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0009-01">64 Pa. 9</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[147,458,1164,809]]]'>If we attempt, now, to put the testator’s language into such shape as to give effect to both the first and third items, and make them consistent, and at the same time properly express his meaning, it would read thus: “ One half thereof I give and devise to my beloved wife Mary, to hold the same absolute, and after her decease I give her said share to the heirs of my said wife,” etc. This would be a devise to Mary and the whole body of her heirs, without limitation or restriction, absolutely and generally, and there being no devise over in default of heirs, would vest the fee in her. In Steiner v. Kolb, <a href="/pa/57/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="57 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1010423" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0123-01">57 Pa. 123</a>, the devise was “to Elizabeth for her lifetime, but immediately after her decease it shall belong to her legal heirs, share and share alike,” and it was held to pass a fee. We are therefore of opinion that the title proposed to be conveyed will be good and indefeasible, and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs.</p>
