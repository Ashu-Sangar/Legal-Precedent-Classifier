How, then, can their appointee and subordinate be held, at least unless there be process addressed to him making it his duty to receive and hold a prisoner, or unless a prisoner be handed over to him by one who has such process and leaves an official copy of it as a voucher ?</p>
    <p id="b130-6" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[236,681,1170,953]]]'>4. Statutes in derogation of the common law, and conferring a new jurisdiction, must be construed strictly: East Union Tp. v. Ryan, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20465" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="86 Pa. 465">86 Pa. 465</a>. The power of a sheriff to imprison a man is a special one, being derived only from a writ directed to him, and therefore it is strictly and absolutely confined within the terms of the direction contained in the writ. The only theory upon which an insolvent debtor can be permanently detained in jail is, that he is in execution on final process, and after a surrender he is held on the original capias ad satisfaciendum : Ingraham on Insolvents, 29; Mullen v. Wallace, <a href="/grant/2/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="2 Grant 389" data-case-ids="227740" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0389-01">2 Gr. 389</a>. But that writ is in terms addressed to the sheriff, and in Philadelphia county the jailer knows nothing of it until an attested copy is lodged in his hands. It is undoubted that Mr. Perkins had neither official nor actual knowledge of any of the previous proceedings in the case, and he was not bound to receive Quigg upon his verbal statements, or upon the unofficial written scrap of paper presented. The sureties on Quigg’s bond could not surrender him: Ingraham on Insolvents, 31.</p>

It was not unreasonable or a breach of duty, for the defendant to refuse to admit a total stranger, unaccompanied by a sheriff’s deputy or some process of the court. Should the jailer indiscreetly admit strangers, able-bodied confederates might thus obtain admission and liberate prisoners. The jailer would then undoubtedly be liable: Wheeler v. Hambright, 9 S. &amp; R. 390; Green v. Hern, <a href="/pen-w/2/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 167" data-case-ids="8877784" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0167-01">2 P. &amp; W. 167</a>. It would be harsh, indeed, to hold him liable for not admitting strangers to the jail, and yet to hold him liable for negligence in admitting them, should evil result. If there was an escape at all in this case, which is more than doubtful, it is clear that the insolvent was in the custody of the sheriff under the capias, and was therefore never in that of the defendant, not having been properly delivered to him by the sheriff. Even if the defendant be treated as the sheriff’s deputy, there must first be a recovery <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>against the sheriff, and then he would be liable in ease, not to the plaintiff, but to his principal.

    <p id="b131-6" data-blocks='[["BL_131.5",131,[190,629,1168,759]]]'>We decided in Saunders v. Quigg, <a href="/pa/112/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="112 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="546795" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0546-01">112 Pa. 546</a>, that, when William Quigg surrendered himself to the warden or keeper of the Philadelphia county prison, it was a compliance with the condition of his bond, and discharged his surety, notwithstanding the prison authorities refused to detain him. In Keim v. Saunders, <a href="/pa/120/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="120 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="559982" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0121-01">120 Pa. 121</a>, we held that the sheriff was liable for Quigg’s escape, for the reason that, under the peeuliar laws regulating the Philadelphia county prison, the sheriff was not the keeper thereof, and had no control over it. And in Saunders v. Smith, <a href="/pa/132/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="132 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="970536" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0180-01">132 Pa. 180</a>, we held, for the reasons there given, that the inspectors of the prison were not liable for such escape. This suit was brought against Howard Perkins, the superintendent of said prison, for an escape, under the statutes of Westminster 2d, in which the plaintiff claimed to recover the amount of debt, interest, and costs in the original capias against Quigg.</p>
    <p id="b131-7" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[193,1395,1164,502]]]'>The point upon which this case rests was not decided in either of the above-cited cases. We have decided there was a valid surrender as between Quigg and the plaintiff, and that the condition of the bond was complied with, and the surety discharged. We also said there was an escape, a question of fact about which there is no dispute. The question now is entirely different. It arises between the plaintiff in the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum and the superintendent of the prison, and we are called upon to say whether the surrender was sufficient to hold the latter to the peril and liability of an escape.</p>
    <p id="b131-8" data-blocks='[["BL_131.7",131,[193,1905,1163,247]]]'>It appears from the undisputed evidence that on the day the Court of Common Pleas refused to discharge Quigg as an insolvent, he proceeded to the county prison with one or two friends, neither of whom was an official, and banded to an under-keeper a paper of which the following is a copy:</p>

    <p id="b132-7" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[240,567,1168,394]]]'>Quigg at the same time informed the under-keeper of the facts surrounding the case. The defendant says in his testimony : “ He (Quigg) showed me a paper; I think the one in evidence is the paper he handed me; I gave him to understand that I would not receive him, as it was not an official commitment ; he asked me what was to be done, and I said he would have to go out. I declined to receive him then, and the gates were unlocked, and he went out.”</p>
    <p id="b132-8" data-blocks='[["BL_132.6",132,[231,974,1178,1409]]]'>It thus appears by the uncontradicted testimony that the defendant refused to receive Quigg for the reason, and the only reason, that he had no sufficient authority to justify him in detaining him. The refusal was based, not upon a mistake of the law, which, in theory at least, is no excuse, but upon the lack of evidence that Quigg was an insolvent debtor whose discharge had been refused by the insolvent court. It is true, he was informed so by Quigg, but is the keeper of the county prison bound to receive every one who claims admission, under the penalty of being mulcted in damages to the extent of several thousand dollars ? For any legal evidence before him, Quigg might have merely desired a night’s lodging at the expense of the county. We must not lose sight of the fact that the defendant is not the sheriff; he is merely the superintendent of the prison, and is accustomed to receive inmates only upon a formal commitment, or the order of the sheriff or some other officer. He had no knowledge, and no knowledge could be imputed to him, that Quigg was an insolvent, beyond the mere statement of Quigg himself. He had no record, no writ, no paper of any kind which bore authenticity, or which, upon its face, justified Quigg’s detention. If the keeper had also been the sheriff, as is the case in many counties in the state, and formerly was so in all, there would have been some reason why such a surrender as this would make him liable for an escape. In such case, the sheriff would have in his hands the original capias upon which the insolvent was arrested, with official knowledge of his application for the benefit of the insolvent laws.</p>
    <p id="b133-3" data-blocks='[["BL_133.3",133,[160,366,1168,761]]]'>
      <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>We have not held in either of the cases above mentioned that this defendant was liable for this escape. His case has not been before us until now. We have not before been called upon to say whether Quigg’s surrender was sufficient to hold the defendant liable. It would be a harsh ruling — -harsh beyond aii precedent — to enforce the old rule of the common law against him under the circumstances. The rule itself is a relic of the barbarism of a past age, and is not essential to, nor is it in harmony with, our present humane insolvent laws. It would be a wise act for the legislature to sweep it away. While it stands, it is our duty to enforce it in a clear case, but we must not be asked to do so in a doubtful one. I do not think it would have been applied in this case had it occurred during the darkest hours of imprisonment for debt, because the facts do not bring it within its reason.</p>

His language must be understood as applicable only to the case upon trial before him, not to another case, which had been passed upon by this court.
