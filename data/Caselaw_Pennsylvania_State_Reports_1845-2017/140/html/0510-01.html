    <p class="summary" id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[154,586,1168,861]]]'>All that the law can do is to measure the advantages with the disadvantages. If the advantages are in excess of the disadvantages, the law makes no compensation to the ones who have been injured by the removal of the earth; but, where the disadvantages are greater than the advantages, the law declares that a jury shall assess the difference and give it to the property owners. The law, therefore, gentlemen, does not permit you to say how much it would take to fill up a hole, how much it would take to bring the surface up to grade, how much it would take to tear down a house and build up a new one, or how much it would take to build a wall along the street to keep the earth from falling in upon your lot. That is not the measure of damages. The measure of damages is the difference in value of the lot, as affected by the change, as compared with its value before the street was graded. It is the difference between its value before and immediately afterward, or as soon afterward as the effect of the grade could be ascertained.</p>

The question now before you is, not what it will cost to fill up these lots and bring them to the level of the grade; that is not the question; for it may never be necessary to fill them up. The question is, what is the difference in the market value of these lands before the street was improved and afterward; and whatever that difference may be, if it is in favor of the landowners, that is the damage to be awarded. If, however, you find that the advantages are in excess of the disadvantages, then there is no damage; because it must be obvious to all that the making of a street at a place where it was worthless before, if it followed the natural surface of the ground, must necessarily enhance the value of the land on each side of it.] 10 It is worth a good deal to have an established grade.

The single question for your consideration is: What is the difference in the market value of these lots and pieces of ground in the market, before the establishment of this grade and unaffected by it, and the difference in value of them after the establishing of the grade and as affected by it ? That is the question you will consider; and if you find that the effect of the establishing of this new grade was to add to the several properties a greater value than they had, and to benefit them more than it inflicted injury, then your verdict will be for the defendant. If you find that the effect of the establishing of this grade was to cause these several properties to suffer a greater injury than they were benefited by the new grade, then you will say how much that injury is, and award damages to the plaintiffs to that extent.....</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b536-8" data-blocks='[["BL_536.6",536,[256,1345,1173,862]]]'>Answer: I say to you that they are entitled to recover damages for the change of grade of Edwards street. The filling is only important as showing, as far as it goes, what the change of grade will be; that is all. When the work is once commenced the damages are recoverable; but the jury are not to look at the amount of work that has been done there, but they are to look at the grade that has been established and decide what the effect of the filling or grading the roadbed or street-way, as established by the ordinance, is. It is the change of grade, that gives the plaintiffs damages, and not the <em>filling. </em>If the filling was above grade, of course they would be entitled to damages for that; for that would be a new change of grade if it was authorized by the borough. But it is the changing of the grade that is the foundation of the cause of action, in this case, and if you come to the conclusion, as I before stated, that these several plaintiffs have suffered damages greater than the benefits, from the change of grade, they are entitled to recover.6</p>

If the jury should find that the best method of restoring the property of any of the plaintiffs to the condition it was in before the filling, would be by raising the building thereon to the present grade of the street, and filling with earth around <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>tbe same, protecting tbe embankment at the rear with the retaining wall, then the measure of damages would be the cost of such raising, filling-in, and building the wall, taking into account the risk that might be incurred in such a process, injury to the building therefrom and the repair of the same.</p>

You may consider these several matters as elements in the cause, but you are not to award damages for the building of walls or the filling up of lots as special damages, or for the likelihood of injuring the building, etc. You are not to take up these separate items and award separate damages for them, and add them together and say that is the damage suffered. The law has given another rule for the measuring of damages, and that rule is as before stated and which I will now repeat. The law is this: You are to consider the market value of the property before the change and unaffected by it, and its market value with the grade and as affected by it. If the establishing of the new grade has added more value to the property than it has depreciated from it, the verdict should be for the defendant. If it has depreciated from the property more than it has added to it, the verdict should be for the plaintiffs, and the measure of damages should be the difference «between its value before and its value after. Now I think that it will not be necessary for me to repeat that again. You understand it, I suppose, perfectly.7</p>

Loss of his business has nothing to do with the case, unless it effects an injury to his land. That is all; and I have stated to you what injury to his land is to be considered, an injury that is over and above the benefits that he has received. Neither . .can I affirm the latter part of that point. If water is thrown upon his premises and lies upon his property, it is his duty to conduct the water <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>away from his cellar if he can, and whatever that would cost would be his damage if that was his only claim.

In doing that you get rid of all these claims, and that is the way the law lays down the rule. That is the rule.8</p>

Of course, the building of a street is an advantage to the whole community. It must be of some special advantage to this property. If it has brought its grade up and made what were low lands and worthless lands more valuable, that is to be considered; but this property has the same right to these advantages as other properties. There is no doubt about that, and you see, gentlemen, the wisdom of the rule which the law has adopted. If you take the value of the property immediately before the establishing of the grade and unaffected by it, and then take its value immediately afterward as affected by it, it must be obvious to every reasonable man that there is .no intervening time when there can be a general depression or decrease from other causes, and all these questions therefore are merely elements ; and the question of the general rise of the property or general depreciation of it from other causes cannot enter into the case, if you confine yourself to the almost imperceptible time immediately before and immediately after; that is to say: Here is a property with no established grade; nothing but a surface grade. What would it be worth, if it continued to remain in the same condition, and if no grades were ever established? What is it worth with the grade as established and as it would be, with the certainty that the street will be useless without a grade ? What is it worth now ? What is it worth with an established grade ? That is the question. If you find it is worth more, then there is no damage; if you find it is worth less, then there is. Now, gentlemen, you may retire and take up the questions I have laid down, considering each case by itself and arriving at the best conclusion you can. After <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>you have arrived at your verdict, I suppose there will be no objections to your coining into court and having the prothonotary receive it and then you can be discharged. You will take August, 1888, as the time upon which all your calculations are based. What was it worth at the time without a grade; what was it worth in August, 1888, with the grade ? Now of course, you must look to the future to a certain extent, but the future can have no effect whatever upon this property, in your consideration, unless it immediately appreciates. Now, let me explain what I mean. Town lots that are not built upon or may never be built on, may have a value far above farm lands. Why ? Because of their future prospect of becoming building-lots ; but that future prospect must operate upon the immediate value of the property if it is to be considered. You may, therefore, consider the grade; you may look at it, you may consider it as it now is, and, aided by that, you may look back to the time when the grade was laid out about August, 1888. You are to set the damage, not what it is now, but what it was then. You may consider what the advantage of the grade as established at that time would probably be, and to aid you in arriving at that you may take things as they are now; but you are not to consider what the property is worth to-day. The question for you is, What was it worth then ? And, I say, what it is worth to-day may have some bearing upon what it was worth then, provided the rise in value has not been produced from other causes, or the depreciation, if such there be. If the property has advantages from other causes, the plaintiffs are entitled to that. The time therefore, to which you will direct your attention is August, 1888; and, as that was the time the grade was established, the plaintiffs were entitled to their damages, if they suffered any, and you may add six per cent to that, from August, 1888, up to the present time, as a fair compensation for the withholding of the money.9</p>

The rule was early adopted and has never been much deviated from. It has never been departed from without a great waste of time, and much inconvenience and dissatisfaction to the parties as well as the court. No other rule has been found so satisfactory. If plaintiffs, in such cases, were permitted to make itemized statements of all the different elements of their damages, and add the sum total as their final claim, the damages would, in many cases, amount to much more than the entire value of the whole property said to be injured. In a case tried in this county before Judge Butler, an engineer and practical surveyor was called to prove the cost, by the yard, of filling up a lot of <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>ground to make it conform to a grade. An elaborate calculation was produced, and the cost proved to be about $2,000. How much will the lot be worth in the market after it is thus filled ? asked the judge. The reply was, that it would be worth about $150 or $200 !</p>

Our two causes of complaint are : <em>(a) </em>The exclusion of all testimony tending to show the cost of filling up the land of the plaintiff to the grade of the street: and (5) the exclusion of testimony to prove the cost of raising the buildings to such grade. It is manifest that the plaintiff would, at the outset, be compelled to make an expenditure that would cover the cost of these two items; but, when it was proposed to show their amount by the best testimony that could be produced, <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>that of experienced mechanics who had inspected the premises, the judge excluded it in emphatic terms. The result was that other witnesses, who were familiar with real-estate values, were precluded from testifying as to the damages to this property, because they lacked the knowledge of the cost of raising and filling which the excluded testimony would have given. The court below relied upon Baltimore etc. R. Co. v. Springer, 21 W. N. 143, misconceiving and misapplying the decision in that case. It was an application of the well-established principles governing the taking of land for railroad purposes, and it was without a feature that bore resemblance to the present case, which involved a claim for consequential damages resulting from a construction outside the plaintiff’s property lines.</p>

The learned judge was in error, in his view that the elements of drainage, filling the lot and raising the buildings, were not'proper for the consideration of the jury. When a borough constructs a culvert of insufficient capacity to carry the ordinary flow of water, and an injury results, the borough is liable: Haus v. Bethlehem Bor., <a href="/pa/134/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="134 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="814932" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0012-01">134 Pa. 12</a>; Huddleston v.

Why, then, should it not be liable for constructing a street so as to obstruct existing avenues for drainage ? In railroad cases, it is proper to consider interference with established crossings, or a failure to construct the crossings required by law: East Penna. Railroad v. Hiester, <a href="/pa/40/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="40 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="478281" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0053-01">40 Pa. 53</a>; or that the railroad makes it more difficult to rent the property: Pittsburgh etc. R.

It would seem reasonably to follow that evidence of increased difficulty of access, or other injurious results of the construction, would be admissible in the present case.

Experience has constantly demonstrated the correctness of the old rule established in the ease of Schuylkill Nav. Co. v. Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411, to wit: “The jury are to consider the matter just as if they were called on to value the injury at the moment when compensation could first be demanded: they are to value the injury to the property, without reference to the person of the owner, or the actual state of his business; and in doing that, the only safe rule is to inquire: What would the property, unaffected by the obstruction, have sold for at the <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>time the injury was committed? What would it have sold for as affected by the injury ? The difference is the true measure of compensation.” Attempts have often been made to introduce particular items of damage into the case, such as the cost of fencing, loss of business, expense of altering buildings, the value of minerals under the surface, the danger of fire, the price of particular pieces of land in the neighborhood, and many other distinct and independent matters, in order that the damages to be recovered might be swelled unreasonably ; but we have repudiated them all. More and more closely, in recent years, we have held parties to the rule that, after all things are considered which may affect the mind of the witness, he must give his estimate of the money value of the injury, by contrasting the market value of the property as it was before the injury was inflicted, with its value immediately after the injury; and the jury is instructed that the difference of these values is the measure of damage. Instances of specific rulings on this subject are East Penna. Railroad v. Hiester, <a href="/pa/40/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="40 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="478281" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0053-01">40 Pa. 53</a>; Pittsburgh etc. R. Co. v.

The inconvenience arising from a division of the property, or from increased difficulty of access, the burden of increased fencing, the ordinary danger from accidental fires to the fences, fields, or farm buildings, not resulting from negligence, and generally all such matters as, owing to the particular location of the road, may affect the convenient use and future enjoyment of the property, are'proper matters for consideration; but they are to be considered in comparison with the advantages, only as they affect the market value of the land. The jury cannot include in the verdict a fund to cover the costs of fencing, or to provide an indemnity against losses by fire, or casualties to the cattle and stock upon the farm. Such assessments must necessarily be purely speculative, as the matters thus sought to <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>be provided against are in their nature altogether ideal and fanciful.”</blockquote>

The learned court below very properly rejected the offers of testimony on this subject, and refused the instruction asked for by the plaintiff’s second point, saying that the law did not permit a recovery for any such matters. In the third point, the court was asked to instruct the jury that the plaintiff might recover damages for any loss or inconvenience in the prosecution of his business, caused by increased difficulty of access to his building, and for the consequences of increased water in his cellar and on his lot, occasioned by difficulties with the drainage resulting from the change of grade: all of which was refused.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[159,1290,1166,899]]]'>To the second point the court answered: “ You may consider these several matters as elements in the cause, but you are not to award damages for the building of walls or the filling up of lots as special damages, or for the likelihood of injuring the building, etc. You are not to take up these separate items, and award separate damages for them, and add them together, and say that is the damage suffered. The law has given another rule for the measuring of damages, and that rule is as before stated, and which I will now repeat. The law is this: You are to consider the market value of the property before the change, and unaffected by it, and its market value with the grade, and as affected by it. If the establishment of the new grade has added more value to the property than it has depreciated from it, the verdict should be for the defendant. If it has depreciated from the property more than it has added to it, the verdict should be for the plaintiffs, and the measure of damages should be the difference between its value before and its value after.”</blockquote>

But you will allow full and ample damage for all these elements when you take the value before and after, and allow the difference. In doing that, you get rid of all these claims: and that is the way the law lays down the rule.”</blockquote>
