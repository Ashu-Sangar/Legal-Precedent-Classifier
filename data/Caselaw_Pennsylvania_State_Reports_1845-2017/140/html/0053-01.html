At that sale Schwartz, who then had no record interest of any kind, excepting as owner of certain liens to his use, and to whom Kugel was indebted for unpaid interest and money loaned, purchased the property, as the highest bidder, for the sum of $6,700, paid <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>that money to the sheriff, and from him received a deed conveying the property to him in fee-simple. Your master finds no fraud attending this transaction on the part of Schwartz. It may be or not that he purchased the property at a bargain. Thirteen years have passed and he appears to have sold it for 112,000, but its present value is no test of its value in 1877 ; and the master calls attention to the fact that in the distribution of the proceeds of that sale, the Wolbold judgment, under w'hich the sale took place, had no share; and yet, in the ordinary course of such transactions, the holder of the judgment probably bid up the property to its full value at a sale which discharged his claim. However, this does not seem an important matter. The vital question is what title did Schwartz acquire by that sale ? It took place under a judgment accompanying a mortgage, given to a mortgagee who took the same as security for money loaned upon a title which had twice been solemnly confirmed by courts having jurisdiction thereof. The holder of such mortgage was a disinterested third party, without knowledge of the guardian’s malfeasance in office, and in no way charged with his misconduct. Your master finds that such sale and conveyance thereunder vested in Frederick Schwartz a good and indefeasible title, and that he acquired the same as an innocent third party, purchasing at a fair - public sale for its fair value, that which was being sold without fraud of any kind upon his part.</p>

Their position is therefore settled. Now, if the guardian, whose debt this surety had been compelled to pay, was still in possession of this real estate, the right of the surety to proceed and recover from him the real estate or its value would be very clear ; but, unfortunately for complainant, such is not the position of affairs. Unquestionably the original sale by Kugel to himself was voidable by any party in interest, but subsequently this title was confirmed by the court, and ratified by the election of the minors. That this confirmation and election would have no force in favor of the guardian as against this innocent surety, of course naturally follows, but the real estate out of which this relief is sought has been held by innocent third parties, for many years, who gave for it its fair adequate value.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[180,1334,1164,706]]]'>As matter of law, your master finds that the confirmation by the court and the election of the minors to take the money instead of the property, rendered the title of the guardian good as against every one in the world, excepting the surety who had been compelled to pay that which the guardian should have paid for such property. It was no longer a voidable title, when the minors had made their election, and undoubtedly such action of theirs was carried back in legal effect to the date of the original sale. Schwartz in good faith loaned his money upon a title, which was good; Wolbold, as trustee, loaned his money upon a title which was good; and, when subsequently Schwartz purchased the property at sheriff sale under Wolbold’s execution, he acquired a good and indefeasible title to the property as against the world.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.3",82,[288,362,1171,1612]]]'>
      <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>Your master again states most emphatically, nowhere in the record is there any evidence of fraud on part of Schwartz as against these minors or their estate. With this element of fraud wanting, as charged in the bill, the whole of complainant’s case falls. This bill charges that the real estate was purchased at sheriff’s sale by Schwartz pursuant to a fraudulent arrangement between him and Kugel; that the pursuit of the surety by the minors, in preference to pursuit of the real estate, was the result of a fraudulent agreement among the parties defendant, and that the decree of May 24, 1873, was sm’reptitiously obtained for the purpose of relieving Frederick Schwartz and Frederick Kugel from liability as sureties. None of these allegations were sustained by evidence produced before your master; and the result is that, at the present time, he finds Frederick Schwartz, or his grantee, in possession of this property under a perfectly good title, without any fraud either on his part, or that of his grantee, by which the complainant or the Muller minors have been injured. This title has been acquired in good faith, for adequate consideration and under proceedings which were only made possible by the fact that complainant voluntarily became surety for the guardian who has since defaulted. If any wrong has been committed, it was through his instrumentality that the guardian was able to consummate it; and, upon the faith of what he has done, Kugel was able to, at least, give to the world a prima facie title, and by means of what he has done procured from Schwartz and Wolbold money subsequently loaned upon mortgage. At the most, it is the case of one of two innocent parties suffering for the wrong doing of a third person; and the well known rule that he who has put it in the power of such third person to commit the wrong, is the one who should suffer the consequences thereof, applies with full force to this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[287,1991,1170,400]],["BL_83.1",83,[174,360,1163,502]]]'>As before stated, if this property was still in possession of the guardian, the complainant’s right to repayment out of the land would be very clear, and the doctrine of subrogation would apply with full force. It is stated in McCormick v. Irwin, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Pa.%20117" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="35 Pa. 117">35 Pa. 117</a>: “ Subrogation is a mode which equity adopts to compel the ultimate discharge of a debt by him who in good conscience ought to pay it, and to relieve him whom none but the creditor could ask to pay. To effect this, the latter is allowed to take the <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>place of the creditor, and make use of all the creditor’s securities as if they were his own.” This clear statement of this doctrine, in view of the facts heretofore mentioned, effectually disposes of plaintiff’s claim. Schwartz is not one who ought to pay this debt, and the property which he holds is not, and has not for a long time been one of the creditor’s securities. The master, therefore, finds that complainant is not entitled to a decree for the repayment of the moneys which he has been compelled to pay as surety, out of the real estate which has been the cause of all this difficulty.</p>

It would consequently follow that the bond given was useless and void; and, as the fraud perpetrated by the guardian was in no manner aided by this bond, but, on the contrary, prior to its entry, all damage that could be had been done to the property of these minors, your master fails to find any reason in law or equity why Frederick Schwartz should be compelled to contribute to a loss sustained by complainant, which was brought upon him by his own original act and subsequent carelessness as to its consequences.</p>

The charge of conspiracy, contained in the twenty-fifth paragraph, is all that gives force to the bill, and this charge is not sustained by the master. On the contrary, he finds, and in this he is sustained by the evidence, that there is nothing to support the charge of fraud and conspiracy as to Schwartz, the only respondent who made defence, and the person against whom this bill is principally directed. It would consume much time, and serve no useful purpose, to discuss the case in detail. We think the hill was properly dismissed.</p>
