The defendants, claiming that Mary Udderzook had derived title to the property as the heir at law of Frank Udderzook, who had died intestate in 1888, as part of their case called Edmund Hatton and Samuel G. Hatton, who testified, under objection and exception to the plaintiff, to acts and declarations of Frank Udderzook in his <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>lifetime with reference to the ownership of the property.

But he has undertaken to show you, in addition to what he says himself, by the parties from whom he bought it, that he did buy it. The gentleman who sold him one of these horses comes upon the stand, and tells you that he did so, that he paid him for it. He tells you that he has possession of the note which he gave for the payment of the buggy. He could not have possession of the note unless he paid it. He also calls before you the gentleman from whom he bought the road cart, who tells you that he did sell it to him, or traded it for a horse with him, not with Frank or anybody else, but with James. Now, you must say whether from this testimony there can be any question in your minds that James is the owner of this individual property that he claims. [I do not understand that there is any attempt made on the part of the defence to contradict what has been testified to by James and his witnesses relative to the property which he owns individually.] 1 Now, how is it as regards the joint property, the property that he claims to have owned with his brother Frank ?

    <p id="b260-9" data-blocks='[["BL_260.7",260,[291,794,1179,597]]]'>The first assignment alleges that the court erred in the following portion of its general charge: <em>“ </em>I do not understand that there is any attempt made on the part of the defence to contradict what has been testified to by James and his witnesses relative to the property which he owns individually.” This language is not strictly accurate, for there was an attempt made. But it was an attempt, nothing more. The title of the defendant could not be defeated by the declarations of Frank Udderzook, which is all the testimony of Edmund Hatton and Samuel G. Hatton amounts to. The second assignment does not conform to the Rules of Court, and for this reason has not been considered.</p>
