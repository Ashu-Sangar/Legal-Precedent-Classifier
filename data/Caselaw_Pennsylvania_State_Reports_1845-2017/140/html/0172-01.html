The executor agreed to pay it to any one,' if the church released him. Was the action of the vestry on February 11, 1888, the action of the corporation ? There was no power in the vestry to dispose of the property of the church except at and by regular corporate meetings; no power in the individual members of the vestry, as such individuals, to dispose of the property of the church. The auditor is of opinion that the action of the vestry of February 11,1888, was illegal. The directors of a corporation cannot bind it unless by corporate action according to the charter and by-laws. Therefore, inasmuch as <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>the resolution of February 11,1888, was passed at a meeting where no quorum was present, the church is not bound by such action unless it afterwards ratifies such action. In the case at hand, the subsequent action of the corporation repudiated the action of February 11,1888, and refused to recognize that meeting at all. Its minutes were not approved, and so far as the church is concerned it is as if they never had been. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss the other aspects of the case, because the church did nothing which could be construed into any relinquishment of this legacy.</p>

    <p id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.4",198,[262,417,1168,500]]]'>The learned auditor has given sufficient reasons for awarding to the St. James’ Episcopal Church at Evansburg, and to Christ’s Church of Swedesburg, the legacies to which they were entitled under the will of Louisa Rittenhouse. The appellant claimed these legacies, although not entitled to them by the will, by virtue of an alleged agreement or comprbmise by which he was induced to withdraw his objections to the probate of the will. But he failed to show any valid agreement by which the church authorities agreed that he should receive these legacies.</p>
    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[263,923,1170,908]]]'>It is true, a paper was produced purporting to be a minute of the vestry meeting of Christ’s Church, by which it was resolved that the vestry “ decline to accept the bequest contained in item No. 6 of the will of the late Louisa Rittenhouse,” etc. Bpt there was no agreement on the part of the vestry to give the legacy to the appellant. Moreover, it appeared that, when this resolution was passed, there was not a legal number of vestry-men present, and the fact that another member was subsequently, and not at a vestry meeting, induced to sign the paper, does not help the matter. The vestry-men of a church, as the representatives of a corporate body, must meet in order to take official action. They cannot act singly, upon the streets, or wherever they may be found. This is because they are required to deliberate. It is the right of the minority to meet the majority, and, by discussion and deliberation, to bring them over, if possible, to their own views. It also appeared that a subsequent meeting of the vestry refused to approve the minutes at the prior meeting above referred to.</p>
