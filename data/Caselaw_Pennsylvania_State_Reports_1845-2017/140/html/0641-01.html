Upon the part of the plaintiff, it is alleged that this amicable action of ejectment was fraudulent, was entered into with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of Henry <em>W. </em>Tobias.

The evidence is that it was entered into in 1869; the last payment became due, under the testimony of Dr. Throop, which is the only testimony bearing upon that question, in 1874, and this amicable action of ejectment, between Price and Pancoast and H. W. Tobias, was not entered into until 1877, three years, perhaps some months more or less; the precise date of the contract was not given, or at least 1 do not recollect it, but nearly three years had elapsed before this amicable action of ejectment was entered into.</p>

It is done almost daily and hourly by all kinds of men doing business.] 1 But, while men have a right to enter into an amicable action, they have no right to enter into such actions for the purpose of defrauding anybody else and the vital question in this case is, whether or not this amicable action of ejectment between Price and Pancoast, upon the one side, and H. W. Tobias on the other, was entered into with the intention of hindering, delaying or defrauding the creditors of Tobias. If it was, then the judgment is thoroughly null and void, so far as those creditors are concerned; but if it was not, then the judgment is valid, and it should be given its full force and effect.</p>

Fraud is alleged by the plaintiff in this case. Therefore, the burden of proving the fraud is upon the plaintiff, and he must prove the fraud by the fair weight of the evidence. You have heard the testimony of Mr. Tobias read. It is for you to say whether or not that testimony bears the construction put upon it by counsel for plaintiff. You have heard the testimony of Dr. Throop, which is directly contradictory to that of Tobias. It is for you to say which tells the truth. If there is any conflict in the testimony, it is for you to harmonize it if you can, and from the evidence which you believe to find the facts. If you find from the weight of the evidence that <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>this amicable action of ejectment was entered into in good faith, then your verdict should be in favor of the defendants. If you find that it was entered into with the intention of hindering, •delaying or defrauding the creditors of Tobias, not only by To-bias himself, but by Dr. Throop, who was acting as the agent of Price and Pancoast, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. Dr. Throop must have been a party to that intended fraud; no matter what Tobias intended, if Dr. Throop had no such intention, then Tobias’s fraud would not be binding upon Price and Pancoast. Dr. Throop must have been a party to such fraudulent intent himself.....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b666-5" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[279,949,1179,916]]]'>[There is evidence in the case that Dr. Throop was to pay Tobias something, in case he got this confession of judgment. Now, that of itself, gentlemen of the jury, is not enough. A man may be willing to pay another for a confession of judgment. You must find more than an agreement upon the part of Dr. Throop to pay Tobias, in case he got this amicable confession of judgment. You must find that Dr. Throop obtained it with the intent to defraud, hinder or delay the creditors of Henry W. Tobias. Tobias himself may have signed this instrument with the intent to defraud his creditors, and Dr. Throop not know anything about it. Dr. Throop may have even promised to pay money, but he may have promised to pay the money without any intent to cheat and defraud the creditors. The important question in the case, as I have already stated is, did they enter into this agreement with the intent to cheat, hinder or delay the creditors of Henry W. Tobias? If they did, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover. If they did not, then your verdict should be in favor of defendants.] 3 «•</p>

    <p id="b667-6" data-blocks='[["BL_667.6",667,[171,636,1171,851]]]'>The question of fraud and collusion between Throop and Tobias to hinder and delay the creditors of the latter, was submitted to the jury under proper instructions. The entry of the amicable action of ejectment was not evidence of fraud. As the learned judge instructed the jury, it is an every-day transaction. If we concede that Tobias intended a fraud, it would not affect Dr. Throop unless the knowledge of it was brought home to him. In other words, he must have participated in it. The mere acts or declarations of Tobias, after the transaction, would not be sufficient to connect Throop with the alleged fraud. Hence it was not error to reject the petition of Tobias for opening the judgment. At most, it was his ex parte declarations. Nor was it error to reject the deposition of Mrs. Tobias. It was offered to show her husband’s turpitude. While he might be willing to admit it, his wife was not a competent witness to prove it. She was testifying directly against her husband.</p>
