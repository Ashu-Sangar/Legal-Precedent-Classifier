The schedule of his property attached to his petition showed that he owned a suit of clothes of the value of $3, and an overcoat of the value of six dollars. The list of his creditors and the nature and amount of his debts exhibited indebtedness for costs, for fines, and for lying-in expenses of Jennie Hossler, amounting to $69.18, and “ one dollar per week until the child reaches the age of seven years.”</p>

He alleged that he gave his wages to his mother for her support; in this statement, his mother’s testimony to some extent contradicted him. She is <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>the owner of real estate in Tremont, and was accepted as bail for her son’s appearance at the hearing, in the sum of $300.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[260,473,1174,646]]]'>It was developed that on the day the case was called for trial, the defendant sold his watch, worth $16, to his mother, for the sum of $2. He admitted that he afterwards carried this watch on his person, having, as he said, “ borrowed ” it from his mother. It also appeared that the defendant made some proposition to settle with the prosecutrix which she declined to accept, whereupon he notified her that he would go to jail and procure his discharge as an insolvent, and that she should get nothing. The financial ability, and the duty of this able-bodied young man to support his illegitimate offspring, are alike plain. That he prefers to remain in jail, at a loss of $60 per month in wages, in a fraudulent attempt to shirk his responsibility, is not to his credit.</p>

Thereupon, on his making a proper assignment of all his estate, property and effects whatsoever, to a trustee to be named by the court, he may be discharged: See act of June 16,-1836, §§ 12,13, 14, P.

The opinion is not assignable as error, for the reason that it does not come here upon a certiorari, and, further, does not appear to have been excepted to. There was an exception to the order of the court dismissing the appellant’s petition for a discharge under the insolvent laws. This was what the learned counsel probably intended to assign as error. If we treat it in this way it does not help him. Whether the appellant was a fraudulent debtor, and for this reason not entitled to his discharge, was a question of fact, which was decided against him by the court below. We must presume the learned judge acted upon sufficient evidence, and his finding is not roviewable here. The testimony does not come up with the record.</p>
