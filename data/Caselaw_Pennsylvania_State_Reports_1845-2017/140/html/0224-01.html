Garrett, Jr., gave out contracts for the erection of a group of conservatories upon the tract of land described in the lien, then owned by him. The plans prepared by his architect provided for the erection of a building divided by a partition into two greenhouses, and for another structure called the palm-house, upon a separate foundation and with a separate roof, but joined to the greenhouses and having communicating doors by which to pass from one to <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>the other. The plans provided also for a system of heating apparatus, by which all the greenhouses could be heated from a common source, but so arranged that either of them could be heated separately. The heat was to be supplied from a “pit ” or boiler room, adjoining one of the greenhouses, and placed in the cellar of a building occupied as a dwelling by the gardener. There was some difference in the opinions of the witnesses, given upon the trial, as to whether these various structures ought to be regarded as together constituting one building, or whether one or more of them should be regarded as separate buildings, distinct from the others. The architect who prepared the plans testified that, speaking as an architect he. would call them one house, but that for purposes of horticulture they were separate buildings. Witnesses for the plaintiffs testified that the buildings as they were erected could readily be identified by the description given in the mechanics’ lien.</p>

They were shipped by the plaintiffs in September, 1888, except certain valves, etc., for controlling the heat in the pipes leading from the greenhouses into the palm-house, which were furnished about November 5, 1888. While the work was in progress, a set of ventilating apparatus was directed to be put in also. This was ordered from the plaintiffs by Wynn &amp; Henwood, some time after placing the order for the heating apparatus. The ventilating apparatus was furnished and put in early in 1889.

It is not necessary that every stranger should be able to do this, of course. It must be some person who is there for that purpose.

The contractors, who are also sued as defendants, defend upon the single ground that the claim does not sufficiently describe the buildings. The curtilage is defined by metes and bounds, evidently taken from the defendant Garrett’s deed, and the buildings are described as “all those four certain buildings known as the palm house, two greenhouses, and pit, or lot,” etc. The primary object of the description of the buildings is identification. Upon this point there was the testimony of a surveyor, who visited the premises, and said that, owing to the peculiarity of the buildings, the location, etc., there would be no difficulty of identifying them from merely reading the claim.</p>

He makes no defence upon this ground or any other. He is satisfied with the description, and with the justness of the claim. It is the contractors who set up this defence, and we are unable to see their standing to make it. They would have the right to allege that the materials were never furnished for the buildings, or that the charge was excessive, or that the materials had been paid for. But we are unable to see how, in a proceeding in rem, — against the buildings, — they can be heard to allege that the buildings are not properly described, and that the money, which is admittedly due for materials which were placed in the buildings, shall not be a lien against the property in the hands of the owner. That is a matter with which they have no concern. It affects the owner only, and, if he is satisfied, no one else has the right to complain. The case is unique. I know of nothing like it in our <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>books, and we would probably never have heard of this ease but for the fact that the contractors have failed, and made an assignment for the benefit of their creditors.
