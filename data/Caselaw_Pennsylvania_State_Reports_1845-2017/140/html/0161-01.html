Dempster’s interest in the property was not divested, if he was entitled to notice and failed to receive it. If notice was unnecessary and his title passed, then he is not injured, for the proceeds of the property were secured, and he can obtain his share if any is due him. Where notice is necessary in the Orphans’ Court, to dispose of an heir’s interest in real estate, failure to give such notice will save his interest and his estate remains undivested: Richards v. Rote, <a href="/pa/68/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="68 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1024612" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0248-01">68 Pa. 248</a>.

Even in a collateral proceeding, they do not stand, in their way. To open the decree and set the sale aside would be of no benefit to Ormrod A. B. Dempster, if he was entitled to notice before the decree was entered; and why should we disturb the sale if the purchaser is satisfied with his title and resists this application ?</p>

Under • the rule, as we interpret and construe it, he had a contingent remainder. The children of the testator had but a life-estate. Upon the death of each child, the children of each child then living were to receive one fourth of the testator’s property. There is a postponement of the division of the estate until the death of the life-tenant or tenants, and the remainder-men cannot be known until the time arrives to designate them. Prior to that time, it is necessarily contingent so far as relates to the persons who are to take : List v.

The act itself provides that all persons having a present or expectant interest shall have notice. Unless the contingent remainder-men are represented, we fail to see how the court can intelligently determine whether such sale is for the interest or advantage of those interested in the property. Our examination of the books discloses that it is the practice, at least in some of the courts, to have the interests of contingent remainder-men represented, whether they be in esse or in posse; but, as already stated, it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to determine whether notice to Ormrod A.

    <p id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[154,780,1163,1060]]]'>The appellant filed his petition in the court below, praying the court to open the decree of confirmation of the sale of certain real estate, and to set the said sale aside. The real estate in question was sold in 1880, under the act of 1853, known as the Price act. The ground of the application was that the petitioner was a minor at the time of the sale, and had no notice of the proceedings. It appears that the appeliant had only a contingent interest in the property at that time, and that the object of the sale — an object expressly authorized by the act of 1853 — was to bar contingent remainders. If we were to concede that contingent remainder-men are entitled to notice when real estate is sold under the act of 1853, it does not help the appellant. This sale cannot be set aside after the lapse of ten years. Something is due to the finality of judgments. The Orphans’ Court, after such a lapse of time, has no power, unless, perhaps, in the case of a fraud practiced upon it, to set aside the sale and vacate its own decree. If it might do so after ten years it might do so after a hundred. Nor is such action necessary to vindicate any supposed right of the appellant. If, as he alleges, his title is not divested, he has the land; if it is divested, he has the proceeds.</p>
