    <p class="summary" id="b112-8" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[273,798,1178,813]]]'>The evidence for the prosecution is that on January 26, 1890, and February 2, 1890, both of which days were Sundaj^s, the barber shop of the defendant was open and in full operation. Some men were being shaved; others were getting their hair dressed, and still others were waiting until attention could be given to them. The defendant, the proprietor of the shop, was participating in the work, and received money for it as compensation. For the defence, a number of witnesses were produced, who testified that it has been the custom for many years, in Philadelphia, to keep the barber shops open on Sunday, for the accommodation of persons who cannot get shaved upon Saturday; that there are some persons who are employed through the other days of the week; that there are others whose beards are so strong that they are shaved every day in order to be cleanly, and that it was in their opinion a matter of necessity to keep open the shops.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b112-9" data-blocks='[["BL_112.7",112,[266,1617,1179,762]]]'>The act of 1794, like every other act, is to be construed without regard to the propriety or wisdom of the legislation, and solely with a view of ascertaining and enforcing the purposes set forth in it and sought to be accomplished by it. It was enacted immediately after the visitation of Philadelphia by the yellow fever in 1793, at a time when that scourge was widely regarded as a punishment inflicted upon the community because of increasing levity and wórldliness, and its object plainly was by the imposition of penalties to compel the observance of Sunday. It prohibits worldly employment and business upon that day, excepting only works of necessity and charity; and, since it cannot be disputed that the business of the defendant is a worldly business, the conviction must stand, unless it can be shown that the business as it was conducted by him upon Sunday is such a necessary or charitable work.</p>

It seems to me to be quite obvious that the argument is a fallacy. If it had appeared that the work which was done was limited to such exceptional persons, there would be ground doubtless for the contention. It cannot be ascertained from the evidence that any one of the persons served was of this class, but, since there is a possibility of it, the argument is that the defendant was justified in keeping his shop open, not only for1 them, but for all other persons; not only for shaving, but for hair cutting, shampooing, and the attendant services; or, in other words, for the pursuit of his wordly business in the ordinary way.</p>

If the position so strenuously and ably urged by counsel for the defendant were sound, it would result in the entire abrogation of the act of 17 94, because the same process of reasoning would throw open substantially all the avenues of business life. In a large community such as this is, there can always be found some hungry to whom the baker may supply bread; some needy to whom the tailor may furnish clothing, and some wanderer in want of transportation. And, to extend the thought further, the baker cannot bake without coal, and the railway cannot carry without iron. If there are persons so closely tied to their occupations during the week that they cannot find sufficient time to get shaved except upon Sundays, the same want of time will prevent them from seeking the shoemaker', the plumber, and the forgeman upon the ordinary days of labor. Although this question, as it affects the barbers, has not been decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, it has been before a number of the judges of the courts of Common Pleas, and, to hold that the conviction should be reversed, would be to determine contrary <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>to the decisions of all of them: Commonwealth v.

It is true, the penalty is a light one ; but, if the right can be denied in this case, it can just as well be denied were the legislature to raise the penalty to years of imprisonment and a fine of several thousand dollars. And this is just such a case as should be tried by a jury. The statute excepts from the prohibition works that are charitable and necessary. Who can best judge what is necessary for a community, a judge or the people themselves ? This is not a question of law, but one of fact alone ; not fixed, but uncertain and shifting; changing with the wants, thoughts and habits of the people: differing with the character of the community, the seasons and the climates. Its determination by the courts has led and will lead to confusion. The decisions have changed and swayed with the mind of the judge or jury, and with the special circumstances of the case, just as it should always be with a jury, and just as it should never be with a judge.</p>

In a number of cases summary convictions have been upheld, and men deprived of their liberty, without the intervention of a jury, upon the argument that the legislature has the right to create new offences and have them adjudicated by any tribunal it pleases : Van Swartow v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/24/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="24 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="9503512" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0131-01">24 Pa. 131</a>; Rhinos v.

But these decisions and this logic cannot be reconciled with the declaration of rights, by which both the constitution of 1790 and that of 1874 guaranteed to acqused persons a trial by jury; and it is evident that this constitutional provision was not in the mind of the court when those cases were decided. In pursuance of article Y., § 14, of the present constitution, granting the right of appeal from summary convictions, etc., by magistrates, to such courts of record as might be prescribed by law, the legislature passed the act of April 17, 1876, P. L. 29, sending appeals in suits for penalties, where no imprisonment is involved, to the Court of Common Pleas, and appeals from summary convictions to the Court of Quarter Sessions. If this distinction were not made with the intent to give a trial by jury in the latter class of eases, the division of jurisdiction would have <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>been unnecessary, especially since tbe same judges sit in both courts. It was- evidently made in view of the fact that in the Court of Quarter Sessions the jury are judges of the law: Kane v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/89/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="89 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1063195" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0522-01">89 Pa. 522</a>; Spencer v.

Some of the lower courts have held, as matter of law, that shaving on Sunday is not a work of necessity, but this court has never so decided. In Ungerict v. State, <a href="/ind/119/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="119 Ind. 379" data-case-ids="1309022" data-case-paths="/ind/119/0379-01">119 Ind. 379</a>, upon a statute analogous to our own, it was held that the court could not decide this question as one of law, but that it was for the determination of a jury upon .the evidence. Similar decisions have been made by the Supreme Courts of Ohio and Iowa. However, if the question was one for the decision of the judge, in this case he erred in deciding it against the defendant. By works of necessity the statute means, not only those things which are absolutely necessary to sustain life or which cannot be dispensed with, but also many things only relatively necessary, which are morally fit or proper to be done on that day, under the circumstances of the particular case: Flagg v. Millbury, <a href="/mass/58/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Cush. 243" data-case-ids="1986193" data-case-paths="/mass/58/0243-01">4 Cush. 243</a>. The judge is mistaken in supposing that the regulation was the result of a spasm of virtue and fear of divine wrath, caused by the yellow-fever scourge. Its title shows that it was passed to take the place of a prior act that was about to expire. It is no part of its object to enforce the observance of a religious or moral duty, but it simply prescribes a day of rest from motives of public policy, as a civil regulation: McGattrick v. Watson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Ohio%20St.%20571" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Ohio St. 571">4 Ohio St. 571</a>.

The argument of the learned judge, that the defendant’s position, if sound, would result in the entire abrogation of the act of 1794, is not logical, nor are his examples in point. You can buy clothing and other articles on any day of the week for use on Sunday, but a clean face or well-dressed hair on Saturday does not mean a clean face or well-dressed hair on Sunday, any more than a full stomach on Saturday night obviates the necessity of eating on the next day.

L. 177, for performing his worldly employment or business on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday. The magistrate imposed the usual penalty, and from his judgment an appeal was taken to the Quarter Sessions, under the act of April 17,1876, P. L. 29. The <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>judgment was affirmed by that court, and tbe record brought up by a writ of certiorari.</p>

It has been before this court in repeated, instances, and its constitutionality sustained. It would be a waste of time to refer to the cases. It is contended now, however, that the defendant was entitled to a jury trial, and that it is for a jury to say whether shaving a man’s face and cutting his hair, are works of necessity. If such questions were submitted to a jury we would have no rule at all; one jury would find one way, and another jury would decide the other way; so that the practical result would be that one barber would be compelled to close his shop on Sunday, while that of his rival would be open. The practical difficulty of the case cannot be met in this way, nor has any authority been shown for the claim to trial by jury. When the legislature shall decide that in every case of a petty summary conviction the defendant shall have the right to a jury trial, they will probably say so in language too clear to be misunderstood.</p>

It is, perhaps, as much a necessity as washing the face, taking a bath, or performing any other act of personal cleanliness. A man may shave himself, or have his servant or valet shave him, on the Lord’s day, without a violation of the act of 1794. But, the keeping open of his place of business on that day by a barber, and the following his worldly employment of shaving his customers, is quite another matter; and, while we concede that it may be a great convenience to many persons, we are not prepared to say, as a question of law, that it is a work of necessity within the meaning of the act of 1794. We do not make the law; our duties are limited to interpreting it, and we feel ourselves bound by the construction which our predecessors have placed upon the act for nearly a century.</p>
