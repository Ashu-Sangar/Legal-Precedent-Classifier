Thereby Correll conveyed to Wetherill and his assigns the right of entering upon said lands for the purpose of searching for mineral and fossil substances and conducting mining and quarrying operations to any extent he might deem advisable, and Wetherill, for himself and assigns, covenanted to pay at the rate of two dollars per ton, during the continuance of the lease, quarter yearly, and, in default of payment quarterly or within ten days after due, Correll, his heirs and assigns, were to have the right to enter as though said contract had not been made. There was a proviso, that if no minerals or fossils should be mined or quarried within two years from date, the contract was to be void; the contract or lease to continue ten years, and, if Wetherill or his assigns should continue in the occupancy of the land, after the termination of said ten years, then the contract to be in force for another term of ten years.</p>

It seems from the report of the case that the lessee was willing to pay for it as ore; he was enjoined from removing the refuse.</p>

Wainman, 14 M. &amp; W. 859. In its enlarged sense it comprises all the substances which form or have formed the solid body of the earth: Bainbridge on Mines, 1. Fossils are organic substances which have become penetrated by earthy or metallic particles, petrified forms of plants and minerals; ore, a compound of metal and some other substance: Webster’s Diet.</p>

There was no provision for payment for them. Suppose the lessees had found no ore, but coal or a <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>valuable deposit of limestone, cement stone, or clay, would they have had a right to remove such valuable substance, the lessor receiving not a cent? Plainly such was not the intention. If there is no grant of the substances other than ores, without ore being found there is none of said other substances found in conjunction with ores. Therefore, regarding the material in controversy as a substance other than ores, it must be held that it belonged to the lessor, and for its conversion the lessees must pay damages.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b174-6" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[279,825,1166,959]]]'>But it is contended that as it contained 7 per cent of zinc ore, it is to be regarded as ore, or as rock containing ore which the lessees have a right to extract. This can be disposed of by a few words. No method or appliance is known by which the small proportion of ore can be taken out profitably. Defendant, when it was dumped, did not propose, nor is it now proposed to pulverize the stuff and wash out the small amount of zinc it contains. That which has been removed cannot be reached to be worked over; it forms parts of roads and the like. The whole was thrown away and treated as waste. All concerned were satisfied with that method of mining. It belonged and still belongs to the landowners, the same as the limestone, rock and loam and clay. The parties, when they contracted, did not contemplate that the waste left on the premises should be the property of the lessees, nor that they should pay for it. This also answers the argument that if defendants must account for what was sold, it should at most be only at the rate at which they were to pay for clean ore, that is forty cents a ton.</p>
