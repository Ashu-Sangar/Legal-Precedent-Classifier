By § 5 of the contract, it is expressly stipulated that no work shall be considered as extra, unless a separate estimate in writing for the same shall have been submitted to and signed by the owner or architect. There is no averment that such estimate was submitted, and it is a condition precedent to recovery for extra work: O’Brien v.

Even if extra work had been ordered, the plaintiffs do not aver that this necessitated their taking additional time to complete their contract. Under § 9 of the contract, the architect’s approval was in no way to lessen the entire and final responsibility of the contractors. But, the plaintiffs having failed to comply with the terms of their agreement, before any certificate of approval was given, and the rights of the parties having become fixed at that time, it is suggested that any subsequent approval, if given, would not be binding upon the defendant unless based upon a new contract or consideration.

The first alleged defence is that the extra work was not performed under written directions of the defendant, and therefore, by reason of § 2 of the contract, there can be no recovery for it. But § 2 does not relate to extra work, but only to “ additions to or deviations from the plans and specifications.” <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>Extra work is provided for by § 5, and this may be ordered by the architect. The statement of claim avers that all this work was so ordered. The affidavit of defence does not deny this, and does not pretend to aver that this section was not fully complied with.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[246,622,1167,491]]]'>2. The second defence alleged is that the work was delayed beyond the stipulated time. Under § 2, the architect had discretionary power to allow additional time in case of extra work. It is suggested that we do not aver that we were allowed extra time. But the delay is purely a matter of defence; and it was the defendant’s duty, if he wished to avail himself of it, to fully set out and aver that the time was not extended. Especially is this so, in a case like the present, when the statement of claim averred an award by the arbitrator who was authorized to extend the time.</p>
    <p id="b386-7" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[243,1131,1172,543]]]'>8. It is suggested that the certificate of the architect is not conclusive, because § 9 of the contract provides that the payments therein referred to shall in no way lessen the plaintiffs’ entire and final responsibility. A very cursory reading of that section will show that this provision relates solely to the partial payments to be made as the work progressed, and in no way modifies or controls the provision in § 4, that the architect’s decision shall be binding upon both parties. The argument that, as the plaintiffs were in default, the award was nugatory, is a curious proposition, assuming a default when the defendant’s own chosen arbiter has decided that it did not exist.</p>

The defendant had a right to rely upon the terms of the agreement, and the powers <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>of the architect were conferred and restricted in this instrument.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[241,474,1172,401]]]'>It was averred in the statement that “ after the said work was done it was examined by the said architect, and approved by him; and his certificate of approval of plaintiffs’ bill, showing a balance of $698.08 due by the defendant to the plaintiffs, was shown defendant, and demand made for payment thereof.” It is not alleged that any separate estimate of the extra work, in writing, was submitted to the architect or the owner, and his signature obtained thereto.</p>
    <p id="b388-5" data-blocks='[["BL_388.5",388,[233,883,1176,861]]]'>The work was to be completed on the 1st day of September, 1888, and it was provided that, should the contractor fail to finish on or before that date, he should pay the party of the first part “ the sum of five dollars per diem for each and every day thereafter the said work shall remain unfinished, as and for liquidated damages.” The statement admits that the work was not finished until the first day of November, 1888, and it does not state that, owing to the additional or extra work, any allowance was asked for, or was in fact allowed by the architect, or that any question arose upon that subject for the decision of the architect, or that the architect in fact passed upon any such question; it simply sets forth that the plaintiffs’ bill for the balance of the work was examined by the architect, and approved by him. The certificate is not before us. We only know from what is set forth in the plaintiffs’ statement what it contains; and we have no right to infer a fact which it was the plaintiffs’ duty to disclose.</p>
    <p id="b388-6" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[230,1752,1173,339]]]'>As to the two shovels, we can only say that, unless they are to be excluded upon the principle de minimis, etc., the defendant would seem to be entitled to a credit for what they were worth. Of course we rule this case upon the effect of the statement and the affidavit; when the cause comes to trial and the facts are fully developed, a different case may be presented.</p>
    <p id="b388-7" data-blocks='[["BL_388.7",388,[490,2109,907,84]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a procedendo awarded.</p>
