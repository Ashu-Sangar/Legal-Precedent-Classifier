The same day, the grand jury made a return finding that the conditions of the act of assembly had been complied with, and recommending that the prayer of the petition be granted. To this return, the borough of Darby filed exceptions, alleging as grounds thereof :</p>

Their rights are not to be adjudicated or in any way affected without their consent. If they come in and ask to be made parties and submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the court, we may, perhaps, make a decree that will be binding upon them, but not otherwise. Clearly the debt of the borough of Darby is due by the people of the territory embraced within the borough lines as they existed before the borough of Sharon Hill was carved out of it. The creditors had and still have the right to look to all the property of the borough, and no act of assembly can divest this vested right: Plunkett’s Creek Tp. v. Crawford, <a href="/pa/27/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="27 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="979756" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0107-01">27 Pa. 107</a>.</p>

All that the borough of Darby can claim is indemnity against the possibility of being compelled to pay the whole of a common debt. The detached territory must be compelled to pay or secure its share of the whole debt of the old borough, as well the floating as the bonded indebtedness. The act of June 1, 1887, P. L. 285, makes ample provision for the adjustment of this question. The words “ all indebtedness” are comprehensive enough to cover a bond not yet due.</p>

The questions involved and the assignments of error are alike in each case. We have nothing before us but the record, and that fails to disclose error. The appeal is given by the act of May 9,1889, P. L. 174. The proceeding itself is fully justified by the act of May 29, 1889, P. L. 393. The objection that the old borough of Darby, out of which the new borough of Sharon Hill is carved, in whole or in part, has a funded debt of $27,000, and that there is no adequate method of adjustment of the rights and liabilities of the said borough of Darby and its creditors, is not sustained.
