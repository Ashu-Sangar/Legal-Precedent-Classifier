In June, 1885, Troth sold one of the lots to Robert Kilpatrick for $2,200, engaging to convey to him an unencumbered title. For the purpose of raising a part of the purchase money, Kilpatrick applied for a loan to George Beebe, a real estate agent who had been employed by one Washburn to invest in a mortgage the sum of $1,500. Beebe agreed to loan this sum to Kilpatrick upon a first mortgage of the property about to be conveyed to him by Troth, and Kilpatrick executed a mortgage thereon in favor of Washburn for that amount. Kilpatrick, Beebe and Troth then met at the office of Patrick Bradley, who was the secretary of the building association and had charge of the books containing the accounts between it and the borrowers and other members. Bradley informed them that the amount due upon the association mortgage was $2,760, and that $1,380.20 would be the amount required to relieve from the mortgage the house and lot which Kilpatrick was buying.</p>

There was some discussion, and I told him that there was a balance due, and I objected to a statement of that amount. I asked him in the conversation about the Kilpatrick matter; I did not know Kilpatrick, and did not know anything about the Kilpatrick mortgage; and Mr. Beebe explained that to me as being intended to be in payment of the mortgage upon one of those houses; and I then explained to him that it was impossible to satisfy the mortgage of Troth upon the payment of the amount set out in this check. Q. What was the reason? A. The reason was, the mortgage covered both houses, and the association had not agreed to release either one of them, and I had no power to release; 1 have no authority whatever to release. Q. You have no authority to release? A. No, sir, and I explained that to Mr. Beebe in this conversation. He said that there was a clear title to be made. I asked if I should make that release, and he said no; and he said the sellers of the property were to pay for all papers except the recording of the deed. I handed this check back to him and said, <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>I cannot accept this check, because it is not sufficient to meet the claim in reference to the rent, and as for the building association matter I know nothing. I asked him to give me a separate check for the rent. He said there would be no difficulty about having the release fixed up; that he would see Mr. Bradley or Mr. Troth at once, and have it fixed up, and asked me to hold this check until he got this fixed up ; I said I would hold it.”</p>

The action taken by the directors of the association upon the report of the solicitor was entered upon the minutes as follows: “ The solicitor’s report was presented and accepted.

The solicitor considered that it was proposed to pay off the loan on the eastern house which this association gave to Troth. Then, on motion of Mr. Spencer, who I presume is one of the directors, the solicitor was authorized to satisfy the mortgage upon the payment of the amount due the association. Now, these are the instructions which the association gave their solicitor, according to his request. The solicitor was authorized to satisfy the mortgage upon the payment of the amount due the association. Did that mean the amount due on the mortgage ? You will bear in mind that the mortgage covered the two houses, the eastern house and the western house. Did they mean that he was to satisfy the mortgage upon receiving the whole amount due upon the mortgage ? You will see that Mr. Bliss in his communication informs them that it was intended to obtain a release upon one of Troth’s houses, and they put upon their minutes that they understood from their solicitor that it was intended to pay off the lien on one of the houses. Now, gentlemen, you must determine whether or not that was what this association meant; whether Mr. Bliss was not to receive this money until the whole amount was paid, or whether, when they said the amount due to the association, they meant the amount due to enable Mr. Troth to convey this eastern house free from the mortgage; and when Mr. Bliss received this amount of money for the association, was he authorized to act, and if so, was he to satisfy or release it ?

Was it to get the whole amount that might be due upon the mortgage, or was it to receive that proportion which would enable Troth to convey this eastern house relieved from the lien of the mortgage?

The defendant Kilpatrick is precluded from benefiting by the defence set up in the court below, for the reason that the wrong done was the act of Beebe who was his agent. The money was the defendant’s money; the debt to be paid was the defendant’s debt, and the check which was drawn by his agent, Beebe, for its payment, was in law the check of the defendant himself. The withdrawal of the fund from the bank by Beebe was undoubtedly a fraud, and, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, that fraud was the act of the defendant: 1 Parsons on Cont., §§ 1, 9; Middlesex v. Thomas, 5 C. E. Green-; McIntyre v. Kennedy, <a href="/pa/29/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="29 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="982932" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0448-01">29 Pa. 448</a>.</p>

Moreover, the jury were not justified in finding a payment to the association, for the reason that Bliss was not shown to have had authority from the association to receive payment. The only evidence of any authority given to him, was in the by-laws, the letter of attorney, and the special minute of June 6, 1885. None of these have such authority. The by-laws inferentially authorize him to make collections “ when ordered by the board of directors,” but not otherwise; and the letter of attorney was a mere power to enter satisfaction of mortgages upon the record. The minute of June 6,1885, authorized him to satisfy this mortgage only upon payment “ to the association ” of the whole amount due upon the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b437-10" data-blocks='[["BL_437.7",437,[219,1693,1163,502]]]'>3. That, under his general powers as solicitor or attorney of the association, Bliss had no authority to receive payment of loans, is conclusively established by decided cases: Seiple v.

All the proof of his authority was in writing, and it was clearly for the court to construe and not the jury: 2 Whart. Ev., § 966; 4 Phill. Ev., 1420, note. It does not show the authority alleged to exist, and therefore the evidence of the chock to Bliss should have been rejected, and the plaintiff’s third and fifth points should have been affirmed.</p>

The admission of the testimony as to Troth’s paying $32 after this alleged payment to Bliss, amounts to admitting evidence of declarations of Troth to the effect that in his opinion the $3,800 mortgage had been paid. It was objectionable both <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>because it was equivalent to hearsay evidence, and also because it was the self-serving declaration of one who was not only the debtor but was likewise a party to this suit.

Beebe was Kilpatrick’s agent to pay the money to the association. His agency terminated when payment was made. Payment was constructively made when the check was accepted by Bliss. Hence the subsequent embezzlement was not the act of Kilpatrick’s agent. And we submit that there was proof, full and ample, of both positive and constructive authority in the secretary to settle the amount owing, and in the solicitor to receive payment. While a corporation is affected by its by-laws, outsiders are not charged with a knowledge thereof, in dealing in good faith with the executive officers of the corporation: Taylor on Corp., §§ 196,197.</p>

The evidence from the pay rolls, as to the payments made by Troth, after the date of the transaction with the solicitor, was simply an abortive effort to obtain something from the enemy’s camp as to the manner in which the association had treated, upon its books, the payment made to the solicitor. The whole effort miscarried, it appearing that the payments made by Troth had no significance or bearing upon the question. And the court was not asked to construe the written evidence referred to in the plaintiff’s argument. Piad it been asked to do so, it would have given the same construction which the jury gave. When the jury have constrtíed a writing correctly, there is no just cause of complaint: Jones v. Kroll, <a href="/pa/116/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="116 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="554386" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0085-01">116 Pa. 85</a>; Miller v.

The objection embraced in the first assignment of error does not specifically relate to declarations of Bradley as to the amount due. The question objected to was as to what occurred at Bradley’s office. The witness went on to testify that the balance due as stated by Bradley was $1,380.20. But Bradley had already testified that the practice was to recognize settlements made by him, that he kept the accounts, and that the amount owing upon the Kilpatrick house was $1,380.20. There is a marked difference between a declaration such as that considered in Gass v. B. &amp; L. Ass’n, <a href="/pa/95/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="95 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="492875" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0101-01">95 Pa. 101</a>, and the declaration of the secretary, in our case, as to the amount owing according to accounts which he was charged with keeping.

It was shown, among other things, that on June 5,1885, after the mortgage in suit was executed, Troth, the mortgagor, sold one of the lots to Kilpatrick for $2,200, clear of all encumbrances. When the deed was about being delivered, Troth, Kilpatrick, and George Beebe met at the office of the association, and were there informed by Bradley, its secretary, that the payment of $1,380.20 would be required to obtain a release of the association’s lien on the lot that Kilpatrick was purchasing. Thereupon Troth directed Beebe, in whose hands he had placed $1,500 for that special purpose, to pay Bradley the said sum of $1,380.20, in satisfaction of the association’s claim against the lot in question. Bradley, instead of receiving the money, directed Beebe to pay it over to Bliss, the solicitor of the association. That was done on the following day by giving him his check on the Chester National Bank, where he then had and continued to have funds on deposit applicable to the payment of the check until the first of August following. But, instead of presenting the check within a reasonable time, Bliss held it until September, after Beebe had withdrawn the money and become insolvent. In consequence of the delay in presenting the check and Beebe’s insolvency, the money was lost, without any fault of Kilpatrick, who had reason to believe that Beebe’s check had been presented and paid.</p>

The minutes of the association contaiu the following entry: “ The solicitor’s report was presented and accepted.

On motion of Mr. Spencer, the solicitor was authorized to satisfy the mortgage upon payment of the amount due the association.” A general power to the solicitor to satisfy all mortgages and judgments in favor of the association as fully “ as if the same were done by the proper officers of said association in their official capacity,” was given in evidence.</p>
    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[211,776,1171,1206]]]'>In addition to the oral and written evidence above referred to, there was other verbal testimony tending to show an understanding that the lot purchased by Kilpatrick should be released on payment of the sum named by the secretary o£ the association, and that the check was accepted by the solicitor as payment, etc. Beebe testified, in substance, that part of the money which he had on deposit when he gave the check was the proceeds of another mortgage which he had placed on the lot, with the understanding that it should be a first lien, and in order to make it so it was necessary that the association’s claim should be paid; that he gave the check for that purpose, and it was so understood by the solicitor. If the written evidence in question had stood alone, it would have been the duty of the court to have construed it; but, in view of the oral testimony relating to and necessary to be considered in connection with the written evidence, there was no error in submitting the whole to the jury, under proper instructions.
