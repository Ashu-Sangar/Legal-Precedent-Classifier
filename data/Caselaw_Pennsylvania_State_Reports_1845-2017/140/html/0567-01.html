Mr. Justice Read also said: “ And for security the heirs of the vendor must also be notified.” But this was corrected in West Hickory Min. Ass’n v.

It is decided in that ease, that when the application for specific performance of a contract for the sale of lands is made by the executor or administrator of a decedent, notice to his widow and heirs is not necessary.

The application before us is made by the representatives of the deceased vendor; and, now that the representatives of the estate of the vendee have placed on record the admission of the correctness of the petition, and avowed their readiness to pay the balance of the purchase money, the way appeal's to be clear for a decree of specific performance.</p>
