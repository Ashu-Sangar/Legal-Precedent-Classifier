Although afterwards enjoying the fruits of the forged deed, Dager personally was not a party to the forgery; and indeed, there is no evidence that he knew, at the time he received the deed, of the fraud practiced by his agent. It is but fair to assume that he placed the $1,000 consideration money in the keeping of his agent, expecting that the latter would by proper deed obtain the title for him. It is clear that he was not physically a party to the transaction. It was wholly consummated in his absence. If living, he could not give a particle of testimony respecting it, other than hearsay. Does his death exclude the plaintiff from testifying to a transaction with his agent, in his absence ? It is submitted that neither the act of April 15, 1869, P. L. 80, nor the act of May 28, 1887, P. L. 158, contemplates such exclusion. In excluding the surviving party when the other is dead, they obviously refer to the death of a person who actually took part in the transaction, as one of the contracting parties. The death of Dager produced no inequality, as, if living, he could not have uttered a syllable to contradict the plaintiff.

Dager was not present at the execution and acknowledg<a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>ment of tlie instrument of writing which she witnessed; that William Haywood, the other subscribing witness, and the justice of the peace before whom the deed purports to have been acknowledged, was present, but that the entire transaction occurred in the absence of Dager, the grantee therein. The offer was then renewed with some modification. The plaintiff’s counsel offered to prove by Sutherland, the plaintiff, not that a forgery w'as committed by Dager, but that Dager employed William Haywood, the justice of the peace, as his agent, on February 14,1877, to prepare and obtain from James Sutherland and his wife a conveyance of the premises in dispute, in consideration of the payment of $1,000; and, whilst in that employment, the agent, Haywood, prepared or had prepared the deed dated February 14,1877, purporting to be signed by James Sutherland and his wife, and witnessed by Mary Nugent and William Haywood, and purporting to be acknowledged before William Haywood, as a justice of the peace, and that no such deed was signed by the witness or his wife, or by Mary Nugent as witness, or acknowledged before William Haywood as a justice of the peace. Objection was also made to this offer, to the same effect as before, which objection was sustained, and this is the first assignment of error.</p>
    <p id="b407-5" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[197,1498,1171,759]]]'>The contention of the appellant is that, as Dager, the grantee in the deed, was not present at the alleged execution of the deed, but was represented by an agent, who is alive and competent to testify as to the whole transaction, Sutherland, the surviving party, may testify, although Dager is dead. In clause (e) of the fifth section of the act of May 28, 1887, it is provided in the plainest manner that where any party to a thing or contract in action is dead, and his right thereto or therein lias passed, either by his own act or by the act of the law, to a party on the record who represents his interest in the subject in controversy, neither the surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract, nor any other person whose interest shall be adverse to the said right of the deceased party, except in certain specified cases, shall be a competent witness to any matter occurring before his death.</p>

Nicholas F. Dager was a party to that deed, and his right under it has by his own act passed to William Ross, a party on the record, who represents his interest in the subject in controversy; and it follows from the express words of the statute that James Sutherland, who is the surviving or remaining party to the deed, is not, in this case, competent to testify to any matter occurring before the death of Dager, who is deceased.</p>
    <p id="b408-6" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[288,781,1175,1524]]]'>It is true that at the time of the execution of the deed, or at the time of its alleged execution, Dager was not present. This is conceded; but he was a party to the deed, and in privity of estate with the plaintiff; and, although .the transaction may have been conducted by Haywood in his absence, in his interest, that, according to the terms of the statute, would not render Sutherland competent as a witness to testify on that subject after Dager’s death. Such was the construction finally put upon similar language in the act of 1869. After the passage of that act, the question arose whether the exclusion of parties to the action was only as to transactions with the decedent ; and for a time, it must be conceded, the course of the decisions upon that point was somewhat unsteady, but it was the manifest purpose of the statute to close the mouth of him who is adversary to the deceased assignor. In Karns v. Tanner, <a href="/pa/66/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="66 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="432500" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0297-01">66 Pa. 297</a>, the broad and general doctrine was thus stated by Mr. Justice Agítew : “ The true spirit of the proviso, then, seems to be that when a party to a thing or contract in action is dead, and his rights have passed, either by his own act or by that of the law, to another who represents his interest in the subject of controversy, the surviving party to that subject shall not testify to matters occurring in the lifetime of the adverse party whose lips are now closed.” This statement of the law was followed in Watts v.
