The auditor, however, conceived this to be beyond the powers conferred by his appointment, and that his inquiries were to be confined to the disputed ownership of the bonds and to the proper distribution of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale. He therefore passed upon the questions raised before him, finding that Jenkins was not the owner of the bonds referred to in his petition, and reported a distribution of the fund in court.

The petition of John S. Jenkins was of alike nature, and averred, inter alia, that the judgment of the Second N.
