He made his will February 21, 1887. His estate is estimated to be worth between thirteen and fourteen thousand dollars. By this will he gives $5,000 to his friend Judson J. Clayton, $2,000 to his cousin Helen D. Lloyd, and the residue to his niece, Elizabeth Hawkins, wife of William Hawkins. The testator was a bachelor, and Mrs. Hawkins, the residuary legatee, was his only near relative. She contested the probate of the will, upon the ground that the testator was not of sound memory and understanding, and upon the further ground that the legacy to Judson J. Clayton was obtained by undue influence. The register decided against the contestant, and she now asks this court to <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>award an issue to determine the question raised in that contest.</p>

His two brothers, Paul and Marshall, lived very intemperate lives. The testator reformed, and for almost seventeen years abstained from intoxicating drinks. He and his brothers lived near the hotel of C. S. Clayton, the father of Judson, the legatee, and during this period of abstinence he expressed great antipathy against this hotel and the persons there and elsewhere engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquor. In August, 1885, he returned to his old habit, and continued therein to his death. In January, 1886, he made his home at the Clayton hotel, and lived there continuously, with the exception of a short time spent in the city of Philadelphia.</p>

His sickness continued for ahput six weeks, and during this period he was nursed by Judson, the legatee. He continued his excessive drinking, spending his money freely at the Clayton bar. He engaged in no business; sat in the bar-room or remained about the premises. He was furnished with liquor over the bar, from day to day. From these indulgences he was very often drunk, and at such times he was wild and very profane. Drink did not readily affect his locomotion, but made him loud and boisterous. Drink impaired his health, and, no doubt, to some extent impaired his mental power. When sober he was always rational and competent to transact business. He was a man of considerable intelligence.</p>

Paul’s estate was not distributed until the spring of 1887; that is, subsequent to the time Solomon Levis, the testator, made his will. From the spring of 1887 to the time of his death the testator spent all the current income from his Philadelphia securities, together with almost four thousand dollars of his share in the distribution of the estate of his brother Paul.</p>

Clayton. He declared to <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>others that Judson had shown great kindness to him. When the will was drawn he told the scrivener that Judson had been very good to him, took good care of him, and was the only friend that cared anything for him. Judson usually served out the drink to him, gave him liquor at intervals, ranging from one half hour to two hours, and stopped the' drink on him when he thought Levis had enough. Judson accompanied him when he went to Philadelphia to collect his interest. Sometimes the testator gave his money to Judson to keep for him, and when money was needed to pay outside bills Judson would hand the money to the testator.</p>

He never visited her at her home after her marriage, which occurred about fifteen years ago.

When Mr. Levis gave directions for the §5,000 legacy he turned to Judson and asked him whether that was not what he promised him. Judson answered that it was, and that whatever he did was satisfactory to him ; to which the testator replied that when he said a thing he generally tried to carry it out. Two years and four months after the will was executed Mr. Levis died. Death was caused, or at least hastened, by the continuous excessive use of stimulants.</p>

Some of the witnesses show that the mental faculties of the testator were more or less impaired by his indulgences. This is not sufficient to establish testamentary incapacity. If his mind and memory were sufficiently sound to enable him to know and to understand the business in which he was engaged at the time he executed the will, this is all that is requisite, although the memory may be imperfect and greatly impaired by age or disease: Wilson v.

How is this confidential relation shown ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[144,965,1163,1457]]]'>It appears that Judson was in the habit of accompanying Levis in his visits to Philadelphia to collect interest; that at times Levis handed the interest to Judson, who then furnished money to the testator when he desired to pay outside bills. There is no evidence that the testator consulted Judson in any business matter, or that he asked or received Jjidson’s advice. The testator’s investments, purchases and gifts, were made without any suggestion from Judson. Mr. Morrison made the investment that is spoken of in the evidence; he also prepared the papers in the gift to the Friends’ School. Mr. Morrison was also the custodian of four thousand dollars, which were paid out from time to time to the testator personally or upon his order. It is even doubtful whether any of the Philadelphia income was handed to Judson prior to the time the will was made. We must remember that the elder Clayton, who died in November, 1887, had the Levis papers, and this income was not sufficient to pay the debts contracted at the hotel; for the evidence shows that due-bills were held by the elder Clayton, at the time the will was executed, and these were subsequently paid by Mr. Morrison out of the testator’s share in the estate of his brother Paul. If Judson afterwards became the custodian of any of testator’s funds this fact could not have operated upon the testator’s mind when the will was drawn, for then the fact had no existence and cannot be used as a factor to show a confidential relation at the time the will was executed. The attendance of Judson upon Levis, in the Philadelphia visits, indicates, as disclosed by the evidence, no more than a desire upon the part of the testator to protect himself against his own known weakness.</p>

      <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>The evidence of an existing confidential relation is certainly insufficient to establish such relation. But, suppose the evidence does establish it, the same evidence also discloses that the will was the free and intelligent act of the testator. The will was not drawn by the legatee, or by his direction or procurement. The testator made application to the scrivener some months before, to have a will drawn. He was taken to Mr. Hunter, at his own request, and gave minute directions from which the draft was made. He discussed with the scrivener matters pertaining to his property, and when the will was written it was read over to him in detail. The legacy to Judson was a specific sum, not the residue or any part of it. There is no evidence upon which to base an argument that the testator did not fully comprehend the extent and character of the bequest he was making. The legatee was present, but took no part in the preparation of the will, except to answer a question put to him by the testator. In this reply he said whatever the testator did was satisfactory to him. Levis was nursed by Judson and seemed to recognize that he was indebted for the kindness shown him. Hé frequently declared that he would or had remembered the legatee in his will. His niece was his only near relative, and it is evident that he did not take very kindly to her husband, for he never visited her at her home, although he showed the kindest interest in her before her marriage. She had some means of her own, a fact upon which the testator commented.</p>

Cuthbertson, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Pa.%20415" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="108 Pa. 415">108 Pa. 415</a>. The acts of confidential agency relied upon, may all be classed under the head of kindness; but general kindness, unless it be shown to be part of a crafty arrangement to procure a testamentary disposition, is no evidence of undue influence: Tawney v. Long, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20Pa.%20115" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="76 Pa. 115">76 Pa. 115</a>; Trost v.

The existence of a fiduciary relationship does not annul the testamentary act in favor of the attorney, even'where he draws the will, but such fact calls for watchfulness lest improper influence may have been exercised. And when in such case, there is no evidence <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>or fact indicating undue influence the court should refuse an issue : Harrison’s App., <a href="/pa/100/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="100 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="498467" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0458-01">100 Pa. 458</a>.

We were much impressed with the forcible argument made by the counsel for the contestant, upon this question. That Judson Clayton violated the law daily, in selling liquor to a man of known intemperate habits cannot be denied. The sales were made wilfully, and were therefore violations of the law even prior do the act of May 18, 1887.</p>

If this is an unlawful relation in the contemplation of law affecting testamentary disposition, it can only arise where the testator is, to a certain degree at least, dependent upon the legatee for his drink. Prom such a dependency, the legatee may have acquired an uiidue influence over the testator. And yet such fact seems to us to establish no more than the existence of a favorable condition for the exercise of undue influence, similar to that condition which exists where there is mental weakness from age, infirmity, or other cause; and, in such case, an issue is not awarded without some evidence that the will is not the free and independent act of the testator, and, as we already attempted to show, there is no such evidence in this case. There is no evidence that the legatee took advantage of this condition to unduly influence the testator in his behalf. But, we think the evidence fails to establish this dependency upon the legatee for drink. The elder Clayton was the proprietor of the hotel when the will was made. The legatee was the bartender. The proprietor was at least equally responsible for <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>the illegal sales. The testator was not dependent upon the legatee alone for his drink.</p>

This is shown by the fact that for a time he went to Philadelphia and there indulged so freely that he had to be removed. Upon said removal he was taken with delirium tremens, as the result of these excessive indulgences. The change to Clayton’s seems to have acted as a check. He had the full control of his estate, could go when he pleased or remain. If refused liquor, he could go elsewhere to procure it. A 'man without means seems to be able to secure enough liquor to lead a drunkard’s life, and a man with a large estate in his full control is sure to have no difficulty in obtaining all the liquor he can drink. If he cannot walk to bring it, money will bring him both messengers and stimulants. This may be a sad commentary upon the observance of the liquor laws, but our observation tells us it is true.</p>
