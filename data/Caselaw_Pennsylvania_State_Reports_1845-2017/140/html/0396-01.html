After his death, the tract was divided into two purparts by a line nearly parallel with each of the said boundaries. His son, John Bennett, became the owner of the purpart east of the division line, and another son, Thomas Bennett, became the owner of the other purpart. J ohn Bennett continued the owner of his tract until his death in 1882, when his son, the plaintiff, became its owner. Thomas Bennett died in 1842, and was succeeded in the ownership of his tract by his son, T. Elwood Bennett, who in 1855 conveyed the same to Abraham Huey. By various subsequent conveyances the title to that tract became vested in the defendant.</p>

This mutual use of the wagon way was continued by the respective owners of the farms, after the death of Thomas Bennett, until 1889, although Huey, and his successors in title, were strangers in blood to the plaintiff. A short time before the bringing of this suit, the defendant placed a fence upon her property, in such a way as to obstruct the wagon way and prevent the plaintiff from passing thereon across her farm. There was testimony tending to show that other persons, beside the occupants of the respective farms, had been in the habit of using the wagon way to cross from one of the public roads to the other.</p>

It is a well-established principle of law that wherever the facts and circumstances of a case show that the use and enjoyment of a way can be ascribed to some other reason than an adverse enjoyment, it is the duty of the court and jury to so attribute it; and, if this way came into enjoyment by the respective owners of these tracts, because they were brothers, and, as the law says, out of comity, that is, out of friendship, the one for the other, then it would not be an adverse enjoyment.</p>

We do not so view the law, that, because these people may have enjoyed this right mutually, the one in consideration of the other, therefore there was a want of adverse enjoyment. I say to you that we do not so consider the law, and in our opinion it will not destroy the adverse occupancy and enjoyment in the one by the other.] 2</p>

Such, in our opinion, is not the law; and if he has used and enjoyed this way openly, notoriously, and adversely in the way I have indicated, for twenty-one years, then, in our opinion, he has acquired a right to it, notwithstanding she may have had a light of the same character over his property.] 3</p>

In other words, if Mr. Bennett has passed and re-passed over this property, in a way similar to the neighbors in that community and in no other way, then he has done nothing which would give Mrs. Biddle the right to infer that he was claiming the right to come there. Other people were doing the same thing that he was doing; they were passing through these gates and going from one road to another whenever they pleased, and he was doing the same thing.

    <p id="b425-6" data-blocks='[["BL_425.6",425,[216,576,1167,706]]]'>The parties to this litigation own adjoining farms. A public road runs on the east side of one of them on which the buildings are located. Another parallel road runs on the west side of the other with the farm buildings upon it. Many years ago these farms were owned by brothers, who passed back and forth across each other’s fields, and kept up a gate in the line fence between the farms, to enable them to pass the more readily. In 1855, one of these farms passed into the hands of a purchaser, who was not a relative; but the occupants of both farms continued to cross from time to time over each other’s fields from one house or road to the other. A few years ago the defendant declined to permit further crossing of her fields, and obstructed such crossing by fences. This action was brought to test her right to do so.</p>
    <p id="b425-7" data-blocks='[["BL_425.7",425,[215,1290,1168,654]]]'>On the trial in the court below, the defendant asked an instruction to the jury that, if they were satisfied from the evidence the travel over the fields began in the intimate relations existing between the two brothers who owned them, it would not be an adverse user by either; and if the successor in title of one of the brothers had permitted and enjoyed the same user, no right would be acquired by mere lapse of time by means of it. The defendant further asked the court to charge, if the jury found the travel by the occupants of these farms over each other’s fields was a matter of mutual accommodation, it was not adverse, and no right would be acquired by reason of it. Both points were refused; and the refusal is now assigned for error.</p>

There must be an adverse possession to accomplish that result, and the statute will not begin to run in favor of one who entered in subservience to the title of another, until some act is done which destroys the relation. The possession must be hostile, so far as to be independent of, and to that extent adverse to, the title of the' owner: Cooper v. Smith, 9 S. &amp;. R. 26; Tinicum Fishing Co. v. Carter, <a href="/pa/61/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="61 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="428573" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0021-01">61 Pa. </a><a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a><a href="/pa/61/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="61 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="428573" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0021-01">21</a>; Wheeler v. Winn, <a href="/pa/53/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="53 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="1004688" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0122-01">53 Pa. 122</a>; Cadwalader v. App, <a href="/pa/81/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="81 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1044126" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0194-01">81 Pa. 194</a>. The same rule applies to a right of way claimed by prescription. The right must not only have been enjoyed without interruption for twenty-one years, but that enjoyment must have been adverse to the rights of the owner of the land, in order to give a title: Okeson v. Patterson, <a href="/pa/29/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="29 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="982733" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0022-01">29 Pa. 22</a>. Where one uses a road over the land of another, without asking leave and without objection, a grant will be presumed; but the presumption may be rebutted, and the user may be shown to have been in subservience to the title of the owner: Garrett v. Jackson, <a href="/pa/20/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="20 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="972376" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0331-01">20 Pa. 331</a>.</p>
    <p id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[278,941,1171,759]]]'>If the facts assumed in the points which were negatived by the learned judge of the court below, had been found by the jury, viz., that the travel over these farms began in the intimate relations of the two brothers, who owned and occupied them, and for their mutual accommodation, and was continued, after the title of one of them had passed to others, on the same basis and in the same spirit of mutual accommodation, then we think it clear that the user of neither was adverse to the other, and that no title was acquired by means of it. What the fact was as to the beginning and continuance of the travel between these owners was for the jury. They must determine whether this user has been a friendly exchange of advantages, or whether each has entered and exercised a right of passage adversely to the other. In the latter case only would the lapse of time give title.</p>
