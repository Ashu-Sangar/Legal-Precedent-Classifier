Crosland having been already conveyed by his previous deed to his mother; that the mortgages of the saving funds were therefore only upon the life-estate of Catharine Crosland, and she being dead at the time of the sale, the plaintiffs acquired no title whatever to the property.

This evidently contemplated that Mrs. Crosland was to have more than the mere use or income of the property during life. The whole of the property, principal as well as income, might be exhausted for the benefit of Mrs. Crosland, so that these legal heirs might receive nothing; and in the third place, the right of the heirs to receive anything out of the remainder was to be subject to the will and pleasure of the father, J ohn M.

      <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>If we examine this remarkable document from what is contained within its four corners, giving to all its various clauses their due weight, its purpose and objects become readily apparent. Whilst the ostensible purpose was to provide a comfortable maintenance for the wife, yet the real purpose was to give the husband full control and authority; the provision for the wife became subordinate to this evident intention, in the drawing up and execution of the instrument. I think it is clear, that, whilst the legal title was put into the wife either for support or safety, yet the dominant purpose was to put into the husband all the benefits and advantages of real ownership, without any of its responsibilities and liabilities; and it becomes a question from the powers granted, whether the wife does not hold the legal title in trust for the benefit of the husband, instead of the husband being the trustee for the wife, as the professed intention of the writing plainly sets forth.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[271,1164,1181,1062]]]'>Whilst the interests of the wife and specially of the remainder-men would seem to be indefinite and hard to define, as we have already touched upon, it is remarkable how carefully the interests' of the husband, who wrote this document, have been guarded and defined, not only as against the remainders, but even as against the chief beneficiary, his wife. He is to have the sole right to sell, rent and lease the property; to repair it; to receive all the income from it and to retain it, and apparently without accounting to her for it, provided he has fulfilled his marital obligation of comfortably maintaining her; and upon her death, then he has the rare privilege of devising the property “ for her and in her name.” And all this power and authority is to continue during “ his natural life,” even after the death of the wife. All this savors of ownership rather than of trusteeship. Nor can we accept the suggestion that it was a clerical mistake of the scrivener, that is, of the trustee, to use the word “ devise ” instead of “ demise,” and that he really intended, demise. There is too evident an attempt to swell the powers of the trustee, to suppose he would use words of lesser signification. He was searching after words which would give the largest powers possible.</p>

Instead of having a vested remainder in the property, their interests seem to be of. the most uncertain character. They <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>are to have the remainder, provided, in the first place, that there is any; in the next place, that the father does not sell the property or “ devise it to third parties,” and provided it is his will and pleasure to let them have it; three very uncertain events. Instead of a vested remainder, this becomes then a contingent remainder. And, in view of the fact that it is made to depend upon three or more contingencies, it may well be called a triple contingent remainder, á thing, I imagine very rarely met with. As all these uncertainties depend upon the acts and will of John M. Crosland, we may well inquire whether he has not himself, in point of fact, been constituted the remainder-man, instead of the heirs of Catharine L. Crosland. It is fortunate perhaps, in view of so many contingencies, that the husband has been constituted only the trustee of the wife, and not of the remainders, thereby relieving him from any possible imputation of having been unfaithful to the trust reposed in him.</p>

It is easy to see that John M. Crosland, having the right to sell the property, had also the right to mortgage it, for the greater includes the lesser right; and it is also easy to see that by such an act the interest of the heirs would be completely extinguished. His right to extinguish depends upon no contingency. They may not object that the father had sold or mortgaged the property, and put the money in his pocket and has not accounted for it. He is not required to account to them for it. He is authorized to retain it for the purpose of giving comfortable support and maintenance to the wife. The wife alone may complain of the want of support, but she cannot demand the money. This, however, is not a question to be decided here.</p>

Hence a conveyance by one who was an executor, with full power to sell and convey, shall be construed to be an execution of the power contained in the will, although that power be not recited.” In the opinion of Justice Sergeant, it is said “ it has been decided so long ago as Clere’s Case, 6 Rep. 18, that if one having only a power to dispose of lands, but no interest in them, make a disposition of them without reference to the power, they shall be considered as passing by virtue of the power; because otherwise the disposition of them would be inoperative and void. The: law, which mainly regards the design and object of the parties, will not suppose them to do a vain and useless thing, but if there be any way in which their design can take effect, it Shall be deemed to operate in that way.” To the same effect is Powell on Powers, 111, 114, and cases cited.</p>

It would be a violent and unwarranted assumption to suppose that the parties by mistake mortgaged the fee instead of the life-estate. There is nothing to show it. It would be a much more violent assumption to suppose that the mortgagees would have accepted such a security.</p>

We cannot suppose he would be called in to do a vain and useless thing. His act in executing the mortgage can therefore be referred only to the power granted to him in the deed of conveyance from the son to the mother. For these reasons, we think that the mortgages were executed in pursuance of the power and that they can be referred to no other source.</p>

If they did not think they were the owners in fee, they penetrated a fraud upon the latter. We are unwilling to impute such an act to them, but prefer to believe that they executed the mortgage in good faith, as owners of the fee. We think they were right in their construction of the deed.
