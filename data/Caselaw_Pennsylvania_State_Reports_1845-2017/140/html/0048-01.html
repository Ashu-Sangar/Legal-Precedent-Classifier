I had a horse and wagon at that time ; kept it on the west side of the market house. The defendant kept a commission store; I was buying a good deal of stuff from him. On Saturday, March 3, 1871, I had occasion to go over to his water-closet. Defendant said, ‘ Do you want to buy a horse ? ’ I said, ‘ No, I might trade horses.’ I looked into the defendant’s stable and I saw the defendant’s horse. I said, ‘ I <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>will trade with you, if the horse is all right.’ I did not examine the horse. I then left and went away for some time. When I came back to where my horse was standing, I found a blind horse in my wagon in place of my own; a man named Mount was gearing him up. I said to Mount, ‘ Take that horse out of there; 1 did not want a blind horse.’ Mr. Jones came over laughing, and said, ‘ Take him away and try him; if he is not all right, bring him back and I will take him back.’ I said, 4 He is not all right.’ This all took place on Saturday afternoon after three o’clock, and the orders were to clear the stalls at three o’clock. I kept the horse till Monday; my man drove him in my wagon home to my place. I kept him till Monday. He was home in my stable till Monday. David O’Gorman, my man, drove him to my home; he would never have got there if I had to drive him. I could not drive him, as he -was no good to me; not worth one cent. On Monday morning, I told O’Gorman to take him back and get my horse. He must have taken him. I didn’t go with him to see. I never got my horse back; neither of the horses, nor money either. Jones never offered to pay me.”</p>

Mr. Graham and I went to look at Potts’ horses across the street. Potts came over after that to my store; we went together back into my stable to look at my horse. Potts went into the stall and looked at my horse; we then agreed to trade and consummated it there; we were to trade even. I do not remember that Potts was to give me $9.00 in cash. I know we traded, and I said to Potts that if neither horse was worth a dollar, there was to be no squealing. Potts said he would not squeal. I then told Mr. Mount to take my horse over and to get Potts’. I did not go over myself. On Monday morning, Potts sent back the horse he got from me; he did not come to me and explain why he sent it back, nor did he or any one ever ask me to return the Potts horse. After the blind horse came back, I notified Potts to come and take it away or I would send it to public auction. I sent him notice in writing that I would have it sold for his account at the bazaar. I had the horse sold; it was entered at the horse bazaar, Ninth and Sansom streets, and sold publicly for $54; it netted about $44, <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>which I took over and offered to Potts in Mr. Graham’s presence. Potts refused to take it. This was after he had sued me. I said if Potts would treat, I would give him back the horse I got.”</p>

The plaintiff’s contention was that there was no trade, and he gave evidence in support of it. This question <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>of fact is ignored in the point.
