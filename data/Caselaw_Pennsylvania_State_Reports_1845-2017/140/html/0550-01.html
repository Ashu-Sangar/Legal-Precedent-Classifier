An execution was issued from one of the judgments, on which a colliery property operated by the brothers Bank was sold by the sheriff. Pending a controversy before an auditor, on the distribution of the proceeds of the sale, Schwartz assigned all <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>three of the judgments to John Hersker, his brother-in-law, and subsequently, to wit, on March 26,1877, by a final decree of the court upon exceptions to the auditor’s report, a part of the fund in court, to wit, $372.42, was awarded to the Schwartz judgments and paid over to Hersker. But prior to the date of receiving this money, awarded upon the auditor’s report, Hersker had received upon the judgments, out of the proceeds of another execution sale, the sum of $510.40, so that the judgments were thus paid in full. This suit was brought to recover the fund so received by Hersker, on said judgments.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b573-4" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[166,877,1177,1533]],["BL_574.1",574,[231,370,1174,401]]]'>The assignment, dated August 7, 1876, was in writing, not under seal, embraced all three of the judgments, and was absolute on its face. It was entered of record to the judgments on August 14, 1876. The plaintiff testified that, though absolute, the assignment was without consideration, and intended merely to enable Hersker to receive the proceeds of the sale applicable to the judgments, for the use of the assignor, and to make it unnecessary for the plaintiff, who lived at some distance from the scene of the litigation, to attend to the collection himself. He testified, also, that after the receipt of the money due upon the judgments the defendant made some payments to him and acknowledged his indebtedness for the balance. His testimony was corroborated by Frederick Miller, also a brother-in-law, who testified in substance that, prior to the assignment, the witness was at Hersker’s house, when it was stated by Hersker and his wife that they would endeavor to obtain an assignment of the judgments from Schwartz, to collect the money upon them, and when the money was obtained they would buy a property so that Mrs. Schwartz would have a place to live in in her old days, requesting the witness to aid them in obtaining the assignment from Schwartz; that, subsequently, the witness again called at Hersker’s, when it was stated to him by Hersker and his wife that they had obtained the assignment, and that when they received the money they would buy a property for the purpose previously referred to, but these two conversations were not communicated to Schwartz until long afterward; and that, at a later date, a year or two after the assignment, when the witness called at Hersker’s, at the request of Schwartz, to inquire about the money and obtain some of it for him, Hersker said to the wit<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>ness that he would pay Schwartz the debt, with interest, but he would not pay him then. The defendant and his wife testified in denial of the testimony of the plaintiff and Miller, and alleged that the assignment was absolute in payment of an existing indebtedness due to Hersker from Schwartz, and to give Hersker a preference over other creditors of Schwartz. A great deal of testimony was offered and received in proof and disproof of this alleged indebtedness.</p>

It does not follow that, because the assignment by Schwartz to Hersker was absolute upon its face, the latter was entitled to collect the money and keep it. There was sufficient evidence of a trust to submit to the jury. Nor was it error to decline the defendant’s second point. This point also contained the vice of withdrawing the case from the jury, and, in addition, assumed the facts. There was evidence to corroborate the plaintiff’s allegations. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments all refer to the testimony of Frederick Miller. It was alleged that, as the conversation between Miller and the defendant had not been communicated to the plaintiff, it had no relevancy to the <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>issue. This position is evidently based upon a mistaken view of the effect of Miller’s testimony. Its very purpose was to show the object of Hersker in obtaining the assignment of the Bank judgments. Such purpose was declared before the assignment was made, and repeated after it had been obtained. As admissions by the defendant, the evidence was clearly competent. The last assignment is disposed of by what has already been said.</p>
