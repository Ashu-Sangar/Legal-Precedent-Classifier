But, before the judgment was entered, the act of May 10, 1889, P. L. 183, was passed, which authorizes the plaintiff in foreign attachment, “ at and after the third term of the court after the execution of the writ, to take judgment against the defendant for default of appearance, unless the attachment before that time be dissolved: provided, fifteen days prior to the entry of said judgment he shall have filed his declaration.” We think the case comes within this act, and that the judgment was lawfully entered. It was urged, however, that the act referred to was not intended to be retroactive. The doctrine upon this subject will be found condensed in Kille v. Tron Works, <a href="/pa/134/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="134 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="814958" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0227-01">134 Pa. 227</a>: “ Legislation which affects rights will not be construed to be retroactive, unless it is declared so in the act; but, where it concerns merely the mode of procedure, it is applied, as of course, to .litigation existing at the time of its passage.”</p>
