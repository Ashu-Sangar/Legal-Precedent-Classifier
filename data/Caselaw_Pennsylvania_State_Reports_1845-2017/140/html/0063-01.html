His mills were known as the Frankford Hosiery Mills. The firm of Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. were his commission merchants. Mrs. Bella <em>G. </em>Yezin took an active part in her husband’s business, and also operated a separate hosiery mill, known as the Bandola Mill, on her own individual account. The goods manufactured in both mills were consigned to Colladay, Trout &amp; Co., who sold them upon commission, and frequently made advances upon them to Alfred Yezin. The account was kept in the name of Alfred Vezin alone, apparently with the knowledge and sanction of his wife. In the course of these transactions, Alfred Yezin became indebted to Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. in a very large sum, the indebtedness at the date of his death amounting to $144,080.84. The Yezins having asked for advances greatly in excess of the value of the goods consigned, Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. pressed for additional security. Thereupon Mrs. Yezin, who had represented to William Y. Colladay that she was possessed of a large separate estate, derived from a former husband, made many promises, both verbal and written, to secure the debt to the extent of $80,000, $90,000, or $100,000, upon her individual property. She also became extremely urgent in her applications to Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. for additional advances and loans, to meet from time to time maturing obligations of her husband. She offered to give as security for such loans a mortgage, or “ deed of sale,” of all her separate property. The loans were made, but no mortgage, deed of sale, or other papers was ever executed. During a whole year, however, prior to her husband’s <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>death, she was continually writing to William Y. Colladay that the papers were being prepared, and promising that she would secure everything upon her individual estate. On the strength o£ these representations and promises, she obtained additional loans for her husband from Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. She also borrowed from them, upon her own individual credit, and for her own use, during the years 1879 and 1880, various sums, aggregating $9,'000, and they further discounted for her two notes of Rene Guillou, indorsed by her, amounting to $12,000. Neither the loans nor the notes were paid at the time the deed of trust was executed. While thus indebted to Colladay, Trout &amp; Co., Alfred Yezin died, as has been stated, on April 15,1881. By his last will and testament, proved April 21,1881, he made his widow his sole devisee and legatee, and appointed her executrix. The deed of trust was executed, and the bond and warrant given, on April 26, 1881. The only. consideration alleged for either was the pre-existing indebtedness, not loans made after the death of Alfred Yezin.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[213,1303,1159,351]]]'>It was argued by counsel for Sharpless &amp; Sons that neither the loans of Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. to Mrs. Vezin, nor her indorsements of the Guillou notes, nor her various promises to secure both her own and her husband’s indebtedness upon her separate estate, imposed any legal obligations upon her, and that, therefore, there was no consideration for the deed of trust, and it was absolutely void as against subsequent lien creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-6" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[213,1661,1159,707]]]'>Counsel for Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. admitted Mrs. Yezin’s disability to make a binding contract during her husband’s lifetime, but argued that her promises and indorsements, and the loans received by her, imposed upon her a moral obligation, constituting a sufficient consideration for the conveyance which was made when she was under no disability; also, that, being sole devisee and legatee under her husband’s will, she necessarily took his estate subject to his debts, and the removal or reduction of, or relief from, any portion of his indebtedness, was an ample consideration for the conveyance of any part of her separate property. It was also argued that the defence of coverture, which is practically set up here, can be made only by the married woman herself, and that, where she does not interpose such defence, it cannot be raised by her creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-7" data-blocks='[["BL_89.6",89,[258,2374,1112,38]],["BL_90.1",90,[244,380,1167,554]]]'>The contention that the relief of her husband’s estate from <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>indebtedness would constitute a sufficient consideration for such a conveyance, would have force, if it had been shown that the estate of Alfred Yezin had been thus relieved from any claim against it. But there was no such agreement. While Mrs. Yezin gave Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. additional security for their debt, they did not relinquish a dollar of their claim against Alfred Vezin’s estate, but on the contrary proved their total debt in the Orphans’ Court, and received a dividend upon the whole amount. Moreover, Mrs. Yezin had no actual interest in the estate of her husband, which was utterly insolvent. The deed of trust cannot be sustained upon this ground.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[245,942,1170,1268]]]'>But the auditor is of the opinion that Sharpless &amp; Sons have no standing before him to attack the consideration of the deed of trust upon the grounds alleged. That consideration would be unquestionably good, had it not been for the coverture of the grantor at the time the original indebtedness to Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. was contracted. The attempt, therefore, is to plead coverture. Mrs. Yezin, herself, does not set up this plea. She does not dispute the validity of the claim against her. On the contrary, she has expressly recognized it, since her discoverture; first, by giving the bond and warrant for the debt of Colladay, Trout &amp; Co.; secondly, by the deed of trust, which recites the “ indebtedness due ” by her ; and, thirdly, so far as the fund now in question is concerned, by the deed of re-conveyance of December 3,1885. She has not appeared before the auditor to raise any objection, but by her solemn deed consents that this money shall be awarded to Colladay, Trout &amp; Co. The auditor does not think that, where a married woman declines to plead her coverture, a creditor has any standing to plead it in her stead, for the purpose of furthering his own interests. Of course, if fraud or collusion were alleged, the case might be different. But no such allegation has been made, nor, if made, would there be evidence to support it. The rights of Sharpless &amp; Sons, in this particular, moreover, can rise no higher than those of Mrs.Yezin, and she is unquestionably estopped from disputing the claim made here by Colladay, Trout &amp; Co.</p>

It is not contended that there was any valuable contemporaneous consideration. The consideration expressed in the deed is nominal. <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>The contention is that Mrs. Yezin’s promises to secure to Colladay, Trout &amp; Co., out of her separate estate, the money advanced on her husband’s account, the money borrowed by herself personally, and her indorsements of Rene Guillou’s notes, constituted a sufficient moral consideration to support her promise, made after discoverture, to pay the same and the deed given to secure such payment.</p>
