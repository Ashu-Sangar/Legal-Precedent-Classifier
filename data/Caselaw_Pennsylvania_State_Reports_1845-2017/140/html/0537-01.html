There would seem to be no doubt about the right of Dull to be placed upon this record as plaintiff, upon his showing that the plaintiff’s title had been conveyed to him after suit brought. This is the object of the passage of the fourth section of the act of April 26,1850, P. L. 591. The only one who could question his right to be thus placed upon record, is the plaintiff who instituted the suit, for he may deny that his title has passed to him after suit brought. This is the doctrine of Longbine v. Piper, <a href="/pa/70/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="70 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="1028174" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0378-01">70 Pa. 378</a>.

This depends upon the testimony, and we have examined the evidence carefully in relation to this matter. The only witness who seems to have any knowledge upon this subject, in addition to that found in the evidence of the deputy sheriff, is Peter Van Blargen. He testifies that, as far as he knows, David Ulshafer was in Ohio in 1883 and 1884, and prior and subsequent to that time. He also says that- David lived with his father Solomon, and was with him, about the time of his death, upon the land in controversy. Solomon, the father, died in or about 1870, and how long David continued there after that time does not clearly appear from this witness’s testimony.</p>

But, when in his return he names the ones mentioned in his writ that could not be found in the county, the name of David again appears. Of course, this presents a contradictory, if not an insensible return.- In consequence of this character of return, the deputy sheriff B. F. Smith was called, and his attention directed thereto. He testifies that the name “ David,” in the list of those not found, is a mistake, that it should be “ Sarah,” and swears positively that he made a personal service upon David on the twenty-fourth day of February, 1883. If this evidence be correct, then Van Blargen’s cannot be, for it places David Ulshafer in this county, on that day, and not in Ohio, as stated by Peter Van Blargen. In addition to this, counsel appeared generally, and thus admitted service upon David, as one of the defendants, and on the first of September, 1883, filed a plea for him and the other defendants. The return of the sheriff is prima facie evidence that the defendant was in possession of the property, for this is the meaning of the second section of the act of April <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>13, 1807, 4 Sm.

Ho filed no disclaimer, and made no pretence of title. Under such circumstances, to avoid a verdict for costs he should have disclaimed at the entry of the plea, or at a period sufficiently early to warn the plaintiff before the trial. Failing to do this, there was nothing left him but to prove he was not in possession, and this question of fact the jury have found against him: see Steinmets v. Logan, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.%20160" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 W. 160">3 W. 160</a>; Kirkland v.

No deed to him was given in evidence, nor any evidence offered to show payment of purchase money under the terms of the agreement, although the greater portion of it was overdue. When it is borne in mind that Solomon Ulshafer, the father of Jacob, was a tenant under the plaintiff’s title, and died upon the premises about 1870, that the evidence strongly indicates that Jacob was a tenant under the plaintiff’s title, and that there is a provision in Miller’s agreement that Ulshafer, the vendor, shall have, “on said premises the right as tenant as long as he shall desire, rent free,” the agreement, to say the least of it, wears a suspicious look. Does it not really indicate an intention to hamper and delay the plaintiff in his action? Although Ulshafer died in 1885, and the contract provided for the delivery of a deed in May, 1885, no evi<a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>dence was given to show any effort to obtain a deed by specific-performance of the contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[266,459,1176,1427]]]'>But suppose Miller had actually obtained a deed, it does not follow that he would have a right to be put upon the record. In Loos v. Caldwell, 2 Miles 390, decided in 1840, Hill purchased from the defendant in ejectment, paid a very large consideration, obtained his deed, swore he had no knowledge of the existence of the ejectment, and himself asked to be placed on record, and his application was denied. There are-authorities of like character under the act which permits a landlord to defend his tenant’s title. When a party purchases, after suit brought, it has been repeatedly held he will not be put upon record: Brown v. O’Brien, 3 Clark 115; Penna. Canal Co. v. Iron Works, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Phila.%20662" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Phila. 662">7 Phila. 662</a>. This subject was discussed by our present learned Chief Justice, in Stafford v. Wheeler, <a href="/pa/93/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="93 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="442237" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0462-01">93 Pa. 462</a>, from which we gather that it is not a matter of right upon the part of a vendee, but in the sound discretion of the court, under the act of 1772. But the case in hand is governed by the act of 1807, and Miller never made application to be placed upon record, although he was present at the trial. The act of 1807 requires that the party next in interest shall be put upon record, and we doubt whether Miller can claim that he occupies that position in this case. Though the defendant quit possession after the service of the writ, it does not affect plaintiff’s right to proceed: Zeigler v. Fisher, <a href="/pa/3/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="400620" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0365-01">3 Pa. 365</a>. Whatever title Ulshafer had descended to his heirs; and if Miller under his agreement acquired any title, still the legal title remained with Ulshafer’s heirs, so far as the record of this case shows.

That act says, “No writ of ejectment shall abate by reason of the death of any plaintiff or defendant, but the person or persons next in interest may be substituted in the place of the plaintiff or defendant who shall have died pending the writ.” The provisions of this act were applied in Ulshafer v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/71/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="71 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1031272" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0170-01">71 Pa. 170</a>, in case of the death of the plaintiff after writ of error taken and before assignment of errors.

If so, then the act of 1807 fails to save to the plaintiff his right of action, and serious questions may arise as to limitation. These heirs are not put upon record as claiming possession or title, but as parties next in interest to John Ulshafer who has been proved to have been in possession when the writ was served and for years thereafter. Under such circumstances, can any one doubt the right of the plaintiff to proceed, as against him, to recover costs, even though he claimed no title ? If his heirs can defeat this right by disclaiming, then the writ has abated, notwithstanding the provisions of the act of 1807.</p>
