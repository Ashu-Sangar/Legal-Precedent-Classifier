Sobernheimer, without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, had entered into an agreement to sell the same, at private sale, to Silas Jones, for a grossly inadequate price; that, as soon as the plaintiffs heard of the contemplated sale, they gave notice to said Robert Cascaden and Silas Jones that they were opposed to said sale and would contest its validity; that, notwithstanding said notice, the defendants consummated said sale and, on November 2, 1889, left for record a deed for the said real estate, executed by Robert Cascaden and Mary Jane Cascaden to one Louis Ilutt, at the price of $700 per acre; “ that the said sale, your orators are informed and believe,” as averred in the bill, “ was really made to Percival Roberts, and that said Louis Hutt’s name was merely used as a conduit of title; that said Percival Roberts is now in possession of said farm;.....that the said executor, Robert Cascaden, lulled your orators to sleep by frequently declaring that he never would sell the property for less than $1,000 per acre;.....that Mary Jane Cascaden signed the deed without knowing what she was signing, and wholly on the faith of representations made to her by Frederick A. Sobernheimer, attorney for said executor; that your orators are willing and now offer to give $900 per acre for the same.” Charging “ that the said sale was fraudulent, and was made to deprive the legatees from getting the full value of the land,” the bill prayed, in substance, that the sale be set aside, the deed to Louis Hutt canceled and a re-conveyance decreed, for an injunction and for further relief, etc.</p>

While we do not wish to be understood as expressing any dissent from the views of the learned judge upon this question, we do not think it necessary to discuss it, for the reason that the plaintiffs, upon their own showing, have no equity. The allegation of the bill is that the defendant Robert Cascaden, as executor of the estate of James Cascaden, deceased, sold a portion of the real estate of his testator at private sale for an inadequate price; that said sale was fraudulent, and was made to deprive the legatees from getting the full value of the land. The prayer is that the sale be set aside, and the deed annulled. But there is no distinct averment that the purchaser was a party to the alleged fraud; and, having paid his money, he is entitled to hold his purchase. If the executor has committed any wrong or breach of his trust he can be called to account in the Orphans’ Court, which has control of his accounts. The bill was properly dismissed in the Common Pleas.</p>
