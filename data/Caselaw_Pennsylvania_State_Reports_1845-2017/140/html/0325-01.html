Under that decision, the land out of which this ground-rent was reserved would admittedly pass by this will, if it had been owned by the testatrix at her death; but the decision neither limits the broad language of the will to land inherited from her mother, nor intimates that the devise is a specific one. The intention of the testator, and the meaning which he attached to the words used, must be regarded in construing a will: Woelpper’s App., <a href="/pa/126/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="126 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="968893" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0562-01">126 Pa. 562</a>; Jodrell v. Jodrell, L. R. 44 Ch. Div. 590; Hill v. Crook, L. R. 6 E. &amp; I. App. 285.

Where a testator gives his property generally by the words “ all my estate,” or “ all my property,” and follows it by a description or enumeration of particulars, such description or enumeration does not abridge or cut down the effect of the general words: Bridges v.

    <p id="b351-6" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[218,523,1164,1062]]]'>3. This is not a specific devise. To be such, it must answer two conditions: <em>(a) </em>it must be a part of the testatrix’s property, and (5) it must be a part as distinguished from the whole: Bothamly v. Sherson, L. R. 20 Eq. 308; Smith’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=103%20Pa.%20561" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="103 Pa. 561">103 Pa. 561</a>. The devise is not a part of the property of the testatrix, but is “all” her estate, “both real and personal.” It is not a part as distinguished from the whole; there is no allegation that she had any other estate. She does not name any particular source from which she should “inherit” what she devised to her cousins. The general words are therefore not restricted and the devise is not specific. Courts are averse to construing legacies to be specific, and the intent that they shall be so, must be clear: Le Rougetel v.

The question is, do these ground-rents answer the description, “estate, real or personal, that I shall inherit'as my portion after my father’s death ? ” That they do not, is obvious from the circumstances of their acquisition. Although reserved out of land which the testatrix inherited from her mother, she parted with the land, and she bought the rents from Lafferty as absolutely as though she had used the proceeds of the sale to buy other land. This is not even the case of a ground-rent reserved by herself. The rents being held at her death by purchase and not by inheritance, they do not come within the description of property “ that I shall inherit: ” Williamson v. Berwicke, 1 Eq. R. 12; Ryall v. Bell, 8 T. R. 583. This one view of the question is sufficient to show that the rents do not <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>pass by this devise; but we may go more deeply into the matter, and consider the principle of revocation or ademption.</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[251,472,1171,1112]]]'>2. Prior to 1833, a devise of all the testator’s land was practically a specific devise of the land then owned, and hence if there were any change in the nature of the estate subsequent to the making of the will, the devise was revoked; e. g., if the land was sold, exchanged or conveyed on ground-rent, the purchase money, or the land taken in exchange, or the ground-rent reserved did not pass by the devise: Skerrett v. Burd, <a href="/whart/1/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Whart. 246" data-case-ids="1829035" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0246-01">1 Wh. 246</a>; Girard v.

Alcock, 7 Ves. 558. The act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, altered the rule in part, by providing that after-acquired real estate should pass by a general devise; but the act does not render general such devises as are specific in terms, and, as to them, the rule that a change in the nature of the estate revokes the devise, still obtains : Bothamley v. Sherson, L. R. 20 Eq. 304. Cases of ademption are strictly analogous, and it is held that a legacy falls, on a change in the character of the property, irrespective of the testator’s intention: Harrison v. Jackson, L. R. 7 Ch. Div. 339; Balliet’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Pa.%20460" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="14 Pa. 460">14 Pa. 460</a>; Bagot Settlements, 31 L. J. Ch. 722; Watts v. Watts, L.

    <p id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[252,1592,1172,805]]]'>3. The appellants contend that the general language of this devise is not restricted by the subsequent clause. This is a very simple method of solving the problem: simply dropping out the troublesome words, and then declaring what remains to be very clear. But the courts are decidedly disposed to give every word in a will its full force and effect, and the phrase, “ that I shall inherit,” must be given the effect of restricting the devise: Baker’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="115 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="551816" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0590-01">115 Pa. 590</a>; Howe’s App., <a href="/pa/126/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="126 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="968942" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0233-01">126 Pa. 233</a>. In Graham v.

Penrose, 9 Jur. 385; Doe v. Brown, 11 East. 441; Quinnell v. Turner, 13 Beav. 240; Leach v. Jay, L. R. 6 Ch. Div. 496.</p>

      <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>4. That this devise is in form a specific one, is clearly shown by the reasoning in the following cases: Bothamley v. Sherson, L. R. 20 Eq. 304; Shepherd v. Beetham, L. R. 6 Ch. Div. 597; Page v. Young, L. R. 19 Eq. 506; Capel v. Girdler, 9 Ves. 509; Emmons v. Smith, 2 De G. &amp; Sm. 722; Douglas v. Douglas, Kay 400; Cole v. Scott, 1 MacN. &amp; G. 518; Re Ovey, L. R. 20 Ch. Div. 676. The defendants erroneously infer that it must appear upon the face of the will that there is other property than that embraced in the description given, in order to render the devise specific. However, the expression used in this will indicates, as clearly as though it were said in so many words, that there is other property. Suppose the language were: “ All the estate that I shall inherit I give to my cousins ; all that I hold by any other title I give to my sisters.” Would there be any doubt that these ground-rents would go to the sisters ? That is precisely what this will says by what it leaves unsaid. The testatrix presumably had knowledge of the intestate law, and it must be read into her will. When a man dies, his realty devolves upon his heirs, and if he leave a will the question is whether its words are sufficient to defeat the estate already vested in the heirs.</p>

    <p class="author" id="Azek" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[466,1499,477,33]]]'>Mr. Justice Sterrett:</p>
    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.6",353,[228,1549,1163,197]]]'>This action was brought by the appellees, as next of kin and heirs at law of Miss Rebecca M. Clark, deceased, against Hosmer B. Parsons, to recover ground-rents issuing out of land now belonging to him, but formerly owned by said decedent.</p>
    <p id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.7",353,[231,1753,1165,658]],["BL_354.1",354,[250,378,1166,145]]]'>The rent in controversy having been claimed by the appellants, as beneficiaries under the will of Miss Clark, the defendant Parsons was permitted to pay the same into court, and thereupon issue was joined between the appellees and said claimants, to determine which of them was entitled to the money. The facts upon which the claim of each party to the issue, respectively, is grounded, are set forth in the appellees’ statement, and in the affidavit filed by the appellants. In the former, a prima facie case in favor of the appellees is presented, and the question in the court below, as here, is whether that ease is successfully met by the averments in the affidavit of defence, which, for the purposes of this case, must be accepted as true. The learned judge of the Common Pleas, being <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>of opinion that appellants’ claim to the money in court was not sustained, entered judgment against them for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence; and hence this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[248,532,1167,294]]]'>It is conceded that the ground-rent security belonged to Miss Clark at the time of her decease in February, 1887, and if the same was disposed of by her will made in January, 1847, the judgment should have been in favor of appellants, who claim under the only dispositive provision contained in said will, which is as follows, viz.:</p>
    <blockquote id="b354-7" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[248,838,1166,297]]]'>“ All my estate, both real and personal, that I shall inherit as my portion after my father’s death, I give and bequeath to my beloved cousins, Dr. William Gray Knowles and his wife, Martha Ann Knowles, their heirs George Gray Knowles, Mary Warfield Knowles, Gustaras Warfield Knowles, and Louisa Yictoria Knowles, their heirs and assigns forever.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b354-8" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[241,1144,1173,1000]]]'>This testamentary provision was before this court for construction in Graham v. Grugan, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20Pa.%2079" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="182 Pa. 79">182 Pa. 79</a>. In that case, as in this, it appeared that the testatrix was one of six children of Mrs. Sarah L. M. Clark, who, about the year 1840, died intestate, seised of certain real estate which descended to her said children subject to the tenancy by the curtesy of her surviving husband, who died in 1868. In 1869, the children of Mrs. Clark, by mutual deeds of partition, divided a portion of the real estate which descended to them as aforesaid, and the premises in controversy, in the case above cited, inter alia, were conveyed in severalty to the testatrix, Rebecca M. Clark. The action of ejectment was brought by the heirs at law against those in possession under the devisees named in the paragraph of her will above quoted. The only question was whether the premises in controversy passed under the will. It was held that they did; that the provisions of the will were applicable to the testatrix’s share of the real estate which descended to her from her mother, and which at the time was owned by her, and not to that which she possibly might inherit subsequently from her father.</p>
    <p id="b354-9" data-blocks='[["BL_354.7",354,[239,2163,1166,250]],["BL_355.1",355,[227,367,1161,93]]]'>In principle, that case is substantially the same as the one now under consideration. The fact that the subject of dispute in this case is the ground-rent, while in the former case it was the possession of part of the land inherited by testatrix from her mother, can make no difference. It clearly appears by the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>averments contained in the affidavit of defence that the ground-rent represents a portion of the real estate so inherited.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[228,469,1163,1469]]]'>In the partition above referred to, a lot of ground out of a part of which the rent in question issues, was conveyed in severalty to testatrix. In 1872, for the purpose of improving the lot, she conveyed the same to Patrick Lafferty, reserving thereout an annual ground-rent of $601.80 ; and, pursuant to agreement made at the time the ground-rent was created, she afterwards extinguished it, and in lieu thereof accepted several smaller ground-rents, including that in controversy, on subdivisions of said lot, which in the meantime had been improved. The ground-rents thus created and acquired were owned by her at the time of her decease, and passed by her will to the devisees therein named, just as did the land which was the subject of dispute in Graham v. Grugan, supra. It was never intended that the will should operate only on what the testatrix might inherit from her father; on the contrary, as was held in the case above cited, she evidently intended to dispose of all her “ estate, both real and personal.” By the words, “ that I shall inherit as my portion after my father’s death,” she must have meant property into the actual possession and enjoyment of which she would come at the decease of her father. The word “ inherit ” was not used in a technical sense. It often means “to become possessed of; ” and in that sense it was doubtless employed by the testatrix. In the language of her will, what she gave was, “ all my estate, both real and personal.” The generality of these words was not intended to be restricted by the explanatory words used to indicate the time when she would come into the actual possession and beneficial enjoyment of the only property that was then subject to her testamentary disposal.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[229,1947,1162,287]]]'>It follows from what has been said, that the testatrix, Miss Clark, did not die intestate as to any part of her estate, either real or personal; and hence the ground-rent in question passed under the provisions of her will to the devisees therein named. The learned court therefore erred in entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</p>
    <p id="b355-7" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[490,2252,755,43]]]'>Judgment reversed, and record remitted.</p>
    <p id="b355-8" data-blocks='[["BL_355.7",355,[273,2354,1118,42]],["BL_356.1",356,[256,363,1164,95]]]'>On May 25, 1891, a motion for a re-argument, filed on be<a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>half of the appellees, was refused, the principal ground alleged therefor being in substance as follows:</p>
    <p id="b356-6" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[255,465,1167,804]]]'>That the opinion filed indicated that the .ground-rent in controversy was reserved by Sarah Clark, the mother of testatrix, and as such inherited by the latter, and, therefore, an inherited ground-rent was the same in principle as an inherited portion of land, and the position of the appellees the same as in Graham v. Grugan, <a href="/pa/132/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="132 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="970483" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0079-01">132 Pa. 79</a>, that the will operated only on what testatrix took from her father. But the facts were, as disclosed by the statement and affidavit of defence, that the ground-rent was never inherited at all, and the land inherited was sold and the ground-rent purchased by testatrix thirty years after her mother’s death, thirty-five years after testatrix made her will, and five years after her father’s death; so that it did not come within the clause explanatory of the time when she was to come into possession and beneficial enjoyment of the only property that was then subject to her testamentary disposal.</p>
    <p id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[302,1329,649,40]]]'>Opinion, Mr. Justice Stebbett :</p>
    <p id="b356-8" data-blocks='[["BL_356.6",356,[254,1381,1165,755]]]'>We adhere to the opinion heretofore expressed, that, under the will of Rebecca M. Clark there was no intestacy as to the ground-rent in controversy, and hence the plaintiffs who claim as her next of kin and heirs at law have no case. It was not intended that our judgment should rest on any other ground than that all the real and personal estate, of which testatrix died seised or possessed, passed by her will to William Gray Knowles and others, sole beneficiaries therein named. If the gift to them had been specific, as claimed by plaintiffs, and restricted to the property which testatrix acquired by descent from her mother, the result would have been different; but that, we think, cannot be regarded as the proper construction of the will, the operative words of which are “ all my estate both real and personal.” The generality of these words is not restricted by anything that appears in the context;</p>
