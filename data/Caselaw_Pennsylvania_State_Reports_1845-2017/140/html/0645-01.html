Referring to the time when the renewal was desired, the defendant testified: He “ wanted me to give him a new one, and I told him, no; that the old one was just as good, probably, as a new one; he wanted me to pay a dollar •on it; I told him no, I couldn’t do that. Of course, I told him, as he said, if I got so I could send him up some I would do it, but I wasn’t so I could.” On cross-examination, he testified: “Q. When he saw you in June, 1885, he had this note with him? A. That was at the house. Q. You admitted owing 'the note, did you? A. Why, certainly, I admitted owing the note. Q. And you did owe it ? A. I did owe it. Q. You <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>was about to renew it on the back of it weren’t you? A. No, sir. Q. You promised at that time, you would pay the note as soon as you could, did you? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you fix a time when you would pay some money ? A. No, no permanent time, only I told him, as he said, if I got so I could, I thought I would do it. Q. You raised no question about the payment of it, until it was sued, did you ? A. No, I never kicked against the note.”</p>
