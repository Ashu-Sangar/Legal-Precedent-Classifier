    <p class="summary" id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[259,589,1169,854]]]'>“ Deponent never received from plaintiff for or on account of said bond, or of the assignment therein recited, more than $1,862. Plaintiff paid $188 for the premiums on a life policy, the two sums making $2,000 which was all the plaintiff loaned to deponent. The premiums for the quarters falling due in 1889 and 1890 deponent owes and no more. They amount, to deponent’s best belief, to the sum of $100. By agreement between plaintiff and deponent, the insurance company was notified by deponent to send the notices for premiums addressed to the care of plaintiff, who was to open them. Plaintiff never notified deponent of the premiums now due, and never asked deponent to pay them. The deponent is not entitled to any portion of the residuary estate of Henry M. Phillips, deceased, until the death of deponent’s aunts, Miss Emily Phillips and Miss Ellen Phillips, who are both in full life. In face of these facts, the plaintiff has issued an attachment in execution for $5,000, with interest and costs.”</p>

      <em>Mr. Henry J. </em>Scott, for the appellant:</p>
    <p id="b74-8" data-blocks='[["BL_74.8",74,[259,1810,1167,541]]]'>The plaintiff stands in a peculiar position. It is uncertain whether or not the legacy will ever be paid, and certainly not until after the death of defendant’s two aunts, “ who are both in full life,” as is shown in defendant’s affidavit. Defendant refuses to pay the premiums, and thereby deprives plaintiff of all protection. It was to provide for such a contingency that the bond in suit was taken and executed. Defendant certainly cannot complain of his own default, and of right he should not. It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff ought to be permitted to pursue the only remedy he has, to wit, action upon the bond in suit.</p>
