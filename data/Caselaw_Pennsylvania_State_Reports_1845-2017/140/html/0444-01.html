The auditing judge questioned the soundness of the position, but directed the examination of Mr. Dallam, for the purpose of ascertaining the data from which he had stated the account. The competency of Mr. Dallam as a witness was objected to, on the ground of the interest of his wife in the establishment of the charge; but Mr. Dallam, being examined, testified in substance, in explanation of the account, that he had not obtained the amount of the debit side of the account from any inventory filed by Philip H. Law, or from any books or memoranda, but he had heard Sallie H. Law assert in the presence of Philip H. Law, who did not dissent, that in the inventory of John Kelty Law’s estate, filed by her and Philip II. Law twenty-two years before, the estate was estimated at $62,171.34; that Sallie H. Law in her will stated that the whole of said estate had been transferred to her, and that she frequently asserted in the presence of Philip H. Law, who did not dissent, that her estate was in his possession as her agent. Mr. Dallam testified, further, that prior to his death Philip H. Law admitted to him that the estate of Sallie H.

His main difficulty is that the clients whom he represents are neither legatees, distributees, nor creditors of Sallie H. Law’s estate, the account of whose executor was before the court below. That they have no standing, therefore, to contest the account, is a principle so well settled that a discussion of the authorities is unnecessary. It is sufficient to refer to McBride’s App., <a href="/pa/72/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="72 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="434653" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0480-01">72 Pa. 480</a>; Braman’s App., <a href="/pa/89/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="89 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1063263" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0078-01">89 Pa. 78</a>; Winton’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=111%20Pa.%20389" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="111 Pa. 389">111 Pa. 389</a>; High’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="136 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="820028" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0222-01">136 Pa. 222</a>. It may be, as contended by the appellants, that they will be collaterally affected by the decree in this estate, but there is no rule of law which entitles a person to be heard in, or become a party to, a judicial proceeding for such a reason. Nor are the appellants wholly without remedy. As they are not parties to the distribution of Sallie H. Law’s estate, they may not be bound by the decree therein, provided they can show hereafter that said decree was procured by fraud or collusion. And slight evidence might perhaps be sufficient, in view of the administrator’s position, to shift the burden of proof. We express no opinion upon the merits of the case.</p>
