In this case, the trust is to pay the income to W. Howard Brooks during his life, and after his death, the principal goes to his heirs in such parts and shares, and in such a way and manner as he, by his last will and testament, shall appoint, and in default of such appointment, to his heirs under the intestate laws, so that his estate vests absolutely in the heirs of the tenant for life immediately upon his death; there is, therefore, no violation of the rule in this case.</p>

Howard Brooks took an absolute estate in the residuary estate, it is sufficient to state that the bequest is not to him and his heirs, but to trustees to pay him the income during his life, and then the principal to go to his heirs. There is no coalescing of the life-estate and the fee, but two separate and distinct estates, one equitable, the other legal. The auditing judge is of the opinion that the trust, by the residuary clause, is a valid one, and that the residuary clause is a valid one; and the residuary estate will therefore be awarded to the accountants, to be held by them for the uses and purposes therein declared.</p>

The direction to hold the residuary estate in abeyance, until the death of the husband, was manifestly intended to be restricted to the case of the failure of the husband to give preferences to his daughters while he lived; and, if this were not so, as accumulation, after the son had become exclusively entitled, would be purposeless and contrary to the statute, the provision for it would be stricken out without affecting the validity of the trust for protection from his creditors: Brown v.
