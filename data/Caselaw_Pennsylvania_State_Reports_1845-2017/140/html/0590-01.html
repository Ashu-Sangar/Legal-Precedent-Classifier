The plaintiff is the second administrator of the decedent, James Stoever having-been the first, and the letters to him- having been revoked. While James’s letters were in force, however, he released the claim in suit, and upon the trial this release was relied upon. The plaintiff alleged it to be a fraud upon the estate, but we thought this question could not be raised in the pending suit, because James Stoever was not a party thereto and therefore could not be heard in reply to so serious a charge. As the release could not be attacked, we directed a verdict for the defendant, and then, upon the plaintiff undertaking to file a bill in equity to set aside the release, also directed the entry of a motion for a new trial, thus suspending judgment. At the time, we supposed this to be agreeable to both parties; the notes of trial show no objection, but we may have been mistaken.</p>

If the release ought to be set aside, the plaintiff ought not afterwards to be met by a judgment in a former suit for the same cause of action, and thus be barred of recovery. On the other hand, if the allegation of fraud should not be made out, the motion would be refused, and the defendant would then have his judgment without another trial, meanwhile having the advantage of the verdict. The bill has been filed, and the parties can <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>have a speedy decision if they so desire.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a> For the present, therefore, we think fairness and justice require us to refuse this motion.

His obvious course was to call a witness for that purpose, and if his evidence was objected to and excluded, to take an exception to the ruling of the court. This was not done. The plaintiff appears to have rested upon the opinion of the court that the release could not be attacked, yet took no exception thereto. Nor does an exception appear to <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>have been taken to anything; not even to the order of the court directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>

Several months afterward a motion was made by defendant’s counsel for judgment upon the verdict, and one of the reasons was that the plaintiff had filed no reasons for a new trial. This motion was denied September 29, 1887. On. December 7, 1888, a new trial was refused, and judgment entered upon the verdict. It would thus appear from the record that the plaintiff had every opportunity to obtain a new trial. Instead of availing himself of it, he brings the case here without an exception to any ruling of the court.</p>
