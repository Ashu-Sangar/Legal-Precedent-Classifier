T., 1910, by Louis Streuber and R. A. Cartwright, from decree of C. P. Elk Co., April T., 1909, No. 1, refusing the petition of Louis Streuber and R. A. Cartwright to intervene as plaintiffs in the case of Fred Koehler et al. v. St. Mary\u2019s Brewing Company et al.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for permission to intervene in a class bill of minority stockholders. Before Orvis, P. J., specially presiding.\nThe original bill was filed February 26, 1909, by certain minority stockholders of the St. Mary\u2019s Brewing Company against that company and ffm. Kaul et al. and majority stockholders to restrain the corporation from selling and conveying to the Elk County Brewing Company its property and franchises illegally for less than a fair value.\nOn June 21, 1909, the petition of Louis Streuber and R. A. Cartwright to intervene as party plaintiffs was filed and dismissed by the court in the following opinion by Orvis, P. J., specially presiding:\nAnd now, to wit, November 6, 1909, petition read and considered, it appearing to the court that the petitioners had notice of the corporate action on February 27, 1909, as well as due notice of said intended action two months prior thereto, without resorting to any proceedings in law, equity or otherwise to prevent same, or had notice or should have had notice of the present bill having been filed and pending in the common pleas of Elk county, they are certainly guilty of not acting with promptness and have not shown reasons otherwise why their prayer should be granted. The prayer of the petitioners is therefore refused.\nJuly 1, 1910:\nError assigned was decree dismissing petition.\nAlexander Simpson, Jr., with him Paul Benson, J. A. Gleason, Louis Rosenzweig, Gunnison, Rilling & Fish, and Fred II. Ely, for appellants,\ncited: Wheelock v. Church, 119 Cal. 477 (51 Pac. Repr. 841); Nicrosi v. Calera Land Co., 115 Ala. 429 (22 So.
