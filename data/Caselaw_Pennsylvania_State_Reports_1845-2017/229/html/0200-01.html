Apparently. Levis owned them when the agreement was made under which Shreve was to take title and protect all interests. No claim for consideration on account of these judgments was then made. Whether Braddock gave anything substantial for them does not appear, but certain it is, in so far as the evidence discloses, he never made any claim to anyone that the judgments were substantially valuable, that they covered land outside of the mortgage, and were desirable as a means of securing title thereto, until at the hearing of this case he ascribed such virtue to these judgments as a justification for having diverted to himself more than half of the consideration named in a contract of sale of the title held by Shreve. Shreve certainly never understood that there was any pretense on Braddock’s part that through his judgments he controlled valuable, independent territory, shutting Shreve’s title off from the <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>water. Shreve was constantly in communication with Braddock relative to the seashore property, had full opportunity to know what his interests were there, and according to his testimony, the only property or interests .that Braddock had, or spoke of having, were so-called hotel property and lots, wholly apart of any of the real estate here involved. After Shreve acquired title pursuant to the agreement referred to, he made earnest and continuous efforts to sell the property, urging Braddock and others to assist him. He incurred expenses in endeavoring to make sale, paid taxes, etc., and no revenues arose from the property. Braddock viewed himself as an agent of Shreve to make sale of the property, he so testified: “I considered myself his agent to sell his interests in the property. I have a number of letters to that effect.” “Q. Had Mr. Shreve authorized you at any time to sell his property as his agent? A. Oh, a number of times, yes; over ten years he had authorized me to sell it. Q. Did you tell him you sold it as his agent? A. No, I think not. Q. And for 133,000? A. I was buying the property then, the moment he signed that agreement he sold it to me, I was no longer his agent. I was acting for myself.” Having recently received a letter from Shreve; under date April 24, 1906, authorizing him to make a sale upon specified terms, and to secure the execution of an agreement, late in April of 1906, Braddock. came in contact with Joseph Taylor, one of the defendants, and representing himself as Shreve’s agent sought to have him purchase. Braddock, Taylor, and his counsel, Darnell, visited the property, looked it over, and on April 30, 1906, met at Darnell’s office, the contract of sale was written, was executed by Braddock as agent from Shreve, by Taylor as purchaser and was also signed by Braddock individually, he having stipulated in the contract, that he would remove or assign any judgment or incumbrance he might have against the property. As already stated, ■ we are unable to determine positively whether Braddock’s judgments had any value, but we are clear that his conduct <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>was wholly inconsistent with their possessing substantial value, with their being liens on property outside of that held by Shreve; and we are satisfied that there was no thought on anyone’s part that through these judgments Taylor was to acquire any land. Braddock does not claim that either when viewing the property or later when the agreement was made, he suggested anything of this kind; he, as agent for Shreve, is the only party vendor named, Shreve’s title as derived from the special master in chancery, is the only thing sold, and the $33,000 purchase money is an entire, indivisible consideration for that title. Even if the judgments had value, they figured in the agreement simply because Darnell viewed them as a cloud on the property Shreve was selling, and Braddock was willing to give them up in order to effectuate the sale of the Shreve title. Braddock was vitally interested in the sale being consummated, not only on account of commissions which he could well have demanded, but also as the owner of bonds secured by the second mortgage, and of certain lots, etc., that might become marketable through the sale of the Shreve land. In no aspect of the case could Braddock be viewed as entitled to any part of the $33,000 consideration on account of his judgments; if possible, his claim to part of the $33,000 is made more preposterous by the magnitude of the share claimed. Though according to his own contention his judgments covered only about 150 acres and Shreve’s title covered some 800, part of which, at least, extended to the water, he sought to justify the diversion to himself of more than half of the $33,000.</p>

      <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>On May 5, 1906, Taylor, through his counsel Darnell, paid the $1,000 provided for in the contract, by two checks, one to the order of Shreve for $750, and the other to the order of Isaac A. Braddock for $250. The Shreve check was certified by the bank on which it‘ was drawn, on May 7,1906, and was delivered by Braddock to Shreve, on that day, on account of a contract then entered into between them, whereby Shreve agreed to convey the lands held by him to Braddock, on or before July 30, 1906, for $15,000, of which sum $750 was to be paid in cash on the execution of the agreement, $4,250 in cash on July 30, 1906, together with a purchase money bond and mortgage for the balance. This was the first and only contract of sale between Shreve and Braddock, disclosed by the evidence. While Braddock does in answering to leading questions of his counsel, say that he contracted to buy the property before he made, as Shreve’s agent, the sale to Taylor, such is clearly not the fact. He testifies positively that his alleged prior contract of purchase is to be found in certain letters of Shreve written to him, two in January and one on April 24, 1906. On inspection it is seen that none of these letters exhibit a contract, and the last one, April 24, 1906, written only five days before he as agent for Shreve, contracted to sell to Taylor, wholly negatives the existence of a contract of sale to Braddock or to anyone else, for it urges Braddock to find a purchaser and to have him sign a contract. Indeed, Braddock testifies that pursuant to this letter of April 24, 1906, he became active and consummated the sale to Taylor a few days later. Moreover, Braddock’s testimony relative to what he told Shreve, concerning the Taylor contract, on May 7, 1906, when he secured an agreement of sale to himself at $15,000, contains an admission that then for the first time he became a purchaser, that until then he had been Shreve’s agent to make a sale. “Q. Did you tell him you sold it as his agent? A. No, I think not. Q. And for $33,000? A. I was buying the property then, the moment he signed that agreement, he sold it to me, <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>and I was no longer his agent. I was acting for myself. Q. Before he signed it, you were representing yourself as his agent? A. I was his agent to sell his property. Q. Before you got home to execute an agreement in your favor did you tell him you had already sold it for him as his agent, and received down money, for $33,000? A. I do not remember telling him anything of the kind, I do not think I did.”</p>

J. At this meeting we are constrained to find from the strong preponderance of the evidence, that it was clearly and distinctly announced to Shreve that Taylor had contracted with him through Braddock, acting as his agent, to buy the property held by him, Shreve, and had agreed to pay therefor $33,000, that a mortgage in Shreve’s favor for $27,000 as provided by the contract, would forthwith be executed by Taylor, and that Taylor was prepared to pay the full consideration of $33,000. Darnell testifies to all of this and Taylor to part of it, and starting out with the uncontroverted facts that Taylor had a contract for the purchase of the property which he was very anxious to have carried out, that he and Darnell knew no one as the vendor but Shreve, and in going to his office to meet him, could have been actuated by no other thought than that they must there deal with him, how can it be doubted that, as they say, the $27,000 mortgage, and the deed, <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>were presented to Shreve, and that he did not receive $33,000 for the property simply because he inexcusably failed for some reason to appreciate his opportunity, turned it off without any consideration, and insisted on putting through his $15,000 contract with Braddock.</p>

The fact that Taylor did substantially pay this sum, leaves little room for doubting that he was fully determined to pay it, and made the fact known as he and Darnell testify. Braddock testifies that he took no part in the discussion, heard nothing of what transpired, that he left all to Shreve and Darnell, that Shreve told him to execute an assignment to Taylor, of his, Braddock’s, $15,0.00 contract. Darnell testifies that when the $27,000 mortgage and the deed were handed to Shreve, and he refused to accept the mortgage and execute the deed because, as he stated, the amount of the mortgage was too large, he, Darnell, was much surprised, and produced the $33,000 contract to Shreve who, thereupon, refused to consider it and insisted on consummating his $15,000 contract with Braddock.</p>

As weakening the force of Shreve’s denial and indicating that his mind was so wholly engrossed by his $15,000 contract with Braddock that he was unable to contemplate or consider any other contract or any other figure than $15,000 is his testimony on page 33 of the transcript of his testimony: “Q. Give the date? A. Thirtieth of July, 1906. Q. Was the first you met Mr. Taylor? A. That was the first time I met Mr. Taylor. Prior to that the deed which was to be drawn up, had been submitted to me. I think I had it out here. I sent that back again. I went there fully prepared to carry out the whole transaction. When I got there, I looked over the deed, and it was all right. The deed was for the consideration of $15,000, and it was all perfectly right in every respect as far as I observe.” Clearly he must be mistaken in his statement that on July 30 at his office in Camden, he looked over the deed and saw that it was for the consideration of $15,000. Darnell, who drew this deed, prepared it with a view to consummating the $33,000 contract of sale to Taylor. There is no reason to believe that he had any knowledge of a $15,000 sale, and, therefore, obviously the deed did not state a consideration of $15,000 as Shreve testifies. All of the proof is to the effect that the deed presented to Shreve on July 30, 1906, is the one that was used by him in making title to Taylor, and the consideration therein stated is not $15,000, but is “one dollar and other valuable considerations.” Shreve is positive that he executed the deed on July 30, and not on August 2, as indicated by the deed, because he is sure that he was not in Camden on the latter date. It is quite clear, however, that the deed was not executed in Camden, but out where Shreve was living in Pennsylvania.</p>

Certain cash payments were made to Braddock in addition to money he had already received, and on August 12, 1906, a mortgage was executed and delivered to him by Taylor for $12,052.78 and Taylor fully met and satisfied his obligation to pay $33,000 consideration, in cash paid, and the two mortgages given to Shreve and Braddock respectively. Subsequently Taylor conveyed the property to the Sea Haven Improvement Company, which company made conveyance to the St. Albans Realty Company, the latter executing to the Sea Haven Improvement Company a mortgage for $95,000 to secure a part of the purchase money. To make this mortgage a first lien, Braddock satisfied his mortgage given by Taylor, upon which $2,500 were still due, and to secure the payment thereof, took an assignment of the $95,000 mortgage as collateral.</p>

He had no knowledge of the sale to Taylor for $33,000 until early in 1909, when the information was incidentally given him by Darnell. After deducting costs, expenses, fees, taxes, etc., from the $15,000 received, a balance of $3,029.69 remained, which Shreve paid to the plaintiff, there being due at the time, March 18, 1908, to the Keinath estate, $5,188.58, with interest from September 12, 1896, on the first mortgage and principal and interest on fourteen $100 bonds secured by the second mortgage.</p>

The bill was filed against five defendants, two of whom, Shreve and Braddock, were treated as principals both in the averments of the bill and in the prayers for relief, and the other three were included because connected with the transaction about which complaint is made. The bill was dismissed as to all the defendants except Shreve upon whose shoulders the whole burden was cast without even extending relief to the extent of the unpaid purchase money, which, it is conceded, he never received, and to which relief he was clearly entitled if within the power of the court to grant. Braddock was a resident of the state of New Jersey in which was located the land out of which this controversy arose. Shreve, trustee for the bondholders, and as such a principal defendant, was a resident of Chester county, Pennsylvania, at the time'the bill was filed, and being properly served, was within the jurisdiction of the court. Braddock, being a nonresident, was served as authorized and directed by the act of 1859. He caused a general appearance to be entered for him and in his answer set up a general defense upon the merits. The other three defendants voluntarily appeared, accepted service and filed answers. All of the defendants were in some way interested in the property sold, or in the proceeds arising from the sale of it, or as mortgagor or mortgagee, or otherwise. It was a situation calling for the exercise of the equity powers of a court in such manner as to work out equitable and just results between the parties in so far as it could be done under the circumstances. Shreve was the active trustee and the bill was filed against him as such, but Braddock was also charged as being a trustee ex maleficio, and as such with having received moneys for which he had not accounted. As to the conduct of Braddock the court did not inquire and no finding was made as to his being a trustee ex maleficio, although this was <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>one of the principal averments of the bill. In the fifth paragraph of his answer, Braddock sets up that he only assumed to act as agent for Shreve in the agreement with Taylor for the purpose of securing the payment to Shreve as trustee of $15,000, which was the amount the latter had agreed to accept for the land in question, and the balance of the purchase money agreed to be paid by Taylor did not belong to Shreve as trustee, but was due him, Braddock, as a party in interest. These were important matters bearing upon the relations and equities existing between Shreve and Braddock and upon their resultant liability to the bondholders or to each other. These things were not considered by the court in any conclusive way because the bill was dismissed as to Braddock and the other three defendants. This led to error in another respect, that is, not to fully consider the terms and conditions upon which the sale for $33,000 was made. Enough appears in the record here presented to show that Shreve only received $15,000 out of the entire purchase money, and that Braddock did not receive nearly all of the remaining $18,000. Whether he paid a commission for making the sale, what became of the money unaccounted for, why he did not receive the entire balance, and how all these things affected the equities and legal liabilities of the principal party or parties were not given that consideration in the determination of the questions involved which the facts warranted and the case demanded. No doubt this was due to the fact that the court did not consider Braddock and the other defendants within its jurisdiction for the purpose of entering a final decree against them or any of them. No one can read this record without being convinced that Shreve was misled, or imposed upon, or misinformed, or that by reason of impaired health and bodily infirmities he failed to exercise that careful diligence he otherwise would have done. While these things may not excuse him for failure to secure the largest price possible for the sale of the trust property, they do appeal <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>to the conscience of a chancellor in determining not only his legal liability, but the equities that may exist between all the parties connected with this transaction. Then, again, it is admitted that at the time of the hearing $2,500 of the original purchase money was unpaid, and if Shreve is to be held for the entire purchase price agreed to be paid by Taylor, he is clearly entitled to have some decree entered by the court in reference to the payment of this unpaid balance as a protection to him. AIL of the parties were before the court, and we can see no reason why these matters should not have been considered and such decree made in reference thereto as to equity and justice doth appertain.</p>

The general rule is that when a court has jurisdiction of the person of a defendant it may render any appropriate decree acting directly upon the person, -although the subject-matter may be without the jurisdiction. When the court has jurisdiction over the subject-matter, or the person of a principal defendant, the rule prevailing generally in judicial proceedings applies to suits in equity. Objections to jurisdiction over the parties are waived by appearing on the merits. An answer to the merits waives an objection contained in the same answer that the defendant is a nonresident: Mutual Aid Association v. Richardson, <a href="/ill-app/38/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="38 Ill. App. 111" data-case-ids="2425493" data-case-paths="/ill-app/38/0111-01">38 Ill. App. 111</a>; Carroll v.

McDonald, <a href="/us/99/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="99 U.S. 298" data-case-ids="3374139" data-case-paths="/us/99/0298-01">99 U. S. 298</a>, it was held that where the necessary parties are before a court of equity it is immaterial that the res of the controversy, whether it be real or personal property, is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the tribunal. It has the power to compel the parties to do those things necessary to give effect to the decree entered against them. Without regard to the situation of the subject-matter courts consider the equities between the parties, and decree in personam according to <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>those equities and enforce obedience to their decree by-process in personam. <em>For </em>a very interesting and exhaustive discussion of this question see our late case of Schmaltz v. York Mfg. Co., <a href="/pa/204/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="204 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="927529" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0001-01">204 Pa. 1</a>. The appellant was a trustee, the bill charged Braddock with being a trustee ex maleficio, the subject-matter of the controversy was a trust estate, and the principal defendant lived in Chester county where the court had the power to compel an accounting. When the parties all appeared either voluntarily or by service regularly made or as directed by the court under the act of 1859, and entered a general appearance, filing answers on the merits, they were within the jurisdiction of the court for every purpose of the case and should have been so treated. For these reasons we think the record should be remitted so that the court and the parties may have the opportunity of considering all questions that have been or may be raised under the pleadings affecting all the parties to the controversy.</p>
