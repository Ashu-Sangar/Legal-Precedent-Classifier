Prior to March, 1907, the township assessor returned a valuation of the lands to the county commissioners which was very largely in excess of the valuation for 1906. The valuation so returned to the commissioners was revised and reduced by them sitting as a board of revision on June 25, 1907. From this valuation plaintiff appealed to the common pleas, which finally adjudicated the valuation in December, 1907 at $330 per acre, or $248,820 in all. On the first Monday of March, 1907, the township supervisors met and fixed the rate for road tax at eight mills for that year. At that time there was no “adjusted valuation” for 1907. On May 31, 1907, an agent of plaintiff tendered to the tax collector the sum of $156.20, being the amount of the road tax for 1907, at the rate of eight mills on the valuation for 1906. The tender was refused because, as the collector said, he had no duplicate and was without authority to receive the tax. In the early part of January, 1908, the tax collector gave the plaintiff company notice to pay taxes based upon the 1907 valuation, the sum claimed being $2,091.14, and within a few days plaintiff paid to the collector $1,722.56, being the amount claimed in the notice, less certain deductions which the plaintiff alleged should be made. Shortly after this, plaintiff demanded the refunding of all over $156.20, the amount due on the valuation for 1906. This was refused and the collector demanded the balance, $368.58; whereupon, in February, 1908, this bill was filed. An answer and replication were filed and the case was referred by agreement to a referee who recommended a decree enjoining the collection of the balance of $368.58 and directing payment to the plaintiff by defendants of $1,566.36, the difference between the amount paid by plaintiff and $156.20, the amount due on the 1906 valuation. A final decree in accordance with the referee’s report was entered by the court below. The defendants have appealed.</p>

This question is settled by a long line of decisions in this state and, hence, we are not required to treat or consider it as one of first impression. C. P. Dyer, the vice president of the plaintiff company and authorized to act for it in the matter, directed the payment to be made by the proper officer of the company. While testifying at length in the case, the facts found by the learned referee and the court below being based upon his testimony, he does not even suggest that any official of the defendant township at any time ever threatened to resort to legal process for the collection of the taxes, or exacted them by duress, or went beyond making a demand for their payment, or did any act by which the plaintiff was misled. Neither does it appear by the evidence nor is it claimed by Mr. Dyer or any other representative of the plaintiff company that it made the payment under protest or with notice <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>of an intention to reclaim any part of the sum paid. The case is entirely barren of any such facts, and it is, therefore, clear that under the settled law of this state the payment was voluntary and not such as to justify the plaintiff in demanding the repayment of the money.</p>

He entered and improved the land which was subsequently recovered by the donee. While in possession, the plaintiff paid the taxes assessed against the land, and after he was ousted, he brought an action to recover the amount paid by him on a void assessment, the land being exempt from taxes. The court entered judgment on a case stated for the county. Gibson, C. J., in affirming the judgment said: “A single fact in the cause turns the scale against the plaintiff — the payment was voluntary. The cases agree that a party who has paid an unfounded demand without constraint, cannot recover it back: it was his folly to part with his money, and he must submit to lose it. . . . The taxes were assessed and the plaintiff paid them, .... without objection, when the collector called on him, and without warning to the county that the money would be reclaimed. There could not be a more bald case of voluntary payment. His course was to appeal from the assessor to the county commissioners, and, if they would not exonerate him, stand a distress and sale, for which he would infallibly have recovered by action of trespass. . . . Independently of that (a proper contribution to the public treasury), however, a sufficient answer to his action is the fact that he made it without compulsion.”</p>

It cannot be allowed. The case is very different from that of payment to an individual by mistake. It was submission to legitimate authority which was prima facie right in its exercise. The taxing officers performed their duty as well as they knew how, and the tax was submitted to by one who was interested in the purposes for which it was raised, though it might have been resisted in legal form. This was an assent to pay more in support of the government of the town than the town had a right to demand, and the law does not imply the duty of refunding. If it had been paid under protest, that is, with notice that he would claim it back, this would repel the implication of an assent, and give rise to the right of reclamation. In another aspect it is unlike to a payment to an individual. It is a contribution to a common fund, in the benefits of which he, as a citizen or property-holder, participates. It is intended for immediate expenditure for the common good, and it would be unjust to require its repayment, after it has been thus, in whole or in part, properly expended, which would often be the case if suit could be brought for its recovery without notice having been given at the time of payment; and there would be no bar against its insidious spring but the statute of limitations.

In affirming a judgment for the defendant, this court, by Lowrie, J., said (p. 74): “If the case of the Borough of Allentown v. Saeger was decided upon a proper principle, then the judgment .... is very plainly right. In that case the taxing officers had no authority at all for imposing the tax complained of, and, as it was paid without objection, <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>it was presumed to have been expended for public purposes, and held to be irrevocable from the district whose officers imposed it. In the present case, .... the plaintiff seeks to recover back the taxes voluntarily paid by him. We state the case as one of a voluntary payment of taxes, because there is no pretense that the defendant’s officers did any more than demand the tax under a supposed authority of law; and this is no more a compulsion than when an individual demands a supposed right. The threat that is supposed to underlie such demands is a legally harmless one; that, in case of refusal, the appropriate legal remedies will be resorted to.”</p>

He then testifies as follows: “Q. What policy did your company adopt in 1907 with respect to the payment of its road tax for that year? A. We had decided to contest the collection of any taxes based on any valuation other than 1906, but based on the 1907 rate. Q. Do you remember when your company determined on that policy? A. Prior to May 31, 1907.” He next testifies that early in January, 1908, “we received a notice .... calling on us to pay taxes based on the 1907 valuation, and it being early in the quarter and a great deal of that sort of stuff before us, I personally passed the bill over to the accounting department to pay according to the treasurer’s notice, subject to some minor deductions which we thought were proper, and the amount was paid in that shape early in January, 1908. I think January 6th. . . . We discovered along shortly after that that we had acted contrary to the company’s determined policy in the matter and called on the supervisors’ treasurer .... for a refunding of the amount paid, excepting the amount based on the 1906 valuation and the 1907 rate of taxation. . . . Q. About how long after that (the payment) was it that you discovered the mistake? A. I think before the first of February.” He says he was probably passing about forty or fifty matters the morning he passed the tax bill. “Q. Had you at that time any recollection that this was or was not the saíne amount that had been tendered by your company on May 31st previous? A. The only way that I'can account for that was that all of our taxes in Fairfield township were included in one notice, and the thought of it which was called to my attention was the <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>chance to escape the penalty. The main factor in the case which we had determined on in the year escaped my attention. Q.

No, sir.” A letter written by Mr. Dyer for his company, dated January 11, 1908, shows that at that time the company had no intention of contesting the amount of road taxes on the ground taken in the present suit.</p>

In this case, however, we think that the evidence wholly fails to sustain his conclusion. Mr. Dyer was the vice president of the company and acted for it in this matter. As appears by his testimony, he was informed of every step taken in regard to the assessment, the fixing of the rate, and the payment of the tax. He appeared before the county commissioners in June, 1907, and asked that the company’s assessment made by the assessor be reduced. He received notice of the reduction from $500, the assessor’s valuation, to $400 per acre made by the commissioners, and subsequently was notified of the reduction to $330 per acre made by the common pleas. He was fully advised of the 1906 valuation and instructed the proper officer to make a tender on May 31, 1907, of the amount of road taxes due under that valuation. He further knew that the company had prior to May 31, 1907, declared its “policy” to contest the collection of any taxes based on any valuation other than that of 1906. It is, therefore, manifest from his own testimony that Dyer knew the 1906 valuation and the millage fixed for 1907 by the supervisors, and hence was fully advised at the time he paid the taxes <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>and for several months prior thereto that $156.20, and not $2,091.14, was the amount legally due from the company for the taxes of 1907. In fact, he does not testify nor can any inference be drawn from any part of his testimony that in January, 1908, when he paid the taxes he was ignorant of any fact which would enable him to determine the amount of road taxes for 1907, legally due from and payable by the plaintiff company. Hence, there is no ground for the plaintiff company’s contention, or the finding of the referee, that the payment of the taxes was made in ignorance of its rights and the facts with relation to the assessment of the road taxes.</p>

He does not so testify, and the facts disclosed by his testimony do not warrant any such conclusion. It will be observed that the amount of taxes due on the 1907 valuation was $2,091.14, while the taxes due on the 1906 valuation was $156.20.

There might be some excuse for his failure of recollection as to these matters if all the steps taken in regard to the levy and assessment of the taxes prior to the payment had been attended to by another representative of the company, but as appears by his own testimony, he was the sole agent and representative of the company throughout the tax proceedings, directed the tender of the amount of taxes to be made in May, 1907, and hence knew the <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>legal amount of taxes due from the company at least seven months prior to the payment made in January, 1908.</p>

He testifies that when he received notice from the township treasurer to pay the taxes based on the 1907 valuation he personally passed the bill over to the accounting department to pay according to the treasurer’s notice, and that “we discovered along shortly*after that that we had acted contrary to the company’s determined policy in the matter and called on the supervisors’ treasurer .... for a refunding of the amount paid excepting the amount based on the 1906 valuation.” It will be observed, therefore, that he does not say that the payment was made in ignorance or for want of recollection of the 1906 assessment or the amount of taxes due on said assessment and tendered at his direction to the collector, but that in making the payment he had acted contrary to the company’s determined “policy” in the matter, and for that reason demanded the repayment of the amount. Had the learned referee and the court below critically examined Dyer’s testimony they would have discovered that it utterly failed to support their finding that the payment was made in ignorance or mistake of any material fact which entitled the plaintiff to have the money refunded. It is . wholly immaterial whether Dyer at the time he made the payment remembered the determined “policy” of his company or not, or what that “policy” was. That is not a material fact the ignorance or want of recollection of which can be made the basis for refunding the money paid. Hence, Dyer’s testimony does not disclose his ignorance or mistake or want of recollection of any fact which would warrant the company in demanding the repayment of the taxes.</p>

      <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>How or by whom the “policy” of the company in regard to the payment of the road taxes for 1907 was determined does not appear by Mr. Dyer’s testimony. Being the vice president of the company and its representative in looking after the company’s assessments and payment of taxes, it may reasonably be inferred that the “policy” of the company was determined by Mr. Dyer. If he could determine its “policy” in the first instance, he could change it, and the presumption is that in paying the taxes on the 1907 valuation with a knowledge of the facts that he intended to change it. This intention is confirmed by his letter of January 11, 1908, in which he protests against paying a penalty on the road taxes for the reasons he states, but in no way indicating that he intended to contest the defendants’ claim for the road tax under the 1907 valuation. The evidence discloses that Mr. Dyer gave intelligent and prompt attention to his duties in regard to the levy and assessment of these taxes from the time he appealed to the commissioners until he invoked the assistance of the court to reduce the valuation, and it is, therefore, incredible that in paying the taxes it was not with a full knowledge and recollection of every material fact in the transaction.</p>
    <p id="b405-3" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[264,1584,1150,529]]]'>If, however, the taxes were paid by reason of Dyer’s negligence or inadvertence, it is no ground for relief. This is the settled rule, and Dyer’s conduct, as appears by his own testimony, amounted to nothing more. Mistake as a basis for refunding taxes is a misapprehension or misunderstanding arising from ignorance, an essential prerequisite, and is distinguished from that inattention or absence of thought which are inherent in negligence, and is not such as results from inadvertence or negligence: 2 Pomeroy’s Eq. Jur. (2d ed.), sec. 839.</p>

The plaintiff, therefore, has no right to have refunded the money which it paid on account of the taxes, and that part of the decree of the court below awarding its repayment must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b406-4" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[270,607,1162,1226]]]'>While we have passed on the merits of the plaintiff’s claim, we are of the opinion that equity has no jurisdiction to compel the refunding of the money. The right of the plaintiff to maintain the bill for that purpose is not supported by Frick Coke Co. v. Mount Pleasant Twp., <a href="/pa/222/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="222 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="959409" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0451-01">222 Pa. 451</a>. The question was not in that case. We held there, as we do here, that under the facts of the case equity will enjoin the collection of a road tax levied on a wrong valuation. We did not hold that it would compel the refunding of the tax if it had been paid. Here, the bill was filed, inter alia, to compel the repayment of the amount inadvertently and by mistake paid by the plaintiff company in excess of what was legally due and owing by it. The fact that it prayed for an accounting did not give the court jurisdiction to compel the refunding of the taxes erroneously paid. The decree does not direct an accounting, and none was necessary. The items were all on one side of the account. There was no relation of trust or agency alleged. Under these circumstances the remedy at law to compel the repayment of the taxes was entirely adequate: Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Mahaffey, <a href="/pa/227/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="227 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1008568" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0048-01">227 Pa. 48</a>; Sprigg v. Com.

It is contended, however, that as the bill would lie for an accounting, equity would thereby acquire jurisdiction, and it might decide all matters incidentally connected with the case so as to make a final determination of the subject. But we held in Graeff v. Felix, <a href="/pa/200/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="200 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="924324" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0137-01">200 Pa. 137</a>, that this rule does not apply to a case where only some incidental matter..is of equitable cognizance, and it is sought to draw in a main subject of <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>controversy which has a distinct and appropriate legal remedy of its own. An accounting was clearly an incidental matter and of no importance in the case. The principal subject in controversy, aside from the right to enjoin the collection of the remainder of the tax alleged to be due, was the right to recover the taxes which had been erroneously paid. There being a complete and adequate remedy at law to compel the defendant to refund the taxes, it is clear that equity had no jurisdiction. There is nothing in the bill which confers jurisdiction on equity to direct the repayment of the taxes.</p>

As thus modified, the decree is affirmed.</p>
