In a proceeding brought to recover compensation for land appropriated by a railroad company the action of the trial judge in submitting to the jury under proper instructions the right of the plaintiff to compensation for delay will not be reversed on appeal where it appears that the railroad company took actual possession of the land in 1903 and enjoyed it for that time on, that at the trial the highest value claimed by the plaintiff was $12.00 a square foot and the jury was not asked for a verdict of more than $9.00 a square foot; that the defendant in its plea declared the land to be of a value of only $1.00 per square foot and gave testimony of a value of less than $3.00 a square foot; that the jury rendered a verdict of $7.00 per square foot and that all of the seven years’ delay, excepting two months, occurred subsequent to appeals by both parties from the award of the viewers.</p>

The ball club case was an instance of a change of grade. A claim for $85,000 was “sought to be supported by theories and testimony of an illegitimate character,” and a verdict obtained for $29,000 was reversed. On a new trial “other theories and testimony were set up in support of a demand for $62,000, quite as indefensible and unreasonable as the demand in the first trial,” and a verdict for $39,000 was cut by the court below to $30,000. But the trial judge had instructed the jury, “You must add to the damages which the plaintiff has suffered reasonable compensation for the detention of those damages.” We said it was manifest that “the oppressive and unreasonable demands of the plaintiff” caused the delay, and reversed, holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to any damages on that score. The Stevenson case was an action of trespass to recover damages for the pollution of a stream with coal dirt, and this court characterized the plaintiff’s claim as “extortionate, unconscionable and incredible.”</p>

At the trial the highest value claimed by the plaintiff was $12.00 a square foot, and the court below states in its opinion refusing a new trial that the jury were not asked for a verdict of more thaii $9.00 a square foot. The defendant in its plea declared the land only to be of a value of $1.00 per square foot, and gave testimony of a value of less than $3.00 a square foot. The jury rendered a verdict of $7.00 a square foot. Both parties appealed from the award of the viewers and all of the seven years’ delay, excepting two months, occurred subsequent to these appeals. In his instructions to the jury the trial judge said: “It is for you to say in the exercise of your sound discretion whether the parties are entitled to compensation for delay in receiving their money. That amount you may give or you may not, just as you conclude .... remembering that as a general principle where there has been delay which is not the fault of the plaintiff, and he has been kept out of his money, for the time lost the jury could give compensation by way of damages. But on the other hand, if it is the plaintiff’s fault and the plaintiff’s own conduct caused the delay, there can be no compensation by way of damages. . . . When you have fixed the market value at so much a foot, compare that with Mr. Rea’s price, and if you are fairly of the opinion and come to a fair and honest conclusion that the difference between the price you fix and the valuation placed by Mr. Rea was so great that you would say that it was an extortionate demand, that it was an inordinate demand, so that the officers of the railroad company were justified in contesting .... then it would be your duty, and I so instruct you, to refuse to give any damages for delay in payment. . . .” And after referring to the testimony, the charge continued: “But if ... . this was merely an honest difference of opinion .... you could give compensation for delay.” These instructions are practically in accord with those approved by us in the case of James v.

It could not be said by the trial judge that the delay was due entirely to the size of the demands made by the claimants. The record shows no offer of settlement at any figure, nor do we find any indication therein that reasonably lower demands would have met with payment. The court left the question squarely and fairly to the jury, and we cannot say that there was any error in so doing. In addition to this, the court could not have affirmed the request covered by the first assignment of error, for it states that Henry B. Rea testified before the viewers that the market value of'the property was $15.00 a square foot. As pointed out by the trial judge in his charge, Mr. Rea denied this fact, claiming that he had merely said, “it was worth that to us.” The assignment is overruled.</p>

The defendant made practically the same offer in its case in chief, and this was refused. These rulings are assigned for error. The offers as a whole were properly refused.

In the examination of witnesses counsel for the plaintiff called attention to the fact that this sale was the nearest in locality to the plaintiff’s property, and he examined the owner of this Klondike property with great particularity concerning the sale. Both counsel for plaintiff and defendant interrogated witnesses regarding the value of the buildings as distinguished from the value of the property as a whole, and in this way they derived the square foot value of the land. Plaintiff’s witnesses fixed the value of the improvements at a comparatively low figure, which of course proportionately increased the value of the lot. The defendant’s offer to prove the fair value of the buildings at the time of the sale was rejected, and counsel contends that had this testimony been admitted it would have shown the improvements to have been worth at least double the value placed on them by certain of the plaintiff’s witnesses; which well might have materially affected the value of the opinion expressed by these witnesses. On this state of facts we are of opinion that the testimony should have been received. The fourth assignment of error is sustained.</p>

To enter upon a discussion of those which question the competency of certain of the witnesses called by the plaintiff to prove value would unduly extend this opinion. The competency of at least six of the witnesses called for that purpose is not questioned in the assignments, and presumably their testimony would have been sufficient to take the case to the jury. But as the case must go back for another trial we take occasion to say that although “the market value of <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>land is not a question of science and skill upon which only an expert can give an opinion,” Penna. &amp; N. Y. R. R. &amp; Canal Co. v. Bunnell, <a href="/pa/81/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="81 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="1044146" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0414-01">81 Pa. 414</a>; yet in each case the trial judge should see to it that every witness called to prove value has a proper foundation of knowledge to make his opinion of some real worth, before admitting it as evidence: Friday v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/204/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="204 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="927480" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0405-01">204 Pa. 405</a>. In large cities “neighborhood” is a relative term, and the field which a witness may take into consideration in forming an opinion of the selling price of land in the vicinity of a particular property, should not only be reasonably adjacent thereto, but it should be of the same general character as the immediate locality in which such property is situated; otherwise the opinion is of little value.</p>
