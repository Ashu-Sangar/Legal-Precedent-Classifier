Either party may appeal .... and the court shall .... have power to increase or <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>lower such appraisement;” sec. 4, “After such value is finally determined, the municipality is authorized to buy such water plant at the valuation so fixed; and the corporation owning same, shall, within ten days’ notice of such determination, file a paper indicating its consent and election to sell and convey its plant at the valuation fixed; and, in default hereof, such corporation shall cease to have any exclusive privilege of supplying such municipality or the citizens thereof with water.”</p>

R. R. Co. v. Phila. County, 220 Pa. TOO. When the stockholders of the water company invested their money they did so with the knowledge that should the borough desire to purchase the company’s property they would certainly get the price fixed in their act of incorporation; and it is beyond the power of the legislature to take this right from them in such a manner as attempted by the act of 1907, the terms of which have a manifest tendency to work injustice to the corporators.</p>
