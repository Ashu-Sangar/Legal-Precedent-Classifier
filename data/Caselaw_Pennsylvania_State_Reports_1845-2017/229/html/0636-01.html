The deed of Mrs. Schenley to the plaintiff, which bears date March 15, 1894, was a deed of gift, and in the description of the property conveyed uses very accurate language in reference to the streets and avenues bounding the property, recognizing Penn avenue, First street, Third street and Fort street as existing streets, while as to O’Hara avenue the language is different, but quite as accurate and specific: “On the southerly side of O’Hara <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>avenue as at present located by the City of Pittsburg, of a width of sixty feet, but not yet opened.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[202,459,1154,530]]]'>Attention also is called to the significant language used by Mrs. Schenley in the reservation in this deed to plaintiff. She reserves to herself the exclusive right to represent Fort street and Point alley in proceedings to vacate them, because they were at the time existing, opened streets; while as to O’Hara avenue, she reserves the exclusive right to represent the land in all proceedings looking to the opening of O’Hara avenue. There was nothing to vacate as to O’Hara avenue; hence the appropriateness of the language.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b671-6" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[196,1000,1156,798]]]'>Why this precise and unmistakable language with reference to O’Hara avenue? Plainly because she owned the balance of the property, and her buildings, of which there were a large number, were located within the lines of this projected street. Is it at all likely that Mrs. Schenley should have intended to convey to plaintiff, without any consideration, any right or control over this unopened street which would affect so vitally her other property? Her language show's that she intended the plaintiff, to whom she was giving the blockhouse property, should have no rights as to O’Hara avenue, which was an unopened street and might never be opened, and that instead of giving the plaintiff the right of an abutter, her purpose was to reserve such right exclusively to herself in case the street was ever opened.</p>

The grantor in his deed declaring the existence of a street is estoppel to deny it; but in all such cases there must be a street corresponding with that described in the conveyance, and in all the cases cited by the plaintiff in which an easement was declared, created by such description, the instrument described the street as existing. This is not done here. Mrs. Schenley states that O’Hara avenue is only located by the city of Pittsburg, not by her, and is not yet opened and may never be <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>opened; but in case <em>there </em>be proceedings for its opening, she reserves all right to represent the land in that proceeding. She says nothing about the repeal of its location, as that matter was wholly within the control of the city and this control was exercised when, on .January 3, 1901, the city passed its ordinance repealing the location of O’Hara avenue. O’Hara avenue never actually existed as a street, and its location was thus wiped out.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b672-4" data-blocks='[["BL_672.4",672,[289,800,1156,792]]]'>Then followed, on February 12, 1902, the deeds of Mrs. Schenley to Mr. Frick, and later the conveyance of Mr. Frick to the defendant. In the deeds of Mrs. Schenley to Mr. Frick she uses the same careful and appropriate language with reference to O’Hara avenue as in the deed to plaintiff, and conveys to Mr. Frick not only the property, but all rights reserved in her deed to plaintiff; and there is nothing in them to sustain the plaintiff’s claim that a right to an easement was created. On the contrary, the language used by Mrs. Schenley and the circumstances attending the conveyances completely negative the implication of such a grant or creation.
