This was done by Daniel Leet, whose survey of a town and out lots at the mouth of Beaver creek was confirmed by Act of assembly of March 6, 1793, 3 Sm. L. 90. By the former of said acts it was provided that “the streets, lanes and alleys of the said town and out lots shall be common highways forever.” On the out lots so surveyed and laid out on the east side of Beaver creek the town of Rochester was built. It was incorporated as a borough by Act of assembly of March 20, 1849, P. L. 283.

L. 92, the governor was authorized and required to appoint a board of commissioners for the purpose of promoting the internal improvement of the state. This was the initial legislation looking toward the construction by the state of its system of canals. The scope of these improvements was enlarged from time to time by subsequent legislation. By the Act of February 25, 1826, P. L. 55, the canal commissioners were authorized to acquire the necessary land for the construction and operation of the canals authorized to be made, and in case of failure to agree with the owners, or in the event of their disability, to enter upon and condemn the lands and have the damages assessed in the manner therein provided, and it was further provided that on payment of such damages, “The state shall be seized of such lands as of an absolute estate in perpetuity or with such less quantity and duration of interest or estate in the same, or subject to such partial or temporary appropriation, use or occupation, as shall be required and described as aforesaid, as <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>if conveyed by the owner or owners.” By the Act of April 9, 1827, P. L. 192, the mode of assessing damages in such cases was changed and the time within which the landowner could petition for the appointment of viewers to assess his damages was fixed at one year after the completion of the work. By the ninth section of the last mentioned act the canal commissioners were authorized “to make such alterations as may appear to be expedient in the route and location of any state, county or township road along which or in the immediate vicinity whereof the canal or any part thereof does or shall pass, and to lay out and open to such width as shall be necessary, so much of any of the said roads as shall be relocated, and such new route of any of the said roads shall be considered as a public highway, to be supported and kept in repair as other highways in this commonwealth are supported and kept in repair, and so much of the route of any road as may be altered shall be thereby vacated.” By the Act of March 21, 1831, P. L. 194, provision was made for the construction of a canal or slack-water navigation “from the Ohio river, at the mouth of Big Beaver creek, up that creek to the town of New Castle.”</p>

In the making of said branch the Beaver creek was slack watered and utilized for a portion of the way. This necessitated the building of locks and dams. Lock number sixteen was located on the east side of Beaver creek in the. town of Rochester. The highway known as Island lane, situate along the east bank of the same at this point, was utilized as a towing path for. the purpose of the canal. On the east side of Island lane and immediately across from said lock number sixteen, was the lock house where the boats passing through said lock obtained their proper clearance papers. That portion of Island lane lying between said lock and lock house was thus used for the purpose of passing from the lock to the lock <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>house, as well as for a towing path, in the transportation of boats through said lock.

By an Act of the general assembly, approved March 7, 1843, P. L. 36, the governor of the state was authorized to incorporate the Erie Canal Company, to which, when certain conditions had been complied with, the property and franchises of the canal extending from the Ohio river to Lake Erie were to be turned over. This was done and thenceforth all the property and rights of the state in that portion of the canal vested in said corporation as fully as it had theretofore vested in the state. In the year 1871 a judgment was entered against the Erie Canal Company in the common pleas court of Beaver county, on which an execution was issued and all the property of said company in the county of Beaver was levied upon and sold by the sheriff of said county and a deed therefor, bearing date September 2, 1871, was duly made and delivered to the purchaser, A. J. Boyle. This deed purported to convey, inter alia, the lock house at lock number sixteen, Beaver division, and the lot attached thereto, containing fifty perches of land, more or less, and being in the borough of Rochester. By subsequent conveyance all that portion of the Erie canal between the mouth of Beaver river and the lower lock at New Brighton, all within said county of Beaver, with the towing path, etc., vested in the present defendants, who, claiming that the portion of the original highway known as Island lane, which had been occupied and used as a towing path, had vested in them by reason of the things hereinbefore recited, moved said lock house number six<a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>teen, outward, so as to occupy a portion of the land lying between said lock house and lock and within the lines of what was originally Island lane and formerly used as a towing path.

The contention of the defendants is that the commonwealth, in taking the land for canal purposes, acquired an absolute fee therein, unvexed by any joint right in the public to use it concurrently as a highway, and that title of the same absolute and unqualified character vested in the Erie Canal Company, as the successor of the commonwealth and, by subsequent conveyance, in the defendants.</p>

Having shown these things, the plaintiff rested. Upon part of defendants, proof was made of the various enactments looking toward the construction of the canals of the state, the creation of the board of canal commissioners^ and their authority to condemn and occupy public roads, etc., for that purpose, the transfer of the Beaver division of the Pennsylvania canal to the Erie Canal Company, the subsequent sale of this property and the vesting of title in the defendants by virtue of diverse conveyances. The defendants also called a large number of witnesses to show the character of the use of Island lane at the point in dispute during the operation of the canal from its inception until the cessation of operation in 1881, when the property was sold by the sheriff. Having offered their <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>proofs along these lines to sustain their title, as set up in their abstract, the defendants rested their cause. The plaintiff then called a large number of witnesses to rebut the testimony offered on part of defendants, especially as to the character of the use made of Island lane during, the operation of the canal, the tendency of plaintiff’s rebuttal evidence being to show that the state and its successor in title, the Erie Canal Company, did not take the exclusive possession of Island lane for canal purposes, and that during the time the canal was in operation there was a concurrent use of said lane by the public as a highway. The plaintiff also offered, in rebuttal, to show that after the canal had ceased to be operated, and for more than twenty-one years prior to the bringing of this action and prior to the taking of possession by the defendants, the borough of Rochester had continuous, open, adverse possession of the premises in dispute as a highway, but as the defendants had offered no testimony as to the use of the premises after the cessation of the use of the canal, the testimony offered could not be received by way of rebuttal. Plaintiff’s counsel then moved for leave to amend their abstract, so as to allege title by adverse possession for more than twenty-one years after the canal ceased to be operated. This motion, being objected to, was refused by the court, for the reason that it would introduce a new and independent cause of action, after both plaintiff and defendants had rested in chief, and would involve a trial of the case de novo on a new and distinct theory.</p>

On the contrary, its whole claim of title rested on the fact of the original dedication of Island lane for highway purposes, and the contention that its use for that purpose could not be changed or permanently lost. On that theory it tried its case in chief and rested. No evidence was adduced on part of defendants which even tended to raise the question of the nature of the use of Island lane during the period intervening between the cessation of its use for canal purposes and the bringing of the pending suit. The plaintiff’s offer on rebuttal, to show continuous and adverse possession for more than twenty-one years <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>prior to the bringing of the suit was therefore clearly not competent, as it did not tend to rebut anything whatever. The offer to amend the plaintiff’s abstract and statement so as to aver title by adverse user, even if allowed, would not have rendered competent the testimony that was otherwise clearly incompetent on rebuttal. Its only effect would have been, at that stage of the case, to introduce a new ca,use of action. Assuming that the plaintiff did have such adverse possession for more than twenty-one years, this was a fact the discovery of which did not await the development of the trial. That it introduced a new and distinct cause of action, we think is clear, when we consider that the cause of action is, in its last analysis, that upon which the plaintiff in the action bases his right of recovery. Two elements enter into every cause of action, viz.: a right in the plaintiff and the denial or infringement of that right by the defendant. If the plaintiff has a right to possession of the premises in dispute, growing out of the original dedication of Island lane, and the defendants interfered with that right, this created a cause of action, distinct in itself. If the plaintiff’s right of possession arose out of its exclusive possession for more than twenty-one years, the denial of that right would also constitute a cause of action, similar to the former, but resting on a different reason, and to be established by a different line of proof. It is not infrequently the case that several causes of action are set up in the same case, especially in ejectment. In the matter of allowing amendments, some regard must be had for orderly practice. In the present case the testimony was voluminous, requiring several days for the trial. The amendment was not asked for until both plaintiff and defendants had rested in chief after many witnesses had been examined and several days had been consumed in the trial. It was then asked for, in order to introduce, in rebuttal, evidence of adverse possession in the plaintiff, after operation of the canal had ceased, but as such testimony would not have tended to rebut anything sought to be proven by <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>the defendants, it could not have been received under the amendment, even if allowed, and its allowance would have been a vain thing. To become effective, it would have meant the beginning of the case de novo, and its trial on a new and distinct ground, but if that might be done, then, also, after the defendant had made defense to plaintiff’s claim of adverse possession, the plaintiff might, with equal right, ask to amend his abstract by showing title to the premises by virtue of a tax sale or otherwise, and whilst, it is conceded that the courts shall be liberal in allowance of amendment in order to exact justice between the parties litigant, yet there is a limit beyond which, we think, liberality would tend to hardship and consequent injustice. If the plaintiff desired to try its case on a new or additional theory, the time having gone by for its doing so in chief, a voluntary nonsuit would have availed for that purpose and would have enabled it to institute its action anew, under such pleadings as would embrace every theory on which it might hope to recover.</p>

This difference becomes important in this, that under the act of 1827, the state could enter upon the land without any prior proceeding of any sort, and its title, we may assume, was complete, even if no agreement were thereafter entered into with the owner, or if the owner failed to institute his proceeding within the year after the work was completed or at all. The title of the state grew out of the fact of its entry upon the land without more on its part, and without any proceeding instituted for the assessment of damages, and without t any record of its entry or of the extent of its taking. These differences are adverted to and commented upon in Com. v. McAllister, <a href="/watts/2/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts 190" data-case-ids="1840173" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0190-01">2 Watts, 190</a>, as follows: “By the Act of April 9, 1827, the viewers are not to be called upon to view the ground and make report until the work of the canal has been completed through the land of the applicant. The canal being finished through the land, it is obvious then that the state has‘no use, after that, for any part of the land except that upon which the canal has been located and made, which is necessarily wanted in perpetuity. The use to which it has been appropriated by the state is a sufficient indication of the quality and <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>duration of interest and estate that was required by her in it, and the applicant has clearly a right to claim compensation for the fee simple in it- — -to set it forth by metes and bounds and the quality and duration of interest and estate which the canal commissioners or state had the use of in making the canal would be perfectly useless.” See also Haldeman v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/50/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="50 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="425175" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0425-01">50 Pa. 425</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[230,730,1155,1222]]]'>As the Beaver branch of the Pennsylvania canal was not authorized until by Act of assembly of March 21,1831, P. L. 194, it is evident that the entry upon and appropriation of the lands in question were under the provision of the said act of 1827, and that the very fact of such entry and appropriation of the land in question for canal purposes, without more, vested title in the state, and that the character of its title was determined by the nature of its occupancy and use. When such occupancy was of a temporary character, connected only with the construction of said canal, it passed away when the work of construction was completed, but when it was for a permanent purpose, necessarily connected with the maintenance and operation of the canal, the estate acquired for such purposes was necessarily an absolute estate in perpetuity. It would seem necessarily to result from this that the mere entry of the state upon the land in question and the use of it for a purpose essentially and permanently connected with the operation of the canal gave rise to a presumption of an absolute and exclusive title in the state in perpetuity, and all the cases seem to rest upon this presumption not only as to the character of the title, but also as to the extent of the land taken.</p>

Houses and other erections were constructed on the lots abutting said alley on the side opposite the <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>canal. The alley was used as a means of ingress and egress to and from these structures. The canal property subsequently vested in said railroad company, which located its original tracks on and along the land occupied by the basin of the canal. Through time it became necessary to lay down an additional track along the east side of said original track on the land which constituted the said alley. The borough authorities, claiming the alley as a highway of the borough, sought to restrain the railroad company by injunction. The court below, in its opinion refusing a preliminary injunction, the refusal of which was affirmed by the Supreme Court, for the reasons given in said opinion, uses this language concerning the use of the alley by the public during the time it was used as a towing path: “This use of the towing path was certainly acquiesced in by the canal company and no difference how long such use had continued or how great it may have been, no rights of absolute user could have accrued, either to the public or to the owners or occupiers of the lots, the property to the canal and its appurtenances being vested in the commonwealth. . . . Whether or not there had been a previous condemnation for the state, it does not appear. The presumption is that there was.” And again the court says: “Now, whilst the canal was in operation, the necessities for the alley were in part supplied by the consentable use and enjoyment of the towing path between those streets, but this enjoyment was only permissive.”</p>

In passing upon the question thus raised, it would seem to be a safe postulate that the commonwealth, in the exercise of its plenary power over the highways of the state, may, either immediately, by legislative enactment, or mediately, through agencies exercising delegated authority, both create and destroy. If this be correct, it would seem necessarily to result that what it can create and may destroy, may be by it diverted from its original use to some other. It can scarcely be thought that the commonwealth, by reason of its dedication of Island lane as a highway, thereby reduced itself to a condition of impotence to thereafter deal with it in such a way as to change or abrogate that use. Island lane did not become inviolate in character by reason of having been originally dedicated by the state to public use forever. This very question was raised in respect to another highway in the same plan of lots, in the case of Com. v. Beaver Valley R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/222/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="222 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="959457" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0220-01">222 Pa. 220</a>, wherein the court below, in disposing of that question, says: “But it is suggested that Fifth street is peculiar in its relation to the Commonwealth, in view of the fact that it was dedicated as a 'common highway’ under and in pursuance of the act of 1791, supra. We fail to see how this fact can in any wise interfere with the operation of the admitted general principle of law that the sovereignty of public roads remains in the Commonwealth; the fact that the Commonwealth has dedicated the street in question to public use does not lessen its control over it or prevent it from exercising the same sovereignty it admittedly would have if the street had been dedicated by some one else; we can see no force in this suggestion.” Whilst, in the case of highways dedicated to public use as a part of a plat of lots which have become the property of private owners who have purchased with reference thereto, the highways so appear<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>ing cannot be closed up against their consent, for the reason that the right is wholly distinct from the right to .have the public character of such ways maintained. As to that, the public character of such highways may be relinquished at any time by proper proceedings instituted and carried on through the agencies to which authority in such cases has been delegated. In respect to a change in their use and ownership, public highways, created by .dedication or arising by prescription, or springing either mediately or immediately from legislative enactment, all of which-are artificial, both in their creation and location, are different, as we take it, from streams or .other bodies of water, which are navigable in fact, and are destined by nature to be highways, according to their kind. ■ The former, being artificial, may be changed or vacated and returned to private use, whilst the latter being fixed and immovable, are held in trust for all the people, and neither the waters nor the lands covered thereby can become, the subject of private ownership. Moreover, in the case of navigable waters so held in trust, no individual has that specific interest therein, nor in the land covered thereby which could become the basis of a claim for damages, were it sought to change the use thereof through the exercise of the right of eminent domain. Whilst in the case of Island lane, every owner of a lot which was a part of 'and purchased with reference to the plot or plan of lots of which it was a part, had such an interest therein, we think, as would have formed a basis for damages when said lane was taken for canal purposes.</p>

L. 142, relative to verdicts and judgments in actions of ejectment and regulating procedure therein, provides that “in all actions of ejectment hereafter to be brought, the plaintiff shall file a declaration, which shall consist of a concise statement of his cause of action, with an abstract of the title under which he claims the land in dispute, and in addition to the plea of 'not guilty,’ now required by <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>law, the defendant shall file an answer in the natúre of a special plea, in which he shall set forth his grounds of defense, with an abstract of the title by which he claims; and no action of ejectment shall be considered at issue until the plaintiff’s statement and the defendant’s plea and answer shall be filed, nor shall any evidence be received on the trial of said action of any matter not appearing in the pleadings, subject to the power of amendment.” This ejectment was instituted by the borough1 of Rochester to recover a small piece of land which it alleges is part of Island Lane, one of its highways. The averment in the statement upon which it went to trial is that it claims title to the land as a part of- Island Lane, one of its public highways, under and by virtue of several acts of assembly, as set forth in its abstract of title. Its whole claim of title, as set forth in its statement, rests on an alleged original dedication of Island lane for highway purposes. The answer of the defendants denies that the land described in the statement constitutes any part of the said highway, or of any other in the said borough, and they claim title to it by virtue of various acts of assembly set forth in their abstract. On the trial the plaintiff endeavored to sustain its title as set forth in its statement and abstract, and, having rested, the defendants proceeded to show a title in fee simple in themselves under the acts of assembly referred to in their abstract. The borough in rebuttal then offered to show title acquired by continuous, open and adverse possession for more than twenty-one years prior to the institution of the suit. This offer was disallowed for the reason that it would not rebut anything that had been shown by the defendants and could not be received as evidence because it related to a matter not appearing in the pleadings. This ruling' was- correct. A motion- was subsequently made by the plaintiff to amend its statement and abstract of title by adding thereto an averment that the lands in suit had been, for more than - twenty-one years prior to the institution of the same, and.prior to the time <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>that defendants took possession of it, thrown open to the public and had been continuously, openly and adversely used and occupied for all ordinary public purposes. The amendment was refused, and the first question raised on this appeal is as to the right of the plaintiff to make it.</p>

The amendment which the plaintiff below asked leave to make was refused because, in the opinion of the learned trial judge, it would have introduced a new and independent cause of action. A cause of action is the particular matter for which suit is brought: Erie City Iron Works v. Barber, <a href="/pa/118/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="118 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="556763" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0006-01">supra.</a> In ejectment the cause of action is the possession of land by one to the exclusion' of another entitled to the possession of it. In the case at bar the particular matter for which the plaintiff sued was the possession of land particularly described in the original statement, and by its amendment it did not seek to change the purpose of its suit. If the amendment had been allowed, the same question — the right of the plaintiff to the possession of the land described in the original statement — would have remained for the jury’s determination. The plaintiff’s cause of action, as laid in its priecipe and statement, was the defendants’ possession of its property particularly described and, under the amendment, there would have been the same complaint. The proof upon which the plaintiff would have had to rely to support its title and right of possession would have been different under the amendment; but that was all. It would still have stood upon the same cause of action— the defendants’ possession of its land. This distinction was evidently overlooked, and the refusal to allow the amendment improperly followed. As it should have been allowed on the usual terms, the first assignment is sustained.</p>
