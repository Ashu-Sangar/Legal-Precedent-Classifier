    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[209,626,1153,1008]]]'>The writing stipulates that the borough of New Castle, its lessees and assigns may and shall occupy forever certain land of the grantors, and that the grantors may and shall occupy forever certain land belonging to the borough. This was a mutual grant, and it seems plain that it must have been the intention of the parties that the words “may and shall occupy forever” should have the same meaning in both instances. This language was sufficient to pass a fee absolute and the additional words “for the purposes of wharf” used in connection therewith should not be taken to diminish the estate so created. As noted by the court below, the words of the grant “are not preceded or followed by any words of condition or limitation. The instrument does not state that the grant is made upon condition or provided that a wharf be built or maintained, nor does it say that the grant is to continue ‘so long as’ or during such time as the premises are used for the purposes of a wharf, nor are there any other words of condition or limitation used.”</p>

Thus, a grant in fee-simple to county commissioners of land ‘for the use of the inhabitants of Delaware county to accommodate the public service of the county’ was held not to create a base-fee . . . .; as also a grant to county commissioners and their successors in office of a tract of land with a brick court house thereon erected ‘in trust for the use of said county, in fee-simple,’ the statute under which the purchase was made authorizing the acquisition of the property for the purpose of a court house, jail and office for the safe keeping of the records. . . .

It is there pointed out that this court has ruled more than once that a declaration in a grant to a corporation that land is conveyed for certain purposes does not necessarily import a limitation of the fee. To again quote from that opinion: “Such a declaration can amount to no more than an explicit assertion of the intended legality of the grant. As was said, in the case of Griffitts v. Cope (<a href="/pa/17/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="17 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="967599" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0096-01">17 Pa. 96</a>): ‘The use to which the granting clause declares that this land is to be applied is of the character which the law requires. . . . The presumption would therefore appear fair and obvious, that by that declaration, the devisor merely meant to make the grant lawful upon its face;’ and in Brendle v. German Reformed Congregation (<a href="/pa/33/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="33 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="988355" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0415-01">33 Pa. 415</a>): ‘What then is the efficacy of the declaration that the congregation holds the land for the use of its poor, for a church, and for a burial ground? Nothing, except to show that they hold it for a purpose for which the law allows congregations to hold land. Not to limit their own title, but to recognize the uses allowed by law.’ . . .” In First Methodist Church v. Old Columbia Public Ground Co., <a href="/pa/103/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="103 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="449133" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0608-01">103 Pa. 608</a>, we stated: “The authorities show that the recital of the consideration and the statement of the purpose for which the land is to be used are wholly insufficient to create a conditional estate.” The' subject is also discussed in Wilkes-Barre v. Wyoming Society, <a href="/pa/134/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="134 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="814962" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0616-01">supra,</a> and in Sellers M.M.

With this in mind, and considering that the writing makes no provision for a forfeiture or termination of the estate and uses no words which must be taken as a condition, we construe the phrase, “for the purposes of wharf,” not as a limitation of the estate given to the borough, but rather as used for the purpose of showing the mutual grant “to be lawful upon its face.”</p>
