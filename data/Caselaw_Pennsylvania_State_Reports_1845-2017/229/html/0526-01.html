    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[213,693,1152,632]]]'>J. A. Shane, a witness for the plaintiff, admitted under cross-examination that in fixing his estimate of the damages he had taken into consideration “the danger from the operation of the road” and “the smoke and the dust . . . ., and the bringing in a cheaper class of houses.” This testimony was not afterwards changed materially or departed from, and it is clear that the witness did take these forbidden elements into account. The testimony was not only objected to during the examination of the witness, but at its conclusion a motion was made to strike out the evidence. The refusal of this motion was reversible error.</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[214,1341,1150,844]]]'>In Hamory v. Pennsylvania, Monongahela &amp; Southern R. R.

On the contrary, the trial judge in his charge treated the testimony as if the witness had confined himself entirely to the element of interference with access to the plaintiff’s property. Though we might not have felt called upon to reverse on this alone, yet in the absence of any instructions that the jury must disregard all elements other than the interference with access, we cannot say that the second and third assignments of error are without merit.</p>

While the rule governing the question involved is, “It must state the question or questions in the briefest or most general terms, without names, dates, amounts or particulars of any kind whatever,” this does not mean that a question unrelated to the main matter for decision but considered sufficiently important to be assigned for error, need not be included.</p>
