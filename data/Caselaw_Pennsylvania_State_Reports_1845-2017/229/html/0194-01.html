P. ten months per year whether current is used or not, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, at full rate of $35.00 per year per horse power, and if plant is shut down for full sixty days $250 as a minimum for the remaining months of the year,” provides for an adjustment at the end of the year and the return to the defendant of all sums paid on monthly payments, made during the year, in excess of the minimum rate of charge expressed in the agreement. Because the agreement in the section referred to, provides that “the Power Company will not make any rebates or deductions in any of its bills for less than 250 H. P. as a minimum power to be used ten months in each year during the period of this contract, and during the period of 60 days of shut down the Phosphorus Company agrees to pay 250 dollars per month during such stoppage or shut downs,” it is strenuously argued that the Power Company has bound itself in terms, to make rebates and deductions; and that not having provided what rebates and deductions are to be made or when, there is an ambiguity, which the defendant has a right to explain, by the letters and conversations offered, to be an adjustment and repayment to the defendant at the end of each year of all moneys paid the plaintiff for power in excess of the minimum rates.</p>
