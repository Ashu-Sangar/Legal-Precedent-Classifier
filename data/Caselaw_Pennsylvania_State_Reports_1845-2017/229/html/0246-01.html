On March 25, 1906, the auditor general and state treasurer setted an account against it for tax of four mills upon $2,760,833 of indebtedness, which, after deducting certain commissions to the defendant’s treasurer, amounted to $10,933.12.

On March 2, 1905, the bank forwarded a report to the auditor general, showing the value of its capital stock, or shares, as ascertained in the method directed by the act of 1897, and at the same time gave notice <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>that it had elected to pay the tax of four mills on such valuation. Its report was received by the auditor general on the day following. Upon this valuation the tax was assessed by the auditor general, and the settlement therefor was mailed to the bank and received by it on March 4,1905. On the same day the bank sent its check for the amount of tax which was turned into the state treasury on March 6, 1905.</p>

Assuming that the bank had paid its capital stock tax in time to obtain the exemption granted by the proviso above quoted, the defendant company paid to the bank the interest in full upon the bonds, making no deduction for any loan tax from the interest. The fact that the bank had not forwarded its capital stock tax before March 4, 1905, was not known to the defendant company until after this appeal had been taken and the interest on the bonds in question had been paid in full.</p>

L. 229, imposes a tax of four mills on all corporate loans, and the fourth section of the Act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 193, requires the treasurer of the corporation issuing the loans to deduct the tax from the interest payable thereon. Upon failure or neglect to do so, the corporation itself is liable for the tax: Com. v. Delaware Div. Canal Co., <a href="/pa/123/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="123 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="967114" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0594-01">123 Pa. 594</a>; Com. v.

The defendant company, <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>therefore, was bound to deduct from the interest which it paid on its bonds held by the Union Savings Bank of Pittsburg the tax of four mills on such bonds, unless the bonds were exempt from taxation by the provisions of the Act of July 15, 1897, P. L. 292. By that act exemption from taxation on its bonds owned by it in its own right is given to a state bank or savings institution which shall pay into the state treasury on or before March 1 in each year the tax imposed therein upon the shares of its capital stock: Com. v. Clairton Steel Co., <a href="/pa/222/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="222 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="959467" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0293-01">222 Pa. 293</a>. The language of the proviso granting the exemption as to the time when the stock tax shall be paid is without ambiguity, and, therefore, is not open to construction. The exemption is conditioned upon the payment of the tax on or before March 1, in each year. As we have found, the Union Savings Bank did not comply with this condition. It did not pay the tax on the shares of its stock, or even elect to pay it, until after the statutory time. It was not entitled, therefore, to the exemption, and the bonds of the defendant company held by it remained subject to the loan tax imposed by the act of 1891, and it was the duty of the treasurer of the defendant company to assess the tax and deduct it from the interest which was paid on them. As this was not done, the defendant company became liable for such tax. It is true that the bank paid its stock tax within a few days after the limit of time fixed by the act, and that the defendant company did not know that the bank had failed to secure the exemption from the tax on the bonds. Inquiry on the part of the defendant company, however, would certainly have disclosed that fact. Be that as it may, we are not at liberty to disregard the time fixed by the act of 1897, on or before which the stock tax must be paid in order to obtain exemption, and thus to relieve the defendant company from its liability in the present instance.</p>
