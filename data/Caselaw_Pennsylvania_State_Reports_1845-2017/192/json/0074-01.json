It was an accident such as is likely to happen in the ordinary conduct of any business, and is one of the risks which is assumed by the workmen in taking such employment.

Groetzinger, trading as Groetzinger\u2019s Sons.\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Bisk of employment\u2014Fellow-servant.\nWhere several workmen in a tannery are engaged in lifting a heavy stone table, and owing to the manner in which one of the workmen handles his crowbar, the table in some way slips, and injures another workman, the latter cannot recover damages from his employer, inasmuch as the accident was among the ordinary risks which he assumed in engaging in the work.\nArgued May 16, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 92, Jan. T., 1899, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Lancaster Co., Aug. T., 1896, No. 48, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Gbeen, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Livingston, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the plaintiff was employed in the beam house of defendants\u2019 tannery in Lancaster city. On the day of the accident there was occasion to move one of the large stone slabs or tables on which leather was dressed. It was about twelve feet long, four and one half feet wide, and four inches thick. Plaintiff and other employees were summoned to help. It was raised upon its edge; rollers were put under it, one of which broke into the floor; the stone slipped off the roller; one of the defendants told the men to lift it up so as to put the roller under it, but not-with their hands; one Cooper, a fellow employee, took a crowbar and tried to lift it up; the table or slab slipped off the crowbar; the other men saw it sliding and ran; plaintiff tried to get away, bnt slipped, and the table caught him around the ankle, and broke his foot. Plaintiff testified that while Groetzinger went to get something with which to lift it, Cooper, the man with the crowbar, undertook to lift it and it fell over.\nWm. Cooper, the man who was handling the crowbar when the slab slipped and caught Reusch, was called by plaintiff, and he described the accident thus:\n\u201cWe had been raising it with nothing but iron bars from the start. I took one of the bars which I had in my hand all the time from the time we started\u2014I used to put my hand against the table and push on it, and carry the bar in my hand. Of course, it run very easy when on the rollers. I took one of the bars and one of the other men took the other bar and put it under the table to lift it up. The bottom of the table flew from us and the top came toward us. There was a hole back of August about three inches wide and two feet long, right between two joists. He stepped through the hole and the table fell over on him and broke his leg until the shin bone stuck out through the flesh. Q. When this roller went through the floor and when the stone fell down on the floor, what directions did Mr. Groetzinger give ? A. Mr. Groetzinger said, \u2018 Take hold of it and raise it up.\u2019 Q. You then put the bar under it? A. Yes, sir. Q. And it slipped away from you and fell over? A. Yes, sir. Q. Was Mr. Groetzinger present at the time? A. Mr. Groetzinger was present at the time, when he said, \u2018 Raise it up and put another roller under it,\u2019 but whether he was there when the table fell or not I would not say positive. But I judge he wasn\u2019t very far away. I couldn\u2019t have time to watch him all the time. Q. You were watching the stone and didn\u2019t have your eyes on Mr. Groetzinger all the time ? A. Yes, sir.\u201d\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nE. McMullen and William 11. Erinton, for appellant.\nThe work of moving the stone, which by its fall caused the injury to the plaintiff, was under the direction, from its commencement until its unfortunate ending, of Charles Groetzinger, one of the defendants. He summoned the men from their accustomed work in other parts of the tannery, gave the orders what to do, and how to do it, and was present observing the work as it progressed. For any negligence, therefore, in the manner of doing the work, or in failing to provide sufficient and safe appliances therefor, the plaintiff is clearly liable: Patterson v. R. R.
