I direct all my just debts and funeral expenses to be fully paid and satisfied as soon as conveniently may be after my decease.\n\u201c Item. I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Catherine Reutter, all my estate, personal, real and mixed of whatsoever kind, to have and to hold during her natural life or so long as she remains my widow, and after her death or marriage to my legal heir during his natural life, and after his death, to his heirs and assigns forever.\n\u201cAnd lastly, I nominate, constitute and appoint my son John Reutter to be the executor of this my last will and testament.\n\u201c In witness whereof, I, John Reutter, the testator, have to this my last will and testament set my hand and seal this twenty-first day of June, A. D., one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-seven.\nhis\n\u201cJohn x Reutter.\u201d\nLetters testamentary upon the foregoing will were in due form of law granted to John Reutter, the executor therein named on February 24, 1868.\nJohn Reutter, the testator, left to survive him only his widow, Catherine Reutter, and his son, John Reutter, the plaintiff above named.

Reutter, wife of the above named plaintiff, John Reutter, therein, should she, the said Emma J. Reutter, survive the said John Reutter. Samuel K. McCall on April 22,1899, refused to accept the said deed, tendered as aforesaid, and refused to execute and deliver the purchase money mortgage, and averred as his reason for declining to accept the said\u2019 deed and to execute and deliver the said mortgage, that John Reutter, the above named plaintiff, acquired under the will of his father, the late John Reutter, deceased, only a life estate in the premises described in the articles of agreement above mentioned, and that the title conveyed by the deed to him tendered as above set forth, did not convey the said premises to said Samuel K. McCall, in fee simple, subject only to the dower interest of Emma J. Reutter, wife of the said John Reutter therein, should she, the said Emma J. Reutter, survive the said John Reutter.\nThe court entered judgment for plaintiff on the case stated, citing Grimes v. Shirk, 169 Pa. 74.\nJError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nSamuel If. McCall, for appellant, cited Hileman v. Bouslaugh, 13 Pa. 344.\nJames St. Clair McCall and Latimer $ Schmidt, for appellee, were not heard.\nMay 24, 1899:"
