    "head_matter": "John Weiser, Appellant, v. John K. Zeigler, Trustee.\nWill\u2014Life estate\u2014Bequest of income.\nTestator by his will bequeathed certain bonds to his grandsons, J. and H., to be delivered to them upon their majority. By a codicil he directed that the bonds should be held by his executor \u201c in trust for the said J. and H., that is to say; he shall pay them the said J. and H., and their several and respective heirs the annual premium at six per cent, currency, if he receives that sum, and at such times as he receives the same, pay them the same, forever hereafter, and in case any or both of them should die without heirs or children, then in that case I give and bequeath his or their share to my son K., his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d Held, (1) that the grandsons took merely a life interest in the bonds; (2) that the corpus was not vested in the legatees because of the provision that, in case the legatees \u201c should die without heirs,\u201d the funds should go to a third person; (3) that the bequest did not violate the rule against perpetuities.\nArgued May 18, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 207, Jan. T., 1899, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. York Co., Aug. T., 1899, No. 4, on case stated.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to declare a trust.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of Stewart, J., which was as follows-:\nThis is a case stated for the opinion of the court involving the construction of the will of John E. Zeigler. The testator in his will provided as follows: \u201c I give, devise and bequeath unto my grandson, John Weiser, his heirs and assigns, and unto my grandson, Henry Weiser, his heirs and assigns, each two thousand dollars worth of Union Pacific Railroad bonds to be paid to them by my executor hereinafter named as they severally arrive at lawful age and not sooner. And in case any of them should die in his minority, then the survivor to inherit his share; and in case they both should die in their minority, then in that case I give and bequeath the said four thousand dollars worth of Union Pacific Railroad bonds to my grandsons John S. Zeigler, Pa\u00fal Hildebrand and John Clinton Zeigler, share and share alike, their heirs and assigns,\u201d and appointed his son John K. Zeigler executor of his said will.\nMore than five years afterward, the testator added a codicil to his will as follows: \u201c Whereas in my said will I have given and bequeathed unto my grandson John Weiser, his heirs and assigns and unto my grandson Henry Weiser, his heirs and assigns, each two thousand dollars worth of Union Pacific Railroad bonds to be paid to them by my executor therein named as they severally arrive at lawful age and not sooner, I do hereby declare that my will is that the said four thousand dollars worth of Union Pacific Railroad bonds shall be held by my son, John K. Zeigler in trust for the said John Weiser and Henry Weiser, that is to say; he shall pay unto them, the said John Weiser and Henry Weiser and their several and respective heirs the annual premium at six per cent, currency, if he receives that sum and at such times as he receives the same, pay them the same forever hereafter, and in case any or both of them should die without heirs or children, then in that case I give and bequeath his or their share to my son John K. Zeigler, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d\nThe purpose of the case stated is to determine the trust and require the trustee to hand over to the cestui que trustent the corpus of said trust funds.\nBy the provision in the original will of the testator these two funds are given absolutely payable to the legatees on their arriving at their majority, this being the only condition. Both have now attained their majority and John Weiser, the plaintiff in this case, is married and has two children living, aged respectively nineteen and fourteen years, and Henry Weiser, the other legatee is unmarried. So that, but for the codicil the legatees would now be entitled to receive the said legacies absolutely. But under this codicil the bonds are directed to be held by John K. Zeigler, the executor, \u201c in trust for the said John Weiser and Henry Weiser, that is to say, he shall pay them the said John Weiser and Henry Weiser and their several and respective heirs the annual premium at six per cent, if he receives that sum and at such times as he receives the same forever hereafter,\u201d and in case any or both of them should die without heirs or children then in that case I give and bequeath his or their share to my son John K. Zeigler, his heirs and assigns forever. By this provision the testator intended to entirely change the original purpose of his will. It took away the bequest to his two grandsons of the corpus of the funds and placed it in trust, and gave them only the interest. But it is contended that as he directed the interest to be paid to them and their several and respective heirs forever, it is \u00e1 gift of the corpus of the funds to them absolutely. The direction to pay over the interest to them and their several and respective heirs \u201cforever\u201d is impossible of performance, and this the testator would of course understand and therefore it may be assumed that he did not mean this. It is evident that the change made by the codicil, putting the fund in trust, was intended to preserve the corpus of the estate for them during life, they to receive the interest and at their death, if they left heirs or children, the principal to go to such children or their heirs. The gift of the income of a fund does not carry the principal except where there is no limitation over: Millard\u2019s App., 87 Pa. 457; Boberts\u2019s App., 59 Pa. 70 ; Bentley v. Kauffman, 86 Pa. 100. It will be observed that there is in the codicil nothing to indicate that the testator intended that the principal of the fund should ever vest in the legatees. In the original will there was plainly and specifically such an intention. It may therefore safely be assumed that he intended by the codicil to prevent this. So that to construe the will as now claimed by the legatees, would be to fly in the face of the testator\u2019s clear purpose. It is contended, however, that the provision in the will directing \u201c in case any or both of them should die without heirs or children, then in that case I give and bequeath their share to my son John K. Zeigler, his heirs and assigns forever,\u201d evidences an intention to vest the principal in the legatees, and which under the construction of the words \u201cdie without heirs or children,\u201d gives them an absolute estate in the fund. I cannot agree with this contention. Even where the corpus of the fund was first given to the legatee and then placed in trust, and where the will provided in reference thereto, \u201c in case the said Martin Eichelberger should die and leave no legitimate heirs of his own body, then the sum so bequeathed to him shall revert to my other heirs,\u201d it was held that he took only a life estate: Eichelberger\u2019s Estate, 135 Pa. 160, and cases cited.\nNor am I convinced that the bequest violates the rule against perpetuities.\nIn accordance with the case stated I therefore direct judgment to be entered in favor of the defendant, the costs to be paid as therein provided.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for defendant on case stated.\nJ.
