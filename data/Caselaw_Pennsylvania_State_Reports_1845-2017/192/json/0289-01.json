They owned a large amount of property in common, and naturally the administration of the two estates ran very much together. The court below, therefore, for convenience, and apparently with general consent, treated them as one, and they have been argued here together.\nThe only question necessary for us to notice, and that briefly, is the compensation to the accountant and Ms counsel. This is objected to as excessive. The amount is large, but it is unquestionable that the trouble and responsibility were great. The auditing judge states that there were upwards of fifty pieces of real estate, located all over the city of Philadelphia, in almost every instance incumbered.with mortgages, arrears of taxes and municipal claims. We have only to look at our own records to be reminded what persistent litigants the two decedents were, especially inresistance to claims for taxes and municipal improvements. By direction of the court the properties were sold clear of incumbrances, and this involved settlements, not only with purchasers, but with mortgagees, lien creditors, and particularly the city of PhiladelpMa. This general outline is sufficient to indicate the exceptional nature of the accountant\u2019s labor.\nThere is no set rule as to percentage on the estate M such cases. The rule is fair compensation for the amount and character of the labor. The responsibility involved in large estates is also an element to be compensated, though not a controlling one. The learned court having all the facts and circumstances before it, fixed what it deemed a fair compensation, and we see no reason to differ with its conclusions.\nAppeal dismissed with costs..",

The rule is fair compensation for the amount and character of the labor. The responsibility involved in large estates is also an element to be compensated, though not a controlling one.\nAn administrator d. b. n. will be allowed commission to the amount of $85,000 on an estate of over $1,000,000, where it appears that estate consisted of over fifty properties, which were incumbered with mortgages and other liens, and all of which were sold clear of incumbrances, and that the administration consumed a vast amount of labor during a period of four years.\nArgued March 23, 1899.\nAppeals, Nos. 44 and 45, Jan. T., 1899, by G. Washington Powell and William Gorman, executors of Richard Wistar, deceased, and G. Washington Powell and William Gorman, executors of William Lewis Wistar, deceased, from decrees of O. C. Phila. Co., Oct. T., 1894, Nos. 70 and 71, dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nBefore Stebbett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, J J.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nThe facts were stated by Ferguson, J., the auditing judge, as follows:\nIn the account of the accountant as administrator c. t. a. of William Lewis Wistar\u2019s estate, he has taken credit for commissions :\nThree per cent on $669,566.49 . . . $20,086.99\nCounsel fee to George Wharton Pepper, Esq., 5,000.00\nAnd in the account of Richard Wistar\u2019s estate :\nThree per cent\u00f3n $796,872.98 . . . $23,906.19\nCounsel fee to George Wharton Pepper, Esq., 5,000.00\nThese commissions and counsel fees were objected to as being excessive.\nThere is no uniform rule upon the subject of what is proper compensation to an executor or administrator. Every case must be decided upon its own peculiar circumstances. A rate of commission that would be very liberal compensation in one case, would be entirely inadequate in another. In this case there can be no question that the labors of the accountant were very considerable and his responsibility very great. These are the two elements to be considered in fixing his compensation. The estates of the two decedents consisted almost wholly of real estate located all over the city of Philadelphia. There were upwards of fifty different pieces of this real estate sold by the accountant. In almost every instance the properties were incumbered with mortgages, arrears of taxes, municipal claims, etc. By direction of the court the properties were sold clear of incumbrances. This increased the labors of the accountant as well as his responsibility, as it necessitated paying off the mortgages as well as the other incumbrances in each case, and of course, involved making settlements, not only with the different purchasers, but also with the mortgagees, the city of Philadelphia and the other lien creditors. The amount of money that thus went through the hands of the accountant was considerably over $1,000,000. It was claimed that as this real estate was largely incumbered, all the interest the estate had therein was the equity over the mortgage, and that the commission should only be charged upon this amount, but the real estate was directed to be sold clear. This was proper for several reasons, particularly to get rid of the testator\u2019s bonds which in each case accompanied the mortgages, and his estate could not well be finally settled with these outstanding. Thus the whole of the large sum above mentioned went through the hands of the accountant. It was not only received, but, excepting the comparatively small balance now for distribution, was disbursed by the accountant in the way of paying incumbrances and other debts and obligations of the testators. It was claimed by the executors that a very large part of the work done in this estate was done by them; that they aided and assisted the accountant in preparing for the sale of the real estate, and in every other duty he had to perform, and that, while there was a great deal of labor, he did not do it all. But, notwithstanding, the labors of the accountant in managing this large estate must have been very great and he should, of course, be adequately paid. The only question is whether the amount charged is not too much. The total amount of the commissions upon both estates aggregates $43,993.18. This is an amount of money sufficiently large to compensate for a great deal of work, and while there was, no doubt, considerable done in these estates, yet the auditing judge thinks that in view of the large amount upon which the commissions are calculated, that the sum of $35,000 would be not only compensatory but a very liberal allowance. This sum is allowed, and the accountant will be surcharged with $8,993.18, the difference.\nWith regard to Mr. Pepper\u2019s fees, the accountant, who is a member of the bar of very considerable experience in such matters, testified that it was exceedingly moderate compensation for the vast amount of work done for four years, and that the fees were fixed at the figures named after consultation with the senior counsel on both sides of the case. Under the circumstances the fees are allowed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nE. Qooper Shapley, for appellants.\nAn administrator pen-An Andente lite is in the same position as a receiver: Schwartz v. Keystone Oil Co., 153 Pa. 283. The amount allowed was excessive: Baucus v.

In each instance a statement is made of the capacity in which the commission was claimed\u2014whether by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian or assignee. There is no legal distinction between these various offices as far as right to commissions is concerned, but it will be observed that (as a matter of fact) the most arduous duties are usually the duties of administration, and the largest commissions are usually allowed to fiduciaries who do this class of work. The only difference in this respect between an administrator pendente lite and any other administrator is the fact that he does his work under circumstances which are peculiarly trying, and in the face of obstacles which make it especially difficult.\nA and B were executors who filed separate accounts. The estate was valued at about $100,000. The services rendered by the executors were as follows: A received about $12,400, of which about $9,400 consisted only of five items. He took the goods of the estate at the appraised value, amounting to about $500, and received the residue of the $9,400 in four payments. B in his first account, amounting to $58,000 and upwards, received more than $49,000 in large payments. In his second account, amounting to $35,000 and upwards, the receipts were likewise in sums uncommonly large. There was a sale of real estate, which cost but little trouble to the executors, and the remittance to them of the proceeds of a mortgage in New York, which cost still less. Many attorneys and agents had been employed, who did all the work, and the executors in many instances had nothing to do but receive the money. Held, that a commission of five per cent was too large under all the circumstances, and three per cent of the amount coming into the hands of the executors was allowed: Pusey v. Clemson, 9 S. & R. 204.\nExecutorship. Estate insolvent. The testator directed in his will that his executors should receive two per cent on the \u201c net proceeds \u201d of his estate, which at the time of his decease was apparently solvent, and which on the settlement turned out to be insolvent.

Besides the necessity of an application to two orphans\u2019 courts, prior claims had to be settled and money advanced in order to obtain the title, and mortgages and judgments had to be paid.
