      <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>The bill in this case sets forth substantially the same matters alleged in the petition presented to this court which appeared in the report of the Commonwealth v.

Solon were not the true representatives and officers of the order, and that, therefore, the judgment of ouster there entered should be opened; that the Order of Solon then was and, the bill alleges, now is doing business by virtue of the authority acquired by the acceptance of the Act of April 6, 1893, P. L. 7, entitled “ An act defining fraternal, beneficial and relief societies and their status,” etc.; that this petition was presented to procure the opening of the judgment of ouster entered in said case, but that the motion to open was refused by the court, and that judgment of ouster was entered against the Order of Solon on May 25, 1894, and Wm. H. Gasldll was appointed receiver of its funds and property, and thereupon toot possession of the same; that the court had no lawful right to appoint a receiver in that case; or to place the funds or property of the Order of Solon in his hands, and that the sum of about $300,000 thus placed in his custody belongs to and is the property of the Order of Solon.</p>

The parties making that answer had been adjudged to be the true representatives of the order. The interveners had no standing whatever at that time. The right of the members to intervene where their official representatives are acting fraudulently or in excess of their authority is not denied, but any such question is concluded here by the action of the Supreme Lodge in accepting as final the decree of the court of Dauphin county founded on the answer and directing the officers of the order to take no appeal. When, following that action, the Supreme Lodge omitted to elect any new officers, and adjourned sine die, the whole ground of contention came to an end. The corporation had ceased to exist. The meeting of a minority party the next day was without authority, and all its acts were void.”</p>
