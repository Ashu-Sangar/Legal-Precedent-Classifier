Dig. 78, pi. 34, have recognized the duty of the courts to enforce the provisions of the act, that if it is reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing they shall by their process prevent a crossing at grade. And by the case of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Braddock Electric Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/152/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="152 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="838147" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0116-01">152 Pa. 116</a>, it was held that the duty is not affected by the Act of May 14, 1889, P. L. 211, Purd. Dig. 1827, pi. 256, and further that the act of 1871 applies to street railways. It follows, then, that the only question in this case is whether or not it is reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing, it being admitted that the defendant company has a right to cross plaintiff’s line. What would be reasonable in any particular case depends upon the degree of danger and the cost and difficulties of avoiding it. The evidence in this case shows that the Junction Railroad is the connecting link between the Baltimore &amp; Ohio system on the Monongahela river and its system on the Allegheny river; that it crosses underneath the Pennsylvania about 1,300 feet south of Liberty avenue, and approaches it on a down grade of about seventy-one feet to the mile, with a curve a short distance from Liberty avenue, which it crosses at grade; that the present traffic of the road consists of about twenty-five trains each day, four of which are passenger trains, <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>and that its yards are on and near Liberty avenue, the switches to which are so arranged that the shifting engines cross it frequently on an average of every ten or fifteen minutes. Its trains are very heavy, consisting of from forty to fifty loaded cars and ninety to 100 empty.</p>

This company has no right to use the street as a shifting ground, and without regard to the use of the street by the street railway company, it should be discontinued as an unwarrantable interference with the rights of, and a menace to, the safety of persons using it for ordinary travel, and the dangers from the handling of heavy trains is entirely within the control of the plaintiff, who should not undertake to do that which by their own showing is dangerous.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.6",66,[315,1067,1171,1109]]]'>Liberty avenue, along which the street railway is constructed westward from Thirty-third street, is almost level and straight for about one mile. East of Thirty-third street it is about level for fifty feet and then rises at a grade of five and five tenths feet for some distance, and is straight for several hundred feet, when it curves to the south. Going eastward there is no greater danger than upon any crossing; going westward there is the added danger of approaching the railroad on a down grade. During the busy hours of the morning and afternoon, about two hours each, it is expected that cars will pass every minute and a half. There are a number of grade crossings in Pittsburg and Allegheny, over most of which more trains pass than along the Junction road, and on streets along which more passenger cars are carried, as for instance, on Penn avenue, on the P. P. W. &amp; C., at Eleventh street, and the Allegheny Valley at Twenty-eighth street, and on Liberty street at the Union depot, on Second avenue over the Panhandle tracks, on Federal, San-dusky and Anderson streets, Allegheny, over the P. F. W. &amp; O., and West Penn, etc. The crossing on Federal street has a grade very similar to that on Liberty Avenue east of Thirty-third street. The accidents to street cars .at. these crossings have been few.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[141,688,1170,506]]]'>The testimony shows that the curves on the first plan would be impracticable unless the tracks were curved across the tracks of the Citizens’ road; that the grade on Penn avenue rises at Thirty-fourth street, and the grade of Thirty-fourth street is over nine per cent. This would make a much more dangerous crossing than the one proposed, for the reason that the cars of both roads would approach each other upon a heavy down grade and those of the Fort Pitt Company come out of Thirty-fourth street on to Penn avenue upon a curve. If such an arrangement were proposed it would be the duty of the court to prevent it.</p>

As the company has no power to condemn property, it is not within its power to do so, except at the will of parties whom the court cannot control.

It would certainly damage the adjoining property. The only witness called upon this point estimated the damage at a sum over $100,000. We think this estimate extravagant, but it would certainly be very large. It was suggested that the railway company would not be liable to pay these damages, but whether they would or not, some one would suffer to that extent,, and in this matter the railroad companies are not alone to be considered, but the public and every individual who may be affected by our order.</p>

In Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Braddock Electric Co., <a href="/pa/152/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="152 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="838147" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0116-01">152 Pa. 116</a>, it was held that this duty is not affected by the Act of May 14, 1889, P.

On the contrary, as population, travel and traffic increase from year to year, grade crossings become more and more dangerous to both life and property, and consequently the necessity of avoiding or prohibiting them becomes more imperative. This is evidenced by the large expenditures that have been recently made, and are now in progress in some of the larger centers of population, for the purpose of correcting mistakes that have been made in past years by permitting the construction of grade crossings. The city of Philadelphia and the Reading Railroad Company are now about completing a subway for the use of said road at a joint expense of not less than $6,000,000.

As an exercise of the police power of the state, the wisdom of the provision has become more manifest from year to year as railroads multiply.” In Traction Co. v. D. &amp; H. Canal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=180%20Pa.%20643" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="180 Pa. 643">180 Pa. 643</a>, will be found an elaborate discussion of the act of 1871, by our Brother Dean, wherein the words “reasonably practicable” are construed, and the wisdom of rigidly enforcing the provisions of the act is clearly and forcibly presented. In that connection it is said, inter alia: “ That it is unwise, if not reckless and barbarous, to unnecessarily subject the traveling public and the employees of carrying companies to the death, maiming and horrors of collision which inevitably result from grade crossings.”</p>
    <p id="b72-6" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[304,1959,1169,247]]]'>These references, to which many more might be added, are quite sufficient to indicate the settled conviction of this Court as to the wisdom and necessity of liberally construing and rigidly enforcing the provisions of the act, whenever cases fairly within its letter and spirit are presented.</p>
    <p id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.7",72,[304,2215,1168,196]],["BL_73.1",73,[143,339,1170,450]]]'>Without referring in detail to the evidence tending to show the dangerous character of the crossing, or reciting the facts found by the court below, it is quite sufficient to say that the undisputed evidence, as to the topography of the neighbor<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>hood and surroundings of the crossing, the extent to which the latter is used by both companies, etc., establishes beyond doubt the general conclusion that it is exceptionally dangerous ; and it is equally clear that the natural growth of the city and consequent increase of travel and traffic on Liberty avenue and over the Junction railroad, will necessarily render the crossing more and more dangerous every year. These conclusions of fact are not seriously questioned and may be accepted as correct.</p>
    <p id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[143,806,1171,456]]]'>The facts referred to by the learned judge, “ That there are a number of grade crossings in Pittsburg and Allegheny over most of which more trains pass than along the Junction road, and on streets along which more passenger cars are carried,” etc., are surely no argument in favor of sanctioning the maintenance of additional death traps. The dangerous character of the crossings referred to will, doubtless, sooner or later, necessitate their avoidance in some legitimate way. Their discontinuance is only a question of time.</p>
    <p id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.6",73,[140,1269,1175,610]]]'>In considering the elements of danger necessarily involved in the crossing, the fact that plaintiff company has been using the street for the purpose of shifting its cars was properly eliminated by the learned trial judge. He was quite right in saying: “ This company has no right to use the street as a shifting ground, and without regard to the use of the street by the street railway company it should be discontinued as an unwarrantable interference with the rights, and a menace to the safety, of persons using it for ordinary travel, and the dangers from handling of heavy trains is entirely within the control of the plaintiff, who should not undertake to do that which by their own showing is dangerous.”</p>
    <p id="b73-7" data-blocks='[["BL_73.7",73,[138,1887,1176,301]]]'>The general conclusion on which the learned judge based his refusal to prohibit a crossing at grade, is recited in the fifth specification as follows: “ After a full consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case, the damages and the costs and difficulties in the way, in our judgment it is not reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing.”</p>
    <p id="b73-8" data-blocks='[["BL_73.8",73,[139,2196,1175,197]],["BL_74.1",74,[291,339,1171,249]]]'>This presents the cardinal question in the case, to which all others are necessarily subordinate. If that conclusion was warranted by all the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence, the court was right in refusing to use its “ process to prevent a <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>crossing at grade,” and in directing its attention to the adoption of such rulés and regulations as will best protect persons and property from injury at the point in question. If not, the decree must be reversed and the injunction prayed for should be granted.</p>
    <p id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[282,596,1179,1584]]]'>Assuming, for argument sake merely, that the above quoted conclusion of fact is correct, and that the only measure of reasonably practicable relief consists in the enforcement of such precautionary rules and regulations as are best calculated to lessen the perils of the grade crossings, etc., we are not prepared to say that the rules and regulations embodied in the decree are open to much, if any, adverse criticism; but our consideration of all the facts and circumstances bearing on the main question has convinced us that it is reasonably practicable to avoid a crossing at grade, and that the court below should have so held. We have reached this conclusion only after carefully considering and weighing all the evidence relating to the location, the surroundings and admittedly dangerous character of the crossing, etc., including the testimony relating to the practicability of avoiding the crossing at grade, etc. This inference of fact might perhaps be fortified by a detailed review and discussion of the testimony, but such elaboration of the minor questions in the case is deemed unnecessary. The learned judge of the common pleas appears to have attached undue importance to the estimated cost of constructing an overhead crossing, or otherwise avoiding the crossing at grade, including damages to adjacent property, etc. As is usual in such cases the witnesses differ widely in their estimates, etc., but neither of their estimates is so high that it should be placed in the scale against the menacing dangers of perpetuating such a crossing. The parties to this proceeding and the city of Pittsburg, representing the inhabitants thereof, are so specially interested in avoiding the dangerous grade crossing in question, that it would seem to be the part of wisdom for them to co-operate and each contribute a just and reasonable proportion of the expenses necessary to make its abolition an accomplished fact.</p>
