J. M. McCarrell, Esq., as well as his counsel, James Fitzsimmons, Esq., of Pittsburg, were present with your auditors at several hearings, and advanced no arguments whatever in support of the claim of the commonwealth for this fund, except the allegations of their petition; they cited no authorities whatever in support of their position, and this, too, in face of the fact that beneficial societies or orders similar to this have been ousted and dissolved, and their funds distributed by the courts to and among certificate holders and their assignees. The Order of Tonti was a similar order to this, and it was dissolved by the court, and its funds distributed to its members. The question as to whether or not the fund for distribution in the assigned estate of the Order of Tonti had escheated to the commonwealth was not raised before the auditors in that case, and it is highly probable that, if a valid claim could have been made upon its funds by the commonwealth, an informer would have been at hand to have helped share in the distribution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[130,1302,1182,767]]]'>We do not understand how the commonwealth, with a good grace, can ask this money from these members, or their as-, signees, who are not at fault. This order was chartered under the laws of the commonwealth, and, if its officers exceed their authority, the penalty for this has been the withdrawal of its franchises. We do not see how the commonwealth could claim more. The members of the order, in good faith, paid in their assessments, and believe they were acting according to law and not against the public good, and when the objects of the order have failed through no fault of theirs, it is difficult to find any reason for the commonwealth to demand the money the certificate holders honestly paid to the association. The members have forfeited no right to their proportion of the funds paid in by them, neither have their assignees forfeited any rights of assignors to the fund.</p>
