At No. 338, September term, 1896, of the court of common pleas of Allegheny county, No. 1, sitting in equity, Frazer filed a bill against Linton averring a partnership and praying, inter alia, that Linton “be required to render an account showing the sales made of the <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>coal lands mentioned in the bill to the Johnson Coal Company, and the profits realized by defendant on same, and that defendant be required to pay to ” the plaintiff the one half of such profits. Subsequently the bill was amended by joining W. Y. Parkinson and H. W. Strickler with Frazer as plaintiffs. Linton, the defendant, in his answer denied the partnership averred in the bill and also “ his liability to pay to plaintiff anything on account of the matters therein contained.” The cause was duly proceeded with and said court found and declared that the agreement between said Linton, Frazer and Parkinson constituted a partnership, and that said parties were partners in the sale of said coal lands. The court further found that Frazer and Parkinson were entitled to the one half of the profits arising from the transactions of said partnership, to wit: to the sum of $2,511.85, and on October 26,1896, decreed that Linton pay the same to Frazer and Parkinson. The decree of the court on appeal by Linton was affirmed by the Supreme Court October 25, 1897.</p>

Petty, the defendant in this issue, <em>W. </em>Y. Parkinson and H. <em>W. </em>Strickler were called by the defendant to establish the subpartnership between Frazer, Parkinson and Strickler.

E. Frazer, Jr. The objection was overruled and the witnesses were permitted to testify. All parties are competent witnesses save those who come within the specified exceptions. It is claimed that the witnesses here come within the exception in clause <em>e, </em>section 5 of the statute. This clause provides: “Nor where any party to a thing or contract in action is dead .... and his right thereto or therein has passed, either by his own act or by the act of the law, to a party on the record who represents his interest in the subject in controversy, shall any surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract or any other person whose interest shall be adverse to the said right of such deceased .... party, be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of said party.” To disqualify a witness he must have an interest adverse to that of deceased. [R. B. Petty’s interest is not adverse to the right or interest of W. E. Frazer in the matter in controversy. On the contrary, he stands in Frazer’s shoes, and it is equally in the interest of both to enlarge or increase rather than diminish the funds in the hands of Linton. Petty’s testimony may tend to diminish the fund, but, if so, it is against his interest as well as the interest of Frazer. It is, however, the adverse interest and not the adverse testimony of a witness that disqualifies him. We think Petty is a competent witness in this proceeding.] [3] “ To exclude a witness,” says Justice Gibson, in Wolf v. Carothers, 3 S. &amp; R. 240, “ it is necessary that he should have a vested interest not in the question, but in the event of the suit. It must be an interest that the judgment in the cause would operate upon; for if by the event he would neither acquire nor lose a right, nor incur a responsibility which the law recognizes, he is competent. Every other kind of interest goes to his credibility.”</p>

We cannot see how Striekler can “acquire or lose a right ” or “ incur a responsibility ” by any conclusion at which we may arrive in this issue.

The true reason lies in the nature of the interest, which is not a specific thing, having a distinct and independent existence, but is a mere result, flowing from a comparison of accounts, and may fall on either side, as the balance happens to be. A specific debt or demand may be unliquidated, but nevertheless has its own independent existence, and may be ascertained by computation or by valuation. Not so with the interest of a partner in an unsettled partnership account. It results wholly from a comparison of the debits and credits of the partnership in the first instance, and then a comparison of the accounts between the partners themselves. If the debts of the firm exceed its' credits, there will be no balance for division between the partners, and if there be a bal<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>anee, whose it is or how much it is, or how much of it, cannot be known till the account between the partners themselves is settled.

From its judgment in defendant’s favor this appeal was taken by the plaintiff company, who in its specifications of error complains of the learned trial judge’s finding of fact, conclusions of law, etc.</p>
    <p id="b60-6" data-blocks='[["BL_60.7",60,[286,726,1171,352]]]'>Our consideration of the record, with special reference to each of these specifications, has failed to convince us that there is any error therein that would justify us in sustaining either of them. On the contrary, we are all of opinion that there is no substantial error in any of the learned judge’s findings of fact, conclusions of law, or in any of his rulings leading up to and including the entry of judgment for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b60-7" data-blocks='[["BL_60.8",60,[288,1087,1170,146]]]'>The court’s action in the premises is sufficiently vindicated in the opinion of its learned president, and on that we affirm the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b60-8" data-blocks='[["BL_60.9",60,[331,1240,358,45]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
