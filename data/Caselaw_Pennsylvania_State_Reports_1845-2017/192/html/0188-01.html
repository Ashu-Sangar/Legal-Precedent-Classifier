At the time of the accident plaintiff was stepping from the crossing upon the pavement. The wire was not over three eighths of an inch in diameter. Plaintiff described the accident as follows:</p>

I felt a sensation, a heavy burning sensation going through my whole system, and I had a great deal of pain and nervous shock. I arose the best way I could and looked around me to see what had happened, and I saw there was a wire lying there.”</p>

A. Well when I picked myself np my foot was on the wire. Q. Would you have had any reason in your own mind for not stepping on it if you had seen it, understand me, I mean as a person would step on a rope or anything of that sort to keep it from tripping them, would you have had any objection to doing that with that wire ? A. I do not think I would have touched it at all if I had seen it. Q. Why not ? A. I would not want to tread on it purposely. Q. What would be your objection to doing it ? A. I do not know that it would benefit me to tread on it. Q. Except as persons tread on an obstacle of that kind to keep them from coming up and tripping them. You say you would have objection to doing that ? A. If I would have seen it I would not have tread on it of course. Q. You would have been afraid? A. Yes. Q. Why? A. Because I knew that it was an electric wire. Q. That is, you would have thought to be dangerous to tread on it? A. Yes, sir. Q. So that makes you feel sure you did not purposely tread on it ? A. I did not tread on it purposely.</p>

Devlin, by her father and next friend, to recover damages for injuries she sustained by being brought in contact with a live electric light wire which was negligently left upon the sidewalk in the city of Chester by defendant company’s employees while they were engaged in readjusting the wires used for public street lighting, and the other, by her parents, James K. and Sarah Devlin, to recover damages sustained by them in consequence of their said daughter’s injury. Before trial, these cases were consolidated by order of court under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1897.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[294,846,1162,551]]]'>On the trial, the joint plaintiffs were nonsuited by the learned trial judge for the reason given by him in the concluding sentence of his charge, viz: “ the plaintiff either saw the dangerous wire and tread upon it, or was negligent in failing to see it, and in either case having contributed to the accident, we must direct the entry of a compulsory nonsuit.” Doubtless, for the same reason, because there is no possible ground for any other, he afterwards denied the motion to take off the nonsuit. Hence this appeal by the plaintiffs. The specifications of error, so far as relevant, are directed to the court’s action in refusing to take off the judgment of nonsuit.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[292,1406,1165,960]]]'>It was not denied, nor could it be with any reasonable hope of success, that the evidence tended strongly to prove that the defendant company was grossly negligent in leaving the wire in a position where it was liable to come in contact with other wires heavily charged with electricity, and thus endanger the lives of unsuspecting pedestrians and others passing and repassing along and across the public street. One of the two reasons assigned in support of the motion for a nonsuit was, “Because plaintiffs failed to prove negligence upon the part of the defendant.” This was wholly unwarranted by the testimony, and the learned trial judge rightly disposed of it by saying : “The evidence showed that the defendant in making some alterations in its line allowed an arc wire to lie upon the pavement in a much traveled part of the city, without guard or warning to passersby; that the plaintiff stepped upon it, and immediately received a shock that felled her to the ground and occasioned the injuries of which she complains. This, in our judgment, was sufficient to establish the negligence of the defendant in the first instance and require it to make answer.”</p>

      <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>As to tbe alleged contributory negligence of the injured plaintiff, it is sufficient tó say that a careful consideration of the testimony has satisfied us that the learned court below erred in denying the motion to take off the judgment of nonsuit. While there is some evidence bearing on the subject of contributory negligence that may be regarded as sufficient to go to the jury, it is not of such a character as to justify a trial judge in holding, as matter of law, that because of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence there can be no recovery. In order to reach that conclusion resort must be had to inferences of fact such as can be legally drawn only by a jury. We are of opinion that the legal conclusion of contributory negligence is unwarranted by any of the admitted or conclusively established facts in this case. In other words, upon the evidence before us the case should be properly submitted to and disposed of by a jury, and not by the court alone.</p>
