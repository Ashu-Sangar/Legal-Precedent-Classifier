On the day of the accident there was occasion to move one of the large stone slabs or tables on which leather was dressed. It was about twelve feet long, four and one half feet wide, and four inches thick. Plaintiff and other employees were summoned to help. It was raised upon its edge; rollers were put under it, one of which broke into the floor; the stone slipped off the roller; one of the defendants told the men to lift it up so as to put the roller under it, but not-with their hands; one Cooper, a fellow employee, took a crowbar and tried to lift it <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>up; <em>the </em>table or slab slipped off the <em>crowbar; </em>the other men saw it sliding and ran; plaintiff tried to get away, bnt slipped, and the table caught him around the ankle, and broke his foot. Plaintiff testified that while Groetzinger went to get something with which to lift it, Cooper, the man with the crowbar, undertook to lift it and it fell over.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[156,796,1177,1179]]]'>“We had been raising it with nothing but iron bars from the start. I took one of the bars which I had in my hand all the time from the time we started—I used to put my hand against the table and push on it, and carry the bar in my hand. Of course, it run very easy when on the rollers. I took one of the bars and one of the other men took the other bar and put it under the table to lift it up. The bottom of the table flew from us and the top came toward us. There was a hole back of August about three inches wide and two feet long, right between two joists. He stepped through the hole and the table fell over on him and broke his leg until the shin bone stuck out through the flesh. Q. When this roller went through the floor and when the stone fell down on the floor, what directions did Mr. Groetzinger give ? A. Mr. Groetzinger said, ‘ Take hold of it and raise it up.’ Q. You then put the bar under it? A. Yes, sir. Q. And it slipped away from you and fell over? A. Yes, sir. Q. Was Mr. Groetzinger present at the time? A. Mr. Groetzinger was present at the time, when he said, ‘ Raise it up and put another roller under it,’ but whether he was there when the table fell or not I would not say positive. But I judge he wasn’t very far away. I couldn’t have time to watch him all the time. Q. You were watching the stone and didn’t have your eyes on Mr. Groetzinger all the time ? A. Yes, sir.”</p>
