This portion was in 1871, condemned as being out of repair and dangerous to the traveling public, and was therefore put into repair by the supervisors of Ephrata township, and was kept and maintained by them as a county road, free of tolls, until 1884. On April 29,1884, the Clay and Hinkletown Turnpike Company, defendant, was incorporated for the purpose of building and maintaining a turnpike road, and by virtue of its right of eminent domain entered upon and took so much of the abandoned roadbed of the Downingtown, Ephrata and Harrisburg Turnpike as lay in the township of Ephrata. In September, 1884, the supervisors of Ephrata township presented their petitions to the court of quarter sessions, setting forth the above facts and praying that the Clay and Hinkletown Turnpike Company be not allowed to collect tolls on the said turnpike until it had paid the several townships in accordance with the Act of April 5,1870, P. L. 48, the sums alleged to have been expended by them on the repair1 and maintenance of the road from its abandonment by the Downingtown, Ephrata and Harrisburg Turnpike Company to its taking as aforesaid by the Clay and Hinkletown Turnpike Company.</p>

We might add that nowhere is it averred in the bill that the defendant is any way indebted to the supervisors of the township of Ephrata for or hy reason of the money expended on said abandoned road. Nor is it therein averred that the defendant claimed said abandoned turnpike road by virtue of the provisions of the act of 1870. The relief prayed for in the bill is that the defendant may he enjoined from the collection of tolls until a certain sum of money not alleged in the bill to be due by the defendant to the plaintiffs has been paid. How can this relief be granted ? The averments to support it are not found in the bill. This is a fatal. defect: Thompson’s App., <a href="/pa/126/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="126 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="968922" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0367-01">126 Pa. 367</a>. There must be a sufficient equity apparent on the face of the bill to warrant the granting the relief prayed for, and material facts relied on must he so distinctly stated as to be put in issue: Harding v.

If the contention of the appellant should prevail, the act of 1870 would practically be a dead letter; for, after years of <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>abandonment by a turnpike company, and years of maintenance by township authorities, involving large expense, those interested in the old turnpike could, by a reorganization under a new charter, reoccupy the road, absolved from all such liabilities as are imposed by the act. In other words, there could not be a conceivable case in which the terms of the act could not be evaded, if this interpretation contended for by the appellant should be given to it.</p>
