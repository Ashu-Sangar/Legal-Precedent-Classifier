    <p class="summary" id="b22-7" data-blocks='[["BL_22.13",22,[312,803,1170,958]]]'>The mortgage on which suit is brought was not executed by this defendant for any money loaned to or received by this affiant; nor was said mortgage executed and delivered by this affiant to secure payment of any debt lawfully contracted by the affiant; said mortgage was executed on the part of this affiant under duress and coercion of said John G. Kline, and was not executed by this affiant as her act and deed; nor was it executed by and with her consent. Affiant further says that she did not voluntarily and of her own free will sign, seal and deliver said mortgage; but on the contrary she did so with and under compulsion and coercion of her husband, the said John G. Kline. Affiant further says that when she executed said mortgage her husband was present, and that she did not sign, seal and deliver the same as her act and deed; nor was she examined separate and apart from her said husband when the same was executed on her part. And affiant therefore avers that she is not bound to pay said debt, nor is her property liable for the same, and claims that judgment should not be entered against her on the writ issued in this case.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b22-9" data-blocks='[["BL_22.15",22,[308,1932,1166,454]],["BL_23.1",23,[161,351,1171,1477]]]'>The averment that “ the mortgage .... was not executed .... for any money loaned to or received by the affiant ” is evasive. It fails to specifically deny that money was loaned on the mortgage, and the fair inference is that money may have been loaned to Mr. Kline, the husband, or the consideration of the mortgage may have been so loaned to Mr. Kline, the husband, or the consideration of the mortgage may have been his debt. It is scarcely necessary to cite authorities to sustain the legal proposition that a mortgage given by a wife for advances <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>to or debts of her husband, is valid and binding upon her separate estate. Moreover said averments and the succeeding statements that the mortgage was not executed “ to secure payment of any debt lawfully contracted by this affiant ” are statements not of facts, but of legal conclusions, and, as such, are faulty: Erie City v. Brady, <a href="/pa/127/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="127 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="565705" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0169-01">127 Pa. 169</a>; Commonwealth v. Snyder, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pa.%20Super.%20291" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Pa. Super. 291">1 Pa. Superior Ct. 291</a>. The averments as to duress and no separate acknowledgment are likewise faulty and insufficient, because it is nowhere stated in the affidavit that plaintiffs had any notice or knowledge of such duress, or failure to examine the wife separate or apart from her husband. Moreover there is no averment that plain-tiffs are-not bona fide mortgagees; the inference therefore is that plaintiffs are such, and that in good faith they loaned their money on the mortgage. It is not claimed that the acknowledgment is irregular or defective; an examination of same shows that it is regular and contains all the statutory requirements. This being so, such certificate is conclusive against the defendant, Mrs. Kline, except as to such persons as may have had notice of duress or irregularities: Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Rook, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20Pa.%20445" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="84 Pa. 445">84 Pa. 445</a>. In said case, Mr. Justice Gordon says: “ When a married woman joins her husband in a deed or mortgage to convey or incumber her separate estate as to bona fide vendee or mortgagee, for value, without notice of fraud or imposition in the procurement of the execution of such instrument, the certificate of the magistrate who takes the acknowledgment is conclusive of every material fact expressed therein. This certificate of the officer is a judicial act and cannot be impeached for fraud.” This doctrine is reaffirmed: Heilman v. Kroh, <a href="/pa/155/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="155 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="983261" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0001-01">155 Pa. 1</a>.</p>

Cavender, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20Pa.%20337" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="38 Pa. 337">38 Pa. 337</a>, and McCandless v.

A careful examination of said cases will show, however, in my opinion, that the facts and the legal points really decided do not sustain the contention of said counsel. In Michener v. Cavender, Woodward, J., at the opening of his opinion virtually admits the law to be as afterwards laid down in the Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Rook, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20Pa.%20445" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="84 Pa. 445">supra.</a> He says: “ Our recording acts having prescribed the form of acknowledgment necessary to be observed by married women, in order to make a valid conveyance or mortgage of their interests in real estate, this court has held the official <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>certificate of acknowledgment conclusive of every fact appearing on the face of the certificate, .... except in cases of fraud and duress. . . . And where fraud and duress have been practiced in obtaining the acknowledgment, knowledge of it is to be brought home to the grantee, or of such circumstances as would lead him to inquiry on the point.” Then Justice WOODWARD goes on to point out that, in the case there before him, there was no proof that the married woman had ever signed the mortgage in question, likening it to a forged paper or a counterfeit note. But, in the present case, Mrs. Kline fails to deny her signature, therefore she admits that she did in fact sign her name to the mortgage. In McCandless v. Engle, <a href="/pa/51/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="51 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="999758" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0309-01">supra,</a> the other authority relied on by counsel, the mortgagee was present at the acknowledgment of the mortgage. The trial judge left it to the jury to find whether said mortgagee had notice of the duress and failure to examine separate and apart from the husband. The jury, by their verdict, found that there was notice. But, in the present affidavit Mrs. Kline does not even hint at any knowledge of or notice to plaintiffs.</p>
