Five trustees are appointed by the will, and are named in the summons ; one of them is dead and two are nonresidents. The summons was served on only two of the trustees.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[292,764,1170,608]]]'>The plaintiff’s evidence tended to show that on the evening of October 3,1896, she came from a point beyond Jaspar street, which she crossed, and stepped into a hole in front of No. 1904, which was more than two feet long by more than a foot and a half wide and nearly a foot deep. She excused her failure to see the hole by the statement that the electric light was very poor. The house had been rented to a Mrs. Kress, about the previous Easter, and it was alleged by plaintiff that there were at the time some loose bricks in the pavement, and sweeping and cleaning by the tenants had enlarged the hole. It was repaired immediately after the accident, and it was alleged that the new bricks used in the repair still showed.</p>

The questions which the jury are to consider are, first of all, was the brick pavement out of repair; that is to say, were the bricks removed and was there a hole created by the removal of the bricks, or any other matter, touching the want of repair. You will understand that property owners are not responsible for the ordinary unevenness of a brick pavement, but only when the pavement itself is out of repair, or, in other words, when portions of a brick pavement are removed, or when there exists such a condition as is complained of here.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[148,1024,1174,404]]]'>Again, if you find that the brick pavement was out of repair, you will determine from the evidence whether it was dangerous or not. You will also determine from the evidence whether the want of repair in the pavement caused the injury complained of by the plaintiff.

In considering this question the jury will consider, first, her knowledge of the locality, of the pavement itself, and of the hole, and its want of repair. Again, the jury are to take into consideration a very important thing, and that is the time—whether it was daylight or night, or whether there was sufficient light, or what quantity of light was thrown upon the hole itself by the reflection of light in and about the place. Again, the jury will take into consideration all the difficulties and circumstances which might have entered into a consideration of the safety or danger of crossing that pavement, in the plaintiff’s mind, such as the darkness of the night, and the obscurity of the light, and all the attendant circumstances. In this connection I have also to say that the greater the difficulty of seeing clearly, renders the greater care on her part. The wayfarer is bound to consider the difficulties of seeing clearly, as he passes along, just as in ordinary circum<a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>3tances lie will consider any question which involves his safety. In this connection it is my duty to say to you that the plaintiff was not bound to exercise extraordinary care. She had a right to assume that the pavement was reasonably safe, and that by the ordinary use of her eyes she could safely walk upon it. Care, under all the circumstances, is all that the law enjoined upon her to exercise.</p>

By the Act of March 25,1805, 4 Sm. L. sec. 5, p. 233, the councils were authorized by ordinance to compel property owners to pave the footwalks. By Act of April 10,1826, P. L. 326, sec. 2, it was made the duty of property owners to have the footway in front of such ground curbed and paved and to keep the same in repair.</p>
    <p id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.6",163,[136,1103,1166,248]]]'>To the same effect are: Act of April 16, 1838, P. L. 626, sec. 3; Act of April 16,1840, P. L. 412, sec. 9; Act of March 22, 1865, P. L. 562, sec. 1, which provide that the municipal authorities are authorized and empowered, at the expense of the owners, to repair any footway and collect the cost thereof.</p>

So by the Act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, sec. 11, the municipal authorities may require sidewalks to be kept in repair by the property owners. So by the Act of May 7, 1889, P. L. 110, sec. 2, all sidewalks built by landowners along the public highways must be kept in repair by said landowner at his own expense. By the ordinance of May 3, 1855, sec. 1, p. 142 (Brightly’s Phila. Digest, p. 260, § 279), it is provided that the footways of all public streets and highways in the city of Philadelphia “shall be graded, curbed, paved and kept in repair at the expense of the owners of the ground fronting thereon.”</p>

    <p id="b164-5" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[304,542,1157,288]]]'>Without unnecessarily consuming time in referring here to the evidence relied on by the parties respectively, it is sufficient to say that our examination of the record has not disclosed any error in the proceedings, leading up to and including the judgment, that would justify us in sustaining any of the specifications.</p>

In affirming their fourth point, he properly instructed the jury in the words thereof thus: “ A person walking along the highway is required to exercise a reasonable watchfulness over his feet, and if the jury believe that this plaintiff, at the time of the accident, did not exercise such watchfulness, she cannot recover.”</p>
    <p id="b164-7" data-blocks='[["BL_164.7",164,[300,1258,1162,294]]]'>Viewed in the light of this instruction, the verdict in plaintiff’s favor necessarily implies a finding by the jury that she did exercise such “reasonable watchfulness,” in walking on the pavement in front of defendants’ house on the east side of York street,—the point at which she was injured,—and hence she was not guilty of contributory negligence.</p>
    <p id="b164-8" data-blocks='[["BL_164.8",164,[298,1561,1161,288]]]'>The question of defendants’ neglect of duty, in not keeping the pavement in front of their “ house in such order and condition as to permit persons traveling over and along said pavement, .... to do so safely, etc., was fairly submitted to the jury with instructions so full and adequate that no just exception can be taken thereto.</p>
    <p id="b164-9" data-blocks='[["BL_164.9",164,[296,1868,1160,298]]]'>The subject of complaint in the first specification is that “the court erred in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff, inasmuch as her statement .... sets forth no cause of action, but purports to be a breach of duty in failing to keep a part of the highway in repair; whereas there is no duty in law incumbent on defendants or any of them to keep the highway in repair.”</p>

Hence it is that, owing to this primary liability, many cases exist in this state, in which, after recovery from the municipality, the latter has successfully recovered over from the property owner on account of his breach of his primary duty to keep the sidewalk in a safe condition. Among these are Reading v.

Several statutes in this state also recognize the duty of the property owner to keep his sidewalk in a safe condition. By Act of March 25, 1805, 4 Smith’s Laws, 233, sec. 5, councils were authorized by ordinance to compel property owners to pave the footwalks; and by the Act of April 10, 1826, P.
