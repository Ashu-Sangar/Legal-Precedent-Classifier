This discretion, which is vested in him, is within his control. He is the sole judge of the circumstances which may influence him to exercise clemency or enforce the execution. The discretion carries within it the right to ascertain for himself the condition which may influence him in the exercise of these powers. The act in question transfers this inquiry to a commission in whose appointment he has no voice and whose decision has no controlling effect on him. He may disregard its finding and satisfy himself, from other sources, what is his duty with respect to the prisoner. This renders the statute futile. In any event, it seems to be an interference with the powers vested by the constitution and laws in the governor, and with the due and orderly administration of the law.

On motion of the district attorney, this plea was stricken off, for the reasons that the matters therein alleged could not then be heard, as they were without the jurisdiction of the court, and this was assigned as error to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Agnew, in delivering the opinion, passing upon these assignments of error, said:</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[155,339,1174,1127]]]'>
      <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>“ The last three assignments of error raise a single question upon the power of the court to inquire, by inspection and per testes, into the insanity of the prisoner since verdict. We have no precedents in this state, known to us, how the inquiry shall be conducted, when such a plea in bar of sentence is put in. It seems to us, however, that no right of trial by jury is involved in the question. A jury having found a verdict against the plea of insanity when set up as a defense to conviction, subsequent insanity cannot be set up in disproof of the conviction. The plea, at this stage, is only an appeal to the humanity of the court to postpone the punishment until a recovery takes place, or as a merciful dispensation. The rights of the prisoner, as an offender on trial for an offense, are not involved. He has had the benefit of a juiy trial, and it is now the court only which must be satisfied on the score of humanity. If the right of trial by jury exist at all, it must exist at all times, no matter how often the plea is repeated alleging insanity occurring since the last verdict. Such a right is inconsistent with the due administration of justice. There must be a sound discretion to be exercised by the court. If a case of real doubt arise, a just judge will not fail to relieve his own conscience by submitting the fact to a jury.”</p>

His case was appealed to the Supreme Court and the judgment of the lower court was affirmed. Application was made to the board of pardons. The testimony of physicians who testified at the trial that he was insane, and additional testimony submitted by other physicians who did not testify at the trial, was presented to, and fully considered by, the board of pardons, and, in their judgment, there was not sufficient proof of the prisoner’s insanity to cause them to make any recommen<a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>dation to the governor for a commutation of sentence.
