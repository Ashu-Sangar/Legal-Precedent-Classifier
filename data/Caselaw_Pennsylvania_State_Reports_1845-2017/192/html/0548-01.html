Conceding that the rule of law is that interest shall be charged against trustees commingling funds of their estate with their own, yet the auditors have concluded that, as a long period of time has elapsed, and settlements have been made on the basis of the interest charged in the accounts, and large payments have been paid to the exceptants, that it is equitable to all parties not to disturb the charge. The liability of an executor for interest in this state has been the subject of legislative enactment. By the 17th section of the Act of March 29, 1832, Purd. Dig. p. 300, pi. 165, it is provided that “ the amount of interest to be paid <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>in all cases by executors, administrators, and guardians shall be determined by the orphans’ court under all the circumstances of the case, but it shall not in any case exceed the legal rate of interest for the time being: ” Norris’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/71/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="71 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1031289" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0106-01">71 Pa. 106</a>.</p>
