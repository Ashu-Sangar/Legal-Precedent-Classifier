As it seems to us now the jury might well find that the bank, having control of the property, through their trustee, carried on the business, and were properly responsible for the manner in which it was conducted and for its results. It seems to us a fair question for the jury was raised under the testimony, to inquire into the operations of the trust, and we think that the defendant should be at liberty to show what the stock of goods was worth, what it sold for, what was done with the proceeds, and if he could establish facts which entitled him to claim that the bank had received, or ought to have received, satisfaction for the note in suit out of the sub<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>sequent management and disposition of the goods by the trustee, he should have the opportunity to do so. But all inquiry of this kind was shut off by the binding direction of the learned court below to the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount of the claim. We think, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, this was error aftd that the case should have been submitted to the jury on all its facts. For obvious reasons we cannot here discuss the facts nor decide the merits of the respective contentions.</p>
