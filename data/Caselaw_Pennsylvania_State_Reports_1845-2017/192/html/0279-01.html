Black, a claim was submitted in the sum of $3,500 upon a bond to prosecute an appeal with effect from a judgment in ejectment in the United States circuit court of October sessions, 1893, in which bond the decedent was a surety. The bond was in $5,000, to Mary K. L. Black, the plaintiff in the <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>original suit, conditioned that the principals therein, who are the defendants below, should prosecute their appeal to effect, and should answer all costs and damages if they should fail to make good their plea. The appeal was afterwards, March 17, 1898, quashed by the United States Supreme Court. The plaintiff claimed that the writ of error being a supers edeasi she was kept out of possession of her property from May 12,1896, to March 17, 1898, and she asked for the damages which had accrued from the loss of rent during that interval. The premises owned by the claimant, and which were the subject of the action, comprised some 912 acres which lay partly in Philadelphia and partly in Delaware counties, and they were known as Black’s Island. Three questions were presented : 1. What amount of damage, if any, had been sustained ? 2. Whether loss of rent arising from the detention of the property was among the damages covered by the bond? 3. Whether the appeal contemplated by the bond had been in fact taken?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[274,1244,1180,1181]],["BL_301.1",301,[147,353,1184,464]]]'>The testimony respecting the rental value during the period of eviction, given by the expert witnesses, differed. One of them fixed it at $2.75 per acre for the whole tract, an aggregate of $2,508 yearly, and another at $1.75 per acre, or a total of $1,596 yearly. These witnesses appeared for the claimant. Frederick Black, one of the defendants, who already occupied a part of the land, accepted, in 1894, a lease of the entire tract from the plaintiff at the yearly rent of $2,000, payable on condition that the plaintiff should insure him possession. He never paid the rent, and continued in his original holding only by an arrangement which he made with the other defendants. After the appeal was determined, the land was subdivided, part being occupied by Frederick Black and part by the remaining children. The former rented 218 acres at $2.00 per acre, and 143 acres at $1.50 per acre, a total rent of $650.50. The others rented from claimant 200 acres at $2.00 per acre, and 78 acres at $1.00 per acre,, making $478 yearly. The remaining 273 acres do not seem to have been rented at all, and were worth to a tenant, according to the testimony of one of the children, $1.00 per acre. Accepting as the standard of value the estimate which was adopted by both parties, by the claimant as lessor when she executed the leases, and by the children as lessees when they agreed to pay the rent, the total rent for the <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>tract would be $1,401.50 per annum, or $2,452.59 for tbe time now claimed for. The improvements which it was alleged were made by the tenants cannot be set off against an award for the claimant for the reason that some of them were necessary repairs which it was the duty of the lessees to provide, and others, although apparently permanent, were not annexed to the freehold Among the latter was a dwelling house, which was erected on piles expressly to facilitate its renewal. The auditing judge finds the damages amount to $2,452.59.</p>

In Keyser v. Keen, <a href="/pa/17/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="17 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="967585" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0327-01">17 Pa. 327</a>, the action was brought against one of six obligors as named in the bond, though five only had signed, and the instrument was a bond of indemnity to indemnify the obligee against loss for having become surety for a deputy sheriff on his bond to the sheriff. The bond contained an admission that the obligee had become surety for the deputy, on the promise of the six to indemnify him against loss by reason of his suretyship. It was claimed for the surety sued that he was not liable because he signed upon the faith that all were to sign, but we said, Low-B.IE, J.: “ This bond was prepared for six obligors and is executed by only five of them; yet we cannot, therefore, infer that it is incomplete and not binding on those who did execute it. . . . . The bond, declares that the plaintiff below had become surety for another person, on the promise of the six persons named in it, that they would indemnify him. This is an admission by the five who executed the bond, that they were jointly bound to indemnify the plaintiff; and although they do allege that another person agreed to become bound with them, yet when we find their bond in the hands of the plaintiff it is impossible to imply that it was not intended to bind them to <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>tbeir admitted duty.

The bond was given in pursuance of Rule 29 of the Supreme Court of the United States, which in real actions gives damages “ for the use and detention of the property, and the costs of the suit, and just damages for the delay and costs and interest on the appeal.” The condition of the bond is that it is to be void if the appellants “ shall prosecute the said writ to effect and answer all damages and costs if they fail to make their plea good.”</p>

Some contention was made in the court below and is made here to the effect that no damages can be recovered on appeal bonds given in ejectment cases for the use and detention of the property pending the appeal, in consequence of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Kountze v. Omaha Hotel Co., <a href="/us/107/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="107 U.S. 378" data-case-ids="3499305" data-case-paths="/us/107/0378-01">107 U. S. Rep. 378</a>.

In this latter class of proceedings it was held, the land is not the subject of the controversy; it does not belong to the mortgagee, but to the mortgagor, and he has a lawful right to continue in possession until the final termination of the case. But in ejectment for the land the plaintiff claims the land itself, because it belongs to him, and he is wrongfully deprived of its possession. Hence the mere continuance of the use and possession after verdict is a wrong to the plaintiff who has recovered a verdict and judgment, and is a just cause for damage for which he is to be paid. This distinction is carefully drawn in t|ie opinion and the decision is therefore inapplicable to the present case, which is an ordinary ejectment for the recovery of the land itself. There is nothing in conflict with this in Roberts v. Cooper, <a href="/us/60/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="19 How. 373" data-case-ids="6142095" data-case-paths="/us/60/0373-01">19 How. 373</a>.

But the fact was that the lease" to Frederick Black was made in March, 1894, and terminated in March, 1895, which was a year before the appeal bond was given, and that he never had possession under that lease while the appeal was pending, and never paid a dollar of rent to the plaintiff for any part of the land during the pending of the appeal. He distinctly testified that he never obtained possession of the land under the lease, and he also testified as follows respecting that lease: “ Q. This lease expired in March, 1895, did it not? A. Yes, sir; she never had possession of it. Q. And you never got possession under this lease? A. Not of the entire tract. Q. And you .never felt justified in paying the rent which was agreed to be paid under <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>this lease did you? A. No, sir. Q. And this lease terminated, as I say, in March, 1895, prior to the appeal being taken? A. Yes, sir. Q. And from that time until the day when the marshal put the plaintiff in possession of the land, you never paid any rent at all? A. Not to my knowledge; no, sir, or to Mrs. Mary K. L. Black.”</p>
    <p id="b305-3" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[134,655,1180,191]]]'>There was no testimony in contradiction of the foregoing, and it is very evident that the claim of the appellee is not subject to any deductions on account of any rents received from Fred. Black.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[134,863,1182,1545]],["BL_306.1",306,[301,346,1173,93]]]'>The only remaining matter to be considered is a claim for the value of improvements which it is alleged for the appellant were put upon the land by the defendants in the ejectment case while they were in possession. There were two of these improvements for the value of which claim was made. One was a new frame house built by Daniel N. Black, one of the defendants in the ejectment case, which he testified cost him $1,300. But he also said it was built on piles so that it could be removed, and he expected to remove it whenever he left the land. The other improvement was the repair of an old house so as to make it habitable. It was done by Daniel Black’s mother for her own use, and it cost $1,000. This was of course permanent and would remain with the land. It was built however in 1897, after verdict and judgment in the ejectment case, and while the appeal was pending. The court below decided that no allowance could be made for either of these improvements, and the authorities are certainly that way. The general rule applicable in this class of cases is perhaps best stated in Morrison v. Robinson, <a href="/pa/31/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="31 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="985118" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0456-01">31 Pa. 456</a>, thus: “ But one who forcibly disseizes another and makes such improvements, or one who makes them after action brought to try the title, can have no claim to have his improvements estimated; because he has no right to choose the mode of improvement of another man’s property against his known will, and justice will not compensate him at the hazard of doing wrong to the owner.” In Wilkinson v. Pearson, <a href="/pa/23/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="23 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="973998" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0117-01">23 Pa. 117</a>, it was held that it was not error to refuse to receive evidence on the trial of an ejectment that valuable improvements had been made by the defendant in possession, since the trial of a former ejectment for the same premises. In Steele v. Spruance, <a href="/pa/22/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="22 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="413745" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0256-01">22 Pa. 256</a>, the same ruling was <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>made in a case in which the improvements were made after the verdict in an ejectment.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[296,449,1177,301]]]'>But a still more serious objection to any allowance for these improvements is that so far as the mother is concerned she simply made a necessary repair to an old building so that she could live in it. The other house which was previously occupied had burnt down and was not rebuilt. The old one that was repaired was simply used in its place.</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[289,757,1181,407]]]'>It is very clear to us that no allowance can be made for these expenditures by way of abatement from the amount to which the plaintiff in the ejectment suit was entitled, as damages for use and detention, and hence no error was committed by the learned court below in refusing to abate the claim upon the present fund. There is no question as to the correctness of the computation of damages by the court below, and hence it is not discussed. The assignments of error are all dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b306-6" data-blocks='[["BL_306.7",306,[290,1171,1176,95]]]'>The decree of the court below is affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
