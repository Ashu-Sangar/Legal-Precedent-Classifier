Every case must be decided upon its own peculiar circumstances. A rate of commission that would be very liberal compensation in one case, would be entirely inadequate in another. In this case there can be no question that the labors of the accountant were very considerable and his responsibility very great. These are the two elements to be considered in fixing his compensation. The estates of the two decedents consisted almost wholly of real estate located all over the city of Philadelphia. There were upwards of fifty different pieces of this real estate sold by the accountant. In almost every instance the properties were incumbered with mortgages, arrears of taxes, municipal claims, etc. By direction of the court the properties were sold clear of incumbrances. This increased the labors of the accountant as well as his responsibility, as it necessitated paying off the mortgages as well as the other incumbrances in each case, and of course, involved making settlements, not only with the different purchasers, but also with the mortgagees, the city of Philadelphia and the other lien creditors. The amount of money that thus went through the hands of the accountant was considerably over $1,000,000. It was claimed that as this real estate was largely incumbered, all the interest the estate had therein was the equity over the mortgage, and that the commission should only be charged upon this amount, but the real estate was directed to be sold clear. This was proper for sev<a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>eral reasons, particularly to get rid of the testator’s bonds which in each case accompanied the mortgages, and his estate could not well be finally settled with these outstanding. Thus the whole of the large sum above mentioned went through the hands of the accountant. It was not only received, but, excepting the comparatively small balance now for distribution, was disbursed by the accountant in the way of paying incumbrances and other debts and obligations of the testators. It was claimed by the executors that a very large part of the work done in this estate was done by them; that they aided and assisted the accountant in preparing for the sale of the real estate, and in every other duty he had to perform, and that, while there was a great deal of labor, he did not do it all. But, notwithstanding, the labors of the accountant in managing this large estate must have been very great and he should, of course, be adequately paid. The only question is whether the amount charged is not too much. The total amount of the commissions upon both estates aggregates $43,993.18. This is an amount of money sufficiently large to compensate for a great deal of work, and while there was, no doubt, considerable done in these estates, yet the auditing judge thinks that in view of the large amount upon which the commissions are calculated, that the sum of $35,000 would be not only compensatory but a very liberal allowance. This sum is allowed, and the accountant will be surcharged with $8,993.18, the difference.</p>

He took the goods of the estate at the appraised value, amounting to about $500, and received the residue of the $9,400 in four payments.

This is objected to as excessive. The amount is large, but it is unquestionable that the trouble and responsibility were great. The auditing judge states that there were upwards of fifty pieces of real estate, located all over the city of Philadelphia, in almost every instance incumbered.with mortgages, arrears of taxes and municipal claims. We have only to look at our own records to be reminded what persistent litigants the two decedents were, especially inresistance to claims for taxes and municipal improvements. By direction of the court the properties were sold clear of incumbrances, and this involved settlements, not only with purchasers, but with mortgagees, lien creditors, and particularly the city of PhiladelpMa. This general outline is sufficient to indicate the exceptional nature of the accountant’s labor.</p>
