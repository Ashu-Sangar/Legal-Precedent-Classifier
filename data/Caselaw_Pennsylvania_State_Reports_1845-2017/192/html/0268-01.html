The third is quoted in full above; and the fourth authorized the mayor to enter security for damages resulting to private property from the construction of said sewers. The contract awarded to J.

Nor is any reference made to the ordinance itself except in the use of the words, “ as authorized by ordinance approved June 27,1895; ” and these words evidently refer only to the location and extent of the sewers to be constructed.

It is not our purpose, nor is it necessary to discuss at length the questions presented by the record. There is much force in the contention of appellees’ counsel that the 3d section of the ordinance of June 27, 1895, was impliedly repealed by the ordinance of October 25, 1895, approving the contractor’s sureties and giving the necessary consent of the city to the contract, then and there finally executed, and as it now appears. While the contract thus finally executed by all the parties thereto distinctly specifies time and terms of payment different <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>from the provisions of said 3d section, we are not prepared to say that there is such irreconcilable conflict as to warrant the conclusion that said section was impliedly repealed by the ordinance of October 25, 1895.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[277,546,1186,821]]]'>Properly construed, the 3d section of the ordinance relied on by appellants never created, nor was it intended to create, any contractual or other relation between the city and its contractors for municipal improvements, or subcontractors under the latter, or between any of them, that would authorize the maintenance of any such proceeding as that now under consideration. If it did, it would be clearly ultra vires the city councils and also void, as being manifestly in conflict with sound principles of public policy long recognized and firmly established in this commonwealth. As it appears to us, the only clause in said 3d section that suggests even a colorable right to maintain such a proceeding as that now under consideration is the following : “ And satisfactory evidence shall be furnished that full compensation has been made for all labor done and materials furnished.” We think the attempt to impose this injunction on the director of public works was ultra vires and void.</p>
    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[277,1377,1184,873]]]'>Appellants’ contention proceeds upon the erroneous theory that municipal corporations, or the officers thereof, may do anything—not actually forbidden bylaw—which the caprice of councils or of executive officers may consider to be for the interests of the municipality. This is a mistake. Nothing is better settled than that a municipal corporation does not possess and cannot exercise any other than the following powers: (1) those granted in express words; (2) those necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted; (3) those essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation, not simply convenient but indispensable. Any fair, reasonable doubt as to the existence of power is resolved by the courts against its existence in the corporation, and therefore denied: Dillon on Municipal Corporations, sec. 89. It is equally well settled that the agents, officers or city councils of a municipality cannot bind the corporation by any contract not within the scope of its powers : Dillon on Municipal Corporations, sec. 457.</p>
    <p id="b294-7" data-blocks='[["BL_294.7",294,[278,2255,1179,149]],["BL_295.1",295,[146,355,1181,773]]]'>It is unnecessary to multiply authorities for the purpose of showing that city councils have no authority whatever, express or implied, to provide a new remedy in the nature of an attach<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>ment, lien or trust of any kind whereby subcontractors may enforce payment of their claim ont of money due the principal contractor. On grounds of public policy, the legislature has hitherto withheld from contractors and subcontractors, not only the right of lien on public buildings, but also the right of attaching money in the hands of the city. On the same principle, it cannot be successfully contended that councils may by ordinance empower the director of public works to retain money due one of the city’s contractors in order that his creditors, who are not parties to the contract, may proceed by bill in equity or otherwise against him, and thus have the money applied to their claims. In other words, city councils are powerless to provide any remedy to be used as a substitute for attachment or any other remedy which the legislature has heretofore withheld on grounds of public policy or otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[146,1136,1179,147]]]'>For these and other reasons that might be added we are clearly of opinion that there was no error in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[191,1291,1078,45]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellants’ costs.</p>
