        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nThe issue in this appeal is whether the Recidivism Risk Reduction Incentive Act, 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4501-4512 (\u201cRRRI Act\u201d), which makes certain offenders eligible for release on parole before the expiration of their minimum terms of imprisonment, applies to defendants who are sentenced to mandatory minimum terms required by two drug trafficking sentencing provisions, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317 and \u00a7 7508. The Superior Court concluded that the RRRI Act was applicable, and affirmed the judgments of sentence imposed by the trial court. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nOn April 1, 2009, in accordance with negotiated plea agreements, appellee pled guilty to two separate cases of trafficking drugs. In the first case (\u201cNo. 1808\u201d), appellee pled guilty to delivery of a controlled substance and criminal use of a communication facility after he sold less than ten grams of cocaine to a police detective on September 12, 2008. Since the delivery occurred within 1000 feet of a school, the Commonwealth invoked the mandatory sentencing provision at 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(a), which requires imposition of a mandatory \u201cminimum sentence of at least two years of total confinement.\u201d\nIn the second case (\u201cNo. 1809\u201d), appellee pled guilty to delivery of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, criminal use of a communication facility, possession of a controlled substance (two counts), and possession of drug paraphernalia, relating to a second sale of cocaine to the detective on October 15, 2008, as well as a search of appellee\u2019s residence which yielded approximately 24 grams of cocaine. Since the weight of the cocaine was greater than 10 grams but less than 100 grams, the Commonwealth invoked the mandatory sentencing provision at 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a)(3)(h), which requires \u201ca mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\u201d of \u201cthree years.\u201d\nAt the sentencing hearing on April 29, 2009, in accordance with the plea agreements, the trial court sentenced appellee to the applicable mandatory terms of imprisonment of two to four years in No. 1808 and three to six years in No. 1809, directing that the sentences be served concurrently. The Commonwealth objected to any determination that appellee was eligible for a recidivism risk reduction incentive (\u201cRRRI\u201d) program, asserting that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of Sections 6317 and 7508 superseded the provisions of the RRRI Act. The trial court disagreed, and determined that appellee was an eligible offender pursuant to the RRRI Act. Accordingly, in addition to the mandatory sentences imposed under Section 6317 and Section 7508, the trial court imposed an RRRI Act minimum sentence of 18 months in No. 1808 and 27 months in No. 1809. As a result, appellee was afforded the opportunity to be paroled six months and nine months earlier than he would be under the respective mandatory minimum terms imposed in the two cases.\nThe Commonwealth appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in applying the RRRI Act to the mandatory minimum penalties of Sections 6317 and 7508(a)(3)(ii). In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court concluded that the General Assembly intended the RRRI Act to supplement existing sentencing law. While acknowledging that the RRRI Act reduced the time that some inmates would otherwise be incarcerated, the court reasoned that the RRRI Act reflected a legislative scheme that \u201cemphasized rehabilitative programming instead of sentence modification.\u201d Tr. Ct. Op., 7/8/09, at 5. The court noted that the RRRI Act did not require offenders to be released prior to the expiration of the mandatory minimum sentence; it merely provided them with the opportunity for an earlier release upon completion of an RRRI program. Because certain drug offenders, even those subject to mandatory penalties like appellee, were not excluded from the definition of \u201celigible offender,\u201d the trial court determined that it did not err in evaluating appellee\u2019s RRRI eligibility as part of its sentencing determination.\nThe court further observed that the General Assembly required judges to comply with the existing Sentencing Code, as well as to apply the provisions of the RRRI Act. In this case, the court complied with these directives by imposing mandatory minimum sentences under the Sentencing Code, while also fashioning RRRI Act minimum sentences. Finally, to the extent that there was a conflict between the drug trafficking sentencing provisions and the RRRI Act, the trial court opined that the RRRI Act must prevail, since it was adopted more recently.\nThe Superior Court affirmed in a published opinion, agreeing that the mandatory drug trafficking sentencing provisions did not supersede the RRRI Act. Commonwealth v. Hansley, 994 A.2d 1150 (Pa.Super.2010). Applying the construction tenet of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (matters not included in a statutory provision are deemed to be excluded), the panel concluded that the General Assembly did not intend to exclude appellee from RRRI Act eligibility because the mandatory sentencing provisions applicable to him were not included as any of the RRRI Act\u2019s specified conditions of ineligibility. Moreover, the court reasoned, the RRRI Act did not expand the trial court\u2019s authority to deviate from the mandatory minimum sentences; rather, the RRRI Act minimum sentence was conditional only, and indicated the point at which the offender \u2014 at the discretion of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (\u201cParole Board\u201d) \u2014 may be released on parole.\nThe Commonwealth appealed from the Superior Court\u2019s decision, and we granted allocatur, rephrasing the issue only for clarity, as follows:\nWhether the Recidivism Risk Reduction Incentive Act, 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4501-4512, is applicable to mandatory minimum penalties imposed pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508 and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317?\nCom. v. Hansley, 608 Pa. 418, 12 A.3d 285 (2011) (per curiam order).\nThe Commonwealth challenges the trial court\u2019s application of the mandatory penalties of Sections 6317 and 7508 on several bases. First, the Commonwealth asserts that the trial court lacked the authority to impose lesser minimum penalties than those prescribed by those statutes. Because the imposition of a minimum sentence under the RRRI Act allows appellee to be released from prison before his mandatory minimum sentences expire, the Commonwealth concludes that the sentences imposed were illegal. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14.\nThe Commonwealth next asserts that the drug trafficking sentencing statutes conflict with the RRRI Act, and the plain language of the former provisions establish that the General Assembly intended the mandatory penalties to \u201coverride\u201d any other conflicting statutes, then-existing or later-adopted. The Commonwealth highlights the language in Section 6317(a), which states that it applies \u201c... notwithstanding any other provision of this title, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or other statute to the contrary,\u201d and the language in Section 7508(a) which similarly states, \u201c[notwithstanding any other provisions of this or any other act to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply.... \u201d\nAs an apparent alternative argument, the Commonwealth describes a manner in which' the RRRI Act and the drug sentencing provisions may be read together so as to accomplish the objectives of each. With regard to Section 7508, the Commonwealth reasons that appellee must serve a term of incarceration in compliance with Section 7508, but that does not alter his status as an eligible offender under the RRRI Act for purposes of present and future crimes. The Commonwealth focuses on the phrase \u201chas not been found guilty or previously convicted\u201d in Section 4503(6) of the RRRI Act. It reasons that \u201c[t]he exclusion of the violations of [35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113](a)(30) for the highest weight of drugs does not only impact the eligibility of the offender for RRRI in the current case, but also for future offenses.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15-16. The Commonwealth then posits that, \u201c[appellee] would be eligible for an RRRI [Act] minimum sentence if the trial court would have to run another sentence consecutive to Count 1 herein.\u201d Id. at 16. The Commonwealth explains that the RRRI Act defined \u201celigible offender\u201d in this manner in order to put defendants on notice of the impact of these convictions in the future.\nReading Section 6317 and the RRRI Act together, the Commonwealth notes that the RRRI Act does not affirmatively mention school-zone mandatory penalties as being subject to the RRRI Act\u2019s minimum sentence. Because the school-zone statute does not affect future RRRI eligibility, the Commonwealth determines that the RRRI Act is still effective, even if it is deemed not to apply to Section 6317 drug offenders. Moreover, the Commonwealth continues, the language of Section 6317 indicates that that statute is superior to any other statute that conflicts with its mandatory penalties.\nFinally, the Commonwealth relies on the rule of statutory construction dictating that when a general provision conflicts with a \u201cspecific\u201d provision, they should be read in a manner that gives effect to both; and if the conflict cannot be reconciled, the specific provision controls the general one, unless the general provision is later in time and there is a \u201cmanifest intention\u201d that the general provision control. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933. The Commonwealth notes that \u201c[statutes designed to establish proper procedures for sentencing all defendants who commit crimes are general provisions.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16-17 (citing Commonwealth v. Klingensmith, 437 Pa.Super. 453, 650 A.2d 444, 447 (1994)). In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the RRRI Act is such a general provision since it \u201cgoverns the sentencings of all defendants,\u201d whereas Sections 6317 and 7508 are specific provisions since they \u201care applicable only to a small subset of defendants____\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17. Recognizing that the RRRI Act was enacted more recently than the mandatory penalties of Sections 6317 and 7508, the Commonwealth contends that the earlier-in-time provisions still control because there is no \u201cmanifest intention\u201d that the general RRRI Act supersede those specific mandatory penalties.\nAppellee counters that the trial court did not err in applying the RRRI Act, and that the sentences imposed were entirely lawful. Since the Legislature specifically excluded only some drug offenses from RRRI Act eligibility, appellee argues, the logical conclusion is that the remaining offenders are eligible for RRRI programs. Appellee\u2019s offenses were not ones designated by the RRRI Act as ineligible offenses. In appellee\u2019s view (and as the lower courts reasoned), the RRRI statute merely supplements the existing sentencing requirements. Thus, the sentencing judge still imposes mandatory sentences as required, but now must simply determine if the defendant is RRRI Act-eligible and if so, what his RRRI Act minimum sentence would be. Appellee analogizes the RRRI Act to the motivational boot camp program, 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3901-3909, which allows a judge to designate an offender as boot-camp eligible even when imposing a mandatory minimum sentence. Finally, if there is a conflict between the drug trafficking sentencing provisions and the RRRI Act, appellee maintains, the RRRI Act must be applied because it was the more recently adopted statute.\nA number of criminal defense organizations have filed amicus curiae briefs in support of appellee. The joint brief submitted on behalf of the Pennsylvania Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Public Defender Association of Pennsylvania largely echoes the rationale of the lower courts and appellee (i.e., there is no statutory conflict because the mandatory sentence is imposed along with the RRRI Act minimum sentence). The second defense-side amicus brief, submitted by the Defender Association of Philadelphia, maintains that the mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and the RRRI Act are irreconcilable because the former prohibit what the latter expressly requires \u2014 a minimum term of incarceration less than that provided for in the mandatory minimum sentencing statutes. Because of this irreconcilability, amicus argues that the RRRI Act and the corresponding amendments to the Sentencing Code, which were enacted later than the mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, impliedly repeal the mandatory minimum sentencing statutes to the extent that they are irreconcilable.\nThe issue in this appeal involves statutory construction, which is a question of law; thus, our review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Garzone, 613 Pa. 481, 34 A.3d 67, 74 (2012). In interpreting statutes, we are guided by the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1991, as well as our decisional law.\nThe object of all statutory interpretation \u201cis to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly\u201d and each statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions, id. \u00a7 1921(a); consideration of the statute\u2019s provisions may include its preamble. Id. \u00a7 1924. We presume that the Legislature \u201cdoes not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable\u201d and \u201cintends the entire statute to be effective and certain.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1922(1), (2). The plain language of the statute is generally the best indicator of legislative intent. Commonwealth v. McCoy, 599 Pa. 599, 962 A.2d 1160, 1166 (2009). When the statutory language is free from ambiguity, a court should not disregard the letter of the statute in order to pursue its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b); Commonwealth v. Cooper, 611 Pa. 437, 27 A.3d 994, 1003 (2011). Penal provisions such as the ones at issue here must be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(1).\nWhen evaluating the interplay of several statutory provisions, we recognize that statutes that relate to the same class of persons are in pan materia and \u201cshould be construed together, if possible, as one statute.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1932. When two statutes appear to conflict, they shall be construed so that effect may be given to both, if possible. Id. \u00a7 1933. When the conflict between the provisions cannot be reconciled, \u201cthe special provisions shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision shall be enacted later and it shall be the manifest intention of the General Assembly that such general provision shall prevail.\u201d Id. Finally, if there is a conflict among statutes enacted by different General Assemblies, \u201cthe statute latest in date of final enactment shall prevail.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1936.\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to an analysis of the language of the applicable statutes. The drug trafficking sentencing provisions (Sections 6317 and 7508), adopted in 1997 and 1988, respectively, require the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence. These statutes unambiguously state that the mandatory sentencing provisions must be imposed \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d any conflicting statutory provisions. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6317(a), 7508(a).\nIn 2008, the Governor signed into law the RRRI Act, 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4501-4512. The RRRI Act permits offenders who exhibit good behavior and who complete rehabilitative programs in prison to be eligible for reduced sentences. The express purpose of the chapter is:\nto create a program that ensures appropriate punishment for persons who commit crimes, encourages inmate participation in evidence-based programs that reduce the risks of future crime and ensures the openness and accountability of the criminal justice process while ensuring fairness to crime victims.\n61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4502. The RRRI Act does not apply to all defendants, but only to certain \u201celigible offenders,\u201d a term that does not include those with a history of violent crime, convicted of certain sex offenses, or subject to a deadly weapon enhancement. See id. \u00a7 4503.\nThe RRRI Act prescribes separate duties for the sentencing judge and the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole. When a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment in a state correctional facility, the court must also determine if the defendant is eligible for an RRRI Act minimum sentence, see 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4505(a). The prosecutor may waive the eligibility requirements, but the court may refuse to accept that waiver after hearing from the victim. Id. \u00a7 4505(b). If the sentencing court concludes that a defendant is eligible for an RRRI Act minimum sentence, or the prosecutor has waived the eligibility requirements, then the court must impose the minimum and maximum sentences, as well as an RRRI Act minimum sentence. Id. \u00a7 4505(c)(1), (2); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756. A court may decline to impose an RRRI Act minimum sentence if the offender has already been afforded two or more RRRI Act minimum sentences. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4505(c)(3). The court must also \u201ccompl[y] with all other applicable sentencing provisions, including provisions relating to victim notification and the opportunity to be heard.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4505(c)(4).\nAlthough the court imposes an RRRI Act minimum sentence, the offender is not guaranteed a right to be granted parole upon the expiration of that term. See id. \u00a7 4506(d) (\u201cNothing in this section shall be interpreted as granting a right to be paroled to any person.... \u201d). Instead, the Parole Board is tasked with issuing a decision to parole an offender upon completion of the RRRI Act minimum sentence only if the Parole Board independently determines that the offender has successfully completed the required recidivism risk reduction incentive or other similar program, as well as several other requirements (e.g., it does not reasonably appear that defendant presents risk to public safety). Id. \u00a7 4506(a)(1)-(10).\nSignificantly, at the same time that the General Assembly passed the RRRI Act, it made corresponding changes to the Sentencing Code to provide for the possibility of parole before an offender\u2019s minimum sentence expired. In pertinent part, the Legislature amended Section 9756 of the Sentencing Code (\u201cSentence of total confinement\u201d) to include new subsection (b)(2), which states that \u201c[t]he minimum sentence imposed under this section may not be reduced through parole prior to the expiration of the minimum sentence unless otherwise authorized by this section or other law.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b)(2) (emphasis added). To account for the minimum sentence contemplated in the new RRRI Act, the Legislature also added new Section 9756(b.l) to the Sentencing Code, which provides:\n(b.l) Recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence. \u2014 The court shall determine if the defendant is eligible for a recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence under 61 Pa.C.S. Ch. 45 (relating to recidivism risk reduction incentive). If the defendant is eligible, the court shall impose a recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence in addition to a minimum sentence and maximum sentence except, if the defendant was previously sentenced to two or more recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentences, the court shall have the discretion to impose a sentence with no recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b.l) (emphasis added).\nApplying principles of statutory construction, we have no hesitation in concluding that the RRRI Act is applicable to the mandatory minimum penalties imposed pursuant to Sections 6317 and 7508. The RRRI Act\u2019s definition of \u201celigible offenders\u201d includes a list of \u201celigibility requirements,\u201d all of which must be met. The eligibility requirements operate to exclude many crimes, and many circumstances, from the Act\u2019s scope. See supra n. 13 (quoting Section 4503). Notably, the eligibility requirement in subsection (6) specifically addresses drug offenders, but the requirement, by its terms, simply does not exclude an offender such as appellee. Rather, subsection (6) captures drug offenders who, inter alia, were subject to mandatory sentencing provisions other than Section 6317(a) and Section 7508(a)(3)(ii), the mandatory sentencing provisions applicable to appellee\u2019s crimes. See 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4503(6) (listing eligible offender requirement that defendant \u201c[h]as not been found guilty or previously convicted of violating section 13(a)(14), (30) or (37) of [35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113], where the sentence was imposed pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a)(l)(iii), (2)(iii), (3)(iii), (4)(iii), (7)(iii) or (8)(iii) (relating to drug trafficking sentencing and penalties)\u201d).\nThe RRRI Act eligibility provision is detailed, intricate, and plain; by its terms, appellee is an eligible offender. Moreover, the intricate construct reveals that the General Assembly made very specific judgments about which offenders and offenses were eligible. It did not exclude all drug offenders, or even all drug offenders subject to mandatory sentences. Appellee\u2019s circumstances qualify.\nMoreover, setting aside the Commonwealth\u2019s other arguments for the moment, we disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence by fashioning an RRRI Act minimum sentence that was less than the minimum penalties prescribed by the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions to which appellee was subject. To be sure, the alternative minimum sentences authorized under the RRRI Act may result in appellee\u2019s release from prison prior to the expiration of the mandatory minimum penalties required by Sections 6317 and 7508, but that fact does not make appellee\u2019s RRRI Act minimum sentence \u201cillegal\u201d; the RRRI Act alternative sentences, no less than the mandatory sentences imposed, are authorized by statute.\nThe classic claim of an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d is one that exceeds the statutory limits. Commonwealth v. Bradley, 575 Pa. 141, 834 A.2d 1127, 1131 (2003). Appellee\u2019s sentence is within those limits. Moreover, the Sentencing Code amendments require that an RRRI Act minimum sentence be imposed \u201cin addition to a minimum sentence,\u201d not instead of the minimum sentence. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b.l). In this case, the trial court imposed mandatory minimum sentences within the statutory limits, in accordance with Sections 6317 and 7508, and also imposed RRRI Act minimum sentences, in accordance with the RRRI Act. We discern no impediment to implementation of the directive in Sections 6317 and 7508 that the drug trafficking sentencing provisions shall be applied \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d any other provisions because, in this case, that is exactly what occurred.\nNor are we persuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s alternative argument that the RRRI Act and the mandatory sentencing provisions may be read together so that each remains effective. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument regarding Section 7508, while creative, is not supported by the plain language of the RRRI Act. As we have explained, under the plain language of the eligibility provisions, an offender such as appellee is RRRI Act-eligible. Nothing in Section 4503(6) dictates that an offender such as appellee is RRRI Act-eligible only if the trial court implements a consecutive sentencing scheme, or that the RRRI Act applies only to future crimes, as the Commonwealth suggests.\nRegarding Section 6317, the Commonwealth asserts that the mandatory minimum penalty of Section 6317 overrides the RRRI Act, such that the RRRI Act remains effective only relative to some statutory provisions, but not Section 6317. Again, that analysis does not comport with the terms of the RRRI Act. We conclude that the interpretation explained above \u2014 that both the mandatory minimum sentence and the RRRI Act minimum sentence are to be imposed for RRRI Act-eligible offenders-is the one that follows the plain language of the statutes, and gives effect to all of the relevant provisions, consistent with principles of statutory construction. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933.\nFinally, we are not convinced by the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that the supposedly \u201cspecific\u201d (i.e., special) provisions of the drug trafficking sentencing statutes control the more \u201cgeneral\u201d provisions of the RRRI Act. The Commonwealth designates the drug trafficking sentencing provisions as the \u201cspecific\u201d ones because they \u201cappl[y] to a small subset of defendants.\u201d But, that classification is mutable; by the Commonwealth\u2019s own theory, the RRRI Act could be deemed to be the controlling \u201cspecific\u201d provision since it too may be deemed to \u201cappl[y] to a small subset of defendants,\u201d in light of its myriad eligibility exclusions.\nEven if the Commonwealth\u2019s designation of the RRRI Act as the general statute was persuasive, Section 1933 of the Statutory Construction Act counsels that the general provision controls if it is later in time and there is a manifest intention that the general provision prevail. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933. The RRRI Act was adopted many years after the mandatory sentencing provisions at issue, and the General Assembly\u2019s intention that the RRRI Act should apply to all eligible offenders, such as appellee, is manifest in the legislative design. The General Assembly obviously was aware of existing mandatory sentences; in listing the requirements for offender eligibility, it cited some-but notably not all \u2014 of those provisions. The plain language suggests that the Legislature made very conscious and careful decisions concerning this new sentencing alternative.\nFurthermore, when the General Assembly drafted the RRRI Act, it simultaneously amended the Sentencing Code by adding 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b)(2) to permit a modification of a minimum sentence, and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b.l), to require that the trial court impose an RRRI Act minimum sentence \u201cin addition to the minimum sentence.\u201d This fact corroborates that the Legislature was aware of the effect of the RRRI Act on the Sentencing Code, and crafted a group of amendments that allowed the RRRI Act to work in conformity with other sentencing statutes, including those involving mandatory minimum sentences.\nWe recognize that the effect of the RRRI Act may be to reduce the total time in prison that an offender subject to a mandatory minimum sentence must serve. But, it is eminently clear from the plain language of the legislation that the General Assembly intended that result \u2014 for a limited class of statutorily defined defendants, upon the completion of several conditions, and subject to the controlling discretion of the Parole Board. Our plain language interpretation accords with the legislative intent as we understand it, and gives effect to all provisions of the relevant sentencing statutes. Accordingly, the decision below is affirmed.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this matter.\nJustices SAYLOR, EAKIN, BAER, TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\n. 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7512.\n. Section 6317, entitled \"Drug-free school zones,\u201d states in pertinent part:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 A person 18 years of age or older who is convicted in any court of this Commonwealth of a violation of section 13(a)(14) or (30) of the act of April 14, 1972 (P.L. 233, No. 64), [35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(14) or (30) ] known as The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, shall, if the delivery or possession with intent to deliver of the controlled substance occurred within 1,000 feet of the real property on which is located a public, private or parochial school or a college or university ... be sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least two years of total confinement, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or other statute to the contrary....\n(c) Authority of court in sentencing.- \u2014 There shall be no authority for a court to impose on a defendant to which this section is applicable a lesser sentence than provided for in subsection (a), to place the defendant on probation or to suspend sentence....

The Commonwealth also maintains that this issue is justiciable even though the RRRI Act only makes appellee eligible for release at the expiration of the RRRI Act minimum sentences. The Commonwealth asserts that should appellee be paroled by the Parole Board per his RRRI Act minimum sentences \"in violation of the mandates of [18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6317 and 7508], there would be little opportunity for court intervention at that time.\" Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14-15. Depending on the timing, the circumstances involving RRRI Act sentences could implicate ripeness (challenge too soon) or mootness (challenge too late). Notably, appellee does not argue that the issue is non-justiciable, and we are not inclined to raise the issue on our own, particularly in these circumstances. Cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Kearney v. Rambler, 613 Pa. 32, 32 A.3d 658, 663 (2011) (addressing matter that implicated exceptions to mootness doctrine for issues that are of great public importance or are capable of repetition while evading review).\n. A motivational boot camp program is a six-month program that includes, inter alia, rigorous physical activity, work on public projects, substance abuse treatment, continuing education, vocational training and pre-release counseling. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3903. Once an offender successfully completes the program, and following certification by the Department of Corrections to the Parole Board, he or she is entitled to immediate release on parole, regardless of any minimum sentence. Id. \u00a7 3907.\n. The Act was originally adopted on September 25, 2008, and codified at Title 44, Chapter 53. On August 11, 2009, the General Assembly recodified the provisions at Title 61, Chapter 45.\n.
