The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Did the Commonwealth Court depart from accepted judicial practice or abuse its discretion when the court ignored the plain language of Section 2704(a) of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2704(a), and held that where \u201ca railroad pays to operate on a rail line but has no ownership interest in or maintenance responsibility for the rail line or facilities at a crossing, it is not a \u2018concerned party1 subject to allocation under Section 2704(a)?\n(2) Has the Commonwealth Court departed from accepted judicial practice or abused its discretion by following the exception, rather than the rule, and citing City of Chester v. Pa. Public Utility Commission, 798 A.2d 288 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) to carve out a narrow \u201cownership\u201d requirement solely for railroads to be a party under \u00a7 2704(a), when no other public utility is held to the same standard?",
