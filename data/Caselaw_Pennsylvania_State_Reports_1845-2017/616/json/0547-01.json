Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\n(1) Where neither the United States Supreme Court nor the appellate courts of Pennsylvania have ever recognized a protected constitutional interest in the decision to remain silent in a pre-arrest setting, did the Superi- or Court err in ruling that the use by the Commonwealth of a non-testifying defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of his guilt infringes upon his constitutional right to be free from self-incrimination?",
