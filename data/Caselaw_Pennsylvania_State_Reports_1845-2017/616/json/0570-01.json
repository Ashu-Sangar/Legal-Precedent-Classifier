        "text": "Chief Justice CASTILLE,\nconcurring.\nI join the Court\u2019s per curiam affirmance of the denial of PCRA relief, on grounds that the serial petition in this case was time-barred. The PCRA claim at issue \u2014 apparently pursued here so that appellant\u2019s federal habeas corpus petition can remain in stasis \u2014 seeks to innovate a new duty for trial counsel based upon purely personal circumstances, unrelated to the client\u2019s cause, implicating attorney disciplinary proceedings. This claim qualifies for no PCRA time-bar exception; and in any event, since it seeks to condemn counsel retroactively with the burden of a new duty, it is frivolous.\nWhenever possible, serial PCRA petitions should be disposed of, both here and below, quickly and summarily. The necessity for this approach is particularly acute in capital cases because of the incentive to pursue far-fetched claims merely to delay matters; our PCRA courts need to be mindful of this incentive. The petition here is premised upon a more than far-fetched claim of \u201cnewly-discovered evidence\u201d that does not even relate to the trial facts. As was most likely the intention here, pendency of appellant\u2019s serial PCRA claim has only caused substantial delay in the administration of justice. In my view, the \u201cnew\u201d \u201cfacts\u201d that appellant forwards have nothing whatsoever to do with trial counsel\u2019s representation of him, but arise instead from mere speculation as to trial counsel\u2019s personal circumstances at the time of trial. As a matter of law, these \u201cfacts\u201d cannot support a cognizable claim of an \u201cactual conflict of interest\u201d that would render counsel ineffective.\nOn the time-bar question, appellant describes the documentation concerning disciplinary proceedings against his trial counsel as \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that \u201ccame to light only after new counsel was appointed to represent [appellant]\u201d following completion of appellant\u2019s first round of PCRA review, which concluded eight years ago, in 2004. Appellant declares that this evidence was \u201cnever before available to [appellant] or his counsel.\u201d Piling speculation upon supposition, appellant declares that the fact of the disciplinary investigation alone proves that trial counsel\u2019s performance was hampered by an \u201cactual\u201d conflict of interest because counsel supposedly \u201crushed forward\u201d with trial without sufficient investigation and preparation; did so in order to obtain \u201csubstantial counsel fees\u201d before being suspended from the practice of law; and \u201ctread[ed] lightly\u201d in handling appellant\u2019s trial in anticipation of needing a favorable reference from the Lehigh County prosecutor\u2019s office. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7-8.\nThe Commonwealth responds that appellant\u2019s petition was untimely, noting that the relevant disciplinary documentation became publicly available in, variously, 1989 (seven years before trial), 1997 (one year after trial, while appellant\u2019s direct appeal was under way), and 2003 (during the pendency of appellant\u2019s first round of PCRA review, which concluded in July 2004). The Commonwealth cites testimony of the attorney who prosecuted appellant\u2019s first PCRA petition, who was aware that disciplinary action had been taken against appellant\u2019s trial counsel, and who evidently did not determine such action to be a basis to allege an actual conflict of interest in appellant\u2019s first PCRA petition. The Commonwealth argues that as a matter of law, information that has been public record for years simply cannot be deemed \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of the PCRA time-bar, and particularly not with \u201cnewness\u201d being measured by the moment appellant or new collateral counsel stumbles upon the public record. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 15-19.\nIn reply, appellant does not rely upon this Court\u2019s on-point decisional law concerning \u201cnew facts\u201d and public records, but instead depends upon inapposite federal decisional law construing the \u201cdue diligence\u201d provision of the federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Thus, appellant cites Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653 (3d Cir.2005), where the Third Circuit declined to read AEDPA\u2019s due diligence provision to mean that the \u201cclock began ticking\u201d on the defendant\u2019s claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), on the day news broke of the existence of a training video allegedly establishing that a Philadelphia prosecutor had endorsed an alleged policy of discrimination in jury selection. Appellant acknowledges that in his case, information regarding the disciplinary actions against trial counsel was publicly disclosed and available, but argues that the \u201cprinciple\u201d expressed in Wilson concerning the non-jurisdictional federal time-bar in AEDPA should apply to constructions of the PCRA\u2019s jurisdictional time-bar, and we should hold that \u201cit is not reasonable to expect [appellant] or his counsel\u201d to discern the need to look into available disciplinary materials. Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 6-8.\nFor purposes of the PCRA time-bar, the question is whether records of disciplinary proceedings against appellant\u2019s trial counsel may be considered facts unknowable to appellant until the day, years later, that one of his subsequent lawyers decided to look for the information. Our decisional law, which appellant ignores, counsels that the answer clearly is \u201cNo.\u201d We have repeatedly held that once sixty days elapsed from the public dissemination of the information forming the basis for the Batson claim in the Philadelphia jury selection cases, the nature and circumstances of the allegations could no longer be considered previously unavailable facts. Commonwealth v. Fahy, 598 Pa. 584, 959 A.2d 312, 316-17 (Pa.2008); Commonwealth v. Hackett, 598 Pa. 350, 956 A.2d 978, 984-85 (Pa.2008); Commonwealth v. Marshall, 596 Pa. 587, 947 A.2d 714, 721-23 (Pa.2008). See also Commonwealth v. Whitney, 572 Pa. 468, 817 A.2d 473, 478 (Pa.2003) (opinion study published in September 1998 edition of Cornell Law Review regarding supposed racial disparity in imposition of death penalty in Philadelphia did not constitute new evidence since statistics used to compile study were public record and therefore could have been known to defendant before he filed his third PCRA petition in July 1998).\nCommonwealth v. Fisher, 582 Pa. 276, 870 A.2d 864 (Pa. 2005), also makes appellant\u2019s reliance on federal authority irrelevant. The defendant in Fisher had been tried and sentenced to death in 1989. At his trial, an expert for the Commonwealth testified regarding FBI methods of conducting compositional analysis of bullet fragments. The defendant\u2019s first round of collateral review concluded in 2002. In January 2004, he filed a second PCRA petition citing a National Academy of Science (\u201cNAS\u201d) study critiquing the FBI\u2019s methods as imprecise and flawed; appended to the second petition was an affidavit from a retired FBI forensic metallurgist, including the metallurgist\u2019s curriculum vitae and list of publications. The defense\u2019s metallurgist opined that the methods used by investigators to connect the defendant to the bullets in the victim\u2019s body were scientifically unreliable. This Court concluded that the NAS study did not support the defendant\u2019s claim, but also that the metallurgist\u2019s affidavit did not cure the serial petition\u2019s untimeliness because the list of publications included in the affidavit showed that criticism of the methods in question was \u201cavailable and discoverable for more than two years\u201d prior to when the defendant filed his second petition. 870 A.2d at 871.\nThis Court has also found that \u201cnew facts\u201d arising from other matters of public judicial record are insufficient to trigger the new facts exception to the PCRA time-bar, even when those matters were not as widely publicized as the Batson jury selection allegations involved in Wilson. In Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 598 Pa. 85, 953 A.2d 1248 (Pa.2006) (Opinion Announcing Judgment of the Court), Hawkins alleged in a serial PCRA petition that the Commonwealth improperly concealed evidence that a \u201cdeal\u201d had been made with a jailhouse informant who testified for the Commonwealth at Hawkins\u2019s first trial in 1990, which resulted in a death sentence. At the informant\u2019s subsequent sentencing proceedings in 1991, the assistant district attorney (\u201cADA\u201d) who prosecuted Hawkins testified on the informant\u2019s behalf and the informant evidently received a shorter term of imprisonment for having cooperated with the Commonwealth. In 1994, Hawkins was retried and again sentenced to death; his first round of PCRA review concluded in 2001. Then in 2003, Hawkins deposed the ADA regarding the informant and filed a second PCRA petition asserting a claim based on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215(1963). This Court stated:\nAs [the ADA] did testify at [the informant\u2019s] 1991 public sentencing, the testimony was in public records. While the 1990 and 1991 testimony did not reveal details of an \u201cagreement,\u201d the facts upon which the claim is predicated are obviously present in the 1990 and 1991 testimony discussed above, and were certainly discoverable with any diligence at all. Since [the ADA\u2019s] 2003 deposition testimony simply reflects the same information [Hawkins] had known since 1990 and 1991, we reject [Hawkins\u2019s] claim that the facts in the 2003 deposition were previously unknown to [him] and could not have been obtained a decade earlier with the exercise of due diligence.\nHawkins, 953 A.2d at 1255 (citation omitted).\nFinally, in Commonwealth v. Chester, 586 Pa. 468, 895 A.2d 520 (Pa.2006), this Court rejected an argument similar to that raised by appellant in this appeal. In Chester, the defendant\u2019s trial resulted in a death sentence; his direct appeal concluded in 1991; and his first round of collateral review concluded in 1999. Thereafter, newly appointed counsel filed a second PCRA petition in 2001, claiming that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had been arrested for driving under the influence (\u201cDOT\u201d) shortly after entering his appearance on the defendant\u2019s behalf. The petition alleged that counsel therefore labored under a conflict of interest, and furthermore, the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of trial counsel\u2019s DOT prosecution amounted to a Brady violation. The defendant argued that his serial petition was timely because it was filed within sixty days after new counsel discovered trial counsel\u2019s DOT. The PCRA court dismissed the defendant\u2019s serial petition as untimely and we affirmed:\nThis Court has held that, for purposes of [Section] 9545(b)(1)(H), information is not \u201cunknown\u201d to a PCRA petitioner when the information was a matter of public record. Here, the fact that trial counsel was arrested for DOT was a matter of public record and, therefore, cannot be said to have been \u201cunknown\u201d to [the defendant] for purposes of the PCRA\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d exception to the PCRA\u2019s one year jurisdictional time-bar. Accordingly, the PCRA court properly determined that [the defendant\u2019s] argument under the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d exception fails.\nChester, 895 A.2d at 523 (citations and footnote omitted).\nNo argument has been forwarded by appellant, here or below, to acknowledge, much less distinguish, this Court\u2019s consistent precedent concerning public records and public information. Under this authority, however, which appellant ignores, his serial PCRA petition is plainly time-barred.\nEven assuming the petition is not time-barred, appellant\u2019s \u201cnew facts\u201d conflict of interest claim is frivolous. The standard for analyzing claims of an attorney\u2019s conflict of interest in the context of criminal defense derives from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 349-50, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). In that case, two privately retained attorneys represented three accomplices in separate murder trials. Sullivan was first to be tried. He was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, but his two co-defendants were subsequently both acquitted. On non-deferential federal habeas corpus review in that pre-AEDPA case, the Third Circuit found that certain of Sullivan\u2019s attorneys\u2019 actions \u201craised a possibility of conflict sufficient to prove a violation of Sullivan\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.\u201d Id. at 340, 100 S.Ct. 1708 (recounting procedural background of case). But, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling in an opinion authored by Justice Lewis Powell: \u201cWe hold that the possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction. In order to demonstrate a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, a defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d Id. at 350,100 S.Ct. 1708.\nIn line with Cuyler, this Court has consistently held as follows with regard to claims asserting a criminal defense attorney\u2019s conflict of interest:\nAn appellant cannot prevail on a preserved conflict of interest claim absent a showing of actual prejudice. Nevertheless, we presume prejudice when the appellant shows that trial counsel was burdened by an actual \u2014 rather than mere potential \u2014 conflict of interest. To show an actual conflict of interest, the appellant must demonstrate that: (1) counsel actively represented conflicting interests; and (2) those conflicting interests adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\nCommonwealth v. Collins, 598 Pa. 397, 957 A.2d 237, 251 (Pa.2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, \u201c[a]n attorney owes his client a duty of loyalty, including a duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty is the obligation of counsel to avoid actual conflicts of interest that would adversely affect his ability to perform on behalf of his client.\u201d Commonwealth v. Tedford, 598 Pa. 639, 960 A.2d 1, 54 (Pa.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nAppellant\u2019s allegations concerning the disciplinary investigation of his trial counsel do not even begin to demonstrate an actual conflict of interest. Even accepting the idle speculations that comprise appellant\u2019s conflict argument, there are stressful matters in the personal lives of lawyers that might affect their ability to prepare for and manage a trial: financial difficulties, substance abuse, marital difficulties, sleep disorders, depression, even collateral attacks by other lawyers involving speculation concerning prior cases. But, appellant\u2019s claim here sounds in an \u201cactual conflict of interest,\u201d a theory appellant prefers because he does not have to prove anything more. But, unlike cases that entail clear and direct conflicts, appellant\u2019s trial counsel was not concurrently representing an accomplice or co-defendant; counsel had not represented the victim or the victim\u2019s family before; and the disciplinary investigation did not even involve this case. This is not a case of conflict; it is a case of rank sophistry.\nMoreover, any question of whether appellant\u2019s trial counsel was actually conflicted must be measured by the governing law as it existed when this matter was tried. As members of the bar, lawyers are obligated to recognize and avoid actual conflicts in the first instance, just as they are obligated not to pursue baseless or frivolous claims, as here. Appellant\u2019s current counsel is essentially claiming that trial counsel was obliged, at the time of trial, to inform the court that he had a conflict because of the pending disciplinary investigation and to seek to withdraw from representation of appellant. But nothing in the law, either at the time of appellant\u2019s trial or now, remotely suggests that counsel was bound to view his own unrelated personal disciplinary issues, which were evidently public knowledge in the Lehigh County legal community, as creating an actual conflict with his client. In short, appellant proposes a novel and unprincipled expansion of what amounts to \u201cactual conflict.\u201d Even if a court someday were to adopt such an odd rule, however, that new rule could not be used to retroactively condemn trial counsel\u2019s conduct decades ago.\n. Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\n. Appellant effectively seeks to extend the actual conflict principles set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Cuyler. Cuyler, a case from 1980, was, of course, governing law at the time of appellant's trial in 1996. But Cuyler, which involved multiple representation, does not govern. Instead, appellant\u2019s attack upon his trial counsel, based on counsel's disciplinary proceedings, depends upon non-controlling cases from other jurisdictions, including cases decided long after his trial.\nAppellant also cites a Pennsylvania case in existence at the time of trial, Commonwealth v. Duffy, 483 Pa. 170, 394 A.2d 965 (Pa.1978), but forwards no argument premised upon the case. Instead, he cites the case as supplemental authority for the general propositions that the Sixth Amendment ensures criminal defendants the right to conflict-free counsel and that while conflicts usually arise \"in cases in which attorneys represented more than one party, they should be equally applicable when an attorney represents a client whose interests may conflict with his own.\u201d Duffy, 394 A.2d at 967 & n. 5. The conflict in Duffy arose from evidence of counsel's own role in the crime for which the appellant was on trial. Notably, in Duffy, counsel himself raised the issue. Like Cuyler, Duffy does not establish that a lawyer should deem himself to have an actual conflict of interest with a particular client whenever the lawyer is facing a totally unrelated disciplinary investigation. The indisputable fact remains that neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor this Court has accepted appellant\u2019s expansion of what constitutes an \"actual conflict,\u201d much less allowed it to be used as a basis to retroactively condemn trial counsel. Appellant has not shown that his trial counsel, while representing him, labored under a cognizable and actual conflict of interest. Presumed prejudice is therefore not applicable and appellant must prove his claims under the ineffectiveness standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Appellant has already had that opportunity in his first round of collateral review and failed; he should proceed now to federal court, where he should have been eight years ago.",

        "text": "Justice McCAFFERY,\nconcurring.\nI agree with the Court that the PCRA requires that petitions for relief be filed within one year of the date a judgment of sentence becomes final, subject to three exceptions. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b). In this case, the PCRA judge held that certain facts contained in internal documents maintained by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel regarding Appellant\u2019s trial counsel could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence by Appellant\u2019s prior counsel. Therefore, the judge ruled that the instant petition was timely because it was filed within 60 days of the discovery by current counsel of the contents of those documents.\nThe Court disposes of this matter on the basis of untimeliness. However, while the Court posits that all of the documents containing the facts upon which Appellant relies were openly available to the public long before the filing of the instant petition, the Court does not address the PCRA judge\u2019s specific finding that certain of the newly discovered facts upon which Appellant relies were contained in internal documents, and that prior counsel was not derelict in his duty of due diligence in failing to obtain these internal documents. Because I find no basis upon which to disagree with the assessment of the PCRA judge, I do not join the determination of the Court that the instant petition is time barred.\nThe instant petition is Appellant\u2019s second petition for collateral review of his death sentence. Therefore, Appellant bears the burden of making a strong prima facie showing to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred, or that he is actually innocent. Commonwealth v. Beasley, 600 Pa. 458, 967 A.2d 376, 384 (Pa.2009); Commonwealth v. Lawson, 519 Pa. 504, 549 A.2d 107, 112 (Pa.1988). Because Appellant does not assert his innocence, he is required to demonstrate that the proceedings which resulted in his conviction were so unfair that a miscarriage of justice has occurred which no civilized society could tolerate.

Morales, 549 Pa. 400, 701 A.2d 516, 520-21 (Pa.1997). Upon thorough review of the record, I conclude that Appellant has not sustained his burden. Therefore, I would affirm the order denying his second petition for collateral review on this basis.\n. Appellate review of a PCRA court\u2019s decision is limited to examining whether the PCRA court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by the record and whether its conclusions of law are free from legal error. Commonwealth v. Colavita, 606 Pa. 1, 993 A.2d 874, 886 (Pa.2010).",
