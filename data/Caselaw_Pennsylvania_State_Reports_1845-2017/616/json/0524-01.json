        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nIn this appeal by allowance, we are called to decide whether the Superior Court improperly reversed a revocation of probation, when the revocation was premised upon the conclusion that a probationer violated restrictions contained within a document entitled \u201cStandard Special Conditions for Sex Offenders,\u201d which was authored by the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (the Board), rather than a judge of the court of common pleas. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Superior Court erred in reversing the revocation of probation. We thus respectfully vacate the order of the Superior Court, and remand this case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nOn April 30, 2002, Appellee, Robert C. Elliott, Jr., pleaded guilty in the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas to various charges related to two separate cases, both of which involved sexual assault of children. After the completion of a presentencing report and Megan\u2019s Law assessment, the trial court held a hearing to impose sentence and determine whether Appellee was a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Megan\u2019s Law. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court imposed a sentence of four-and-one-half to nine years of imprisonment, followed by a consecutive probationary term of five years. The court further adjudicated Appellee a SVP, and accordingly imposed three conditions of his probation: Megan\u2019s Law registration; no contact, direct or indirect, -with the victims; and no unsupervised contact with any minor child. Finally, in light of Appellee\u2019s status as a SVP, the court requested that the Board supervise Appellee as a special probationer upon his release from state prison.\nDuring incarceration, Appellee was refused parole on four different occasions for his failure to complete a sex offender treatment program successfully. Accordingly, Appellee served the maximum nine-year sentence and was released on April 7, 2009. Upon regaining his freedom, Appellee moved to Erie and, on April 8, 2009, met with agents of the Board. At that meeting, and a second meeting two days later, Appellee was given a form created by the Board entitled \u201cStandard Special Conditions for Sex Offenders \u2014 Minor Victims.\u201d See Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 131a. The form, five pages in length, set forth twenty-five conditions of his probation supervision. Appellee initialed after each condition, and then signed his name at the end. During both the April 8 and April 10 meetings, an agent of the Board explained each condition to Appellee, and Appellee indicated that he understood them. Relevant to this appeal, Supervision Conditions 17 and 19 stated as follows:\n(17) You must not have any contact with anyone under the age of 18 years old. This includes direct and indirect contact, written correspondence, telephone contact or contact through a third party. You must immediately report to your Parole Agent any incidental contact you have -with anyone under the age of 18 years old. Contact is defined as follows: (1) actual physical touching; (2) writing letters, sending messages, buying presents, sending email, sending instant messages, sending text messages, calling on a telephone/cell phone/blackberry; (3) and verbal communication, such as talking, as well as nonverbal communication, such as body language (waiving, gesturing, winking), sign language and facial expressions.\n# * *\n(19) You must not enter or loiter within 1,000 feet of areas where the primary activity at such locations involve persons under the age of 18, including playgrounds, youth recreation centers, youth clubs, arcades, amusement parks, child daycare centers, elementary schools, high schools, elementary/high school bus stops, Special Olympics, Boy Scout/Girl Scout meetings/events or any similar areas where persons under the age of 18 commonly congregate.\nR.R. at 133a-34a. .\nAfter completing the first several weeks of his probation without incident, on June 24, 2009, Appellee\u2019s probation officer, Agent David Buchiet, observed Appellee sitting in Perry Square, a common area located in the center of the city of Erie. Agent Buchiet noted that Appellee was sitting \u201crather close\u201d to a large water fountain in the park, in which young children were playing. Notes of Testimony (N.T.), Probation Revocation Hearing, Aug. 17, 2009 at 18. While observing Appellee for approximately thirty minutes, Agent Buchiet noticed that he was paying particular attention to one young girl in a red bathing suit. Appellee eventually left the park, but soon after returned for another twenty-five minutes. After leaving a second time, Appellee traveled the short distance from the square to the Erie County Courthouse for his regular sex offender group meeting.\nAgent Buchiet intercepted Appellee prior to the beginning of the meeting and confronted him about his presence and actions in Perry Square. According to Agent Buchiet, Appellee admitted that he regularly went to the park to watch the children, and that he was sexually aroused by the girl in the red bathing suit. Based upon this statement, the next day, Agent Buchiet obtained a warrant and arrested Appellee for violating his probation. Thereafter, Board agents searched Appellee\u2019s apartment, and found a journal in which Appellee had documented prior visits to the square, and how those visits reminded him of his prior assault victims.\nOn August 17, 2009, Appellee was returned to Westmoreland County for a probation revocation hearing. Agent Buchiet testified concerning the above-referenced observations, Appellee\u2019s statements concerning his presence in the square, and the subsequent search of Appellee\u2019s residence. Agent Buchiet also related that he never saw Appellee come into contact or interact with any of the children in the square, and further that, after questioning some of the adults at Perry Square on the day in question, he discovered no evidence of direct contact by Appellee with the children. For Appellee\u2019s part, he testified that he never told Agent Buchiet that he was \u201csexually aroused\u201d by the girl in the red bathing suit, and that he could not recall any of the specific provisions of the \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d sheet that he initialed and signed at the commencement of his probationary period.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court determined that Appellee had violated the \u201cSpecial Conditions,\u201d revoked his probation, and incarcerated him for two consecutive terms of two-and-one-half to five years. Later, in its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial court opined that Appellee had violated Supervision Conditions 17 and 19. See supra p. 3. The court first determined that the Commonwealth had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that, when Agent Buchiet observed Appellee in Perry Square, it was an \u201carea where the primary activity ... involve persons under the age of 18 ... or any similar area where persons under the age of 18 commonly congregate,\u201d because of the common use of the fountain in Perry Square by young children. Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 8 (quoting Supervision Condition 19). As Appellee was prohibited from \u201centering or loitering\u201d in such areas, the court found that he violated Supervision Condition 19.\nThe court also determined that Appellee violated Supervision Condition 17, which prohibited Appellee from engaging in \u201cnonverbal communication [with minor children while unsupervised], such as body language (waving, gesturing, winking), sign language and facial expressions.\u201d Id. at 9 (quoting Supervision Condition 17). The court determined that by following the girl in the red bathing suit \u201cwith his head\u201d for a prolonged period of time without attempting to relocate himself outside of, or into a different area of, Perry Square, he had \u201ccontacted\u201d minor children while unsupervised, as that term has been defined by Condition 17.\nAppellee filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court, challenging the validity of the revocation, as well as the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon to revoke his probation. In his brief to that court, he challenged, as a threshold matter, the ability of the trial court to revoke his probation based solely upon Supervision Conditions 17 and 19. Citing to relevant Superior Court precedent, Appellee contended that a revocation could not stand based upon conditions set solely by the Board or an agent thereof. To the contrary, he argued, only a judge had the authority to impose terms and conditions of probation. See e.g. Commonwealth v. MacGregor, 912 A.2d 315 (Pa.Super.2006) (holding that a probationary sentence could not be revoked on the basis that the defendant had violated a condition established by the Board or an agent thereof, rather than a trial court); Commonwealth v. Vilsaint, 893 A.2d 753 (Pa.Super.2006) (same).\nAppellee first pointed to Section 9754 of the Sentencing Code, which provides in relevant part:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 In imposing an order of probation the court shall specify at the time of sentencing the length of any term during which the defendant is to be supervised, which term may not exceed the maximum term for which the defendant could be confined, and the authority that shall conduct the supervision.\n(b) Conditions generally. \u2014 The court shall attach such of the reasonable conditions authorized by subsection (c) of this section as it deems necessary to insure or assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754(a) & (b). Subsection (c) delineates fourteen conditions a sentencing court may impose upon a defendant in the imposition of probation. Among these, courts may direct defendants on probation to attend treatment and addiction programs, pay fines and restitution, and refrain from frequenting \u201cunlawful or disreputable places.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9754(c)(12), (8), (11), and (6), respectively. Further, subsection (c)(13) provides a \u201ccatch-all\u201d for trial courts, allowing them to order defendants \u201c[t]o satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the defendant and not unduly restrictive of his liberty or incompatible with his freedom of conscience.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9754(c)(13).\nAppellee contended before the Superior Court that, based upon Section 9754, previous panels of that tribunal had found that \u201cthe legislature ... specifically empowered the court, not the probation offices and not any individual probation officers, to impose the terms of probation.\u201d Vilsaint, 893 A.2d at 757; see also MacGregor, 912 A.2d at 317-18. According to Appellee, then, the Board or any agents thereof have no authority to impose any conditions or regulations of probation, and he thus could not have his probation revoked for violating conditions \u201cnot imposed by the court.\u201d MacGregor, 912 A.2d at 318.\nThe Superior Court agreed with the general proposition forwarded by Appellee, and thus examined his revocation under Supervision Conditions 17 and 19. Regarding Supervision Condition 17 (no contact with minors), the panel found that the condition \u201cwas incorporated into the sentencing court\u2019s condition that [Appellee] must refrain from contacting minor children.\u201d Super. Ct. Mem. Op. at 8. The panel elaborated that it interpreted Supervision Condition 17 to \u201cmerely defin[e] what constitutes \u2018contact\u2019 with minors,\u201d and therefore it was authorized by and subsumed within the trial court\u2019s conditions of probation. Despite this finding, the court reversed the revocation of probation based upon Condition 17 because, in the panel\u2019s opinion, insufficient evidence existed to prove that Appellee violated it. The court opined that, by merely focusing his attention on a particular child, Appellee did not engage in verbal, direct, or indirect contact. The Commonwealth has not appealed this decision to this Court.\nConcerning, however, Supervision Condition 19 (no loitering within 1,000 feet), the panel was \u201cconstrained to conclude that the condition ... was not incorporated into the court\u2019s general no-contact requirement of Appellant\u2019s probation.\u201d Id. at 9. On this basis, and without reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence surrounding Appellee\u2019s alleged violation of Condition 19, the Superior Court reversed the revocation of Appellee\u2019s probation to the extent it was based upon this condition. Thus, finding insufficient evidence to support a violation of Supervision Condition 17, and lack of judicial imprimatur for the imposition of Supervision Condition 19, the panel reversed the revocation order and remanded the case to the trial court.\nThe Commonwealth petitioned for allowance of appeal, which we granted as to the following question:\nWhether the Superior Court\u2019s reliance on 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754 in its holding in Commonwealth v. Vilsaint, 893 A.2d 753 (Pa.Super.2006) and Commonwealth v. MacGregor, 912 A.2d 315 (Pa.Super.2006), that only the court, and not probation officers, can impose the terms of probation is in conflict with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9798.3,[] enacted in 2007, which directs that the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and County probation authorities in Megan\u2019s Law [sic] may impose supervision conditions that include offender tracking.\nCommonwealth v. Elliott, 609 Pa. 499, 17 A.3d 331 (2011) (per curiam).\nFairly encompassed within this question is a general inquiry concerning whether the Board, county probation offices, or the agents and officers thereof, can impose conditions upon probationers that are not explicitly delineated in a trial court\u2019s sentencing and probation order. This inquiry revolves around an interpretation of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9701, et seq., as well as the Prisons and Parole Code, 61 P.S. \u00a7 1, et seq. and 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 101, et seq. As statutory interpretation concerns a pure question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Hacker, 609 Pa. 108, 15 A.3d 333, 335 (2011).\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s principal argument centers upon Section 9798.3 of Megan\u2019s Law, and contends that through this provision the General Assembly has granted the Board wide latitude in regulating and supervising sexually violent predators who have been placed on probation and fall under the Board\u2019s authority. The Commonwealth asserts that this provision is specifically included within Megan\u2019s Law because the legislature \u201crecogniz[edj the high risk posed by these offenders and the great need to protect the community, and to aid the offender in leading a law abiding life because of concerns for recidivism with sex offenders.\u201d Brief of the Commonwealth at 12. The Commonwealth avers that, while Section 9798.3 is entitled \u201cGlobal positioning system technology,\u201d the language of the statute states that the Board \u201cmay impose supervision conditions that include offender tracking through global positioning system technology.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9798.3. Parsing the clause \u201cmay impose supervision conditions\u201d from the language that follows it \u2014 \u201cthat include offender tracking through global positioning system technology\u201d \u2014 the Commonwealth advances that the first clause of Section 9798.3 gives the Board authority to impose any supervision conditions necessary upon probationers who are subject to Megan\u2019s Law.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Commonwealth delves into a general discussion regarding the interplay between the Prisons and Parole Code and the Sentencing Code. As will be more fully developed below, the Commonwealth posits that the Prisons and Parole Code grants the Board the power to impose \u201cconditions of supervision\u201d upon any person under its jurisdiction. See e.g. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6151 (defining conditions of supervision as \u201cany terms or conditions of the offender\u2019s supervision, whether imposed by the court, the board or an agent, including compliance with all requirements of Federal, State and local law.\u201d). In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, orders of probation by a trial court do not always delineate specific conditions that probationers must follow and, thus, the Board is permitted to institute conditions of supervision with which probationers must comply.\nAppellee responds that only courts may place restrictions upon defendants under the provisions of the Sentencing Code: \u201cExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, in all cases the sentence to be imposed shall be determined by the court as authorized by law.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9703; see also MacGregor; Vilsaint. Countering the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cconditions of supervision\u201d contention in accord with 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6151, see supra p. 9, Appellee argues that such provisions merely permit the Board to monitor probationers under its authority and nothing more.\nThe arguments by both parties demonstrate that, to resolve the issue before this Court, we must examine the relationship between \u201cterms and conditions of probation,\u201d as used in Sections 9754 and 9771 of the Sentencing Code, which a trial court imposes, and \u201cconditions of supervision\u201d as contemplated by the Prisons and Parole Code, which the Board and its agents execute. As our canons of statutory construction mandate, this Court must consider \u201cevery statute ... to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). Moreover, statutes which \u201crelate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things\u201d are to be \u201cconstrued together, if possible, as one statute.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1932(a) & (b). In conjunction with these rules, we must presume that \u201cthe legislature does not perform useless acts in adopting the words of a statute.\u201d Freundt v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d 503, 506. (Pa.2005). Thus, when the legislature uses two different words, we must also presume that \u201cit must have meant for the words to have separate meanings.\u201d Drabic v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, 588 Pa. 670, 906 A.2d 1153, 1157 (2006) (citing Freundt, 883 A.2d at 506-07), rejected on other grounds by Strawn v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., 609 Pa. 482, 17 A.3d 320 (2011).\nInstantly, the operative words to be examined are \u201cprobation,\u201d as in \u201cterms and conditions of probation,\u201d and \u201csupervision,\u201d as in \u201cconditions of supervision.\u201d As the above discussion already exhibits, these words clearly have different meanings within the consolidated statutes. An order of probation is a sentencing directive given by a trial judge with criminal jurisdiction, and the imposition of such an order is always available to that judge, except when a mandatory minimum sentence of punishment applies. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721. Conversely, supervision in the probationary context does not even apply until an order of probation has been entered by a trial judge. See e.g. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6133(a) (\u201cthe board shall have exclusive power to supervise any person placed on probation by any judge of a court having criminal jurisdiction, when the court by special order directs supervision by the board.\u201d). As both the Sentencing Code and Prisons and Parole Code concern orders of probation and their administration, we must, if possible, read the relevant provisions in pari materia with each other, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1932(a) & (b), while at the same time giving full effect to all of the words in those provisions. See id. \u00a7 1921(a). In our view, the following framework accomplishes both of these goals.\nFirst, under the language provided by the Sentencing Code, specifically Sections 9751 and 9771, we generally agree with Appellee and the Superior Court that only \u201cthe court, not the probation offices and not any individual probation officers, [may] impose the terms [and conditions] of probation.\u201d MacGregor, 912 A.2d at 317. Under Section 9754 of the Sentencing Code, this necessitates that the sentencing court, when imposing an order of probation: (1) \u201cspecify at the time of sentencing the length of any term during which the defendant is to be supervised;\u201d (2) \u201cthe authority that shall conduct the supervision;\u201d and (3) attach any \u201creasonable conditions authorized by [Section 9754(c) ] as it deems necessary to insure or assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754.\nConsistent with the canons of statutory construction, however, merely because the legislature has placed the authority to impose a term of probation, and the conditions thereof, solely with the trial courts, we cannot ignore the provisions of the Prisons and Parole Code that mandate the Board and its agents to establish uniform standards for the supervision of probationers under its authority, and further to implement those standards and conditions. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6131(a)(5)(h) & 6151. Put differently, if courts shall levy \u201cconditions of probation,\u201d and the Board and its agents may impose \u201cconditions of supervision,\u201d consistent with the legislative mandates above, we must determine what, if any, is the difference between the two and, consistent with the various standards of statutory interpretation discussed above, how they interlink.\nIn our view, the answer is found, again, in the respective statutory provisions. The General Assembly has specifically enumerated fourteen conditions that a court may place upon a probationer. These conditions, found in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754(c), \u201cshall\u201d be imposed by a sentencing court \u201cto insure or assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754(b). Moreover, these conditions are inherently noninclusive, because clause (13) of Section 9754(c) permits a court to impose any condition necessary to ensure the \u201crehabilitation of the defendant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9754(c). Consistent, then, with a court\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority to impose a sentence, see e.g. id. \u00a7\u00a7 9751, 9754, & 9771, these fourteen conditions must be the starting point in any analysis of a probation violation.\nWe therefore preliminarily agree with Appellee that the Board and its agents cannot impose any condition of supervision it wishes, carte blanche. This would, of course, interfere with a court\u2019s well-established sentencing authority. Thus, we reject the primary argument of the Commonwealth that Section 9798.3 of Megan\u2019s Law gives the Board independent authority to impose any condition of supervision it wishes upon a probationer subject to the sex offender provisions merely because of his status as a sex offender. Furthermore, we note that the legislature\u2019s intent in promulgating Section 9897.3 was simply to permit the Board to use GPS tracking on sex offenders in furtherance of the desire to scrutinize the physical location of offenders. See Senate Journal, Jun. 19, 2006 at 1730-31 (remarks of Sens. Orie and Rafferty). We therefore decline to read the few words relied upon by the Commonwealth out of context to justify its position of carte blanche establishment of conditions of probation by the Board.\nAccepting, however, the remainder of Appellee\u2019s argument that the Board has no power to impose conditions of supervision would ignore that 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6131(a)(5)(h) and 6151 direct the Board and its agents to establish and impose \u201cconditions of supervision,\u201d distinct from \u201cconditions of probation.\u201d This would be improper. We thus conclude that the Board and its agents may impose conditions of supervision that are germane to, elaborate on, or interpret any conditions of probation that are imposed by the trial court. This interpretation gives meaning to all of the statutory provisions relevant to this case and thus: (1) maintains the sentencing authority solely with a trial court; (2) permits the Board and its agents to evaluate probationers on a one-on-one basis to effectuate supervision; (3) sustains the ability of the Board to impose conditions of supervision; and (4) authorizes that a probationer may be detained, arrested, and \u201cviolated\u201d for failing to comply with either a condition of probation or a condition of supervision. In summary, a trial court may impose conditions of probation in a generalized manner, and the Board or its agents may impose more specific conditions of supervision pertaining to that probation, so long as those supervision conditions are in furtherance of the trial court\u2019s conditions of probation.\nTurning, then, to the case at bar, we find that Supervision Condition 19, that Appellee should not \u201center or loiter within 1,000 feet of areas where the primary activity at such locations involve persons under the age of 18,\u201d is a permissible condition of supervision imposed by the Board and is derivative of the trial court\u2019s condition of probation that Appellee not have unsupervised contact with minors. What apparently occurred here is that the Board felt it necessary to expound upon the trial court\u2019s no contact order, by prohibiting Appellee from placing himself into situations where he could easily violate his terms and conditions of probation. Accordingly, legal authority exists for revocation of Appellee\u2019s probation for a violation of Supervision Condition 19. To the extent the Superior Court held otherwise, it erred.\nWe note, however, that because the Superior Court found Supervision Condition 19 to be invalid, it did not address the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s revocation of Appellee\u2019s probation based upon Supervision Condition 19. As such, we remand this case to the Superior Court for an examination of the sufficiency to sustain Appellee\u2019s revocation based upon Supervision Condition 19.\nThe order of the Superior Court is vacated, and this matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN, TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\n. \u201cThe board shall have exclusive power to supervise any person placed on probation by any judge of a court having criminal jurisdiction, when the court by special order directs supervision by the board.\u201d 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6133(a).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9798.3, a provision included within Pennsylvania\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law, provides: \"The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and county probation authorities may impose supervision conditions that include offender tracking through global positioning system technology.\"\n. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9771(b) (authorizing the revocation of probation upon proof that a probationer violated a condition of probation); 37 Pa.Code \u00a7 67.1(c) (authorizing the revocation of probation upon proof that a probationer violates any condition of supervision).\n. We note that the MacGregor case is distinguishable. There, the trial court had ordered a $25.00 \"probation administration fee\u201d as the sole condition of probation. Accordingly, supervision conditions akin to those imposed by the Board in this case would be invalid in MacGregor, as they would not, in any way, be in furtherance of the probation order entered by the trial court.",
