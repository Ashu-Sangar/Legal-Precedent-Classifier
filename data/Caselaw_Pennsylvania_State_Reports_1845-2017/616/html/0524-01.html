Elliott, Jr., pleaded guilty in the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas to various charges related to two separate cases, both of which involved sexual assault of children. After the completion of a presentencing report and Megan’s Law assessment, the trial court held a hearing to impose sentence and determine whether Appellee was a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Megan’s Law. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court imposed a sentence of four-and-one-half to nine years of imprisonment, followed by a consecutive probationary term of five years. The court further adjudicated Appellee a SVP, and accordingly imposed three conditions of his probation: Megan’s Law registration; no contact, direct or indirect, -with the victims; and no unsupervised contact with any minor child. Finally, in light of Appellee’s status as a SVP, the court requested that the Board supervise Appellee as a special probationer upon his release from state prison.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Based upon this statement, the next day, Agent Buchiet obtained a warrant and arrested Appellee for violating his probation.

The court determined that by following the girl in the red bathing suit “with his head” for a prolonged period of time without attempting to relocate himself outside of, or into a different area of, Perry Square, he had “contacted” minor children while unsupervised, as that term has been defined by Condition 17.</p>

Despite this finding, the court reversed the revocation of probation based upon Condition 17 because, in the panel’s opinion, insufficient evidence existed to prove that Appellee violated it.

An order of probation is a sentencing directive given by a trial judge with criminal jurisdiction, and the imposition of such an order is always available to that judge, except when a mandatory minimum sentence of punishment applies. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9721. Conversely, supervision in the probationary context does not even apply until an order of probation has been entered by a trial judge. <em>See e.g. </em>61 Pa.C.S. § 6133(a) (“the board shall have exclusive power to supervise any person placed on probation by any judge of a court having criminal jurisdiction, when the court by special order directs supervision by the board.”). As both the Sentencing Code and Prisons and Parole Code concern orders of probation and their administration, we must, if possible, read the relevant provisions <em>in pari materia </em>with each other, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1932(a) &amp; (b), while at the same time giving full effect to all of the words in those provisions. <em>See <a href="/pa/609/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="17 A.3d 320" data-case-ids="4200467,7281725" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0482-01,/a3d/17/0320-01">id.</a> </em>§ 1921(a).

Under Section 9754 of the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>Sentencing Code, this necessitates that the sentencing court, when imposing an order of probation: (1) “specify at the time of sentencing the length of any term during which the defendant is to be supervised;” (2) “the authority that shall conduct the supervision;” and (3) attach any “reasonable conditions authorized by [Section 9754(c) ] as it deems necessary to insure or assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9754.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[164,774,1160,735]]]'>Consistent with the canons of statutory construction, however, merely because the legislature has placed the authority to impose a term of probation, and the conditions thereof, solely with the trial courts, we cannot ignore the provisions of the Prisons and Parole Code that mandate the Board and its agents to establish uniform standards for the supervision of probationers under its authority, and further to implement those standards and conditions. 61 Pa.C.S. §§ 6131(a)(5)(h) &amp; 6151. Put differently, if courts shall levy “conditions of probation,” and the Board and its agents may impose “conditions of supervision,” consistent with the legislative mandates above, we must determine what, if any, is the difference between the two and, consistent with the various standards of statutory interpretation discussed above, how they interlink.</p>
    <p id="b591-6" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[163,1533,1158,732]]]'>In our view, the answer is found, again, in the respective statutory provisions. The General Assembly has specifically enumerated fourteen conditions that a court may place upon a probationer. These conditions, found in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9754(c), “shall” be imposed by a sentencing court “to insure or assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9754(b). Moreover, these conditions are inherently noninclusive, because clause (13) of Section 9754(c) permits a court to impose any condition necessary to ensure the “rehabilitation of the defendant.” <em><a href="/a2d/912/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="912 A.2d 315" data-case-ids="8440650" data-case-paths="/a2d/912/0315-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 9754(c).

Thus, we reject the primary argument of the Commonwealth that Section 9798.3 of Megan’s Law gives the Board independent authority to impose any condition of supervision it wishes upon a probationer subject to the sex offender provisions merely because of his status as a sex offender. Furthermore, we note that the legislature’s intent in promulgating Section 9897.3 was simply to permit the Board to use GPS tracking on sex offenders in furtherance of the desire to scrutinize the physical location of offenders. <em>See </em>Senate Journal, Jun. 19, 2006 at 1730-31 (remarks of Sens. Orie and Rafferty). We therefore decline to read the few words relied upon by the Commonwealth out of context to justify its position of <em>carte blanche </em>establishment of conditions of probation by the Board.</p>

We thus conclude that the Board and its agents may impose conditions of supervision that are germane to, elaborate on, or interpret any conditions of probation that are imposed by the trial court. This interpretation gives meaning to all of the statutory provisions relevant to this case and thus: (1) maintains the sentencing authority solely with a trial court; (2) permits the Board and its agents to evaluate probationers on a one-on-one basis to effectuate supervision; (3) sustains the ability of the Board to impose conditions of supervision; and (4) authorizes that a probationer may be detained, arrested, and “violated” for failing to comply with either a condition of probation or a condition of supervision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In summary, a trial court may impose conditions of probation in a generalized manner, and the Board or its agents may impose more specific conditions of <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>supervision pertaining to that probation, so long as those supervision conditions are in furtherance of the trial court’s conditions of probation.</p>

What apparently occurred here is that the Board felt it necessary to expound upon the trial court’s no contact order, by prohibiting Appellee from placing himself into situations where he could easily violate his terms and conditions of probation. Accordingly, legal authority exists for revocation of Appellee’s probation for a violation of Supervision Condition 19.
