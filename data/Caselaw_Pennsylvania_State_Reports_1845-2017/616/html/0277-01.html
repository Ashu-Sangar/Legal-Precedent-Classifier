The Majority could be far less kind to <em>Mason </em>and <em>Melendez. </em>The Majority could focus on: the absence of an <em>Edmunds </em>analysis in either case, indeed the absence of any authority but the apparent policy preferences of court majorities; the importance of judicial restraint before constitutionalizing evanescent preferences; and the fact that, to the extent <em>Melendez </em>purported to speak to circumstances not involving police misconduct, its prophylactic rule was, by definition, <em>obiter dicta.</em>

In a situation where evidence tainted by an illegal search is otherwise obtained by the police through a genuinely independent source, without violation of individual constitutional rights, the exclusionary rule will not operate to bar introduction of the evidence at a subsequent criminal trial; thus, in this sense, it is an exception to the application of the exclusionary rule.
