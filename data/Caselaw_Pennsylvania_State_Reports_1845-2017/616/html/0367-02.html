      <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>At the sentencing hearing on April 29, 2009, in accordance with the plea agreements, the trial court sentenced appellee to the applicable mandatory terms of imprisonment of two to four years in No. 1808 and three to six years in No. 1809, directing that the sentences be served concurrently. The Commonwealth objected to any determination that appellee was eligible for a recidivism risk reduction incentive (“RRRI”) program, asserting that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of Sections 6317 and 7508 superseded the provisions of the RRRI Act. The trial court disagreed, and determined that appellee was an eligible offender pursuant to the RRRI Act. Accordingly, in addition to the mandatory sentences imposed under Section 6317 and Section 7508, the trial court <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>imposed an RRRI Act minimum sentence of 18 months in No. 1808 and 27 months in No. 1809. As a result, appellee was afforded the opportunity to be paroled six months and nine months earlier than he would be under the respective mandatory minimum terms imposed in the two cases.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[262,611,1151,998]]]'>The Commonwealth appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in applying the RRRI Act to the mandatory minimum penalties of Sections 6317 and 7508(a)(3)(ii). In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court concluded that the General Assembly intended the RRRI Act to supplement existing sentencing law. While acknowledging that the RRRI Act reduced the time that some inmates would otherwise be incarcerated, the court reasoned that the RRRI Act reflected a legislative scheme that “emphasized rehabilitative programming instead of sentence modification.” Tr. Ct. Op., 7/8/09, at 5. The court noted that the RRRI Act did not require offenders to be released prior to the expiration of the mandatory minimum sentence; it merely provided them with the opportunity for an earlier release upon completion of an RRRI program. Because certain drug offenders, even those subject to mandatory penalties like appellee, were not excluded from the definition of “eligible offender,” the trial court determined that it did not err in evaluating appellee’s RRRI eligibility as part of its sentencing determination.</p>
    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[262,1631,1150,520]]]'>The court further observed that the General Assembly required judges to comply with the existing Sentencing Code, as well as to apply the provisions of the RRRI Act. In this case, the court complied with these directives by imposing mandatory minimum sentences under the Sentencing Code, while also fashioning RRRI Act minimum sentences. Finally, to the extent that there was a conflict between the drug trafficking sentencing provisions and the RRRI Act, the trial court opined that the RRRI Act must prevail, since it was adopted more recently.</p>

Moreover, the court reasoned, the RRRI Act did not expand the trial court’s authority to deviate from the mandatory minimum sentences; rather, the RRRI Act minimum sentence was conditional only, and indicated the point at which the offender — at the discretion of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (“Parole Board”) — may be released on parole.</p>

First, the Commonwealth asserts that the trial court lacked the authority to impose lesser minimum penalties than those prescribed by those statutes. Because the imposition of a minimum sentence under the RRRI Act allows appellee to be released from prison before his mandatory minimum sentences expire, the Commonwealth concludes that the sentences imposed were illegal.

The Commonwealth highlights the language in Section 6317(a), <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>which states that it applies “... notwithstanding any other provision of this title, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or other statute to the contrary,” and the language in Section 7508(a) which similarly states, “[notwithstanding any other provisions of this or any other act to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply.... ”</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[270,688,1157,1111]]]'>As an apparent alternative argument, the Commonwealth describes a manner in which' the RRRI Act and the drug sentencing provisions may be read together so as to accomplish the objectives of each. With regard to Section 7508, the Commonwealth reasons that appellee must serve a term of incarceration in compliance with Section 7508, but that does not alter his status as an eligible offender under the RRRI Act for purposes of present and future crimes. The Commonwealth focuses on the phrase “has not been found guilty or previously convicted” in Section 4503(6) of the RRRI Act. It reasons that “[t]he exclusion of the violations of [35 P.S. § 780-113](a)(30) for the highest weight of drugs does not only impact the eligibility of the offender for RRRI in the current case, but also for future offenses.” Appellant’s Br. at 15-16. The Commonwealth then posits that, “[appellee] would be eligible for an RRRI [Act] minimum sentence if the trial court would have to run another sentence consecutive to Count 1 herein.” <em>Id. </em>at 16. The Commonwealth explains that the RRRI Act defined “eligible offender” in this manner in order to put defendants on notice of the impact of these convictions in the future.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[273,1848,1154,527]]]'>Reading Section 6317 and the RRRI Act together, the Commonwealth notes that the RRRI Act does not affirmatively mention school-zone mandatory penalties as being subject to the RRRI Act’s minimum sentence. Because the school-zone statute does not affect future RRRI eligibility, the Commonwealth determines that the RRRI Act is still effective, even if it is deemed not to apply to Section 6317 drug offenders. Moreover, the Commonwealth continues, the language of Section 6317 indicates that that statute is superior to any other statute that conflicts with its mandatory penalties.</p>

      <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>Finally, the Commonwealth relies on the rule of statutory construction dictating that when a general provision conflicts with a “specific” provision, they should be read in a manner that gives effect to both; and if the conflict cannot be reconciled, the specific provision controls the general one, unless the general provision is later in time and there is a “manifest intention” that the general provision control. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1933. The Commonwealth notes that “[statutes designed to establish proper procedures for sentencing all defendants who commit crimes are general provisions.” Appellant’s Br. at 16-17 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Klingensmith, </em><a href="/pa-super/437/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="437 Pa.

In the Commonwealth’s view, the RRRI Act is such a general provision since it “governs the sentencings of all defendants,” whereas Sections 6317 and 7508 are specific provisions since they “are applicable only to a small subset of defendants____” Appellant’s Br. at 17. Recognizing that the RRRI Act was enacted more recently than the mandatory penalties of Sections 6317 and 7508, the Commonwealth contends that the earlier-in-time provisions still control because there is no “manifest intention” that the general RRRI Act supersede those specific mandatory penalties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Since the Legislature specifically excluded only some drug offenses from RRRI Act eligibility, appellee argues, the logical conclusion is that the remaining offenders are eligible <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>for RRRI programs. Appellee’s offenses were not ones designated by the RRRI Act as ineligible offenses. In appellee’s view (and as the lower courts reasoned), the RRRI statute merely supplements the existing sentencing requirements. Thus, the sentencing judge still imposes mandatory sentences as required, but now must simply determine if the defendant is RRRI Act-eligible and if so, what his RRRI Act minimum sentence would be. Appellee analogizes the RRRI Act to the motivational boot camp program, 61 Pa.C.S. §§ 3901-3909, which allows a judge to designate an offender as boot-camp eligible even when imposing a mandatory minimum sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Finally, if there is a conflict between the drug trafficking sentencing provisions and the RRRI Act, appellee maintains, the RRRI Act must be applied because it was the more recently adopted statute.</p>

The joint brief submitted on behalf of the Pennsylvania Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Public Defender Association of Pennsylvania largely echoes the rationale of the lower courts and appellee <em>(i.e., </em>there is no statutory conflict because the mandatory sentence is imposed along with the RRRI Act minimum sentence). The second defense-side <em>amicus </em>brief, submitted by the Defender Association of Philadelphia, maintains that the mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and the RRRI Act are irreconcilable because the former prohibit what the latter expressly requires — a minimum term of incarceration less than that provided for in the mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.

Appellee’s sentence is within those limits. Moreover, the Sentencing Code amendments require that an RRRI Act minimum sentence be imposed “in addition to a minimum sentence,” not instead of the minimum sentence. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9756(b.l). In this case, the trial court imposed mandatory minimum sentences within the statutory limits, in accordance with Sections 6317 and 7508, and also imposed RRRI Act minimum sentences, in accordance with the RRRI Act.

We conclude that the interpretation explained above — that both the mandatory minimum sentence and the RRRI Act minimum sentence are to be imposed for RRRI Act-eligible offenders-is the one that follows the plain language of the statutes, and gives effect to all of the relevant provisions, consistent with principles of statutory construction. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1933.</p>
