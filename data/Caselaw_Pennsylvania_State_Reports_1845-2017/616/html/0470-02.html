    <blockquote id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[212,649,1111,470]]]'>(1) Did the Commonwealth Court depart from accepted judicial practice or abuse its discretion when the court ignored the plain language of Section 2704(a) of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. § 2704(a), and held that where “a railroad pays to operate on a rail line but has no ownership interest in or maintenance responsibility for the rail line or facilities at a crossing, it is not a ‘concerned party1 subject to allocation under Section 2704(a)?</blockquote>
