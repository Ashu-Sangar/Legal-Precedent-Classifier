Prior to sentencing, Willis filed a motion challenging the verdict as against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. Willis also filed a motion for a new trial on the basis of an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation by the Commonwealth. Specifically, Willis alleged that Peoples had <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>made a deal -with the Commonwealth prior to trial, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to certain unrelated charges in exchange for the Commonwealth’s <em>nolle pros </em>of certain other charges, including the robbery of Thomas. Willis averred that, in the course of his discussions with police, Peoples indicated that he committed the Thomas robbery with someone other than Willis, namely, a man named Robert Richardson a/k/a Woodard (hereinafter “Woodard”). The statement was inadvertently omitted from documents produced by the Commonwealth prior to trial, and was discovered by the prosecutor in her file following trial. The statement was brought to the trial court’s attention, and the court offered to allow the victim to view another photo array containing a photo of Woodard, but Willis’ counsel refused.</p>

Willis’ counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s statement, nor did she request that Peoples be brought to court to confirm on the record that he would invoke the Fifth Amendment if asked to testify about the robbery.</p>

Bronson acknowledged that Peoples’ statement, which identified someone other than Willis as the person who robbed Thomas, “plainly was exculpatory and should have been provided to the defense.” <em>Commonwealth v. Willis, </em>CP-51-CR-1000571-2005, unpublished memorandum at 5 (Phila. Cty. filed Sept. 4, 2007). Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that Peoples’ statement was not material within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>because disclosure of the statement could not have affected the outcome of the case. Specifically, the trial court reasoned that Peoples’ out-of-court statement was inadmissible hearsay, and that, based on the prosecutor’s statement that Peoples’ attorney told her he would advise Peoples not to testify, Peoples’ statement would never have been introduced <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>to the jury. In addition, the trial court noted “the evidence at the hearing established that Woodard did not resemble [Willis], thereby making it improbable that the complaining witness confused [Willis] for Woodard and made a misidentification.” <em>Id. </em>at 6. Accordingly, on March 16, 2007, the trial court denied Willis’ motion for a new trial based on the Commonwealth’s alleged <em>Brady </em>violation, and sentenced Willis to an aggregate term of 10 to 20 years incarceration.</p>

In doing so, the Superior Court relied on this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Green, supra, </em>for the proposition that <em>Brady </em>does not require an analysis of the admissibility of evidence before such evidence can be deemed material. Specifically, the Superior Court noted that Peoples’ statement “goes directly to the potential innocence of Willis;” that there was no proof that Peoples would have refused to testify; and that, “even if the statement were not admissible, it is not the Commonwealth’s role to determine how defense counsel shall use such evidence.” <em>Willis, </em>1024 EDA 2007, at 6.</p>

Brady was tried first, and, at trial, he took the stand and admitted his participation in the crime, but claimed that Boblit did the actual killing. After Brady was convicted, sentenced, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal, Brady discovered that, despite his counsel’s pre-trial request to examine all of Boblit’s extrajudicial statements, one of those statements, in which Boblit admitted to the actual homicide, was withheld by the prosecution. Brady’s petition for post-conviction relief was dismissed by the trial court, but the Maryland Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a retrial on the issue of punishment only. The United States Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari, </em>and agreed with the Court of Appeals that the prosecutor’s nondisclosure of Boblit’s confession violated Brady’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, explaining “the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">373 U.S. at 87</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">83 S.Ct. 1194</a>.</p>

Prior to Bagley’s trial on charges that he violated federal narcotics and firearms statutes, his counsel requested that the prosecution disclose any inducements that were made to witnesses that were called by the government. The prosecution failed to disclose that two of its principal witnesses had been promised the possibility of a reward for the information they supplied to investigators.

Specifically, when asked whether he had assisted his brother in the robbery, or whether he and his brother were, at any time, in the laundromat together, Rodney answered in the negative; the examiner, however, concluded that Rodney’s answers suggested deception. The district court denied relief; however, the Ninth Circuit reversed. While noting that polygraph examinations are inadmissible as evidence under Washington law, even for impeachment purposes, the court concluded that the results were, nevertheless, material under <em>Brady, </em>in that, had Bartholomew’s counsel known of the polygraph results, “he would have had a stronger reason to pursue an investigation of Rodney’s story,” and “likely would have taken Rodney’s deposition.” <em>Bartholomew v.

The information at issue here, then — the results of a polygraph examination of one of the witnesses — is not “evidence” at all. Disclosure of the polygraph results, then, could have had no direct effect on the outcome of trial, because respondent could have made no mention of them either during argument or while questioning witnesses. To get around this problem, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the information, had it been disclosed to the defense, might have led respondent’s counsel to conduct additional discovery that might have led to some additional evidence that could have been utilized. Other than expressing a belief that in a deposition Rodney might have confessed to his involvement in the initial stages of the crime — a confession that itself would have been in no way inconsistent with respondent’s guilt — the Court of Appeals did not specify what particular evidence it had in mind. Its judgment is based on mere speculation, in violation of the standards we have established.</blockquote>

In response, Willis claims that his failure to obtain an affidavit or certification is not fatal to his claim, as there was no purpose to be served by attempting to obtain an affidavit, in view of the prosecutor’s representation that Peoples intended to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We find it disingenuous for Willis to challenge the trial court’s reliance on the prosecutor’s statement that Peoples intended to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, yet rely on the prosecutor’s statement to excuse his failure to attempt to obtain a written statement from Peoples as to whether he was willing to testify.</p>

Throughout its brief to this Court, the Commonwealth makes conflicting statements as to the proper interpretation of <em>Wood. </em>For example, on page 11 of its brief, the Commonwealth asserts that, under <em>Wood, </em>"admissibility is ... a prerequisite to materiality under <em>Brady." </em>

In other portions of its brief, the Commonwealth adopts a more qualified position, stating " [decisions of both the United States and Pennsylvania Supreme Courts subsequent to <em>Green </em>have clarified that inadmissible evidence will not be deemed material under <em>Brady, at least where there is no showing that it would have led to the discovery of admissible evidence." </em>Commonwealth's Brief at 11 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Commonwealth’s Brief at 13 ("[T]he vast majority of other jurisdictions have held that information cannot meet the <em>Brady </em>materiality standard where it is inadmissible <em>and the defendant makes no showing that it would have led to the discovery of admissible evidence." </em>(emphasis added)). Notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth is inconsistent in its characterization of the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Wood, </em>in its reply brief, the Commonwealth takes Willis to task for pointing out such inconsistencies, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>“[t]he Commonwealth has not argued that inadmissible evidence can <em>never </em>qualify as <em>Brady </em>material.” Commonwealth’s Reply Brief at 4 (emphasis original). The Commonwealth, in its reply brief, goes so far as to urge this Court to "adopt the (apparently unopposed) rule that, to satisfy <em>Brady’s </em>materiality standard, a defendant must show that the suppressed information was admissible or would have led to the discovery of admissible information.” <em>Id. </em>at 5. As the Commonwealth seemingly concedes that nondisclosed evidence which itself is inadmissible at trial may still be material under <em>Brady, </em>if such evidence would have led to the discovery of admissible information, we question the Commonwealth's reason for urging this Court to reconsider that portion of our holding in <em>Green.</em>

With respect to Ly’s claim that the Commonwealth improperly withheld other evidence in violation of <em>Brady, </em>this Court determined that each specific claim failed, either because the Commonwealth’s failure to disclose was not prejudicial, or because the evidence was not material because it was neither exculpatory, nor related to the credibility of a witness.</p>

The OAJC characterizes the “therefore” language as an "inadvertently misplaced adverb by the <em>Green </em>Court, and not a deliberate misrepresentation of the law.” OAJC Op. at 660. I have not suggested that the <em>Green </em>Court "misrepresented” the law; rather, I am demonstrating its misapprehension and misstatement of governing federal law, which is not remotely the same thing. I do not doubt that the error in <em>Green </em>was in good faith, but it is an error nevertheless that we have a responsibility to recognize.</p>

Notably, the <em>Wood </em>Court, unlike the <em>Green </em>Court, was careful to identify the actual precedential standing of <em>Bagley </em>on this point; and when it spoke of what the <em>Bagley </em>lead opinion and concurrence could be said to have established, it confined its characterization to the reasonable probability standard, with no mention of speculative effects upon trial preparation.</p>
