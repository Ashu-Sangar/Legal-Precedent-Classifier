A complaint was filed on August 2, 2007, alleging medical negligence last occurring on July 7, 2003. Appellant’s primary insurer, Pennsylvania Healthcare Providers Insurance Exchange (“PaHPIX”), requested that the claim be accorded Section 715 status by the Insurance Department. The Department denied such request, however, on the basis that the claim had been made less than four years after the alleged malpractice. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1303.715(a).

The claims examiner added that Appellant and PaHPIX first received notice of the writ on July 23, 2007, over four years after the asserted medical negligence. According to his testimony, this date is significant to Appellant’s primary coverage, since the policy was written on a claims-made basis, pursuant to which coverage is provided for claims received by an insured and reported to the insurer during the policy period. <em>See </em>N.T., May 29, 2008, at 17, 31; Exhibit 2 to Joint Stipulation of Facts, at 9 (reflecting the policy’s definition of a claim, subsuming “[wjritten notification received by an insured of a suit or receipt by an insured of any other request for compensation to which this insurance applies made by or on behalf of an injured party to which this insurance applies”).</p>

Brief for Appellee at 15 (asserting that Appellant “ignores the fact that there is a notice provision in the 180-day requirement, so the purpose and effect of service of process are achieved by Section 715.”). Appellee also posits that the amendment of the statutory language from a claim being “filed” to a claim being “made” did not, as Appellant argues, impose a communication or notice requirement.

In the first instance, the concept of a claim being made, considered in very broad terms, may indicate the claim’s mere coming into existence, as Appellee asserts. On the other hand, as used in the litigation setting, the term often connotes conveyance of a demand to those intended to respond in damages. Indeed, the conception of the making of a claim has attained a particular meaning (or set of meanings) in the context of claims-made policies in the insurance setting, of which the General Assembly is well aware. <em>See, e.g., </em>40 P.S. § 1303.702 (defining “Claims made” as “[m]edical professional liability insurance that insures those claims made or reported during a period which is insured and excludes coverage for a claim reported subsequent to the period even if the claim resulted from an occurrence during the period which was insured”). Moreover, consistent with the primary liability policy maintained by Appellant, most claims-made policies incorporate some conception of notice to at least the insured. <em>See </em>Allan D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes 5th § 11.5 (2012) (“[I]n general, a claim is not made against an insured unless the insured has received notice of its existence.”); <em>accord Wolfson v.

As to Section 715’s purpose, we find that Appellee views this too abstractly in its indication that the statute merely sets out criteria by which to determine which claims are, and are not, eligible for first-dollar indemnity and costs of defense treatment. As Appellant stresses, there is an underlying reason why the Legislature has drawn this distinction among claims, which we agree is to afford insurers greater certainty in calculating reserves. <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>

Appellee, however, does not provide a particular limiting principle, other than by way of the suggestion that, in the absence of notice (such as by way of a demand letter), the commencement of a civil action is another avenue for making a claim for Section 715 purposes. In our view, however, consistent with the approach specified in the claims-made primary liability policy maintained by Dr. Yussen and in many other such policies, the concept of communication or notice supplies the most rational limiting principle in the Section 715 context as well. <em>Accord supra </em>note 3.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Therefore, the legislature obviously recognized a difference between three events: a claim being made, the claim being <em>filed, </em>and <em>giving notice </em>of the claim.

There is a notice requirement triggering the date for a request for indemnity, but no such requirement when considering the time a claim was “made” or “filed.” The statute recognizes the distinction between making or filing a claim and providing notice thereof through service on the other party.
