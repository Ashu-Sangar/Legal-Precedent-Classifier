Of particular concern to Appellants were several requests filed by an individual utilizing a post office box because it was unclear to whom and for what purpose the information would be disseminated. Upon discovering that many school districts had not challenged, or would not challenge, the release of such information, Appellants filed a petition for review against the OOR in the Commonwealth Court, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the disclosure of school employees’ names and home addresses and a declaration that such information is exempt from disclosure under the RTKL. The Commonwealth Court granted two petitions to intervene by parties supporting the OOR, filed by: (1) Simon Campbell, President of StopTeacherStrikes, Inc., an advocacy group with the purpose of eliminating teacher strikes that often requests contact information for non-union school teachers, <em>see </em>Petition to Intervene of Simon Campbell, at 1-2; and (2) the Pennsylvania Association of School Retirees (“PASR”), an association of former school employees, which routinely requests the <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>names and addresses of retired employees, <em>see </em>Brief of Intervenors Pennsylvania Association of School Retirees, Kirkwood, Nye, Vak and Rowland, at 5.</p>

Although arguably the more appropriate party in interest, SWB Yankees did not receive notice of the initial record request, and did not participate either in the agency’s decision to deny access to the records or in the requestors’ appeal to the OOR. SWB Yankees intervened in the matter only after the OOR ordered release of the entity’s records by filing an appeal from the OOR’s adjudication to the court of common pleas. As I explained in my concurrence, subsequent judicial review in this Court appeared materially affected by how the matter proceeded through the administrative process, as SWB Yankees pursued relief on grounds limited to those specific issues addressed by the agency and the OOR in proceedings in which SWB Yankees did not participate. As a result, on appeal to this Court, the parties did not address foundational notions on which the decision may have turned, such as whether the requested information was a “public record” in the first instance. <em>Id. </em>at 1045 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2, 1048 (Castille, C.J., concurring). <em>Cf.

Beyond the immediate question of whether PSEA may call upon the Commonwealth Court to exercise its original jurisdiction and decide this matter under the Declaratory Judgment Act, I am persuaded that appellants correctly identify substantial due process concerns, especially regarding notice to and the right to appeal by third parties affected by a Right-to-Know Law request <em>(i.e., </em>not the requestor or the agency to which the request is made).

For example, in this appeal, the OOR takes the position that notice to school employees regarding a request for disclosure of personal information should be addressed at a local level, via regulations promulgated by individual school districts. OOR’s Brief at 9, 12 (citing 65 P.S. §§ 67.504(a), 67.1101(a)). The OOR’s position appears to have some support in the plain language of the provisions it cites, because Section 504(a) grants local agencies the authority to “promulgate regulations and policies necessary for the agency to implement [the Right-to-Know Law].” <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.504(a); <em>but see </em>65 P.S. § 67.1101(a) (authorizing filing of appeal by requestor). But, the Right-to-Know Law also authorizes the OOR to “promulgate regulations relating to appeals involving <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>a Commonwealth agency or local agency.” <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.504(a); <em>see also </em>65 P.S. § 67.1102(b) (“Procedures. — The Office of Open Records ... may adopt procedures relating to appeals under this chapter.”). As a practical matter, the OOR may be in the best position to devise an adequate procedure governing all appeals to the OOR that complies with and promotes uniformity in the OOR’s administration of the Right-to-Know Law. As applied here though, the downside of the approach advocated by the OOR is obvious: individual school districts do not have the OOR’s expertise regarding enforcement of the Right-to-Know Law necessary to implement an adequate policy; school districts may or may not adopt policies in time to address record requests; and the school districts’ action is likely to result in a patchwork of policies that may or may not resolve due process concerns. Accordingly, I am skeptical of the OOR’s apparent decision to abdicate its potential role as the agency responsible for adopting regulations that facilitate the appeal process and its administration of the Right&gt;-to-Know Law, uniformly and in accordance with its expertise. <em>See, generally, </em>65 P.S. § 67.1310(a).</p>

The Commonwealth Court addressed the OOR’s participation as a party in the <em>East Stroudsburg </em>appeal from its adjudication, and that decision’s progeny, as an issue of “standing.” 995 A.2d at 507. But, "the core of the concept of standing is that a person who is not adversely affected in any way by the matter he seeks to challenge is not aggrieved thereby and has no right to obtain a judicial resolution of his challenge.” <em>Commonwealth, Pa. Game Comm'n v. Commonwealth, Dep’t of Env. Res., </em><a href="/pa/521/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="521 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1817477" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0121-01">521 Pa. 121</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="521 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1817477" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0121-01">555 A.2d 812</a>, 815 (1989) (emphasis added). In the <em>East Stroudsburg </em>appeal, as here, the OOR was not mounting any challenge but was in a defensive posture; accordingly, an inquiry into its "standing” in that appeal was misplaced. Indeed, in support of its decision, the Commonwealth Court relied on cases in which the agency at issue was an appellant, without apparent appreciation of the procedural posture of the cases. The Commonwealth Court’s extrapolation to cases in which the agency is in a defensive procedural posture, whether in the Commonwealth Court’s original or appellate jurisdiction, is questionable. Moreover, even where the agency is seeking to bring legal action, standing is a fact-intensive matter, of which the party's agency status and role in the statutory scheme are but factors. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 815-16; <em>Pa.

Indeed, in delineating the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, the legislature imposed the necessity of an action against the “Commonwealth government.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 761(a)(1). This mandate is satisfied here, as the Judicial Code defines the “Commonwealth government” as including “the courts and other officers or agencies of the unified judicial system, the General Assembly and its officers and agencies, the Governor, and the departments, boards, commissions, authorities and officers and agencies of the Commonwealth.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 102.
