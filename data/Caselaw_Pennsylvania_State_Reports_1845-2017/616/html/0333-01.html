While Claimant was cleaning the patient’s tracheotomy, the patient coughed, causing sputum to spray in Claimant’s left eye. Claimant proceeded immediately to Lancaster General’s emergency room, where she had her eye flushed, received antibiotics, and was told to see her eye doctor. Approximately two weeks after the incident, Claimant’s eye became swollen and infected, and Claimant believed she contracted HSV.

In October 2006, however, while Claimant was working for the Heart Group, Claimant’s eye again became infected and, this time, her infection did not respond to treatment. By February 2007, Claimant lost the vision in her left eye, and, in May 2007, she underwent a cornea transplant.

Lancaster General denied the allegations. Before Workers’ Compensation Judge Robert Benischeck (“WCJ”), Claimant presented the testimony of Dr. Barton Halpem, who testified that he began treating Claimant in 1985 and that Claimant sustained a dense vascularized corneal scar related to chronic inflammation from her contraction of HSV. Dr. Halpern testified that there was nothing wrong with Claimant’s corneal transplant, but that the infection can affect other tissues in the eye beyond the cornea, which can lead to blindness, and that her injury was the result of this HSV infection. Lancaster General presented the testimony of Dr. Kristen Hammersmith, who agreed with much of Dr. Halpern’s testimony, but believed it was merely possible, but not likely, that the incident with the tracheotomy patient was the actual source of Claimant’s infections. Dr. Hammersmith testified that Claimant’s report of poor vision following the incident, absent any redness or vesicles in the skin, was more typical of a secondary infection rather than an initial exposure to HSV.</p>

The WCJ determined Claimant suffered a work-related injury on May 16, 2007, the date on which her doctor informed her of her likely permanent blindness and of her inability to return to work. The WCJ also found her work-related injury stemmed from the incident with the tracheotomy patient, as that incident led to her contracting HSV, which, in turn, caused her blindness almost 30 years later. The WCJ noted Claimant’s pay was determined by the hour, and, applying Section 309 of the Act, which we discuss in detail <em>infra, </em>the WCJ calculated Claimant’s benefits as $389.50 per week for 275 weeks, a sum calculated based on Claimant’s 2007 wages with the Heart Group.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Lancaster General submits the phrases “by the employer” and “in the employ of the employer” in subsection (d.l) plainly refer to the employer who would pay workers’ compensation benefits (the “payor”). Based on this premise, Lancaster General contends Section 309(d.l) applies when a claimant suffers a work-related injury, but, in the 52 weeks before the injury, has not completed three consecutive 13-week periods of employment with the payor. Lancaster General posits the claimant’s average weekly wage is then calculated by dividing <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>by 13 the total wages earned in the 13-week period of employment with the payor nearest to the date of the work-related injury.

As such, Lancaster General submits Claimant’s average weekly wage should be calculated using her most recently completed 13-week period of employment with Lancaster General prior to her injury, which occurred in 1985 when Claimant was earning $8.00 per hour.

Specifically, Lancaster General claims calculating a claimant’s average weekly wage based on her employment with an unaffiliated, subsequent employer could lead to absurd results, particularly where the claimant acquired additional education, changed careers, or realized a sizable increase in income. It would be difficult, Lancaster General alleges, for an employer or insurer to predict its workers’ compensation liability if it were required to consider the possible average weekly wages of all former employees, no matter their current salary or career. As a corollary, Lancaster General contends using the last wages earned with the payor for purposes of calculating a claimant’s average weekly wage does not necessarily work an injustice against a claimant, as sometimes those wages will be higher than a claimant’s current salary, and, in any event, such a method provides predictability in the calculation for both employers and claimants.</p>

Further, Claimant notes the Act is to be construed in favor of the employee in order to achieve its humanitarian objectives, and, to that end, fixing her average weekly wage in 2007 more accurately reflects her actual economic loss. Finally, Claimant avers Section 309(e) of the Act allows “exceptional causes” to be considered when an average weekly wage computation does not fairly ascertain the wages actually earned by the injured employee.

For purposes of the Act, Section 103, 77 P.S. § 21, defines “employer” as “synonymous with master, and to include natural persons, partnerships, joint-stock companies, corporations for profit, corporations not for profit, municipal corporations, the Commonwealth, and all governmental agencies created by it.” This definition is of little help in resolving the matter <em>sub judice, </em>however, as it does not indicate whether “employer” under Section 309 refers to the payor or the employer at the time of the injury — that is, in this case, both Lancaster General and the Heart Group fit the definition of employer.</p>

Similarly, Section 306(e) establishes that the “employer” is liable for surgical and medical expenses associated with the work-related injury. Obviously, in using the term “employer,” these sections each refer to the payor, as they discuss the employer as the entity or person responsible for paying benefits and medical expenses. While it would be superficially appealing to thus conclude the term “employer,” as it is used in Section 309, should likewise refer to the payor, a closer analysis reveals that Section 309 involves a different focus than Sections 301(a) and 306(e). More specifically, Section 301(a) establishes when the payor becomes liable for workers’ compensation benefits, and Section 306(e) outlines the expenses for which the payor is responsible. Neither section, however, concerns the calculation of those liabilities. In contrast, Section 309 is concerned with calculating the claimant’s average weekly wage “at the time of the injury,” which, as this case suggests, could be long after the incident which established the payor’s liability. For this reason, the meaning of “employer” in Sections 301(a) and 306(e) does not necessarily control the question of which employer is relevant for purposes of calculating the average weekly wage. Moreover, Section 309 itself does not explicitly indicate which “employer” — the payor or the employer at the time of the injury — is relevant for purposes of its calculation. As the language of the Act is not explicit regarding the present question under Section 309, we turn to principles of statutory construction. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

First, the express language of the subsections of Section 309 directs attention to the time of the injury, as subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) begin explicitly with the language, “if at the time of the injury, the wages are fixed by ...,” thereby signaling that the time of the injury is the relevant time period for purposes of examining how the injured employee earned <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>his or her wages. Notably, this language also refers to the manner in which wages “are fixed,” attaching a present tense meaning (relative to the injury) to the term “wages,” and thus appearing to exclude consideration of wages earned by a prior employer. Moreover, subsections (d), (d.l), and (e), in establishing their respective formulas, consider periods of time “immediately preceding the injury,” again focusing on the period of time nearest to the date of the work-related injury. Furthermore, interpreting “employer” to mean the employer at the time of the injury is consistent with the goal of providing a claimant specific loss benefits calculated using an accurate representation of the claimant’s actual lost wages as of the date of the injury. <em>See Hannaberry HVAC, </em><a href="/pa/575/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="575 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="630352" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0066-01">575 Pa. at 81-82</a>, <a href="/pa/575/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="834 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="630352,9080745" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0066-01,/a2d/834/0524-01">834 A.2d at 533</a> (concluding the goal in enacting the current version of Section 309(d) was to provide a more accurate representation of an injured employee’s lost wages, and to eliminate the mischief of an injured employee’s relying on artificially high periods of earnings to receive inflated workers’ compensation benefits). Otherwise, interpreting “employer” to mean the employer at the time of the initial incident would result in a claimant receiving specific loss benefits calculated using out-of-date wages merely because the claimant’s injury happened to lie dormant for a period of time. Indeed, here, were we to interpret “employer” to mean the employer at the time of the initial incident, Claimant would receive specific loss benefits calculated using wages she earned over 20 years ago.</p>

The loss of claimant’s vision is compensable at the rate paid “immediately preceding the injury”; here, that is 2007. However, for purposes of which employer must pay the <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>benefits, the injury was in 1979, 28 years before it happened for purposes of setting the rate. This incongruity is not before us, as Lancaster General neither contests responsibility for claimant’s benefits, nor challenges the date of the injury.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[279,538,1149,460]]]'>While the claimant benefits here from our result, it is because her wage increased between the “incident” and the injury manifesting itself. The precedent of this case may easily work to the detriment of the next claimant whose wages <em>decreased </em>between incident and manifestation. Sometimes the desire to effectuate the humanitarian purposes of the Act, interpreting ambiguous language with an eye toward charitable results, can lead to a rule with non-charitable results in the next case.</p>
    <p id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[278,1031,1151,305]]]'>Thus, this case reveals a gap in the legislative scheme in which an appropriate response should come from the legislature, not this Court. This case points out several incongruities arising from situations not clearly contemplated when crafting the statute, which should be dealt with comprehensively by our legislature, not piecemeal by the courts.</p>
