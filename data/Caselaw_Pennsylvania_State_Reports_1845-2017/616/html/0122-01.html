The trial court discontinued the case because the Commonwealth failed to bring Defendant to trial within the time required by Pennsylvania’s speedy trial rule, Pa.R.Crim.P. 600, when the Magisterial District Judge failed to forward timely the relevant file as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 547(B). Upon review, we determine that dismissal was not appropriate under Rule 600 when the Commonwealth acted with due diligence in relying upon the judicial system to transfer documents in accordance with the Rules of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of charges and remand to the trial court.</p>

Defendant was arrested the next day, charged with kidnapping, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and terroristic threats. The following day, Defendant was arraigned and bail was set at $100,000. When Defendant could not make bail, he was incarcerated in the Allegheny County Jail.</p>

An assistant district attorney represented the Commonwealth during the hearing and sought amendment of the charges to add one count each of sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, and indecent assault.

Accordingly, the case was not entered into the Department’s docketing system. The docketing system is designed to generate a “CR Number,” which is then automatically transmitted to the District Attorney’s office, launching that office’s docketing system that tracks cases for Rule 600 purposes. As a CR Number was not generated in this case, the District Attorney’s office’s tracking system was not triggered. Instead, following the preliminary hearing, Defendant returned to the Allegheny County jail where he remained with no further proceedings until October 9, 2009. On that date, Defendant filed a counseled motion to dismiss charges pursuant to Rule 600, which provides for the dismissal of charges when a defendant’s trial has not commenced within 365 days of the filing of the criminal complaint subject to certain exclusions and extensions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Counsel filed the motion <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>to dismiss at a miscellaneous docket number because no CR Number had been assigned to the case by the Department of Court Records.</p>

The District Attorney’s office contacted the Magisterial District Office, which immediately sent the documents by facsimile to the Department of Court Records. When the Department entered the information into the docketing system and generated a “CR number,” the CR number was then electronically transmitted to the District Attorney’s computer docketing system on October 15, 2009. The District Attorney filed a criminal information on the same day. A pre-trial conference was scheduled for October 23, 2009, and trial was set for the first available date of December 7, 2009.

The court further concluded that the District Attorney’s office did not exercise due diligence in bringing the case to trial: “The Court finds there was no diligence exercised in light of the serious nature of the charges. The only system in place [for Rule 600 compliance] is that of reliance upon the clerks of the District Magistrate Court and the Department of Court Records.” Tr. Ct.

On December 29, 2009, the trial court filed a comprehensive opinion reviewing the case law surrounding Pennsylvania’s speedy trial jurisprudence and supporting its dismissal of the charges. The court recognized that the Commonwealth alleged that it acted with due diligence in relying upon the District Judge’s compliance with Pa.R.Crim.P. 547(B), which would have triggered the Commonwealth’s internal docketing system for Rule 600 compliance, and thus, that the failure to prosecute the case within the statutory timeframe was attributable to judicial delay rather than its own lack of diligence.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[288,1475,1150,732]]]'>While the court acknowledged that the Commonwealth could not control the clerical error of the District Judge or the failure of the postal system to deliver the documents to the Department of Court Records, it “could control the possible effect of a clerical or administrative error and prevent any threat to its obligation to commence the trial as required by Rule 600 by instituting a system to track cases prosecuted at Preliminary Hearings by Assistant District Attorneys which are held for court.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 16. The trial court concluded that the Commonwealth did not exercise “due diligence when it use[d] the receipt of the paperwork from the District Judge as a ‘trigger’ when the obligation to bring the Defendant to trial under Rule 600 commences with the filing of the complaint.” Tr.

The majority opinion recognized <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>that the key issue in the case is whether the Commonwealth acted with due diligence, pursuant to Rule 600(G), when it relied upon the District Justice’s compliance with the Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 600(G) provides, “If the court, upon hearing, shall determine that the Commonwealth exercised due diligence and that the circumstances occasioning the postponement were beyond the control of the Commonwealth, the motion to dismiss shall be denied and the case shall be listed for trial on a date certain.” The court further recognized while “due diligence does not demand perfection, it does require the Commonwealth to put forth a reasonable effort.” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b185-5" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[140,1249,1154,743]]]'>Applying the law to the case at hand, the Superior Court initially refuted the Commonwealth’s suggestion that any of the delay could be attributable to the Defendant for failing to alert the court or the Commonwealth to the delay in the case, finding that such contention was frivolous. The court next concluded that the Commonwealth’s system of relying upon the District Judge to forward the case information to the Department of Court Records was not reasonable because the Commonwealth had no control over the District Judge’s or the Department of Court Record’s compliance. The court opined that when the assistant district attorney left the preliminary hearing due diligence required the Commonwealth to keep a list, diary, or some other sort of record-keeping system to track the case for Rule 600 purposes.</p>

As discussed more fully below, this Court in <em>Monosky </em>held that Rule 600 did not require dismissal of charges in a case where, as in this case, the defendant was bound over for court at a preliminary hearing but the magistrate did not forward the file in timely <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>compliance with the Rules of Criminal Procedure, thus failing to trigger the district attorney’s internal Rule 600 tracking system. The Superior Court distinguished the case at bar from <em>Monosky, </em>observing that, unlike in <em>Monosky, </em>the assistant district attorney was present at the preliminary hearing in the case before us, thus alerting the District Attorney’s office to the existence of the case. Indeed, the court noted that in <em>Monosky </em>we left open whether the result would be different if the district attorney had been aware of the charges. Accordingly, the majority of the panel affirmed the trial court’s order dismissing the charges based upon the expiration of the 365 day period under Rule 600 and the Commonwealth’s failure to exercise due diligence.</p>
    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[265,1037,1155,742]]]'>Judge Bowes filed a lengthy and emphatic dissent. The dissent first questioned whether the delay was beyond the control of the Commonwealth. Relying upon our decision in <em>Monosky, </em>the dissent opined that the Rule 600 violation resulted not from the Commonwealth’s lack of due diligence but from judicial delay occasioned by the failure of the District Judge to forward the file pursuant to Rule 547(B). The dissent further distinguished the case at bar from <em>Browne, </em><a href="/pa/526/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="526 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1825984" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0083-01">584 A.2d 902</a>.

It asserts that the delay in this case was not the result of the absence of due diligence by the Commonwealth but, instead, due to the failure of the District Judge to comply with the Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Commonwealth maintains that is was reasonable for it to expect that the District Judge would forward the documents in compliance with the rules, thus triggering the internal Rule 600 tracking system, even though the system, like all systems, proved to be imperfect. It avers that it is acceptable for the Commonwealth to utilize the judiciary’s system of tracking cases to trigger its own tracking system, rather than duplicating the effort in a county processing 20,000 cases each year.</p>

The Court in <em>Browne </em>concluded that the district attorney’s failure to maintain a record keeping system constituted a failure to exercise due diligence.

He further argues that due dili<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>gence requires that the Commonwealth take steps to ensure compliance with Rule 600 prior to the mechanical run date, and asserts that prior to that date in this case, the Commonwealth did nothing.
