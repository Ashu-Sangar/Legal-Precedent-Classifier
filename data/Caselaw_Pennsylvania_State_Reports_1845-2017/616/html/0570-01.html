The PCRA claim at issue — apparently pursued here so that appellant’s federal <em>habeas corpus </em>petition can remain in stasis — seeks to innovate a new duty for trial counsel based upon purely personal circumstances, unrelated to the client’s cause, implicating attorney disciplinary proceedings. This claim qualifies for no PCRA time-bar exception; and in any event, since it seeks to condemn counsel retroactively with the burden of a new duty, it is frivolous.</p>

      <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>Whenever possible, serial PCRA petitions should be disposed of, both here and below, quickly and summarily. The necessity for this approach is particularly acute in capital cases because of the incentive to pursue far-fetched claims merely to delay matters; our PCRA courts need to be mindful of this incentive. The petition here is premised upon a more than far-fetched claim of “newly-discovered evidence” that does not even relate to the trial facts. As was most likely the intention here, pendency of appellant’s serial PCRA claim has only caused substantial delay in the administration of justice. In my view, the “new” “facts” that appellant forwards have nothing whatsoever to do with trial counsel’s representation of him, but arise instead from mere speculation as to trial counsel’s personal circumstances at the time of trial. As a matter of law, these “facts” cannot support a cognizable claim of an “actual conflict of interest” that would render counsel ineffective.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[164,1239,1153,902]]]'>On the time-bar question, appellant describes the documentation concerning disciplinary proceedings against his trial counsel as “newly discovered evidence” that “came to light only after new counsel was appointed to represent [appellant]” following completion of appellant’s first round of PCRA review, which concluded eight years ago, in 2004. Appellant declares that this evidence was “never before available to [appellant] or his counsel.” Piling speculation upon supposition, appellant declares that the fact of the disciplinary investigation alone proves that trial counsel’s performance was hampered by an “actual” conflict of interest because counsel supposedly “rushed forward” with trial without sufficient investigation and preparation; did so in order to obtain “substantial counsel fees” before being suspended from the practice of law; and “tread[ed] lightly” in handling appellant’s trial in anticipation of needing a favorable reference from the Lehigh County prosecutor’s office.

The Commonwealth cites testimony of the attorney who prosecuted appellant’s first PCRA petition, who was aware that disciplinary action had been taken against appellant’s trial counsel, and who evidently did not determine such action to be a basis to allege an actual conflict of interest in appellant’s first PCRA petition. The Commonwealth argues that as a matter of law, information that has been public record for years simply cannot be deemed “new” for purposes of the PCRA time-bar, and particularly not with “newness” being measured by the moment appellant or new collateral counsel stumbles upon the public record.

Appellant acknowledges that in his case, information regarding the disciplinary actions against trial counsel was publicly disclosed and available, but argues that the “principle” expressed in <em>Wilson </em>concerning the non-jurisdictional federal time-bar in AEDPA should apply to constructions of the PCRA’s jurisdictional time-bar, and we should hold that “it is not reasonable to expect [appellant] or his counsel” to discern the need to look into available disciplinary materials.

The defendant’s first round of collateral review concluded in 2002. In January 2004, he filed a second PCRA petition citing a National Academy of Science (“NAS”) study critiquing the FBI’s methods as imprecise and flawed; appended to the second petition was an affidavit from a retired FBI forensic metallurgist, including the metallurgist’s <em>curriculum vitae </em>and list of publications. The defense’s metallurgist opined that the methods used by investigators to connect the defendant to the bullets in the victim’s body were scientifically unreliable. This Court concluded that the NAS study did not support the defendant’s claim, but also that the metallurgist’s affidavit did not cure the serial petition’s untimeliness because the list of publications <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>included in the affidavit showed that criticism of the methods in question was “available and discoverable for more than two years” prior to when the defendant filed his second petition. <a href="/pa/582/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="870 A.2d 864" data-case-ids="650381,9019764" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0276-01,/a2d/870/0864-01">870 A.2d at 871</a>.</p>

The petition alleged that counsel therefore labored under a conflict of interest, and furthermore, the Commonwealth’s failure to inform the defendant of trial counsel’s DOT prosecution amounted to a <em>Brady </em>violation. The defendant argued that his serial petition was timely because it was filed within sixty days after new counsel discovered trial counsel’s DOT. The PCRA court dismissed the defendant’s serial petition as untimely and we affirmed:</p>
    <blockquote id="b633-6" data-blocks='[["BL_633.7",633,[223,1447,1109,580]]]'>This Court has held that, for purposes of [Section] 9545(b)(1)(H), information is not “unknown” to a PCRA petitioner when the information was a matter of public record. Here, the fact that trial counsel was arrested for DOT was a matter of public record and, therefore, cannot be said to have been “unknown” to [the defendant] for purposes of the PCRA’s “newly discovered evidence” exception to the PCRA’s one year jurisdictional time-bar. Accordingly, the PCRA court properly determined that [the defendant’s] argument under the “newly discovered evidence” exception fails.</blockquote>

In that case, two privately retained attorneys represented three accomplices in separate murder trials. Sullivan was first to be tried. He was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, but his two co-defendants were subsequently both acquitted. On non-deferential federal <em>habeas corpus </em>review in that pre-AEDPA case, the Third Circuit found that certain of Sullivan’s attorneys’ actions “raised a possibility of conflict sufficient to prove a violation of Sullivan’s Sixth Amendment rights.” <em><a href="/us/446/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="446 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="6182598" data-case-paths="/us/446/0335-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/446/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="446 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="6182598" data-case-paths="/us/446/0335-01">at 340</a>, <a href="/us/446/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="446 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="6182598" data-case-paths="/us/446/0335-01">100 S.Ct. 1708</a> (recounting procedural background of case).

Even accepting the idle speculations that comprise appellant’s conflict argument, there are stressful matters in the personal lives of lawyers that might affect their ability to prepare for and manage a trial: financial difficulties, substance abuse, marital difficulties, sleep disorders, depression, even collateral attacks by other lawyers involving speculation concerning prior cases. But, appellant’s claim here sounds in an “actual conflict of interest,” a theory appellant prefers because he does not have to prove anything more. But, unlike cases that entail clear and direct conflicts, appellant’s trial counsel was not concurrently representing an accomplice or co-defendant; counsel had not represented the victim or the victim’s family before; and the disciplinary investigation did not even involve this case. This is not a case of conflict; it is a case of rank sophistry.</p>

As members of the bar, lawyers are obligated to recognize and avoid actual conflicts in the first instance, just as they are obligated not to pursue baseless or frivolous claims, as here. Appellant’s current counsel is essentially claiming that trial counsel was obliged, at the time of trial, to inform the court that he had a conflict because of the pending disciplinary investigation and to seek to withdraw from representation of appellant. But nothing in the law, either at the time of appellant’s trial or now, remotely suggests that counsel was bound to view his own unrelated personal disciplinary issues, which were evidently public knowledge in the Lehigh County legal community, as creating an actual conflict with his client. In short, appellant proposes a novel and unprincipled expansion of what <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>amounts to “actual conflict.” Even if a court someday were to adopt such an odd rule, however, that new rule could not be used to retroactively condemn trial counsel’s conduct decades ago.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Instead, he cites the case as supplemental authority for the general propositions that the Sixth Amendment ensures criminal defendants the right to conflict-free counsel and that while conflicts usually arise "in cases in which attorneys represented more than one party, they should be equally applicable when an attorney represents a client whose interests may conflict with his own.” <em>Duffy, </em><a href="/pa/483/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="483 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1751224" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0170-01">394 A.2d at </a>967 &amp; n. 5. The conflict in <em>Duffy </em>arose from evidence of counsel's own role in the crime for which the appellant was on trial. Notably, in <em>Duffy, </em>counsel himself raised the issue. Like <em>Cuyler, Duffy </em>does not establish that a lawyer should deem himself to have an actual conflict of interest with a particular client whenever the lawyer is facing a totally unrelated disciplinary investigation. The indisputable fact remains that neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor this Court has accepted appellant’s expansion of what constitutes an "actual conflict,” much less allowed it to be used as a basis to retroactively condemn trial counsel. Appellant has not shown that his trial counsel, while representing him, labored under a cognizable and actual conflict of interest. Presumed prejudice is therefore not applicable and appellant must prove his claims under the ineffectiveness standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em><a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">466 U.S. 668</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">80 L.Ed.2d 674</a> (1984).
