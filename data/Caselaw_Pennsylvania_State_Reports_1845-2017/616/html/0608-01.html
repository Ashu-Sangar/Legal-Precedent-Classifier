The court further noted that, although Appellant claimed that counsel was ineffective for failing to present the expert testimony of Dr. Walter S. Finken, a psychiatrist who opined at a deposition that Appellant did not possess the requisite specific intent to kill, Dr. Finken had since died. The PCRA court also noted that it would be “extremely difficult if not impossible for the original defense attorneys to recall why they did or did not take any particular action and whether there existed at the time any reasonable <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>basis for not objecting, not calling any particular witness(es), not filing a particular motion or otherwise.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Initially, we note that Section 9543(b) was enacted as a part of the General Assembly’s overhaul of the post-conviction relief process in 1988, <em>see </em>Act of Apr. 13, 1988, P.L. 336, No. 47, § 3, and the requirement that an evidentiary hearing be held prior to dismissal for a delay in filing that causes prejudice to the Commonwealth was added via the 1995 amendments to the PCRA, which also created the one-year jurisdictional time bar, see Act of Nov. 17, 1995, P.L. 1118, No. 32, § 1 (Spec.Sess. No. 1). We have observed that this one-year time limitation, coupled with its <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>few exceptions, reflects a legislative balance between the competing concerns of the finality of adjudications and the reliability of convictions. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Morris, <a href="/pa/573/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="573 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="197188" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0157-01">573 </a></em><a href="/pa/573/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="573 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="197188" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0157-01">Pa. 157</a>, 167, <a href="/pa/573/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="822 A.2d 684" data-case-ids="197188,9131837" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0157-01,/a2d/822/0684-01">822 A.2d 684</a>, 690 (2003); <em>Commonwealth v.

Section 9543(b) further demonstrates this balance by permitting a PCRA court to dismiss a matter on grounds of delay, which promotes the interest in finality, while requiring an evidentiary hearing where the Commonwealth must prove prejudice, thereby protecting the reliability of the underlying conviction. Similarly, as the Commonwealth points out, Section 9543(b) specifies that prejudice can occur “at any time,” indicating that it was not only the commencement of PCRA proceedings with which the Legislature was concerned. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(b).</p>
    <p id="b678-4" data-blocks='[["BL_678.4",678,[261,1137,1155,622]]]'>We are also persuaded by the Commonwealth’s argument that the deliberate placement of Section 9543(b) within the “eligibility for relief portion of the PCRA, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543, rather than the “jurisdiction and proceedings” portion, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545, indicates the Legislature’s intent to connect prejudicial delay to the full scope of a petitioner’s burden to “plead and prove” his claims, rather than to the initial determination of timeliness. In this regard, it is also notable that, in the usual case, the amended petition — rather than the original petition — sets forth the claims that a petitioner must prove and upon which the PCRA court may grant relief.</p>
    <p id="b678-5" data-blocks='[["BL_678.5",678,[262,1791,1154,575]],["BL_679.1",679,[168,331,1155,254]]]'>In addition, it would not serve the purposes of the statute to apply Section 9543(b) only to original or serial petitions, as the one-year time bar and its limited exceptions already provide a significant barrier against delay in such filings. <em>See </em>42 Pa. C.S. § 9545(b). This construction would also render Section 9543(b) virtually superfluous because, similar to the sixty-day limitation on filing serial PCRA petitions based on the statutorily permitted claims, Section 9543(b) expressly does not apply “if the petitioner shows that the petition is based on grounds of which the petitioner could not have discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the delay became <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>prejudicial to the Commonwealth,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(b). Thus, applying Section 9543(b) only to original petitions would not only fail to give effect to the entire statute, but also would lead to an unreasonable result. Moreover, as the Superior Court has aptly noted:</p>
    <blockquote id="b679-4" data-blocks='[["BL_679.5",679,[210,601,1113,306]]]'>Under the current statute, prejudicial delay will most often result not in the filing of an original petition, but from any subsequently amended petitions.

As a final observation, however, we note the troubling nature of the lengthy delay that occurred in this matter, particularly given the clear indication from the record that at least a portion of this lapse was due to the initial PCRA judge’s unexplained failure to appoint counsel for Appellant until almost three years following the Superior Court’s order to do so. <em>See Renchenski II, slip op. </em>at 13 (stating that the responsibility for the delay “can only be placed on [Appellant] and the Judge who originally handled the matter”). Indeed, as Appellant notes, the PCRA court does have the ability and responsibility to manage its docket and caseload and thus has an essential role in ensuring the timely resolution of PCRA matters. <em>See Commonwealth v.
