(“Mother”), then approximately seventeen, were involved in an intimate relationship prior to Father’s incarceration in December 2004 for the shooting death of his stepfather. While Father was incarcerated, S.P. (“Child”) was born in May 2005. According <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>to documents in the record, at the time of Child’s birth Mother was living with a foster family and had been involved with the Washington County Children and Youth Services (“CYS”) for several years. After Child’s birth, Mother took her to visit Father several times while he was incarcerated at the county prison awaiting trial. In December 2005, Child was declared dependent, when Mother tested positive for THC, a chemical found in marijuana, and was involved in a domestic assault in the presence of Child. Following the declaration of Child’s dependency, Mother and Child apparently moved between several foster homes and Child’s grandmother’s home.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[173,919,1153,842]]]'>In January 2006, Father pled guilty to third degree murder and was sentenced to five to ten years of incarceration to be served at a state correctional facility. Father petitioned and the trial court granted one contact visit with Child before Father was transferred to the state facility. After Father was transferred, the trial court denied Father’s February 2006 request for a contact visit due to concerns over the exposure of the young child to the state facility and the absence of an existing relationship or bond with Father. Father filed an appeal of the trial court’s order, which the Superior Court quashed as a result of Father’s untimely Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal. While in prison, Father participated in classes including anger management and vocational training and sent cards and gifts to Child. However, he did not provide any financial support from his prison wages.</p>

After the hearing on the petition, the trial court placed Child in the care of her maternal great-aunt. In October 2007, Mother gave birth to N.D., Child’s half-sister, who was soon thereafter adjudicated dependent and placed in foster care. In November 2007, Child was placed with her half-sister’s foster care family. In September 2008, Mother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights to Child. In December 2008, the trial court changed Child’s goal to adoption and placed Child and <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>N.D. in the care of a maternal great-aunt and uncle.

Ct. Op. at 5. The court further opined, “Although incarceration will certainly impact a parent’s capability of performing parental duties, and <em>may </em>render a parent incapable of performing parental duties under subsection <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>(a)(2), incarceration alone is not sufficient to support termination under any subsection.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>
    <p id="b371-5" data-blocks='[["BL_371.5",371,[176,481,1155,854]]]'>The trial court emphasized that Father had been incarcerated since prior to Child’s birth and that he did not have a relationship with Child due to his incarceration. The court stressed that Father had never been able to provide for Child and had not sent Child any of his prison earnings. Additionally, the court noted that, at the time of his incarceration, Father did not have his own housing, employment, or transportation, and had previously been adjudicated delinquent. Accordingly, the court concluded that Father had been incapable of providing for Child since her birth, and was unable to “maintain” a relationship with Child because one never existed. Noting that Child’s special needs required a “caregiver who can provide almost constant attention to her needs,” the court found that “Father does not currently have the ability to be such a caregiver, nor is it clear when in the future, if ever, he will be capable of doing so.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 7.</p>
    <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.6",371,[175,1376,1157,1012]]]'>The trial court concluded that Father’s parental rights should be terminated under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(a)(2). Specifically, the court observed that, even though there was no affirmative act of Father that resulted in Child being forced into foster care, Father admitted that his incarceration resulted in Child’s placement because his absence caused her to be without essential parental care and control. The court further held that the incapacity would not be remedied by Father because even if he would be released on parole at the first possible date in August 2009, he would enter a halfway house, and still need to obtain housing and employment. Again, considering Child’s special needs, the court concluded “it is not likely that Father will be capable of providing the care and parenting that [Child] needs in a reasonable amount of time.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 8. Recognizing that Father could not provide a date certain when he would be able to parent Child, the court held that Child’s “need for permanence and stability will not be subordinated to a parent’s claims of progress or hope for the future.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 8.</p>

Ct. Op. at 9. The court also recognized Child’s strong bond with her half-sister, with whom she has lived since her half-sister was born in October 2007, and observed that placing Child with Father would result in separating her from her half-sister. Given these considerations, the court granted the petition to terminate Father’s parental rights concluding that termination would best serve the needs and welfare of Child pursuant to § 2511(b).</p>

The Superior Court correctly observed that the <em>McCray </em>decision held that “incarceration is not conclusive of the issue of abandonment,” which was the statutory requirement for termination at the time, but rather required the courts to “inquire whether the parent has utilized those resources at his or her command while in prison in continuing a close relationship with the child. Where the parent does not exercise reasonable firmness in declining to yield to obstacles, his other rights may be forfeited.” <em>McCray, </em><a href="/pa/460/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="460 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="482775" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0210-01">331 A.2d at 655</a> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[271,1253,1155,789]]]'>Important to this decision, the Superior Court recognized that the decision in <em>McCray </em>considered incarceration’s effect on abandonment, which is now encompassed in § 2511(a)(1), rather than incapacity, which is the statutory grounds for termination under § 2511(a)(2) at issue in the case at bar. The Superior Court majority acknowledged that the application of the <em>“McCray </em>rule” to § 2511(a)(2) “has proven difficult, inasmuch as a parent’s incarceration is obviously an ‘incapacity’ that precludes day-to-day interactions and activities normally attendant to a parent-child relationship.” <em>S.P., </em><a href="/a3d/32/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="32 A.3d 723" data-case-ids="7271477" data-case-paths="/a3d/32/0723-01">32 A.3d at 731</a>.

The trial court determined that the length of Father’s sentence was not so great as to foreclose the possibility of the successful maintenance of the parent-child relationship, and that termination of Father’s parental rights would not serve the best interests of the children. The Superior Court viewed the same facts, and drew the opposite conclusion.</blockquote>

This writer authored the referenced concurring opinion in <em>R.I.S. </em>Justice Saylor, joined by Chief Justice Castille, agreed with the thoughts expressed in the concurring opinion, but also opined that the facts of <em>R.I.S. </em>presented a closer case for termination than suggested by the lead opinion. These justices nonetheless deferred to the trial court’s determination denying termination. Additionally, Justice Todd agreed with this author’s concurring opinion but wrote separately to address the standard of review in the case. Justice Orie Melvin dissented from the majority’s ultimate holding, finding instead that the facts of <em>R.I.S. </em>provided grounds for termination. As discussed in detail in the body of this opinion, the dissent was philosophically aligned with the concurrences in the conclusion that the length of incarceration can satisfy the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights under appropriate facts.</p>
