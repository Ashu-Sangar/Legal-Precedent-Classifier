At 6:20 a.m. on February 2, 1995, in York County, Appellant approached Penny Gun-net’s vehicle on the pretense of asking her for directions. He forced her into the passenger seat of her car at gunpoint and then drove to an isolated area. Christina Noland, Appellant’s then-girlfriend, followed him, driving a car they had stolen the previous day in Schuylkill County. While both cars were stopped on an isolated road, Noland heard three gunshots. Appellant then sped off in Ms. Gunnet’s car, with Noland in <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>unsuccessful pursuit in the other stolen car. Ms. Gunnet’s body was found later that morning under the wheels of her abandoned car. Hours after the murder, Appellant tried to sell some of Ms. Gunnet’s jewelry, and he later gave her rings to his ex-wife, Michelle Rhinehart.</p>
    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[137,615,1157,513]]]'>Police apprehended Appellant in a motel room in Carlisle, Blair County, the day after Ms. Gunnet’s murder. When Appellant opened the door to the room and surrendered, he discarded a silver nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol that was subsequently identified as the weapon that had fired at least two of the three nine-millimeter bullets recovered from Ms. Gunnet’s car. In the motel room, police found Appellant’s bloodstained jeans, a knife, nine-millimeter “full metal jacket” ammunition, five credit cards issued in Ms. Gunnet’s name, and one credit card issued in her husband’s name.</p>

Two days before Ms. Gunnet’s murder, on January 31, 1995, Appellant shot and killed his brother, Dustin Spotz, in Clearfield County and then fled with Ms. Noland. The next day, in need of money and a vehicle, Appellant abducted June Ohlinger at gunpoint in Schuylkill County, drove her car to a remote area, and then shot her in the head. After a brief trip to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where Appellant and Ms. Noland attempted to alter their appearances, they drove to York County in search of another vehicle to steal. This was the point at which they came upon Ms. Gunnet. Following the abduction and murder of Ms. Gunnet, Ms. Noland went to Altoona in Blair County, where she surrendered to police, and Appellant went to Cumberland County, where he abducted and murdered his fourth victim, Betty Amstutz, and stole her car and her money.</p>

Furthermore, Appellant fails to recognize or contemplate that the evidence presented at trial strongly indicates that, at the time of Ms. Gunnet’s murder, Appellant was able to formulate the intent to evade the authorities, who he knew were seeking him in connection with a prior homicide; to steal a car from Ms. Gunnet and drive to a remote area with her as a passenger; to take Ms. Gunnet’s cash, as well as her credit cards and rings, which he attempted to sell; to drive away rapidly in her vehicle after firing three shots; and, within hours after the murder, to seek out and find an acquaintance for assistance with his wounds. Finally, Appellant has never admitted that he killed Ms. Gunnet, not at trial, where he attempted to shift blame for the murder onto Ms. Noland, nor in this collateral appeal, where he continues to attempt to implicate Ms. No-land. All of this evidence of Appellant’s directed, intentional, goal-oriented activity at or near the time of the murder argues strongly against his current assertion that diminished capacity would have been a viable guilt-phase defense had counsel only done further investigation.</p>

One example that Dr. Ragusea gave was an observation by an individual who had cared for Appellant as a child “during one of those episodes when his mother would throw him out of the house.” <em>Id. </em>The caregiver said that it was common for Appellant to hide in the closet with the light on in the middle of the night, looking frightened. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Ragusea also cited “frequent references[, which were confirmed by Appellant,] throughout the record during [Appellant’s] childhood and adolescence of over suspiciousness, of paranoia, of reports of hallucinatory experiences, hearing voices, seeing things that aren’t there.” <em>Id. </em>at 281-82. Dr. Ragusea described Appellant as “an individual who tends to experience difficulties with reality testing [and] doesn’t know what’s real some of the time.” <em>Id. </em>at 292. Dr. Ragusea also indicated that drug usage caused further deterioration of Appellant’s mental state: “So I would say that given [Appellant’s] overall profile[,] traumatic experiences, drug-induced experiences would only keep it more difficult for him to stay glued together.” <em>Id. </em>at 284.

Appellant also broadly asserts in this sub-claim that the history of mental illness documented for his father, mother, and brother was “important mitigation” evidence and “also had an important environmental effect on [Appellant’s] development.” Appellant's Brief at 52. Appellant neither develops these assertions in any meaningful way nor provides any citations to the record to support them. Appellant offers no rationale or argument to support his apparent belief that if only the jurors had heard more evidence of Appellant's family history of mental illness, they would have returned a different verdict, despite the fact that the jurors heard testimony from multiple witnesses regarding Appellant's chronically abusive and violently dysfunctional family; his mother’s depression, instability, and suicide attempts; his absent father and cruelly abusive stepfather; his brother’s violent rages, and CYS's attempts to intervene. Under these circumstances, we conclude that it is virtually inconceivable that additional evidence as to Appellant’s family history of mental illness would have changed the jury’s verdict. Accordingly, there is no merit to Appellant's claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present such evidence.</p>
