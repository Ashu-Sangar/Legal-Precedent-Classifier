But, appellant argues, the amount of the fine here is unconstitutionally excessive. He asserted at his plea colloquy that at the time of his offense, he was thirty-six years old, had only an eighth-grade education, had lived in the same area for six years, had worked for the same employer for four years, had a wife and children, and, most importantly, had no prior criminal record. He claimed that he acquired the cocaine only because he “fell into a drug habit.” N.T., 9/11/08, at 2-6. Appellant adds that even though he pleaded guilty to PWID, there was no history or evidence that he was engaged in actual drug dealing. He suggests that absent any nexus between the offense and the fine amount, the fine was disproportionate and unconstitutionally excessive. To this end, he cites certain forfeiture cases, including <em>Commonwealth v. 5043 Anderson Road, Buckingham Township, Bucks County, </em><a href="/a2d/699/1337-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="699 A.2d 1337" data-case-ids="11913647" data-case-paths="/a2d/699/1337-01">699 A.2d 1337</a> (Pa.Crawlth.1997), <em>aff'd, </em><a href="/pa/556/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="556 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="607116" data-case-paths="/pa/556/0335-01">556 Pa. 335</a>, <a href="/a2d/728/0907-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="728 A.2d 907" data-case-ids="11626310,607116" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0907-01,/pa/556/0335-01">728 A.2d 907</a> (1999), for the proposition that forfeiture of a defendant’s property to satisfy mandatory minimum drug offense fines is <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>constitutional only to the extent that the amount to be forfeited is significantly and proportionally related to the underlying drug offense.

    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[263,493,1157,1195]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that, in the context of a constitutional excessive fine challenge, the dispositive inquiry is whether the fine is irrational and unreasonable, relying upon the Superior Court’s opinion in <em>Gipple, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="418 Pa.

Still following <em>Gipple, </em>the Commonwealth adds that fines serve the twin goals of punishment and deterrence, and in the drug trafficking context, fines are reasonably set at amounts tiered and keyed to the amount of drugs involved so as to discourage future continued violations. The Commonwealth also dismisses appellant’s reliance on the “nexus” approach used in forfeiture cases. The Commonwealth argues that the point of imposing forfeiture in the context of drug dealing is to confiscate funds, assets, or property that is acquired or retained through drug trafficking offenses that have already been committed. By contrast, the Commonwealth posits, mandatory fines based on possession of substantial amounts of illegal substances both punish past conduct and deter future conduct, which differs in fact and theory from forfeiture.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> As such, the Commonwealth concludes, the automatic mandatory minimum fines set forth in Section 7508 are neither irrational nor unreasonable, and they therefore do not violate the excessive fines prohibitions of either the Pennsylvania or the U.S. Constitution.</p>

Contrary to the Commonwealth’s argument, this is not unlike the goal of forfeiture. Presumably, the trial judge faced with imposing a fine under Section 7508 determines whether $25,000 is sufficient to exhaust assets and proceeds amassed by a defendant engaged in drug <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>trafficking. However, by its terms, the flexibility in the mandatory minimum fine scheme works only one way; the statute reposes no discretion in the judge to impose a lesser fine if the court determines that a lesser amount will sufficiently exhaust the defendant’s assets and proceeds in relation to the offense committed. Indeed, the statute requires no relationship between the fine and the assets and proceeds before the mandatory $25,000 fine is imposed: as to the statutory floor, one size fits all.</p>

Put simply, mandatory mínimums are automatic, indiscriminate, and blunt provisions that deny trial courts the ability to calibrate punishment to correspond to a defendant’s actual criminal conduct and circumstances. As one scholar, a former federal prosecutor during the crack epidemic of the 1980s, has observed, these types of sentencing provisions transform judges into “mere automatons” permitted only to mechanically impose standardized and arbitrary sentences without the authority to perform the difficult and nuanced job of determining “the punishment that best fits each particular crime and, even more importantly, each unique offender.” David M.

The $25,000 amount for all cases involving over 100 grams of cocaine is substantial (and was even more so when the legislation was enacted in 1988), and well beyond the means of many individuals. There is no argument forwarded that $25,000 represents some measured examination of the cost or value “on the street” of cocaine, either then or now. Presumably, the figure was borrowed from similar statutes <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>being enacted across the nation at the time, or perhaps it was just fixed arbitrarily by the legislative committee charged with drafting the legislation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> By notable contrast, Section 7508’s language provides a guiding principle for sentencing courts that determine to impose a fine in excess of the statutory mínimums; courts are to impose the applicable minimal statutory fine “or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity.” There is, then, a clearly worded indication that the General Assembly intended Section 7508 not just to punish and deter bluntly, but specifically to deplete convicted drug dealers of money acquired through their illegal drug trafficking activities, not unlike the goal of forfeiture discussed above. And Section 7508 is within the Crimes Code, so it must be read strictly in the defendant’s favor. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). In my view, the foregoing reading of Section 7508, based on the language of the criminal statute itself, belies the Commonwealth’s theory that fines and forfeiture are totally distinct creatures, having nothing in common, that cannot possibly be treated as analytically similar.</p>

Our 2003 decision in <em>5W* Spruce Street </em>addressed whether forfeiture of the defendant’s house in Philadelphia was excessive and grossly disproportionate to the underlying PWID offense. The narcotics in question had a value of under $100; none of the usual “trappings” of systematic drug dealing, such as scales or cutting agents, were found at the property; and the defendant testified that, she pleaded <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>guilty solely to protect her daughter, who was the actual drug dealer.

As such, we held, the proposed forfeiture must be remanded for a court to apply the <em>Bajakajian </em>factors comparing the potential forfeiture to the underlying offense: whether the defendant’s conduct was an isolated violation or “part of a pattern of misbehavior,” the actual or potential harm that could result from the underlying offense, and whether the forfeiture sought was the maximum allowable under the controlling statute.

Zemprelli of Allegheny County described "the tragedy of mandatory sentencing” in an instance where "it absolutely divested the court of an opportunity to deal with a situation that called for a little compassion, called for a little sympathy, called for a little understanding, and the court’s hands were tied because it could not do anything about it.” Pa. Senate Legislative Journal, 2/23/88, at 1783. In the House, Representative John Broujos of Cumberland County, stated: "We have had a system in Pennsylvania that has worked for decades — I would like to say centuries — and that is placing within the hands of a judge the question of sentencing. Only a judge first as elected and as qualified to make these decisions sees the presentence report, judges the case, may have heard the case, knows the district attorney, knows the parties, and makes a decision on sentencing. Gradually, with mandatory sentencing and the other abuses to the sentencing system, we have eroded the power of the judge to make those decisions.” Pa. House of Representatives Legislative Journal, 3/16/88, at 363.</p>

There may be a valid point that if the fines set were appropriate for the times in 1988, they may have by now become inappropriately lenient. But the arbitrary nature of the amount remains the constant.</p>
