      <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>Claimant appealed to the Commonwealth Court, a panel of which affirmed in an unpublished decision. The panel noted that it had recently decided <em>Fox v.

In <em>Fox, </em>an employee of the PECO Energy Company sustained an ankle injury in the course of his employment, and subsequently sued the City of Philadelphia for damages related thereto. The employee and City reached a settlement agreement for $150,000 that included an indemnification clause identical to the one presented in this case. When PECO attempted to subrogate against, or recover reimbursement from, the settlement, the employee averred that Section 23 barred the claim. The Commonwealth Court rejected the employee’s contention, noting that Section 319 provides for an absolute and automatic right to subrogation. <em><a href="/a2d/969/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="969 A.2d 11" data-case-ids="7252801" data-case-paths="/a2d/969/0011-01">Id.</a> </em>at 13 (citing <em>Thompson v.

With that background, the Commonwealth Court in <em>Fox </em>further expounded: “Because [PECO] is seeking subrogation from [the employee] for the $150,000 he received from the City, not from the City itself, Section 23 of Act 44 does not foreclose [PECO] from enforcing its Section 319 ... reimbursement rights.” <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>

According to Claimant, to interpret Section 23 as not allowing immunity in the factual circumstance presented in this case “renders Commonwealth entities immune from direct claims for subrogation ... while requiring them to factor the value of such claims into their settlements with tort claimants, [thus leading] to a manifestly absurd result which frustrates the purpose behind granting such immunity.” Brief of Claimant at 14. Put differently, Claimant contends that the purpose of Section 23 immunity, and, indeed, sovereign immunity in general, is negated if a governmental entity will have to include in a settlement agreement amounts equal to subrogation liens in recognition that an employer may merely wait for a claimant to receive funds from a governmental entity and then demand reimbursement for paid compensation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Bayada Nurses argues that, should we accept Claimant’s argument herein, all three of these purposes will be nullified: Claimant will receive a double recovery; Bayada Nurses will be forced to pay compensation for an injury that was not its fault; and SEPTA will escape liability. To that end, Bayada Nurses further contends that the entire settlement is an exercise in bad faith by SEPTA and Claimant to avoid application of the mandatory provisions of Section 319: “Respectfully, it is hopefully abundantly clear to this Court that whatever effort and subterfuge [Claimant and SEPTA undertook to artificially describe what was and what was not being paid with the $75,000.00 check is not binding on the employer, nor on this Honorable Court.” Brief of Bayada Nurses at 9.</p>

Bayada Nurses argues that Section 23 is not even implicated by this case because SEPTA is no longer involved in the litigation — it has paid its settlement monies — and the action for reimbursement is solely between Claimant and Bayada Nurses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> It somewhat incoherently concludes that Section 23 has a unitary application: if, for some reason, an employer cannot recover already paid sums from its injured employee, the employer cannot sue the government agency for that money.</p>

Relevant to this appeal, the General Assembly included within Act 44 two provisions concerning workers’ compensation subrogation: Section 23, the subject of this case, and Section 25(b), which reinstated the rights of all employers/insurers to seek workers’ compensation subrogation and reimbursement in cases involving the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> In other words, the legislature, with Section 25(b), reestablished the comprehensive right of the employer/compensation insurer to subrogation as part of an extensive legislative enactment designed to “reduce the cost of [workers’ compensation] in order to fix our economy and save jobs.” House of Representatives Journal, Mar. 30,1993, at 543 (comments of Rep. Gladeck). Indeed, as reflected in the debates on what was then Senate Bill No. 1 of 1993, the overriding purpose of Act 44 was to lessen the burden on private corporations in the face of the loss of approximately 140,000 jobs in the Commonwealth during the preceding years. <em>See <a href="/pa/491/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="491 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1765689" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0493-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/491/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="491 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1765689" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0493-01">at 541</a> (comments of Rep.

As noted, <em>supra </em>note 7, Bayada Nurses, in rejecting the viability of the settlement agreement, baldly contends that the agreement, which <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>expressly limited the settlement to non-workers’ compensation benefits and provided for indemnification of Claimant by SEPTA, was drafted and executed in bad faith and subterfuge by SEPTA and Claimant. We first note that there is no basis in the record for this unfounded allegation. Moreover, the workers' compensation judge accepted the terms of the agreement in his findings of fact, and we may not question those findings unless they are arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Lehigh County Vo-Tech Sch. v. WCAB (Wolfe), </em><a href="/pa/539/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="539 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="474182" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0322-01">539 Pa. 322</a>, <a href="/pa/539/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="652 A.2d 797" data-case-ids="474182,7873834" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0322-01,/a2d/652/0797-01">652 A.2d 797</a>, 800 (1995).</p>
      <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.2",661,[198,1863,1121,506]]]'>That said, the Idaho Supreme Court has recently questioned the vitality of "any characterization of damages [in a settlement agreement] to which the employer is not priv[ied]____” <em>Struhs v. Prot. Techs., Inc., </em><a href="/idaho/133/0715-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="133 Idaho 715" data-case-ids="882633" data-case-paths="/idaho/133/0715-01">133 Idaho 715</a>, <a href="/idaho/133/0715-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="133 Idaho 715" data-case-ids="882633" data-case-paths="/idaho/133/0715-01">992 P.2d 164</a>, 170 (1999). While we again stress that there is no basis in fact of record for the accusation that SEPTA and Claimant acted with unclean hands, we generally agree with the sentiments of the Idaho court and would suggest that, moving forward, if the Commonwealth, its agencies, or political subdivisions wish to construct settlement agreements like that presented instantly, all interested parties, including the employer or its workers' compensation carrier, should be party to the settlement discussions. Incorporating all around the proverbial conference table would help ensure that the dual goals of preventing double recovery and protecting the public fisc are met.</p>

This final point is not absolute, as courts have previously found that the labeling of damages as non-workers’ compensation monies, <em>i.e., </em>pain and suffering, will not operate to frustrate an employer’s subrogation rights. <em>See Bumbarger v. Bumbarger, </em><a href="/pa-super/190/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="190 Pa. Super. 571" data-case-ids="745757" data-case-paths="/pa-super/190/0571-01">190 Pa.Super. 571</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20216" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="155 A.2d 216">155 A.2d 216</a> (1959); <em>but see supra </em>note 11. Nevertheless, the point remains: settlements like those presented here easily operate to serve the goals of both workers' compensation and sovereign immunity, and are completely consistent and in accord with Section 23 of Act 44.</p>

We note in this regard that there is no reason to believe that the Commonwealth would pay a penny more than necessary to resolve a claim. Thus, it is the governmental entity, which will protect the public fisc in this regard by refusing to pay a claimant benefits already recouped through the workers’ compensation system.</p>
