The Board recommended that Respondent Anthony C.

After the receipt of the Board’s recommendation, this Court issued a rule to show cause why Respondent should not be disbarred from the practice of law. Respondent filed a response to the rule, requesting oral argument under Pa.R.D.E. 208(e)(3) (giving an attorney the “absolute right” to oral argument upon request when this Court issues a rule to show cause). This Court heard oral argument on May 8, 2012. For the reasons stated herein, we now enter an order disbarring Respondent from the practice of law, retroactive to July 30, 2009.</p>

At these concerts Respondent purchased and supplied alcoholic beverages to three minors and also smoked marijuana with them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> During this same period Respondent also attended football games, played pool and went to restaurants accompanied by members of the youth group.

During this time Respondent told victim # 1 not to reveal the relationship to anyone due to the victim’s age and Respondent’s marriage. The relationship was consensual and the victim was over the legal age of consent relating to sexual offenses as defined by 18 Pa.C.S. § 3101, <em>et seq.

The ODC then filed a Petition for Discipline, charging Respondent with professional misconduct arising from his criminal convictions. A disciplinary hearing was held before a Hearing Committee appointed by the Board on December 11, 2009. During those hearings, the ODC presented evidence of Respondent’s conviction as well as the fact that his criminal conduct was publicized to the community on electronic media and in newspaper articles.</p>

Mr. Dickson treated Respondent following his arrest and until his incarceration. Sessions resumed by telephone following Respondent’s release from prison and Respondent resumed in-person sessions after he was released from house arrest. Mr. Dickson stated that Respondent’s risk of recidivism was low and expressed the opinion that Respondent does not suffer from a psychological or personality disorder or any sexual deviance. He further opined that Respondent’s criminal conduct was due, in part, to his sexual identity problems; however, he acknowledged that Respondent had the ability to choose right <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>from wrong and noted that homosexuality is not a psychological disorder.</p>

Mr. McElroy also opined that Respondent had a reputation in the community as a truthful and honest person. John Benson, Esquire, also testified on Respondent’s behalf. Mr. Benson had previously worked with Respondent at the District Attorney’s office and described Respondent’s trial skills as excellent. Mr. Benson further opined that Respondent had an excellent reputation in the community as peaceful, law-abiding, truthful and honest.

The four aggravating circumstances noted were that Respondent held a public office at the time of the misconduct, the public notoriety surrounding the misconduct, his inappropriate post-crime conduct, and the nature and duration of the crime. The eight mitigating circumstances considered were Respondent’s lack of disciplinary history, his positive academic history, the positive character witnesses, his cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, his remorse for the misconduct, his continued psychological treatment, the payment of complete restitution, <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>and the low risk of recidivism. The Hearing Committee also noted that Respondent’s expert testimony did not meet the standard for mitigating evidence under <em>ODC v. Braun, </em><a href="/pa/520/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="520 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1815597" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0157-01">520 Pa. 157</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="520 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1815597" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0157-01">553 A.2d 894</a> (1989). In <em>Braun, </em>this Court held that a psychological disorder will be considered a mitigating factor where it caused the misconduct. In this case, the Hearing Committee concluded that Respondent could not meet the <em>Braun </em>standard because of the lack of a specific psychological disorder diagnosis. The Hearing Committee recommended disbarment due to the fact that Respondent would be under sentence for longer than the five-year maximum suspension. “It would be both inappropriate and in contravention of past disciplinary proceedings to allow Respondent to practice before the courts of Pennsylvania while he remains under sentence.” Report and Recommendations of the Hearing Committee, filed 9/2/2010, at 16.</p>

    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[281,447,1152,944]]]'>In this case, none of these standards are at issue. The ODC and Respondent entered into a Joint Stipulation of Facts, the lower tribunals credited Respondent’s testimony and that of his character witnesses, and Respondent is not contesting the lower tribunals’ determination that he failed to present expert testimony meeting the <em>Braun </em>standard. Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement provide that “a certificate of conviction of an attorney for a crime shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against the attorney based upon the conviction.” Pa.R.D.E. 214(e). Given that the instant disciplinary proceedings arose as a direct result of Respondent’s convictions, the ODC has met its burden of establishing that Respondent violated Pa.R.P.C. 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for counsel to commit criminal act) and Pa.R.D.E. 208(b)(1) (conviction of crime shall be grounds for discipline). Thus, the only question before this Court is the extent of final discipline to be imposed.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[279,1415,1152,951]]]'>The ODC argues that Respondent should be disbarred. According to the ODC, Respondent’s misconduct was aggravated by the positions of trust he held. First, as Chief Deputy District Attorney of Bucks County, Respondent held a position of leadership, authority and power. Respondent betrayed the faith and trust of the public when he violated the very laws he personally prosecuted and he engaged in ongoing criminal activity that extended over a period of a year and a half. Second, Respondent was a church youth group leader, who was charged with supervising the welfare of the minor victims he ultimately exploited. The ODC points out that Respondent accompanied the youths to rock concerts and abdicated his responsibilities as a chaperone by “partying” with his juvenile charges. He also knowingly participated in schemes to obtain marijuana and then smoked the marijuana with them. The ODC avers that Respondent’s illicit sexual affair with a sixteen-year-old boy should likewise be considered, including that he had another encounter with the minor following his arrest.</p>
    <p id="b505-3" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[175,325,1153,1224]]]'>
      <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>The ODC further argues that the Hearing Committee properly took into account the length of Respondent’s criminal sentence in determining the appropriate disciplinary sanction, since a five-year suspension would permit Respondent to be reinstated before his period of probation expires. Furthermore, the ODC contends that the length of sentence was only one of many legitimate aggravating factors considered by the Hearing Committee in recommending disbarment. The ODC avers that a review of precedent demonstrates that disbarment is fitting in this case. As an example in contrast, the ODC cites <em>ODC v. Christie, supra. </em>In that case, a five-year suspension was imposed; however, the ODC notes that <em>Christie </em>involved only misdemeanor charges, attorney Christie presented <em>Braun </em>evidence, and he was not a prosecutor at the time of the misconduct. The ODC cites as an analogous case of disbarment <em>ODC v. Pazuhanich, </em>No. 15 DB 2005. In that case, disbarment followed after a two-term District Attorney of Monroe County, recently elected to the trial bench, was arrested because he was observed fondling a ten-year old girl at a rock concert. The attorney pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to indecent assault, endangering the welfare of children, corruption of minors and public drunkenness, and was sentenced to ten years’ probation.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[173,1575,1151,789]]]'>Respondent contends that a five-year suspension is appropriate given his expressions of remorse, his rehabilitation since the misconduct, which included intensive psychological treatment, his otherwise excellent reputation, and the non-punitive nature of the attorney disciplinary system. Respondent points out that he has engaged in a serious and concentrated effort through therapy to understand why he committed the misconduct. Mr. Dickson offered that Respondent had suppressed his homosexuality for many years by marrying and having two children. In Dickson’s view, victim # 1 broke down Respondent’s defenses and due to Respondent’s repression of his sexual identity, he had the maturity of a 14- or 15-year-old when he acted sexually. Respondent also points to his excellent academic record and his success as a prosecutor before his criminal conduct was uncovered.</p>
    <p id="b506-3" data-blocks='[["BL_506.3",506,[257,325,1153,583]]]'>
      <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>Respondent next argues that the Hearing Committee was under the mistaken belief that a lawyer could not be reinstated while he or she was still on probation or parole. He provides many examples of attorneys who were permitted to practice law while under a criminal sentence, and points out that first-time DUI<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> offenders routinely receive a private reprimand or public censure even though they may be under a criminal sentence. According to Respondent, the Hearing Committee erred in assuming an iron-clad rule that a lawyer’s discipline must coincide with the length of any criminal probationary term.</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[258,933,1155,632]]]'>Respondent further avers that the fact that he held positions of trust should not elevate the discipline in this case to disbarment, because almost every type of attorney misconduct involves some type of breach of trust. “The fact that one is a public official such as an Assistant District Attorney ... doesn’t lessen [sic] the trust violation. There should not be a distinction that breach of trust of a public official is more serious than a breach of trust as a private lawyer to their [sic] client.” Brief of Respondent at 38. Instead, Respondent urges this Court to consider the many mitigating circumstances in his favor as well as his psychological evidence notwithstanding that it did not rise to the level of <em>Braun </em>mitigation.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[259,1592,1155,421]]]'>Finally, Respondent cites to decisional law in support of his position, including the <em>Christie </em>case, offering that a five-year suspension is warranted. He distinguishes his circumstances from those in <em>Pazuhanich </em>on the grounds that attorney Pazuhanich never admitted to the misconduct, did not express remorse for the crimes, and failed to acknowledge any harm done to the public perception of the judicial system. Thus, Respondent concludes that disbarment is unwarranted here.</p>

Disbarment is an extreme sanction and it is properly reserved for the most egregious matters, because it <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>represents a termination of the privilege to practice law without any promise of ultimate reinstatement. <em>ODC v.

Attorney Joshua Eilberg was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1966. While serving in Congress, Eilberg maintained a law practice with three other partners. The law firm received a check from Hahnemann Hospital for obtaining a federal grant for the construction of an addition to the existing hospital. Attorney Eilberg received some portion of this money, notwithstanding that he was prohibited by law from doing so because of his public position.

On the other hand, there have been disciplinary resolutions involving attorneys holding public offices who have committed crimes unrelated to their office, and this Court has approved recommendations by the Board, deeming such circumstances as aggravating the misconduct. <em>See, e.g., ODC v. Joyce, </em>No. 47 DB 2009 (Judge of Superior Court of Pennsylvania disbarred following convictions in U.S. District Court for two counts of mail fraud and six counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity); <em>ODC v.

This aggravation arising from public status is strong where the public position is that of <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>prosecutor and the misconduct involves criminal actions, and it is particularly strong where, as here, the conduct involved crimes against individuals (minors, in this case). We realize that many attorneys hold positions of trust with respect to individual clients. But, that trust is not the same as the broader public trust reposed in judges, prosecutors and the like. Indeed, the facts of this case bear out the consequences that may arise when a position of public trust is involved. The evidence reveals that Respondent gained access to his minor victims — access that allowed him to ply them with drugs and alcohol, and that led to his sexual encounters with victim # 1— because of his respected and trusted position as a Deputy District Attorney (as well as his position as a church youth group leader).</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[268,1087,1156,1161]]]'>Turning to the ultimate question to be resolved — the determination of final discipline — we find that disbarment is appropriate. As is often the case with attorney disciplinary matters, there is no case precedent that is precisely on all fours, but disbarment fits into the range of discipline in prior cases, and accounts for the aggravating circumstances of this case. The base criminal conduct in this case is similar to that in <em>Christie. </em>Attorney Christie pled guilty to thirteen misdemeanor sex offenses involving two minors. The crimes occurred during a ten-day period when he invited two male minors, ages 12 and 14, into his apartment. He provided the minors with alcoholic beverages, showed X-rated video tapes, and masturbated in their presence. Christie, <a href="/pa/536/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="639 A.2d 782" data-case-ids="1843158,7863646" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0394-01,/a2d/639/0782-01">639 A.2d at 784</a>. Attorney Christie presented expert testimony that the crimes resulted from a psychiatric condition. As noted, this Court suspended Christie for a period of five years, explaining that the final discipline accounted for the fact that his criminal conduct was caused by his psychiatric condition under <em>Braun. </em>It also reflected the lack of any prior disciplinary history or criminal record, the low risk of recidivism, and the cooperation, remorse, and reformative efforts demonstrated by attorney Christie. <em><a href="/pa/536/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="639 A.2d 782" data-case-ids="1843158,7863646" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0394-01,/a2d/639/0782-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/536/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="639 A.2d 782" data-case-ids="1843158,7863646" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0394-01,/a2d/639/0782-01">at 786</a>.</p>

However, there are two critical distinctions supporting disbarment. First, Respondent did not present expert testimony meeting the <em>Braun </em>standard, and therefore, is not entitled to the type of consideration that was given to attorney Christie; given that Christie received the most severe sanction short of disbarment, the distinction is significant. Second, as discussed, Respondent’s position as a Chief Deputy District Attorney aggravates the misconduct, particularly in light of the facts here. At the time Respondent was engaging in his ongoing criminal conduct by endangering the welfare of minors and corrupting the morals, his public persona was that of a law enforcement figure in the county, prosecuting members of the public for similar crimes. In our view, any sanction short of disbarment in these circumstances threatens the integrity of the legal system, undermines our very serious duty to protect the public, and fails to give appropriate weight to Respondent’s status as a public official. Accordingly, given these two distinctions, which indicate that a more severe sanction than that imposed in <em>Christie </em>is warranted in this case, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</p>

Although the facts Respondent cites makes his conduct look less troublesome than the conduct in <em>Pazuhanich, </em>it is also true that attorney Pazuhanich’s crime apparently was an isolated one-time incident, whereas here, Respondent’s criminal conduct occurred over an extended period of time and involved three minor victims. Thus, while both matters involved criminal conduct by public prosecutors, which resulted in convictions for child endangerment and corruption of minors, the similarities end there and the distinctions are dispositive. We reiterate that each matter must be examined individually based on the totality of facts <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>surrounding the convictions. There obviously are circumstances of disbarment which involve misconduct worse than that committed by Respondent, or by attorney Pazuhanich; the question is not simply whether the conduct at issue is as troublesome as that in other disbarment cases, but whether it is troublesome enough, -viewed in its own totality, that disbarment is the appropriate sanction, and is not a disproportionate punishment. <em>See, e.g., Czmus, </em><a href="/pa/586/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="889 A.2d 1197" data-case-ids="5652153,8998164" data-case-paths="/pa/586/0022-01,/a2d/889/1197-01">889 A.2d at 1208-04</a> (“[S]ome conduct is simply too egregious and requires disbarment to protect the integrity of the profession and judicial tribunals.”).
