On July 13, 2007, the Commonwealth withdrew the PWID-PCP charge.

The court did not agree with the Commonwealth, but rather accepted Appellees’ contention that Rule 1013(A)(4) controlled the time frame under which the Commonwealth was required to bring Appellees to trial in the Court of Common Pleas under the circumstances of this case.
