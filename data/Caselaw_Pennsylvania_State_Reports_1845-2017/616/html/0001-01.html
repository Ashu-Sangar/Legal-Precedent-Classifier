In particular, Appellant claims that counsel failed to elicit evidence pertaining to Liverman’s history of drug use and criminal behavior. This assertion is belied by the record.

Defense counsel also elicited testimony regarding Liverman’s activities as a drug dealer and his drug use on the night in question, including the large quantity of cocaine he consumed. <em>Id. </em>at 142-50,159.

Appellant conveniently omits that immediately after claiming he remembered nothing about the murder, Liverman stated, “Wait a minute let me tell you the truth about this.” <em>Id. </em>Liverman then proceeded to recount the events surrounding the shooting and also told police about the murder of Anthony D’Amore, another of Appellant’s victims, discussed <em>infra. </em>If counsel had questioned Liverman about the initial comment, the Commonwealth could have rehabilitated him with the remainder of his statement. Consequently, we will not find counsel ineffective for failing to introduce this statement, as counsel’s strategy had a reasonable basis designed to effectuate Appellant’s interests.</p>

We find these contentions to be completely devoid of merit. Defense counsel’s first question to Henderson concerned his arrest record, which elicited testimony that Henderson had been arrested “at least fifteen times” for numerous robberies and burglaries. N.T., 3/12/85, at 36. Counsel’s cross-examination also exposed Henderson’s drug use, his failure to report the murder, and numerous inconsistencies in his testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 37-90.
