They sued Sears, alleging that Sears had violated the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act, 43 P.S. § 333.101 <em>et seq. </em>(“PMWA”), by not paying them for time during which they had to perform work at home, and for time spent attending to Sears matters while traveling in their Sears vans from their homes to customers’ homes and back. In ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Sears and against Appellants on Appellants’ claim for violation of the PMWA, concluding that Appellants’ travel time amounted merely to commuting time, which is non-compensable, and that the work they did at home was <em>de minimis. Caiarelli v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>No. GD 03-1735, slip op. (C.P. Allegheny Cty. Jan. 15, 2009) (“Trial Court Opinion”). The trial court also noted that the program allowing service repair technicians to operate from home instead of from a Sears location was optional. In making its rulings, the trial court relied on what it viewed as comparable federal law under the Fair Labor Standards Act, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 201">29 U.S.C. § 201</a> <em>et seq. </em>(“FLSA”).</p>

In response to Appellants’ argument that their <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>“commuting” time was in reality “time spent traveling as part of the duties of the employee” under 34 Pa.Code § 231.1(b), the court stated that “[Appellants] ignore the qualifying phrase in the definition which limits the time spent traveling by the employee as part of his duties to time spent traveling ‘during normal working hours.’ ” <em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 201">Id.</a></em>

Moreover, the trial court noted that, under a federal implementing regulation, ordinary “home to work” travel is a normal incident of employment such that commuting to and from work is not work time, regardless of whether an employee works at a fixed location or at different job sites. <a href="/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.35" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="29 C.F.R. § 785.35">29 C.F.R. § 785.35</a>. Thus, the court concluded, “it is clear that the service technicians’ principal activity is servicing and repairing Sears[ ] appliances and that the work place is located in the various customers’ homes.” Trial Court Opinion at 7. Accordingly, the court determined that the work activities for which Petitioners alleged they were entitled to be compensated were merely incidental to their use of the Sears vehicles to commute, and thus not compensable. <em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.35" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="29 C.F.R. § 785.35">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.35" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="29 C.F.R. § 785.35">at 5</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

      <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>The Superior Court affirmed, largely on the basis of the trial court opinion. <em>Caiarelli v.

Sept. 21, 2009) <em>(“Caiarelli”). </em>It seems, however, that the Superior Court understood that the correctness of the trial court’s opinion, insofar as it was based on applying the FLSA instead of the PMWA, was questionable. The Superior Court thus supplemented the trial court’s determination as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[183,767,1114,303]]]'>In addition, it is clear that under <em>any </em>law, there is no need to compensate a worker for his or her time commuting to work.

    <blockquote id="b99-6" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[183,1095,1113,299]]]'>Here, although there were limitations on what could be done while in the Sears van on the way to work, that does not mean the technicians were “on the job” during the commute.

In today’s world, receiving an assignment by Internet on a company-supplied computer is no more onerous than receiving the <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>assignment by telephone. Any intrusion on private time is minimal, even if it takes a few minutes to boot the computer while the technician does other personal things.

    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[273,771,1151,1426]]]'>I believe it is clear that the Superior Court erred in affirming the trial court. First, it mischaracterized the issue raised by Appellants as whether employees must be compensated for “commuting to work.” This is not what Appellants alleged in their complaint. They did not allege that they were entitled to be paid for merely commuting. Rather, they alleged that while they were driving to their first appointments of the day, they were required to perform certain work which constituted “hours worked” under the PMWA for which they were entitled to be paid. They asserted that their activities while driving were restricted to Sears business and included dealing with the handheld computer and scheduling appointments. Second, the court viewed the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, precisely the opposite of what the law requires. Those facts were hotly contested in the record. The deposition testimony conflicts regarding the necessity of performing the work at issue when the technicians perform it, and the extensiveness of such work. The Superior Court, without reference to any controlling law, simply concluded, arbitrarily, that the tasks for which Appellants seek compensation for hours worked are “minor,” “minimal,” and not “onerous,” and that “Sears was careful to make sure that any such tasks ... were done during working hours.” <em>Caiarelli, </em>slip op. at 6. These conclusions completely ignore conflicting evidence in the record on these very points, and improperly view the evidence in the light most favorable to Sears, the movant, on its motion for summary judgment.</p>

On the record here, it is clear to me that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the work activities for which Appellants sought compensation constituted “hours worked” under the PMWA.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[125,877,1153,846]]]'>The lower courts noted that the HDP program is optional and that employees need not participate in it. On the surface, this fact may seem to detract from Appellants’ contention that they are essentially forced to work uncompensated hours. However, the optional nature of the arrangement should not be treated as removing Appellants from the protection of the PMWA if, in fact, the work for which they seek to be compensated falls within the terms of the PMWA and its regulations. Even though there are some conveniences to employees who participate in the program, common sense suggests that Sears established the “optional” HDP program to benefit its business operations, and, accordingly, that Sears encourages technicians to participate in the program. Indeed, if all technicians opted out there would be no program, and Sears would lose whatever competitive advantage it believes the program provides.</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[124,1747,1153,633]],["BL_102.1",102,[280,330,1155,887]]]'>Viewing the evidence of record in the light most favorable to Appellants as the non-moving parties, and resolving doubts in their favor, it is clear that service repair technicians’ homes are used as shipping points for parts, which the technicians then have to load into their vans and sort; further, they have to deal with computer issues on an ongoing basis at home. According to Appellants, this arrangement requires them to do work at home and while traveling. Although Sears instructs its supervisors to tell the technicians to work only during the “standard” hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. (the hours during which the technicians are required to be making visits to customer homes), Appellants dispute that it is even <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>possible to carry out the disputed work within this time frame. They argue further that Sears is well aware of this, such that the supervisors’ incantation of “standard hours” is just that, an incantation, and belies the actual practice. Thus, under the HDP arrangement, Sears uses technicians’ homes as delivery sites for Sears’s business, and the technicians are placed in a position where it is rational and beneficial to Sears for the technicians to perform some work at home and while traveling. Sears’s “defense” — that it tells its supervisors to nonetheless inform the technicians: “don’t do any work outside the ‘official’ work day of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. because you won’t get paid for it” — seems, when the evidence is viewed favorably to Appellants, to be a smokescreen that is contradicted by Appellants’ evidence regarding their working hours. Nothing under the PMWA indicates that “normal working hours,” an undefined term, is not flexible enough to encompass the hours that employees actually and reasonably work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

Nor has the General Assembly adopted any similar amendments. Neither is there an established <em>“de minimis </em>” rule under the PMWA. There is no indication that Pennsylvania law on the critical issues in this appeal parallels federal law. Indeed, in <em>Bayada Nurses, Inc. v. Pa.

The court held that the technicians were on duty while traveling because their use of the company trucks was limited to company business, their receipt of assignments at home via handheld computers set them apart from regular commuters, and the truck constituted a “prescribed work place”. <em>Stevens, supra </em>at 476-77.</p>

This was improper under our law. Appellants were not required to prove their case in opposing Sears’s motion for summary judgment, only to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.

Inexplicably, the trial court addressed only Appellants’ claim respecting their driving time ("commuting time,” in the trial court’s view). It did not address their claim regarding work performed at home. In support of its resort to federal law, the trial court cited <em>Commonwealth v. Stuber, <a href="/a2d/822/0870-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="822 A.2d 870" data-case-ids="9132923" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0870-01">822 </a></em><a href="/a2d/822/0870-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="822 A.2d 870" data-case-ids="9132923" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0870-01">A.2d 870</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2003), <em>aff'd </em><a href="/pa/580/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="580 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1100663" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0066-01">580 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="859 A.2d 1253" data-case-ids="1100663,1100726,9166627,9166691" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0066-01,/pa/580/0065-01,/a2d/859/1253-01,/a2d/859/1253-02">859 A.2d 1253</a> (2004) (affirming on the basis of the Commonwealth Court's opinion). In the opinion we thereby adopted, the Commonwealth Court stated that the PMWA "mirrors” the FLSA, and indicated that when interpreting the PMWA, a state court could defer to a federal <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>court’s interpretation of the FLSA when the state statute substantially parallels the federal statute. <em>Id. </em>at 873. The issue in <em>Stuber </em>was whether the appellant was an employee or an independent contractor. The Commonwealth Court noted that both acts contained virtually identical definitions of the terms “employ,” "employer,” and "employee,” and that neither act contained any language discussing any distinction between an employee and an independent contractor. <em>Id. </em>Under the circumstances, because the two statutes substantially paralleled one another on the issue under consideration, the court stated that it was appropriate to give deference to a federal court’s interpretation of the federal statute. In the instant case, by contrast, the state and federal statutes do not mirror or parallel one another with respect to the PMWA provisions at issue.</p>

In applying the provisions of the PMWA, it should be borne in mind that the PMWA is remedial legislation which should be interpreted liberally to achieve its remedial purpose. Cf. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(c) (“All other provisions of a statute shall be liberally construed to effect their objects and to promote justice.”).</p>
