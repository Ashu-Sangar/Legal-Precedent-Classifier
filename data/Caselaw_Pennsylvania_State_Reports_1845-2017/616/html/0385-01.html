One set of snow tubing slopes grants snow tubers relatively uncontrolled access down the mountain and deposits them in a common receiving area. Alternatively, customers can enjoy two snow tubing slopes identified as “family” tubing slopes. These family tubing slopes are separated from the other snow tubing slopes, and the flow of snow tubers is controlled by a Camelback employee, who discharges them from the summit once the previous snow tubers have cleared the receiving area at the bottom. The receiving area for the family tubing slopes is segregated from the common receiving area connected to the other slopes.</p>

Once she reached the receiving area at the bottom of the slope, however, Tayar exited her snow tube and was immediately struck by another snow tuber coming down the family tubing slope. Camelback employees rushed to assist Tayar out of the receiving area, when yet another snow tuber narrowly missed striking her. At this point, several Camelback employees were yelling and gesturing up the mountain to Monaghan to stop sending snow tubers down the slope until they could safely remove Tayar from the receiving area. As a result of the collision, Tayar suffered multiple comminuted fractures of her right leg, for which she underwent surgery and required two metal plates and 14 screws to stabilize her ankle.</p>

Appellants filed an answer and new matter, and thereafter moved for summary judgment, asserting Tayar’s claims against Camelback and Monaghan were barred by the Release. On March 31, 2006, the trial court granted Appellants’ motion, reasoning the Release covered Camelback and thereby released it from any liability associated with Tayar’s injuries. Additionally, the court determined that it did not need to address whether the Release encompassed Monaghan in his personal capacity because, in any event, the release printed on the lift ticket <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>relieved Monaghan of liability. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Further, while the court concluded the evidence demonstrated Monaghan acted negligently by sending snow tubers down the mountain too early, it did not suggest he acted recklessly or with gross negligence. Thus, the trial court determined the Release and lift ticket relieved Appellants of liability and compelled entry of summary judgment in their favor. Tayar appealed to the Superior Court.</p>

As the Release did not mention employees, but only Camelback, the majority reasoned that reading the Release to encompass Monaghan in his personal capacity would require inserting language into the Release. The majority also determined that the Release encompassed only negligent conduct because its language was not specific enough to release acts of greater culpability: the Release “had to explicitly state that the releasor was waiving claims based upon allegations of recklessness and intentional conduct” in order for such conduct to be validly released. <em><a href="/pa/598/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="957 A.2d 281" data-case-ids="3989431,8206248" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0387-01,/a2d/957/0281-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/598/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="957 A.2d 281" data-case-ids="3989431,8206248" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0387-01,/a2d/957/0281-01">at 292</a>. Thus, the majority determined the Release was valid only with respect to Camelback, and relieved Camelback from liability for only negligent conduct. As the majority further found there existed a material question concerning whether Monaghan acted recklessly or negligently, the majority concluded the trial court erred by entering summary judgment in favor of Appellants, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>

    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[181,451,1152,893]]]'>Appellants first argue the Superior Court erred by concluding that Monaghan was not covered by the Release. Appellants note that it is well accepted that a corporation may not act but through its employees, and claim the intent of the Release, therefore, was to release both Camelback and its employees, specifically Monaghan. Appellants allege the final phrase of the Release supports this conclusion, as it states that Tayar was releasing claims for injuries caused by negligence or other improper conduct “on the part of the snowtubing facility.” Appellants aver that, because Camelback could not act but through its employees, a common sense reading of this statement serves to release employees acting in the course of their employment as well as Camelback itself. Lastly, Appellants note that Monaghan was, in fact, acting within the scope of his employment at the time of Tayar’s injury, and, therefore, is indemnified by, and considered the same party as, Camelback for purposes of this suit.</p>

Tayar notes the Release refers only to “Camelback Ski Corporation,” and never mentions employees. She alleges the Release did not describe, or even mention, injuries resulting from acts an employee could commit, contending the Release mentioned only risks inherent to the sport of snow tubing, or dangerous conditions which naturally exist on a snow tubing slope, the minimization and control of which is the responsibility of the property owner, <em>ie., </em>Camelback. For example, Tayar submits a skier injured by a negligently placed fence or barrier would be subject to the Release, because the placement of fences and barriers is controlled by Camelback itself, not its employees. Tayar argues that the Release’s failure to mention employees corresponds to its description of dangers and injuries, as those descriptions referred to situations for which Camelback as the property owner was solely responsible. Further, Tayar contends, because the Release only described naturally occurring dangers and risks, the public was not put on notice that it was releasing Camelback’s employees from overt, reckless conduct. <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>For instance, Tayar argues the Release’s reference to the “risk of collisions” pertained to the common receiving area, which was unregulated by Camelback employees, and did not notify the public of a risk of collision due to a Camelback employee sending a snow tuber down the slope too early. She observes that, prior to this matter, Camelback used a different version of the Release, which did specifically mention employees. Yet, Camelback elected to remove all references to employees in the version of the Release at issue here. As such, Tayar claims Camelback made a deliberate decision to remove its employees from the protection of the Release. Additionally, Tayar contends the Release failed to inform the public with the greatest particularity that acts of employees were covered by the Release, asserting this Court would have to read the term “employee” into the Release in order to conclude it bars suits against Camelback employees.</p>

Here, Tayar does not point to any such express indication that employees are removed from the protection of the Release. Rather, by referring to “Camelback Ski Corporation” and “the snow tubing facility,” we conclude the Release expressed with sufficient particularity that it covered the acts of Camelback employees, as Camelback could not act, negligently, improperly, or otherwise, other than through its agents and employees.

Appellants submit the instant matter does not involve any of these scenarios, but, rather, concerns a private agreement between individuals relating to their private affairs. Appellants note that, in <em>Chepkevich v. Hidden Valley Resort, L.P., </em><a href="/pa/607/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="607 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="4198976" data-case-paths="/pa/607/0001-01">607 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/607/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="2 A.3d 1174" data-case-ids="4198976,7290550" data-case-paths="/pa/607/0001-01,/a3d/2/1174-01">2 A.3d 1174</a> (2010), we stated that recreational sporting activities may be viewed differently in the context of exculpatory agreements, as each party is free to participate, or not, in the activity, and, therefore, is free to sign, or not, the release form.

On the contrary, Appellants claim the Release contained language sufficient to encompass reckless behavior, as it purported to release Appellants from “negligence or other improper conduct.” Appellants contend the instant language is nearly indistinguishable from that involved in <em>Valeo, </em>where the Superior Court determined the release prevented a suit based on gross negligence. Additionally, citing <em>Chepkevich </em>and <em>Zimmer v. Mitchell and Ness, </em><a href="/pa-super/253/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="253 Pa.

Therefore, they contend similar language should also encompass recklessness, as, Appellants argue, it would be clear to a reasonable person that such conduct was being released by that language. In the same vein, Appellants assert the phrase “negligence or other improper conduct” encompasses recklessness by reference to “other improper conduct.” Indeed, Appellants query what the phrase “other improper conduct” refers to, if not recklessness. Moreover, Appellants note the Release informed Tayar that snow tubes end up in a common runout area at various times and speeds, and that it was her responsibility to avoid collision. Appellants contend, therefore, that Tayar was specifically informed of the risk of suffering her type of injury, and was notified she would not be able to sue Appellants for negligence or other improper conduct, including recklessness.</p>

Furthermore, Tayar submits both federal courts and courts from other states have determined that exculpatory clauses will not insulate defendants from grossly negligent or reckless behavior, and she contends that these courts agree on this point because to permit such releases would remove any incentive for defendants to adhere to even a minimal standard of care. Specifically, Tayar cites <em>Hanks v. Powder Ridge Rest. Corp., </em><a href="/conn/276/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="276 Conn. 314" data-case-ids="3991153" data-case-paths="/conn/276/0314-01">276 Conn. 314</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=885%20A.2d%20734" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="885 A.2d 734">885 A.2d 734</a> (2005), wherein the Connecticut Supreme Court refused to enforce a release purporting to reheve a snow tubing facility of recklessness, reasoning that, otherwise, “recreational opera<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>tors would lack the incentive to exercise even slight care, with the public bearing the costs of the resulting injuries.” Brief of Appellee at 20. As further support, Tayar notes Section 195(1) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts states that releases for intentional or reckless conduct are unenforceable as a matter of public policy. In fact, Tayar notes, Appellants were unable to cite to a single decision that upheld a preinjury release for recklessness. In that regard, Tayar distinguishes the caselaw relied upon by Appellants by noting that those cases, save for <em>Valeo, </em>involved releases of negligent behavior and are thus inapposite. Further, even though the <em>Valeo </em>court upheld the release as it applied to claims of gross negligence, Tayar observes that the focus of that decision was whether the language of the release was specific enough to release gross negligence, and did not address the public policy concerns of doing so.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[269,1201,1154,566]]]'>Next, Tayar contends that, even if it is not against public policy to release recklessness, the language of the Release was not specific enough to relieve Appellants from liability for her injury. Tayar argues the standard set forth in <em>Topp Copy, </em>quoted above, governs the enforceability of exculpatory provisions. Largely echoing her argument concerning whether Monaghan was encompassed by the Release, Tayar submits the Release fails to meet the <em>Topp Copy </em>standard because it did not describe, with the greatest particularity, that she was releasing Camelback’s employees for any actions, let alone reckless behavior.</p>

There, a skier was injured when the bindings on his rented skis did not disengage after he crashed coming down the mountain. The release signed by the skier before renting the skis specifically indicated that the bindings on the skis would not release in all situations and were not a guarantee of safety. The court found the release barred the claim against the ski resort because the release specifically described the type of injury suffered by the skier. Tayar argues that, while the release operated to bar the claim against the ski resort in <em>Zimmer, </em>here, the Release did not mention the specific harm <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>and risk at issue, namely, that snow tubers would be sent down the family tubing slope too early and cause a collision. In essence, Tayar argues that the release in <em>Zimmer </em>satisfied the <em>Topp Copy </em>standard because its language was particular, whereas, here, the language of the Release is too broad and fails to describe the risks with the greatest particularity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[161,668,1155,907]]]'>Turning to our analysis, we note that, although exculpatory provisions are generally disfavored, such provisions are enforceable where three conditions are met. First, the clause must not contravene public policy. Second, the contract must be between persons concerning their private affairs. Third, each party must be a free bargaining agent so the contract is not one of adhesion. <em>Employers Liab. Assur. Corp. v. Greenville Business Men’s Ass’n, </em><a href="/pa/423/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="423 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1903106" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0288-01">423 Pa. 288</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=224%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="224 A.2d 620">224 A.2d 620</a> (1966). Our instant focus is on the first of these three conditions: whether the Release contravenes public policy. In that regard, we note that avoidance of contract terms on public policy grounds requires a showing of overriding public policy from legal precedents, governmental practice, or obvious ethical or moral standards. <em>See Williams v.

      <em>Chepkevich </em>is our most recent analysis of pre-injury releases as they pertain to ski resort facilities. There, the plaintiff was skiing with her six-year-old nephew and asked the lift operator to stop the lift so she and her nephew could board the lift. Although the lift operator agreed to do so, when the lift came behind the plaintiff and her nephew, the operator failed to stop the lift. As a result, the young boy did not board the lift properly and, when the plaintiff tried to help him on to the lift, she fell and injured her shoulder and hip. The plaintiff filed suit against the ski resort, alleging the lift operator was negligent in failing to stop the lift after promising to do so. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the ski resort, reasoning that the release signed by the plaintiff prior to her skiing that day barred her suit. Against a public policy challenge, we upheld the release, reasoning that Pennsylvania encourages the sport of siding, <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>and noting our courts previously upheld such releases for negligence.</p>

      <em>Chepkevich </em>did not, however, address whether a release for recklessness is against public policy. In ruminating on this question, we first consider where on the spectrum of tortious conduct recklessness falls. At one end of that spectrum, exculpatory clauses that release a party from negligence generally are not against public policy, and are enforceable provided certain criteria are met.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

It is elementary and foundational to our system of criminal and tort law that parties are not permitted to intentionally harm one another. Accordingly, releases for intentional tortious conduct are likewise prohibited. <em>See </em>AMJUR Contracts 286 (collecting cases); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 195(1) (a term exempting a party from liability for intentional conduct is against public policy); 15 Corbin on Contracts § 85.18 (2003) (stating courts generally do not enforce agreements to exempt parties from tort liability for intentional conduct). Thus, while obviously distinct concepts, whether on this spectrum we conclude recklessness is more akin to intentional conduct, or more like negligence in character, can guide our inquiry.</p>

Williston, Contracts § 19.24 (1998) (“An attempted exemption from liability for a future intentional tort or crime or for a future willful or grossly negligent act is generally held void.”). Moreover, federal courts purporting to apply Pennsylvania law have barred the enforcement of releases for reckless behavior.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Similar to our assessment above, these jurisdictions have reasoned that recklessness is more akin to intentional conduct, as recklessness, in contrast to negligence, requires conscious action rather than mere inadvertence. Accordingly, they conclude that permitting recklessness would remove any incentive for parties to act with even a minimal standard of care.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[162,1204,1152,792]]]'>We agree. As illustrated above, were we to sanction releases for reckless conduct, parties would escape liability for consciously disregarding substantial risks of harm to others; indeed, liability would be waivable for all conduct except where the actor specifically intended harm to occur. There is near unanimity across jurisdictions that such releases are unenforceable, as such releases would jeopardize the health, safety, and welfare of the people by removing any incentive for parties to adhere to minimal standards of safe conduct. <em>See Hall v. Arnica Mut. Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/538/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="538 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="475549" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0337-01">538 Pa. 337</a>, 347-48, <a href="/pa/538/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="648 A.2d 755" data-case-ids="475505,475549,7874198,7874309" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0336-01,/pa/538/0337-01,/a2d/648/0755-01,/a2d/648/0755-02">648 A.2d 755</a>, 760 (1994). We therefore conclude that, even in this voluntarily recreational setting involving private parties, there is a dominant public policy against allowing exculpatory releases of reckless behavior, which encourages parties to adhere to minimal standards of care and safety.</p>

In his Concurring and Dissenting Opinion (“CODO”), Justice Baer contends our review of the question of whether a release for reckless conduct is against public policy is infirm because the underlying issue of Monaghan's recklessness was not properly before the Superior Court. <em>See </em>CODO at 5-6. We disagree. Tayar raised the issue of whether there was a factual question regarding Monaghan’s recklessness in her response to Appellants’ summary judgment motion, <em>see </em>Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment at 13, and in her Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, <em>see </em>Plaintiff's Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal, 5/11/06, at 1-2. Further, the issue was fully briefed before the three-judge Superior Court panel, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant at 32-33; Brief for Appellees at 26-28, and the <em>en banc </em>panel of that court, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant on Reargument at 37, 42-43; Brief for Appellees on Reargument at 35-36.

Scott generally agrees with Tayar that recklessness may not be released as a matter of public policy, and also submits there is a generally accepted recognition that recklessness constitutes a more severe form of misconduct than ordinary negligence, and, in light of that recognition, many states do not permit releases of reckless behavior. Further, Scott requests that we formally adopt Section 195 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which, Scott contends, would align Pennsylvania with the many states that refuse to enforce exculpatory provisions purporting to release recklessness.</p>

It differs from that form of negligence which consists in mere inadvertence, incompetence, unskillfulness, or a failure to take precautions to enable the actor adequately to cope with a possible or probable future emergency, in that reckless misconduct requires a conscious choice of a course of action, either with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it or with knowledge of facts which would disclose this danger to any reasonable man.... The difference between reckless misconduct and conduct involving only such a quantum of risk as is necessary to make it negligent is a difference in the degree of the risk, but this difference of degree is so marked as to amount substantially to a difference in kind.</blockquote>

Thus, the trial court concluded that Plaintiff failed to create a genuine issue of material fact <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>as to whether Monaghan engaged in reckless conduct.

With regard to the question of whether the release, likewise, absolved the defendants from reckless conduct, the panel noted that, as determined by the trial court, Plaintiff failed to produce evidence creating an inference that Monaghan acted in an intentional, reckless manner. Further, the panel opined that, even assuming reckless conduct on the part of Monaghan, the release was sufficient to cover such conduct, noting that its language released defendants for negligence and “other improper conduct.” Thus, the court affirmed the trial court’s decision.</p>

Plaintiff, however, never raised, as an issue in her brief to the court, whether the trial court erroneously concluded that she failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Monaghan’s conduct constituted recklessness. Notwithstanding this omission, the <em>en banc </em>court found that a material question concerning this fact did exist. The court further found that the release encompassed only negligent conduct because its language was not specific enough to release acts of greater culpability. Finally, the court determined that the release applied to the negligent acts of Camelback, but not Monaghan. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on the question of whether the defendants’ conduct was reckless or intentional, and if so, whether such conduct caused the injuries to Plaintiff.</p>

The burden of proving that no genuine issue of material fact exists is on the moving party and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party. <em>Toy v.

Defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment, conceding that the testimony of Monaghan demonstrated negligence, while implicitly indicating that it failed to support Plaintiffs allegation of recklessness, which required a higher quantum of consciousness and risk on the tortfeasor’s part. <em>See </em>Restatemént of Torts (Second) § 500, comment g.
