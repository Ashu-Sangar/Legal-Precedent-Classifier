They further maintain that the charge was erroneous because it instructed the jury that Appellants/Plaintiffs were required to prove that the surgeon who performed the allegedly unauthorized operation did so with the intent to harm. Viewing the jury charge in its entirety, we conclude that it clearly and accurately set forth the law. Contrary to Appellants’ contentions, the jury charge did not require proof that the surgeon performed the operation with the intent to harm. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court, which affirmed the trial court’s entry of judgment on the verdict in favor of Appellees.</p>

The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the physicians committed a battery when they delivered Dr. Cooper’s baby via a Cesarean section after twenty-seven weeks of pregnancy, notwithstanding that she had refused consent for such procedure. A two-week jury trial was conducted, during which extensive testimony was offered by all parties.</p>

Dr. Cooper called her obstetrician’s office, Appellee Main Line Health, Inc., and spoke to Appellee Dr. Eric Carlson, who advised her to go to Appellee Lankenau Hospital for tests. Once Dr. Cooper arrived, a nurse examined her with both an ultrasound and a fetal heart monitor. Finding the fetal heart rate to be lower than normal, the nurse called the on-duty obstetrical resident, Appellee Dr. Sharon Nemser-Rudo, to assist.</p>

Dr. Cooper, being a physician herself, believed her baby could be experiencing a relatively benign arrhythmia, which would not require surgical intervention. When Dr. Nemser-Rudo relayed the facts and asked the opinion of Dr. Carlson, Dr. Cooper’s obstetrician, he advised Dr. Nemser-Rudo to proceed with the surgery.</p>

Superior Court Memorandum, dated 8/10/10, at 10. The court went on to state that “while repeatedly reinforcing the law of battery as the controlling standard in [lack-of-consent] cases, our Supreme Court has not chosen to modify the constituent element of <em>mens rea </em>in a manner specific to medical consent cases.” <em>Id.</em>

They rely on that portion of the jury charge which states: “[a] battery is an act done with the intent to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>body of another, and directly results in the harmful or offensive contact with the body of another.” N.T. 5/15/09, Vol. IX, at 51. According to Appellants, this statement improperly conveyed to the jury that a plaintiff in a medical lack-of-consent case must prove that the defendant surgeon acted with the intent to harm the patient. To the contrary, they contend, the “intent to cause harm” element of battery has no place in a medical lack-of-consent case because it would be virtually impossible to prove that a surgeon performing an operation did so with an intent to harm the patient. Rather, Appellants submit, the issue in a medical lack-of-consent case is simply whether the patient gave permission for the surgical procedure.</p>

Relying on earlier decisions of this Court, Appellants suggest that a plaintiff asserting a claim of unauthorized surgery need only demonstrate that the operation was performed and that the plaintiff did not authorize it. <em>See Dicenzo v.

As noted, however, the jury could not have been misled here as the trial court unambiguously followed the definition of battery with an express direction that a batteiy is committed if the patient did not consent to the operation.

    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[259,388,1156,513]]]'>I respectfully dissent. In a lack of consent medical battery case, I would dispense with the notion, perpetuated by the majority, that consideration of the traditional battery element of “harmful or offensive contact” is meaningful or helpful. Rather, I conclude it is, as a practical matter, pointless and, as illustrated by the instructions in this case, potentially confusing to the point of error to require juries to assess whether contact is “harmful or offensive” in such cases. Further, given the ambiguous instructions in this case, I would grant a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[261,931,1156,626]]]'>As the majority cogently explains, a claim of lack of consent, doctrinally, sounds in battery, and a battery requires proof, <em>inter alia, </em>that the actor intended to cause a harmful or offensive touching. Majority Opinion at 560-64, 51 A.3d at 190-92; <em>see also Dalrymple v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/549/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="549 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="17222" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0217-01">549 Pa. 217</a>, 229, <a href="/a2d/701/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="701 A.2d 164" data-case-ids="11891666,17222" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0164-01,/pa/549/0217-01">701 A.2d 164</a>, 170 (1997). As the majority further notes, we conceive of a claim of lack of consent to be a battery because “surgery performed without the patient’s consent constitutes an intentional and offensive touching.” Majority Opinion at 564, 51 A.3d at 191; <em>see also id. </em>(agreeing that “by proving that the surgery or ‘touching’ was intentional and not consented to, a patient establishes that it was ‘offensive’ ”).</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.7",622,[261,1578,1159,787]],["BL_623.1",623,[167,336,1157,583]]]'>However, beyond enforcing the doctrinal tidiness of battery theory, instructing juries to consider the “harmful or offensive” nature of the contact is not meaningful, and, at the same time, causes mischief and confusion. Outside of an emergency context, unconsented-to surgery is <em>ipso facto </em>a battery. <em>See Montgomery v. Bazaz-Sehgal, </em><a href="/pa/568/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="568 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="163574" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0574-01">568 Pa. 574</a>, 584-85, <a href="/pa/568/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="798 A.2d 742" data-case-ids="163574,9434994" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0574-01,/a2d/798/0742-01">798 A.2d 742</a>, 748 (2002) (“surgical or operative procedures, if not consented to, amount to a battery”); <em>Moure v. Raeuchle, </em><a href="/pa/529/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="529 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1831163" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0394-01">529 Pa. 394</a>, 404, <a href="/pa/529/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="529 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1831163" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0394-01">604 A.2d 1003</a>, 1008 (1992) (“an operation without the patient’s consent is a technical assault”). Yes, unconsented-to surgery is also a “harmful or offensive” touching, and, yes, a harmful or offensive touching is a battery. But that intermediate logic is superfluous in lack of consent cases: again, outside of an emergency context, <em>all </em>unconsented-to surgeries are batteries, and, as a matter of proof for the <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>parties, and as a matter of fact finding for the judge or jury, a lack of consent case rises and falls solely on consent. <em>See Grabowski v. Quigley, </em><a href="/pa-super/454/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="454 Pa. Super. 27" data-case-ids="772853" data-case-paths="/pa-super/454/0027-01">454 Pa.Super. 27</a>, <a href="/a2d/684/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="684 A.2d 610" data-case-ids="7352465,772853" data-case-paths="/a2d/684/0610-01,/pa-super/454/0027-01">684 A.2d 610</a>, 615-16 (1996) (“The dispositive issue in this [lack of consent] claim is the nature and scope of Appellant’s consent.”). For this reason, any consideration of “harmful or offensive” touching falls out of the equation; indeed, in this Court’s decision reaffirming the battery foundation for lack of consent claims, we analyzed the issue without any mention of the harmful or offensive conduct element. <em>See Montgomery, supra; see also Moure, <a href="/pa/529/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="529 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1831163" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0394-01">supra.</a></em>

    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[277,520,1153,954]]]'>The second paragraph above instructed the jury that a battery requires an “intent to cause a harmful or offensive contact.” (Significantly, as I discuss below, harmful or offensive contact was not defined.) The third paragraph instructed that, if surgery is done without consent, it is a battery. However, if the instruction in the third paragraph is correct, and the majority and I agree it is, what was the point of the instruction in the second paragraph? That is, if a jury finds there was no consent, as a matter of law the contact <em>was </em>harmful and offensive. So, why additionally instruct the jury on harm and offense? Is it merely so they understand the legal theory behind our medical battery jurisprudence? Obviously not. An instruction on harmful or offensive contact adds nothing to a jury’s deliberations, is at best redundant, and at worst confusing. I would reinforce the principle that unconsented-to touching is the <em>sine qua non </em>of this type of medical battery and would disallow, in such cases, any instruction regarding harmful and offensive contact.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Again, the jury was instructed that a battery requires an “intent to cause a harmful or offensive contact” and, further, that, if surgery is done without consent, it is a battery. Critically, the jury was <em>given no </em>guidance on what is harmful or offensive contact. Thus, as Appellants contend, the jury in this case quite reasonably could have found <em>both </em>that: (1) the doctor did not intend to cause a harmful or offensive contact (perhaps because, unguided by <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>instructions, they concluded the surgery was beneficial) and (2) the patient refused consent. The instructions do not preclude these dual findings.</p>
    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[177,515,1153,691]]]'>Further, based on finding # 1 and the instruction in the second paragraph, the jury would have concluded the doctor’s conduct <em>was not </em>a battery, while, based on finding # 2 and the instruction in the third paragraph, the jury would have concluded the doctor’s conduct <em>was </em>a battery. Absent from the jury instructions was any guidance about how to avoid or resolve such conflicting conclusions. Rather, the majority holds, it seems, that the last — correct—instruction controls, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at 565 n. 10, 51 A.3d at 192 n. 10 (“[T]he trial court unambiguously followed the definition of battery with an express direction that a battery is committed if the patient did not consent”), while ignoring the potential and likely confusion engendered by the prior instruction.</p>
    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.6",625,[174,1234,1154,905]]]'>The <em>majority </em>understands the instructions to be accurate because we understand, as a matter of legal theory, that “surgery performed without the patient’s consent constitutes an intentional and offensive touching.” Majority Opinion at 564, 51 A.3d at 191. However, <em>the jury </em>in this case was never provided with that critical logic. Without that essential piece — indeed, without any guidance on what “harmful or offensive contact” is — the jury was permitted to decide for itself whether the contact was harmful or offensive, and to arbitrarily resolve any potentially conflicting conclusions. For this reason, contrary to the majority, I cannot conclude the jury was “clearly, adequately, and accurately” instructed on the law. <em>See Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/592/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="592 Pa. 698" data-case-ids="3556679" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0698-01">592 Pa. 698</a>, 728, <a href="/pa/592/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="927 A.2d 586" data-case-ids="3556679,8398300" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0698-01,/a2d/927/0586-01">927 A.2d 586</a>, 603 (2007). Further, as I cannot say the ambiguous instructions could not have contributed to the verdict, I would grant a new trial. <em>See Levine v. Rosen, </em><a href="/pa/532/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="532 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1835964" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0512-01">532 Pa. 512</a>, 517, <a href="/pa/532/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="532 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1835964" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0512-01">616 A.2d 623</a>, 626 (1992).</p>
