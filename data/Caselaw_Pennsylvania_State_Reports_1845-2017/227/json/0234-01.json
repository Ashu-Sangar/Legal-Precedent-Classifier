    "head_matter": "Somerset Colliery Company v. John, Appellant.\nMortgage \u2014 Costs\u2014Appeal\u2014Reversal of judgment.\nWhere on a trial of a scire facias sur mortgage the plaintiff recovers less than the amount claimed, and only the amount tendered, and the judgment is reversed on appeal by the plaintiff, the defendant on an appeal from the same judgment cannot have the question considered as to his liability for interest, costs and attorney\u2019s commissions. This liability depends on the verdict on the retrial of the case.\nArgued Jan. 17, 1910.\nAppeal, No. 23,\nOct. T., 1910, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Somerset Co., Feb. T., 1905, No. 18, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Somerset Colliery Company v. A. F. John.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAppeal dismissed.\nScire facias sur mortgage.\nThe facts appear by the report of Somerset Colliery Co., Appellant, v. John, ante, p. 228.\nError assigned was as follows: 1. The court erred in making the following order: And now, July 21, 1909, after consideration thereof it is ordered and directed that the rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered in above case without costs, be discharged; it is further ordered and directed that the rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered without attorney\u2019s commission, be discharged.\nW. H. Ruppel, with him W. H. Koontz and J. G. Ogle, for appellant.\nH. Gordon McCouch, L. C. Colburn and Ernest O. Kooser, for appellee."
