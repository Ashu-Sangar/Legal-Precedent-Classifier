The plaintiff furnished the purchase money and by agreement the title was placed in the defendant\u2019s name and he executed a declaration of trust for an undivided half interest and agreed to pay the plaintiff one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the coal. The-questions of fact were carefully submitted to the jury, and a discussion of them would serve no useful purpose. The instruction in relation to the effect of a receipt \u201cin full payment of a share of coal sold,\u201d given by the plaintiff to the defendant, was free from error. Such a receipt is prima facie evidence of a settlement in full of the matter to which it refers, and is not to be set aside except for fraud, accident or mistake, but it is always open to explanation or correction. \u201cA receipt is like any other parol admission by the party, open to contradiction, explanation or correction:\u201d Russell v. Church, 65 Pa. 9.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

A receipt given by a client to her attorney \u201cin full payment\u201d of a certain sale transaction is prima facie evidence of a settlement in full of the matter to which it refers, and is not to be set aside except for fraud, accident or mistake, but it is always open to explanation or correction.\n2. A receipt is like any other parol admission by the party, open to contradiction, explanation or correction.\nArgued Feb. 22, 1910.\nAppeal, No. 354,\nJan. T., 1910, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lackawanna Co., Sept. T., 1907, No. 1,661, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Laura A. Gregory v. W. S. Huslander.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and M\u00f3schzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for money alleged to be due. Before Edwards, P. J. '\nThe facts appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for 13,043.24. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned among others was the answer to defendant\u2019s third point as follows:\n3. If the jury believe that Laura A. Gregory executed the receipt dated December 9, 1904, it is prima facie evidence of settlement and should not be set aside except for fraud, accident or mistake, and the cause of setting it aside should distinctly appear. Answer: I affirm this point, but I add to it the following explanation: that a receipt is like any other parol admission of the party signing it, and it is open to explanation or correction, and he may show that it was made by mistake or does not exhibit the truth or state all the facts.\nS. B. Price, with him J. F. Scragg, C. B. Price and J. E. Davis, for appellant.\nW. N. Leach, with him George Morrow, for appellee."
