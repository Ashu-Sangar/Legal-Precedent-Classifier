      <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>“Now this agreement witnesseth, that the party of the first part does hereby employ the party of the second part to procure for him a purchaser for said coal lands, known as the Keffer Improvement Tract, in case the same shall be offered for sale in the course of said partition proceedings; and in case such purchaser shall be found, the party of the first part will pay to the party of the second part the sum of ten per centum of the amount which he shall receive for his interest in said Keffer Improvement Tract, whether said sale shall be made in the course of said partition proceedings or not, and whoever may be the purchaser thereof; and shall also include any amount received from the said Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company as a settlement in said partition proceedings. It being the understanding of the parties hereto that a partition of said premises is essential to a successful sale thereof, and that the finding of a purchaser who will buy said land in case it shall be offered for sale in the course of said proceedings, is essential in order for a successful prosecution thereof.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[359,1343,1154,253]]]'>We do not construe this agreement to mean that the plaintiff shall do nothing, but that his compensation of ten per centum hinges upon the fact of his procuring a purchaser who is ready, able and willing to buy the land in question, providing it is offered for sale.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.6",532,[344,1613,1169,794]]]'>On first blush, the plaintiff's contention might appear to be the correct one, that even though no sale were effected other than to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal <em>&amp; </em>Iron Company, who would take in partition proceedings, he was then to receive the ten per centum; but on reading the whole of the above clause, there can be no doubt that the meaning of this clause is that the plaintiff was to have a purchaser ready, able and willing to buy, in order that the partition proceedings might be carried to their final consummation. The statement does not allege that the plaintiff had procured a purchaser, as above set forth, or, in fact, that he had procured any purchaser, but seems to rely upon the fact that the property was sold in the course of partition proceedings, to the Philadelphia . <em>&amp; </em>Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company, and that his duties were performed.</p>

      <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>With this view of the case we cannot agree, and we think that the construction of the contract is as we have stated above. It was incumbent upon this plaintiff to procure a purchaser before he was entitled to any compensation; and as he has not alleged this in this statement, his statement is defective, as it does not contain an allegation of performance upon his part. We have concluded, however, to overrule the demurrer and the motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and dispose of this question on the trial of the case; for, if the plaintiff can prove that he had a purchaser able, willing and ready to buy, then we think he would be entitled to his compensation under this contract, otherwise not; but for the present we will overrule both motions and dispose of whatever questions may arise upon the trial of this case.</p>
