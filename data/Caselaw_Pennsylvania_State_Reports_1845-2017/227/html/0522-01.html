They do not purchase the goods but sell to the trade and charge a commission on them. They are the exclusive selling agents for the GlennLowry Manufacturing Company of Whitmire, South Carolina, manufacturers of dry goods. In reply to a telegram containing an offer for a certain quantity of goods, the Glenn-Lowry Manufacturing Company on March 20, 1906, deposited with the defendant company at Whitmire, South Carolina, the fol<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>lowing telegram for transmission to the plaintiffs in Philadelphia: “Anxious that you sell summer deliveries of decade at chaplet.” On the morning of March 21, 1906, the defendant company delivered to the plaintiffs, as the message deposited with it the evening before at Whitmire for transmission, the following telegram: “Anxious that you sell summer deliveries of decade at chapel.” It will be observed that the word “chapel” in the message delivered to the plaintiffs in Philadelphia was.erroneously substituted for the word “chaplet” in the message deposited for transmission. The blank on which the messages were written contained the usual stipulations limiting the company’s liability for unrepeated messages.

The sales note provided that “ if the production of the Glenn Mills shall be curtailed during the time above named by strikes, or lockouts to counteract strikes, or any unavoidable casualty, the deliveries shall only be proportionate to production.” Immediately after the sale the plaintiffs wired the Glenn Mills to ship the goods. The error in the transmission of the telegram was then discovered. The Glenn-Lowry Manufacturing Company refused to deliver the goods which had been sold to Gamer &amp; Company at the price of four and seven-eighths cents per yard, and compelled the plaintiffs to • pay five cents per yard for them. This resulted in a loss to the plaintiffs of $1,999, and to recover that sum the plaintiffs instituted this action.

It is settled in this jurisdiction and by the great weight of authority in this country that a telegraph company is liable in tort to the addressee for injuries arising out of the negligent transmission of an intelligible message. A different rule prevails in England and possibly in some states of the Union. New York &amp; Washington Printing Telegraph Co. v. Dryburg, <a href="/pa/35/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="35 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="990450" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0298-01">35 Pa. 298</a>, was an action on the case brought by the recipient of a message against the telegraph company for the careless and erroneous transmission of a telegram. Between the receipt of the message and the time he learned of the error in transmission, the plaintiff acted on the information contained in the telegram and sustained a loss. He brought the action to recover damages for the loss resulting from the error in transmission. A judgment of the trial court against the telegraph company was sustained by this court. It was held that if a telegraph company negligently or willfully violates its duty of sending the very message prescribed, it is responsible in an action sounding in tort to the party to whom the erroneous message is addressed, and further, that even if the telegraph company be considered only as the agent of the sender of the message, it is liable to third persons, as a wrongdoer, for any misfeasance in the execution of the duties confided to it. In delivering the opinion, Woodward, J., said (p. 302): “The wrong, then, of which the plaintiff complains, consisted in sending him a different message from that which they had contracted with LeRoy to send. That it was a wrong is as certain as that it was their duty to transmit the message for <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>which they were paid. Though telegraph companies are not, like carriers, insurers for the safe delivery of what is entrusted to them, their obligations, as far as they reach, spring from the same sources, — the public nature of their employment, and the contract under which the particular duty is assumed. One of the plainest of their obligations is to transmit the very message prescribed. To follow copy, an imperative law of the printing office, is equally applicable to the telegraph office.” This case was followed in Western Union Telegraph Co. v.

Both of these cases were ruled on the ground that the sender was the agent, specially authorized by the addressee, to send the message, and hence was bound by the contract made by the sender with the telegraph company. In the Coit case, it is said in the opinion: “Plaintiffs telegraphed to Dennis, in St. Louis, requesting him to send by telegram the price of 220 tons of steels rails. In pursuance of that request, Dennis telegraphed the desired information. It is thus plain that Dennis performed service for plaintiffs at their request. And, that being so, we deem the conclusion irresistible that, in the performance of the service, Dennis was acting for plaintiffs, and was their agent. ... Dennis, in sending the,message, being the agent of plaintiffs, they were bound by the contract made with the defendant. Plaintiffs, by requesting him to send the message, necessarily authorized him to contract with <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>defendant as to how that message should be sent .... and therefore the agreement was binding upon the principal, these plaintiffs.” The case of New York &amp; Washington Printing Telegraph Co. v.

The Cannon Manufacturing Company, therefore, in transmitting the information requested by means of the telegraph, was made the agent of the plaintiffs for that purpose. ... It is our judgment that, where the receiver of a message has, by special request, procured it to be sent by the telegraph, he becomes bound by any reasonable contract made by the sender with the telegraph company for its transmission, and is limited in his claim for any damages for a loss occasioned by error or mistake in transmission, where the stipulations for the repetition or for the insurance of the message had not been availed of, to the amount stipulated in the contract.”</p>

The contention of the defendant company is that the message involved in this case was in cipher and unintelligible except to the sender and sendees, and hence the doctrine of these cases does not apply. We are not convinced of the correctness of this position. We think the message sent to the plaintiffs disclosed on its face that it related to a business transaction of importance which required immediate attention by the sendees. It was addressed to a well-known business firm of the city of Philadelphia and was signed by the Glenn-Lowry Manufacturing Company. It was dated March 20, 1906, and reads: “Anxious that you sell summer deliveries of decade at chaplet.” There were but two <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>code words in the dispatch and, apart from these, the language is plain and intelligible. It was sent by a manufacturing company and manifestly referred to a commercial transaction. It in terms shows anxiety on the part of the sender that the firm to which it is addressed shall sell something. It will be assumed from the intelligible language employed that some articles of merchandise manufactured by the company were to be sold by the sendees for delivery during the approaching summer. It implied action by the sendees at an early date. The message was sent March 20, and delivered the following day, less than a month and a half before the beginning of summer when the deliveries of the articles sold were to be made. Hence, the necessity for prompt action on the part of the sendees. The only words of the telegram in cipher are the name and price of the article to be sold. These are some of the details of the proposed business transaction, and while important to the parties it was not absolutely necessary that they should be known by the defendant’s operator to inform him of the general character and importance of the transaction. A message need not disclose on its face the nature of the business, so that its meaning as to quantity, quality or value may be disclosed to the operator; if it shows that it relates to a commercial or legal transaction of value it is sufficient: Postal Tel. Cable Co. v. Lathrop (Ill.), <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Am.%20St.%20Rep.%2055" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="19 Am. St. Rep. 55">19 Am. St. Rep. 55</a>; Pepper v.

The fact that a telegraphic message is sent and received by parties evidently engaged in business operations and that part of it is in cipher should be notice to the operator that it relates to business matters of importance to the parties, and some of which matters they wish to conceal from the general public and about which they wish to communicate without delay. It is, therefore, sufficient, notice to a telegraph company if the message shows on its face that it relates to a commercial transaction of importance without giving the details of the transaction. This is substantially the rule announced in the many cases on the subject and stated in the standard text-books. In 2 Joyce on Electric Law, sec. 952, it is said: “The rule (requiring the message to indicate its importance) is not to be <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>construed as meaning that all the details in reference to a transaction referred to in a dispatch and which are known to the parties themselves, need be disclosed to the company to render it liable for more than nominal damages.” In Jones on Telegraph and Telephone Companies, sec. <em>535, </em>the author says: “Although a message may be couched in unusual, or trade language, if it is sufficiently plain to indicate that it relates to a business transaction of much importance, and that loss will probably result unless it is promptly transmitted and delivered, recovery will not be limited to nominal damages.”</p>
    <p id="b565-3" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[207,893,1153,744]]]'>The language of the message in Western Union Telegraph Co. v.

C. 38</a>, is much less intelligible and disclosed less urgency than the language of the message in the present case, yet we held it sufficiently plain on its face to justify a verdict and judgment for the actual loss sustained by the addressee by reason of error in its transmission. The message as deposited with the telegraph company at the stock yards in Pittsburg in that case reads: “One cost six half two wooled Texas five sixty take all off evening.” In course of transmission to the abattoir, West Philadelphia, its destination “sixty” was changed to “six.” In the opinion of the court it is said: “There was enough upon its face to indicate to the operator that it referred to sheep to be shipped to Philadelphia, and the price.”</p>

It is equally true, however, that the plaintiffs were required to observe their contract with Garner &amp; Company and deliver the goods they had sold them on the faith of the erroneous telegram. While the goods sold to Garner <em>&amp; </em>Company were <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>standard goods and were similar to goods to be had in the market, the plaintiffs’ contract, as evidenced by the sales note, obliged them to deliver goods manufactured by the Glenn-Lowry Manufacturing Company at its Glenn Mills. This, we think, is clearly the proper interpretation of that note. The provision that the deliveries should be proportionate to the production of the Glemi Mills during a strike or lockout manifestly indicates that the goods sold by the plaintiffs to Garner &amp; Company were the product of the Glenn Mills. Any other construction of this clause of the sales note renders it meaningless and, therefore, such construction is not permissible. There is no evidence in the case that the market price of the Glenn Mills goods was less than five cents per yard, the price the plaintiffs were required to pay the GlennLowry Manufacturing Company for the goods sold to Garner &amp; Company.</p>

The sale, however, was made prior to the discovery of the mistake in the message and relying on its correctness. The goods sold, as we hold, were the product of the Glenn Mills, owned and operated by the Glenn-Lowry Manufacturing Company. The uncontradicted evidence is that the plaintiffs paid five cents per yard for the goods, and had sold and were required to deliver them to Garner &amp; Company at four and seven-eighths cents per yard, thereby losing one-eighth of a cent per yard on the quantity sold. It is contended, however, by the defendant that the plaintiff received a commission from the manufacturing company of four per cent on the gross selling price of the goods and that the commission amounted to more than one-eighth per cent per yard and, therefore, the plaintiffs sustained no loss. We agree with the learned trial judge that the defendant company cannot defalk, as it were, the plaintiffs’ commissions against the plaintiffs’ loss on the sale. The plaintiffs are the exclusive selling agents and bankers of the Glenn-Lowry Manufacturing Company, and receive a fixed commission of <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>four per cent on all sales of a certain grade of the company’s product. They guarantee to the manufacturing company payment of the price of the company’s goods sold by them. They were entitled to their commission of four per cent on five cents per yard of the goods purchased from the manufacturing company and sold to Garner &amp; Company. Had the mistake not occurred in the message the plaintiffs would not have sold the goods for less than five cents per yard, and hence would not have lost their commission of four per cent. The negligent act of the defendant company caused this loss and it must compensate the plaintiff for the injury done. The commission was compensation for services rendered and liabilities assumed and was the property of the plaintiffs for the loss of which they were entitled to be paid. It was not profit in the correct sense of the term, but if it was, it results from the contract with the manufacturing company, and for its loss, caused by the negligence of the defendant company, the latter is responsible.

In speaking of the right to recover loss of profits in cases of this character, the opinion says (p. 428): “This test of the measure of damages is not affected by the fact that part of the difference between the contract price and the market price would be profit. The parties are entitled to all the legitimate benefits of the contract, including profits. This general rule is applicable to damages for mistakes in communicating contracts by telegraph, and it was the basis of the decision in Hays v. Telegraph Co., <a href="/sc/70/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="70 S.C. 16" data-case-ids="4424768" data-case-paths="/sc/70/0016-01">70 S. C. 16</a>.”</p>
    <p id="b567-3" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[222,1864,1149,206]]]'>The view we take of this case relieves us from the necessity of determining the proper measure of damages in an action brought by the sendee against a telegraph company for mistakes in transmitting a cipher or unintelligible message.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[264,2082,473,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
