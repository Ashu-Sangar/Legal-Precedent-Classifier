Brooks and Mears needed money to improve their coal properties and the Hudson company wanted the coal. A tonnage agreement was entered into, a loan was arranged and a mortgage was given to secure the loan. This mortgage did not cover .the land of the Langcliffe Coal Company. It could not legally, because the lessor of the Langcliffe land would not consent to a conveyance of it from the Langcliffe Coal Company to Brooks and Mears, and, consequently, it could not be included in the mortgage, exhibit “C.” It appears by later agreements, that it was intended all the time that the Langcliffe land should be security for the loan of $325,000, equally with the Brooks and Mears land embraced in the mortgage; because all the land, the Brooks and Mears’ and the Langeliffe’s, constituted one mining operation, and the monéy advanced by the Hudson company was used necessarily for the benefit of both properties. It is this element in the case — the effort by means of subsequent agreements- to make and hold the Langcliffe land liable for said loan in the same manner and to the same extent as the land included in the Brooks and Mears mortgage, that accounts for any complications in the controversy between the parties; and it is this phase of the ease that gives the plaintiff a color of right to come into a court of equity for relief.</p>

The new mortgage recites the right to substitute one for the other and it contains the usual default clauses and the right to issue scire facias, etc. It is hardly necessary to discuss the law applicable to s.uch a state of facts. All liability under the Brooks and Mears bond and mortgage has been canceled: The debt has been extinguished.

To answer this question, the other agreement not yet discussed must be considered. The source of plaintiff’s claim to equitable relief must be found, if found at all, in the right of the plaintiff to the Langcliffe land as additional security for the loan and in the agreement as to the Langcliffe capital stock. Plaintiff contends that it cannot establish or <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>enforce this right by any adequate legal remedy; and that if equity ought to intervene to adjudicate a part of plaintiff’s claim, then, under a well-known principle, equity has its grasp on the whole controversy.

' It sets forth more fully why the land embraced in the Langcliffe contract was not included in the Brooks and Mears original mortgage;,and it proceeds to state that its intent is to constitute the Langcliffe land an additional security for the payment of the loan of $325,000. This agreement recites the oft-repeated clause as to the substitution of one mortgage for the other, and it sets forth a promise on the part of the Langcliffe Coal Company to pay the said loan at the rate of fifteen cents on each- ton mined. The agreement has in it a sixty-day default clause, and there is attached to it a schedule containing a full description of the Langcliffe property. The eighth paragraph of the agreement reads thus: “This agreement shall take effect as of the twentieth of April, 1892, and shall be deemed to be made as additional- security for the payment of said bond and mortgage of the parties of the third part (Brooks and Mears) and of said substituted bond and mortgage, and for the repayment of said advance, and shall pass as an incident of said bond and mortgage, and of said substituted bond and mortgage, or any transfer thereof.” The only promise made by Brooks and Mears in the agreement is that they will enter into a tonnage agreement with the Hudson company when requested to do so.</p>

The trust company has also exhibit “F,” one of the agreements signed September 25, .1893. This is the additional security consisting of the property of the Langeliffe Coal Company. By this agreement the trust company has its grasp on the Langeliffe property in addition to the Brooks and Hears property. What is the legal character of this agreement? An examination of it will show that it is in itself a complete legal instrument imposing upon the Langeliffe Coal Company a definite legal obligation, capable of enforcement by an adequate legal remedy. The default clause in the seventh paragraph of the agreement reads thus: “In case of default on the part of the party of the first part, its successors or assigns, in any of the obligations hereof on the part of it, them or any of them, and such default shall continue for the space of sixty days, the whole of said principal sum of three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, with all arrears of interest, shall <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>and may, at the option of the party of the second part, its successors or assigns, become and be forthwith due and payable.” Without regard to this default clause and to the character of the agreement as an independent and separate instrument, it might be regarded in another light in view of the eighth paragraph of the agreement, which we have quoted in another place. By this paragraph the agreement is in effect attached to the Brooks and Mears mortgage; it is made to “ pass as an incident of said bond and mortgage, and of said substituted bond and mortgage, or any transfer thereof.” Why could not this agreement and the Brooks and Mears mortgage be treated as one obligation for the payment of the loan of $325,000? And why could not a judgment be obtained in scire facias proceedings which would cover the Langcliffe property as well as the Brooks and Mears property? It is not for us to decide now which one of three or four legal remedies would be the most effective. That should be left to the judgment of counsel. All we say at present is that we see no reason yet why plaintiff should come into a court of equity.</p>

In addition to the foregoing securities the trust company by exhibit “G” has in his grasp, as additional security for the same loan, the entire capital stock of the Langcliffe Coal Company, with summary power to dispose of the same. Under this agreement the trust company has more than one complete remedy incident to its ownership of the capital stock. The remedies are summary and quite drastic. In case-of default in any of the conditions contained in the Brooks and Mears bond and mortgage the holder of said stock may deal with it as if the holder were the “absolute beneficial owner thereof;” or, the stock may be sold or transferred for such price as the holder shall think fit; or, the holder “may enter into possession of the corporate property, or any part thereof and work said mines;” or, it may “as the owner of all the stock of said Langcliffe Coal Company, sell and realize the property of said company or any part of such property,” applying the proceeds “ to the payment of said bond and mortgage of the mortgagors, or of said substituted bond and mortgage.”</p>

It had the Brooks and Mears bond and mortgage; it had the Langclifl'e property as additional security; and, as further security, it had the entire capital stock of the Langcliffe Coal Company. If, during this period, there had been any default in the payment of the loan, either of principal or interest, the trust company had adequate and efficient legal remedies to enforce the payment of the loan. The date of March 23, 1896, was given by us above because it was at this time that the Langclifl'e Coal Company, Limited, substituted its bond and mortgage from the original bond and mortgage of Brooks and Mears. The new bond and mortgage were given direct to the Continental Trust Company, as stated by us already. The limited company had evidently been formed as early as 1893 (after September 28) because plaintiffs bill states that in 1893 and 1894 Brooks and Mears, by two deeds, had conveyed their interests in the lands embraced in the original mortgage, to the Langcliffe Coal Company, Limited.</p>

There can be no question as to the soundness of this conclusion so far as the old bond and mortgage are concerned; nor can there be any question arising from the nature of the agreement, exhibit “ F,” because, so far as it touches the merits of plaintiff's contention this was the agreement of the Langcliffe Coal Company, a corporation, with the Hudson company. It is true that Brooks and Mears signed the agreement; but an examination of its provisions will show that whatever was therein promised to be done which might be of any benefit to the plaintiff was promised by the Langcliffe Coal Company, and not by Brooks and Mears. But, independently of this fact, we hold that the plaintiff has an adequate legal remedy by which all of its rights under this agreement might be enforced, as we have already stated.</p>

A large part of plaintiff’s argument is devoted to this transaction. It is claimed that the plaintiff is a trustee for Brooks and Mears for the pledged stock; that the equities arising out of the relation of trustee and beneficiary cannot be adjusted in an action at law, and that this matter, being strictly cognizable in equity, draws to it and with it into a court of equity every other branch of the controversy between the parties. This agreement seems plausible, and under a proper state of facts would be convincing; but the facts of the present case destroy the effectiveness of the argument. It must be remembered that neither Brooks and Mears, nor anybody representing their interests, are demanding relief on account of any act of a trustee in connection with said capital stock. From September 28, 1893, the plaintiff, or its predecessor, has had the absolute power to dispose of the stock by sale or transfer at any price it pleased in case of default in the payment of the loan of 1325,000.</p>

Has the Continental Trust Company, or the plaintiff, at any time attempted to enforce any of the ample legal remedies provided in the agreement, exhibit “G”? The precise date when the default in the payment of the loan first occurred cannot be ascertained clearly from the bill; yet, if several of the allegations of the bill are true, there was a default in the performance of some of the conditions of the various agreements quite early in the history of the transactions detailed in this case. It is stated that Brooks and Mears were in default. If that be the case, then the Continental Trust Company could have foreclosed the Brooks and Mears mortgage at some time dur<a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>ing the period between August 15, 1893, the date of the assignment of said mortgage, and March 23,1896, the date of the substitution of the new for the old bond and mortgage.

Then, and in that case, the trust company had a choice of legal remedies ■under said agreements. It had the right to take possession of the mines, or to sell the entire capital stock of the Langcliffe Coal Company, or to take the company and reorganize it. It is a significant fact that when the trust company in 1896 accepted the bond and mortgage of the limited association in lieu of the Brooks and Mears bond and mortgage, nothing was done to enforce the obligations contained in exhibits “F” and “G,” or to put the securities relating to the Langcliffe company’s property and capital stock in better or different shape. It may be that all the parties were satisfied with matters as they stood at that time; or, it may be that recognizing the uncertain value of the security of the Langcliffe property under exhibit “F,” because of the defect in the title, the trust company did not choose to make any attempt to realize on this security, until the defect was removed by obtaining the consent of the lessor of the Langcliffe property to the alienation of the same. Of course the same objection would not apply to the agreement relating to the capital stock, viz., exhibit “G.” At this point in the discussion and in connection with this phase of the case, we find it necessary to consider two certain writings executed after the date of the new bond and mortgage.</p>

We cannot help commenting upon this unusual delay. Upon any default occurring between 1893 and 1896, the trust company cohid have proceeded on the Brooks and Mears bond and mortgage and on the other two securities. From 1896 to 1901 it could have proceeded on the substituted bond and mortgage and on either or both of the other securities; and from 1901 to 1908 the date of the filing of the bill, the trust company was in better shape than ever to pursue its legal remedies on all the securities. Instead of asserting its rights at the proper time on the law side of the court, it waits until the two principal parties in the case are dead, and now it comes into a court of equity asking for relief, after a delay of seven, twelve or fifteen years, as the case might be under the facts.</p>

In order to understand the force of this assignment we must refer again to some of the exhibits. Exhibit “A,” the first agreement between Brooks and Mears and the Hudson company, provided not only for the advance of 8325,000 to Brooks and Mears, but also for a coal and tonnage arrangement. Brooks and Mears were to sell and deliver to the Hudson company practically all the coal mined by them, and the Hudson company was to pay for <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>the coal monthly a certain price per ton based upon the prices at tide water and to furnish a sufficient number of cars, etc. The bond and mortgage given by Brooks and Mears to secure the loan to them was to be paid in a certain way, viz., the Hudson company was to deduct fifteen cents from the price of each ton of coal bought by it and to apply the same on the mortgage debt. Exhibit “B” is a coal and tonnage contract between the Langcliffe Coal Company and the Hudson company, of the same character as exhibit “A,” except that it contains no reference to the mortgage. Under this contract the Hudson company may assign all its rights to a third party. There is a similar provision in exhibit “A.” An analysis of the two exhibits lead us to the conclusion that there was no legal difficulty in the way of one party holding the coal and tonnage contract and another party holding the bond and mortgage; and that is what happened in this case. The Continental Trust Company, in 1893, by assignment, exhibit “E,” became the owner of the bond and mortgage, exhibit “C,” the Hudson company still retaining its rights in the contract relating to the purchase and sale of the coal under exhibits “A ” and “B.” This was the situation on August 15, 1893, when the Hudson company assigned the Brooks and Mears bond and mortgage to the trust company.</p>
    <p id="b655-3" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[165,1596,1149,531]]]'>Later, on September 28, 1893, the Hudson company assigned to the trust company the two agreements, exhibits “F” and “G,” the one constituting the Langcliffe property as additional security for the loan, and the other constituting the capital stock of the Langcliffe Coal Company as additional security for the same purpose; but the trust company “shall not be deemed to assume any of the covenants or agreements of said agreement (exhibit 'F’) on the part of the Improvement (or Hudson) Company.” That is, the Hudson company still had the coal and tonnage contract.</p>
    <p id="b655-4" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[163,2138,1149,262]],["BL_656.1",656,[316,339,1166,2039]]]'>On December 4, 1893, according to the eleventh paragraph of plaintiff’s bill, the agreement itself not being given, the Hudson company conveyed to the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Coal Company the coal and tonnage contract of April 20, 1892, and the latter company “assumed and under<a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>took all the covenants and agreements” of the Hudson company. There is no reason why this could not be done. The Susquehanna company simply took the place of the Hudson company, and from December 4, 1893, the trust company was to receive its payments on the mortgage from the Susquehanna company. We cannot ascertain from plaintiff’s exhibit “N” who paid the various sums of money credited on the mortgage; but, from 1893 to November 18, 1897, the Susquehanna company was liable to the trust company for the payments on the mortgage. During this period the Susquehanna company was the assignee of the Hudson company’s coal contract. At the end of this period, viz., on November 18, 1897, the Langcliffe Coal Company, Limited, entered into a direct contract with the Susquehanna company as to the coal. It was the same kind of a contract as that of the Hudson company, and is exhibit “ J ”; and it provided for the payment of the mortgage in the same manner as in the other agreements. The Susquehanna company continued to occupy the same relation with the coal properties until February 13, 1901. At this time the agreement, exhibit “K,” was signed by the limited company and the Susquehanna company. This agreement canceled the original coal and tonnage contract between the Hudson company and Brooks and Mears. We do not see that the plaintiff has just ground of complaint on this score; because, in terminating the old contract, it was provided that the agreement should in no wise affect the lien of the mortgage given by the limited company, nor in any way impair its obligation as to the payment of the fifteen cents per ton on all coal mined. Indeed, we find that from the beginning, at every step in the transactions between the parties, the trust company’s mortgage has been protected, so far as that could be done by written agreements and conveyances. Even the last exhibit we shall refer to, which is a conveyance to the Hudson Coal Company of all the properties of the Langcliffe Coal Company, Limited, executed April 29, 1901 (exhibit “M”), states in apt terms that the conveyance is made and received especially subject to the mortgage of the trust company.</p>

There is as much reason for making this company a defendant as there is for making the Hudson company a defendant. Each bears the same relation as the other does to the trust company and its mortgage. The Hudson company agreed to buy and sell the coal from the Langcliffe properties and to pay fifteen cents per ton on the mortgage. The Susquehanna company agreed to do the same thing. We can gather from exhibit “N” that the only thing done by the Hudson company under its coal contract, was to advance the loan of 8325,000, because the first credit given on the mortgage was in 1896. And the money paid then must have been paid by the Susquehanna company. It was the latter company that bought and sold the coal for many years, and the accounts of this company and its relation to the transactions in this case, if at all the subject of investigation in equity, are just as important as those of any other defendant.</p>

The mortgage is to secure the same debt, and includes the same land as the Brooks and Mears mortgage. It contains the usual default clauses providing a remedy for collection, and was duly assigned to the plaintiff. By the agreement of September 25, 1893, exhibit “F,” the property of the Langcliffe Coal Company was made additional security for the payment of the original and substituted bond and mortgage, and became effective as of April 20, 1892, the date of the Brooks and Mears agreement and mortgage. The plaintiff holds this agreement, the seventh paragraph of which provides: “In case of default on the part of the party of the first part, its successors or assigns, in any of the obligations hereof on the part of it, them or any of them, and such default shall continue for the space of sixty days, the whole of said principal sum of three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, with all arrears of interest, shall and may, at the option of the party of the second part, its successors or assigns, become and be forthwith due and payable.” By virtue of the agreement of September 25, 1893, exhibit “G,” the plaintiff company also holds as additional security for its loan the whole of the capital stock of the Langcliffe Coal Company.

If, as the plaintiff company alleges, default has been made in the payment of the principal and interest of the loan, its remedies at law for enforcing payment have at all times been adequate and effective without invoking the aid of a court of equity. The mere fact that a creditor has several securities for his debt does not confer jurisdiction on equity to enforce payment of the claim. A scire facias is the proper remedy for foreclosing the substituted mortgage of the Langeliffe Coal Company, Limited. An appropriate action at law will lie on the agreement of September 25, 1893, to subject the property of the Langeliffe Coal Company, not included in the Brooks and Mears mortgage, to payment of the loan; and it is suggested by the learned judge of the common pleas that the agreement and mortgage may be treated as one obligation for the payment of the loan, and that a judgment on the scire facias would cover the Langeliffe Coal Company property as well as the Brooks and Mears property. The agreement of September 25, 1893, it will be observed, provides numerous and effective remedies for realizing on the capital stock of the Langeliffe Coal Company, and affords an opportunity for controlling the company itself.</p>

We can see no necessity for an accounting to enable the plaintiff to realize on its securities. When the mortgagee issues a scire facias on the mortgage, the amount paid and the amount yet due thereon can,, as in the ordinary case, be readily ascertained. As the bill shows no ground for an accounting, the prayer for discovery, incidental to the accounting, must be .denied. If plaintiff should find that it needs discovery in aid of its action at law, a court of equity will lend its assistance for the purpose.</p>
