The writer further agreed to pay for all freight for the delivery and return of the machinery, to keep it in good order, and to keep it insured. It was also provided that in case of default in payments the corporation should be at liberty to remove the machinery. By a separate writing on the same page, the corporation agreed to sell all of its title to the machinery after all payments had been made, for the sum of $107.40. There was evidence that this $107.40 was for interest on deferred payments, although the agreement stipulated that the notes should be without interest. <em>Held, </em>that the agreement on its face was a bailment, and not a conditional sale.</p>

It is the duty, always, of the court to construe written papers. When a paper comes into a suit and it needs construction, it is the duty of the court to construe the paper, and to say whether it is a bailment or a lease or a conditional sale. In this case after reading if over and comparing it with the decisions' in other similar cases, we say to you as a matter of law that this paper is a bailment, that it conferred no title to the property upon Evans when he purchased it. And if that was all there was in this case we would say to you that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, because the trust company would take no title, for the reason that Evans had no title to the property at the time it was sold. . . . While it is a bailment upon its face, the parties had a right to make a new contract at any time. [1]</p>

The contract, exhibit “A,” attached to plaintiff’s statement, constitutes a bailment. <em>Answer: </em>That is this contract of November 21,1904. As we have said to you in the general charge, taken and read as a whole, it is a bailment, and would entitle the plaintiff to recover unless it was the understanding of the parties at the time it was entered into that it was to be merely a security for the amount due, and was intended by <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>them not as a bailment but as a bill of sale, or was afterwards modified by the parties in the spring of 1905, by which modification the property was sold outright in lieu of the bailment.

B. Evans, in which the plaintiff in this case agreed to sell all its title and interest in all this machinery for the exact amount of the interest, to wit, 1107.40, this contract is not one of bailment, but a conditional sale, and your verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.
