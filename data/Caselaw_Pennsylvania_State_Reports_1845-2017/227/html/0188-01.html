In the present case, it is clear from the language of the will, that the gifts are confined to the children of the testator’s son who might be living at his death, gifts, necessarily contingent upon their survival to that event. That testator’s thought was not beyond his grandchildren is evidenced not only from the language of these gifts in remainder, but also from the prior gifts of income to his grandchildren which fell in upon their deaths, irrespective of their leaving issue, or dying without. That the words “ then living ” imply a contingent remainder, has been decided so often and so recently that it will be sufficient to refer to a few of the late cases on the subject: Scott’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/37/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="37 Pa.
