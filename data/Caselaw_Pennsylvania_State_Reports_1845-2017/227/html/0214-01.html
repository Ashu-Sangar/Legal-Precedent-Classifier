The ordinance provides for a penal bond conditioned that thé principal contractor shall.“promptly make payment to all persons supplying him with labor and materials, whether as a subcontractor or otherwise, in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract.” It is further provided: “Any person or persons making application therefor, and furnishing affidavit to the Department or Bureau, under the direction of which said work is being or has been prosecuted, that labor or materials for the prosecution of such work has been supplied by him or them, and payment for which has not been made, shall be furnished with a certified copy of such contract and bond, upon which said person or persons supplying such labor and materials, either as a subcontractor or otherwise, shall have a right of action, and shall be authorized to bring suit in the name of the City of Philadelphia for his or their use and benefit against said contractor and sureties, and prosecute the same to final judgment and execution. Provided, That such action and its prosecution shall involve the City of Philadelphia in no expense, and that the person or persons so authorized, to bring suit shall first furnish such indemnity to the City of Philadelphia against costs as shall be approved by the City Solicitor.

In such cases the statute may, if unreasonable^ impair the obligations of a contract, and for that reason be held void. But the principle would not apply to contacts made when the limitation was in force, and when the parties are presumed to have made their contracts with reference to the statute. Thus in Pereles v.
