She filed an inventory and appraisement of the estate in the register’s office of Lackawanna county on December 20, 1905, from which it appears that the estate was valued at $15,333.61, and, with the exception of personal property amounting to about $53.00, consisted of bonds, mortgages, judgments and cash.

Wagner, may be lawfully administered and distribution of the same may be had, according to lav/.” The rule was granted. The administrator of Sarah Wagner filed an answer in which he admitted that his decedent had received, as executrix, the personal property of James S. Wagner, but denied that it was of the value alleged in the petition; averred that Wagner by his will and codicil bequeathed to Sarah Wagner his personal property absolutely; that a large number of items in the inventory are in excess of the amounts due from the several parties charged therewith; that all debts and charges against Wagner and his estate have been paid and settled; and that thereupon the said Sarah Wagner took the personal property as her own under the terms of the testator’s will and codicil. It appears that Sarah Wagner as executrix collected judgments in favor of her husband against various individuals and deposited the money in bank to her account as executrix but subsequently transferred the whole account to her individual name.

L. 73, 1 Purd. 1112 (13th ed.), administrators de bonis non have power to recover from their predecessors in the administration, or their legal representatives, all moneys, goods and assets, remaining in their hands due and belonging to the estate of the decedent; to prosecute actions upon promises made to such predecessors in their representative character; to sue forth and defend writs of error, of scire facias, or of execution upon judgments, obtained in the name of their predecessors, and to proceed with unexecuted executions for the collection of such judgments: Provided, that in any suit for the recovery of moneys, goods or assets, remaining in the hands of the predecessor, or his legal representatives, brought before he shall have settled his final administration account, the court shall have power to stay proceedings thereon, upon the defendants filing such account in the register’s office of the proper county, twenty days previous to the term next succeeding that to which the writ was returnable, until final settlement of said account, and the court in which the suit is pending shall render judgment for the balance which shall appear to be due to either party. Before the passage of this act, an administrator de bonis non could not recover the assets of his decedent from his predecessor, or from the legal representative of his predecessor. Creditors and others interested in the estate were compelled to resort to the personal representatives of the decedent’s executor or administrator for payment of their claims. The act of 1834 was manifestly passed to confer authority on an administrator de bonis non to collect from his predecessor all of the assets of the decedent which came into his hands. It confers full <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>power upon an administrator de bonis non to take possession of and administer all the unadministered assets of the decedent’s estate. It, however, does not authorize the administrator de boms non to compel delivery of possession of the assets of the estate until an account has been filed disclosing what part of the estate still remains unadministered in the hands of the former legal representative.

Letters de bonis non cum testamento annexo on Sponsler’s estate were then issued to Bobb. Bowman, as Rupp’s administrator, filed for his decedent an inventory of Sponsler’s personal estate so far as it came into Rupp’s possession. Subsequently Rupp’s administrator settled an account for his decedent as executor of Sponsler’s estate. Exceptions were filed by Sponsler’s administrator de bonis non. The auditor reported the account as filed with some few changes. The orphans’ court set aside the auditor’s report, and struck out the entire debit side of the account on the ground that no assets had come to the hands of Rupp as executor. Such action by the orphans’ court was held by this court to be clear error. In delivering the opinion, Mr. Justice Agnew said, inter alia (p. 171): “In the present case the account of the deceased executor was filed by his legal representative, and was the mode recognized by the law of ascertaining the estate which had come to his hands; yet the court struck out the whole debit side, the effect of which was to leave his estate exposed to actions at common law on the note, book account, and for the goods received. This is clearly contrary to the law which brings the settlement of such an account into the Orphans’ Court, and which does away circuity of action by giving the administrator de bonis non a direct remedy against the estate of the deceased executor for the balance remaining in his hands of the predecessor, after settlement in the Orphans’ Court.”</p>

But while the estate of the deceased administrator is liable, as he would have been if living, for what he had in his possession belonging to the estate under his care, it is entitled, as he would have been if living, to credit for all his proper disbursements and services rendered; and to settle these and ascertain the balance, an account must be stated. ... It is essential to the protection of the estate of the deceased administrator, and his sureties, that his account be finally settled before a right of action accrues against them for what he has received or reduced to his possession in his lifetime; for in this way only can they have the benefit of the credits to which his services and disbursements entitle them.” From this review of the law and procedure in such cases, it is apparent that under the facte of this case the learned court below was in error in making absolute the rule to show cause why the administrator of Sarah Wagner should not deliver the assets of the estate of James S. Wagner to his administrator de bonis non. Under the circumstances disclosed by the pleadings, the administrator of Sarah Wagner, deceased, should have filed an account for her decedent as executor of James S. Wagner’s estate. Tf he neglected or refused to file such an account the orphans’ court, upon application of the administrator de bonis non, would have compelled him to do so. The account having been filed, by this means it could have been ascertained what estate of James S. Wagner, deceased, had come into the hands of the executrix and to what extent it had been administered by her, and what was yet remaining in her hands of the estate at the time of her death. Under the act of 1834, the administrator de bonis non can recover only the estate of James S. Wagner, deceased, found to be in the hands of his executrix, unadministered, at the time of her death. Neither the decree of the court nor the petition on which it was entered discloses the assets of James S. Wagner’s estate remaining in the hands of the executrix at <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>the time of her death. Who is to determine whether there were any unadministered assets of James S. Wagner’s estate in the hands of the executrix at the time of her death? If there were such assets, what were they and what was their value? To what extent did she administer the estate? What were the expenses of administration? Did she, as executrix, sell the small amount of personal property which came into her possession, as she was authorized to do, or did it remain in specie at the time of her death? What was the value of thé personal property, was it greater or less than shown in the inventory? Were the bonds, mortgages, and judgments of the-estate collectible, and was there any loss in the collection of any of them? It must be manifest that these questions can only be answered by requiring the administrator of Sarah Wagner, deceased, to file an account for her as executrix of James S. Wagner’s estate. The orphans’ court had no authority to determine them upon the rule which was granted in this case. Such a procedure has no precedent either at common law or under any statute of the commonwealth. _ On the contrary, the statute provides how the administrator de bonis non of James S. Wagner, deceased, may proceed to ascertain what part of his decedent’s estate remained unad.ministered in the hands of the executrix at the time of the latter’s death, and only such part of the estate, if any, is he authorized to take into his possession.</p>

That was a contest between the surviving executor of a testator and the executors of 'his widow (who was not an executrix of her husband) to whom her husband’s executors had transferred all his personal estate and certain real estate. This court held that the orphans’ court could entertain a petition in the nature of a bill in equity to compel its retransfer. In the language of the opinion, the petitioner sought “the aid of the court to the executor in obtaining possession of the assets of his testator’s estate,” the title to which was admittedly in the testator and the possession of which had not been in his widow as executrix. Here," the widow was the executrix and took possession of the testa<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>tor’s estate for the purpose of administering it.
