Phillipi and its followers. In the Van Loon v. Engle case, the serious difficulty in the way of the Act of June 2, 1881, P. L. 45, was the provision of the constitution that no liens should be created or extended by a local or special law. Mr. Justice Williams wrote the opinion in the Van Loon case, and we note that he drew a clear distinction between an act which attempts to regulate the collection of taxes and one which attempts to formulate a method by which a lien for taxes may be created.

Macferron, <a href="/pa/152/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="152 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="838153" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0244-01">152 Pa. 244</a>, <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>he said, “We are asked to reverse the court below for the reason that an act relating to the collection of taxes, in a given class of cities, is local and violates sectiqn one of article IX of the constitution.

The section then provides that the township treasurer shall have all the powers and be subject to all the responsibilities that are now conferred upon or imposed upon the collectors of taxes. In other words the powers and duties of a tax collector are in no manner changed. The many acts relating to tax collectors are to remain as they now stand upon the statute books. The duties, powers and laws governing the office of tax collector remain unchanged, although the collector is called by a different name. He is elected by the same people and calling him township treasurer does not change the law as to the powers, duties and responsibilities conferred and imposed upon tax collectors by the existing laws in the various counties. If these powers and duties had not been referred to in the act of 1907, they would have devolved upon the tax collector and he would have been governed by them, no matter under what name he acted as the duly qualified collector. “No act can be rendered unconstitutional by a section which makes no change whatever in the law as it was before, and which might have been omitted without any effect whatever,” Knisely v.

The act then before the court substituted in certain counties the office of county controller for that of county auditor. Section 15 of said act provided, “All the duties devolved on the county auditors by the Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 537, and all powers conferred on them by said act shall be performed and exercised by the county controller.” Here powers and duties are conferred by reference to the date of a certain act. The title is not given and of course the powers conferred are not re-enacted and published. Among other things the court said, “The fifteenth section of the act of 1895 is not a revival, amendment, extension or conferring of the provisions of the act of April 15, 1834, so as to bring it within the prohibition of section 6 of article III of the constitution. It makes no change in the duties of the office, but merely in the name of the officer by whom they are to be performed. If the act had provided 'the officer now known as the county auditor shall hereafter in all counties having one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants and over, be called the county controller, and shall in addition to the duties and powers of said officer have the following,’ then enumerating the new duties and powers .covered by the act, its effect would have been precisely the .same, and yet it could hardly have been contended that it was unconstitutional for not re-enacting at length all the provisions of the act of 1834.” The act of 1885 creating the office of tax collector has the same provision, and this act <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>was before the Supreme Court again and again and its constitutionality was never successfully attacked.</p>

The county treasurer was elected in November, 1907, and the triennial election for constable was held in February, 1908, so that the persons who would be affected by the act of 1907 were elected after the passage of the act. They knew that if the act prevailed the township treasurers would receive the tax duplicates for 1909. The respective terms of the township tax collectors in office, when the act of 1907 was passed, expired before the taxes for 1908 became collectible. The act of 1907, gave full notice that it would go into effect as soon as the collectors in office had fulfilled their respective terms.</p>

That he would not receive the duplicates for townships of the first class for the year 1909 was fixed in 1907, before his election to office in that year. There was no contingency as to the time when the act of 1907 should go into effect. In this respect the case differs from that cited by the defendant’s counsel, Guldin v. Schuylkill County, <a href="/pa/149/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="149 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="832541" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0210-01">149 Pa. 210</a>. The county passed into the class having a population of 150,000, but when that condition should arise no one could positively state at the time the coroner was elected. At least no census had determined that the county entered the higher class and the federal census was the method by which the fact must be ascertained. There was in that case “an agreed consideration” that the compensation should continue as prescribed, at the time the coroner accepted his office. In our case no such agreement can be urged, for the county treasurer was informed that his salary or compensation was fixed at different basis for 1909 from that which prevailed in 1908 and this notice he had prior to his election.</p>

When our legislature enacts general laws to secure uniform procedure and to displace local legislation, courts should not be over astute to defeat the purpose.

This was made the more emphatic by a specific declaration that no taxes shall be collected in any township of the first class save only by the treasurer of the said township. The act of 1909 now attempts to strike down this general provision that all local laws are repealed, by declaring that the county treasurers shall continue to collect state and county taxes wherever by existing laws such duties and powers were conferred upon him.</p>

The terms of the tax collectors throughout the state expired on the first Monday of April, 1909. It was then that the act of 1907, according to its terms, went into effect. The act of 1909 was not passed until a month later. There was no general act giving to county treasurers the right to collect taxes. If there was any such general act it was repealed by the act of 1885. That act <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>repealed all general acts inconsistent with its provisions, but saved all local acts. So far, therefore, as the act of 1909 attempted to restore to county treasurers the powers of a tax collector it attempted to revive a local law. The act of 1907 was a general law as already shown. We may call the act of 1909 an amendment, but the name cannot disguise the fact that it is a partial repeal of the general act of 1907 whereby a local act is indirectly enacted contrary to the provisions of the seventh section of article III of the constitution.</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[183,854,1153,1236]]]'>There was no existing law on May 1, 1909, giving to county treasurers the power to collect state and county taxes. Prior to 1907 there was a local act in Montgomery county to that effect. There was a similar local act in the county of Allegheny. These were the only counties having townships of the first class and local acts giving to the county treasurer the right to collect state and county taxes. If we give effect to the act of 1909, we have the two local laws restored, one for Montgomery and one for Allegheny. There wás no power in the legislature to enact such special laws, without publication. If we sustain the act of 1909 then the legislature may do indirectly what it cannot do directly. It is said that the amendment of 1909 speaks as of the day when the act of 1907 was passed. This no doubt is true so far as the amendment speaks within legislative authority. But this rule cannot be invoked to defeat the constitution itself. A rule of interpretation of statutory enactments which sustains local legislation in conflict with the seventh section of article III of the constitution must give way to the mandates of the constitution. “Existing laws,” as used in the act of 1909, must mean existing at the time of the passage of the act of 1909. This was the interpretation given to a similar amendment in Webster v. State, 82 S. W. Repr. 179 (Tenn.).</p>
