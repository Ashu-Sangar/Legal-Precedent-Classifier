A lease of cars was for one year with a privilege to the lessees to cancel at the expiration of four months by giving notice. The rental was $5.00 per car per day. The cars were to be returned to the lessors at the expiration of the lease in as good condition as when received, “ ordinary wear and tear in the service for which said cars are leased, excepted.” Other repairs and replacements were to be made by the lessees. The lessees exercised their option to terminate the lease at the end of four months, and notified the lessors to that effect, stating that the cars would be delivered on a certain day “when rental of same will cease.” The lessors insisted on certain repairs being made, and the lessees made the repairs, all of the cars remaining in their possession <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>in the meantime. In an action to recover rentals for the cars after the date of the tender under a covenant of the lease whereby rentals were to be paid for detention of the cars after the termination of the lease the trial judge charged that if the repairs were merely those made necessary from ordinary wear and tear, the lessees although having made the repairs by mistake would not be liable for the rental. There was evidence that the defects were merely from ordinary wear and tear. <em>Held, </em>that a verdict and judgment for defendants should be sustained.</p>

The claim in suit is for the rental of certain cars leased by the plaintiffs to the defendants under a contract of lease between them dated January 23, 1905. The claim is for rental of the cars after the expiration of the lease on July 9,1905, during the progress of certain repairs which were being made to the cars. It is the uncontradicted evidence that the defendants paid to the Knickerbocker Trust Company, standing for both plaintiffs, on or about July 20, 1905, after the lease expired, $1,080, by the defendants’ check, upon which it was stated that the same was in full payment of contract dated January 23, 1905, and that the said Knickerbocker Trust Company received and used said check without any claim at the time that the'same was not in bill payment of all claims and demands for rentals under said contract. The said receipt of said check, under the circumstances, is prima facie evidence of full settlement, and satisfaction of all demands by the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>plaintiffs against the defendants for rentals under the contract in suit; and the burden is upon the plaintiffs of explaining said receipt, and of showing why it is not controlling against them. <em>Answer: </em>That point is affirmed.

    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[268,554,1176,1287]]]'>2. By the contract in suit the defendants obligated themselves to replace, at their own expense, any and all parts of the cars which might be destroyed during the term of the lease, with like material of equal quality, value, character and construction to the parts destroyed. They at the same time bound themselves, upon the expiration or other termination of (the lease, to return the cars in as good condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear in the service for which the cars were leased, excepted. The above provisions of the lease, interpreted in harmony with each other, mean that the defendants were not obliged to make repairs to the cars after the expiration of the lease, if their condition at that time was due to ordinary wear and tear in the service for which said cars . were leased; and if any parts of the cars were destroyed during the term of the lease due only to ordinary wear and tear in the service for which the said cars were leased, the defendants were not obliged to replace said parts after the expiration of the lease. If, therefore, the jury believes that,, after the expiration of the lease, the cars needed certain replacements of parts destroyed, and certain repairs, but that, the necessity for these replacements of parts and these repairs was due only to ordinary wear and tear in the service for which the cars were leased, they will find a verdict for the defendants. <em>Answer: </em>That point is affirmed.

W. &amp; B. Railroad tracks at Farnhurst, the place named in the contract for their delivery, “where they will be subject to your orders.” The lessors replied to the telegram: “Do not deliver cars to P.

Hold them for inspection your tracks Farnhurst.” At the same time they wrote to the lessees, saying, inter alia: “We have, therefore, to request that you hold the cars on your track at Farnhurst pending the result of the joint inspection, after which we can furnish you shipping instructions.” It was agreed that the cars should go out of service on July 9, 1905.</p>

    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[316,784,1157,420]]]'>The lessors contended that the single issue in the case was whether the lessees were required to pay rent for the leased cars after the expiration of the lease so long as they remained in the possession of the lessees as required in covenant second of the contract, and that the question whether or not the lessees were obliged to make repairs was immaterial and was not an issue in the case. The lessors, the plaintiffs, therefore, claimed they were entitled to binding instructions.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[301,1215,1172,1178]],["BL_285.1",285,[174,353,1150,362]]]'>The theory on which the court below tried the cause was that the lessors were required to accept the cars when tendered on July 9, if the repairs were only such as resulted from the ordinary wear and tear while in the lessees’ service and, failing to do so, the latter were not responsible for rentals for their detention while the repairs were being made. The court, therefore, submitted to the jury to find the character of the repairs necessary to be made at the termination of the lease on July 9, and instructed them that if they resulted from the ordinary wear and tear of the cars in the lessees’ service during the lease there could be no recovery, but that the plaintiffs were entitled to a verdict if the repairs and replacements were such as the lessees were required to make. As said above, covenant second must be construed in connection with the other stipulations in the contract, and when so interpreted the learned trial judge cannot be convicted of error in his view of the agreement. The question of fact was; of course, for the jury, -and was properly submitted. Notwithstanding the fact that the lessees made the repairs, there was ample evidence to justify the jury in finding that they were not such as the lessees were required to make under the contract. There was no reason for the lessors refusing to accept the cars on July 9, <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>unless the lessees had failed to make the repairs required by the contract. The lease was at an end, and the balance of the rentals due on the day the cars went out of service was secure. Under the finding of the jury, the tender of the cars by the lessees should have been accepted by the lessors, and hence the action to recover the rentals for the cars since the expiration of the lease cannot be maintained.</p>
    <p id="b285-4" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[174,733,1154,1547]]]'>We discover no error in the admission of testimony. It is insisted that the check should not have been admitted in evidence.

The plaintiffs’ statement, as noted above, avers that the sum claimed in this action is for “rentals” under the contract, and hence the contract as construed by the plaintiffs does not make the distinction, suggested in the plaintiffs’ supplemental brief, between the “rental” to be paid for the use of the cars and the “compensation” to be paid for their detention after the term. The check containing the statement that the rentals due on the contract were paid in full was, in the absence of any explanation by the plaintiffs, evidence tending to show an admission that all the rentals accruing under the contract were paid, including those in suit. The check was given eleven days and appropriated sixteen days after the expiration of the term, and ten days after it was agreed the replacements and repairs should be made, and after two of the cars had been received by the plaintiffs for which rentals are sought to be recovered in tin's action. When the check was used on July 25, the lessors knew that there had then been a delay of sixteen days in delivering the cars, and that the necessary time for repairs would require their further detention, and hence the use of the check, stating on its face to be in full payment of the contract, was, unexplained, in the nature of an admission as of that date that all claims on the contract for rentals were satisfied.</p>
