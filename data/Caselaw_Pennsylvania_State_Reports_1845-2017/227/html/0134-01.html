    <p id="ARH" data-blocks='[["BL_167.8",167,[211,884,1155,800]]]'>While it is true that the trust is for the sole and separate use of the daughters, and that, so far as Eliza H. Elliott is concerned, it is void in that she was neither married nor in immediate contemplation of marriage at the time of the making of the will, yet the income is, in express terms, given her for life only. Upon her death, the principal goes to her children, if she leaves any her surviving; if not, to her remaining brothers and sisters, and the issue of any then deceased; with the right of disposing of her part by will if she dies unmarried. One of the objects of the trust is, of course, to exclude a possible husband, either during the life of the wife or after her death, but this is not the only purpose, and the auditing judge was clearly right in refusing to decree it terminated (see Boyd's Est., No. 1, <a href="/pa/199/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="199 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="922742" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0487-01">199 Pa. 487</a>); for, until the death of Mrs. Elliott, it is impossible to tell who will be entitled to the corpus. ’</p>

In the former, a fund arising from a sale of real estate in partition was before the court for distribution. Brown had given his residuary estate to a granddaughter, for her sole and separate use, and “the main question argued,” according to Mr. Chief Justice Mercur, who delivered the opinion of the court, was whether she was entitled to her share or whether it was payable to a trustee for her. She was not married nor in immediate contemplation of marriage at the time of the execution of her grandfather’s will, though she was married at the <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>time of his decease. It was held that the separate use was void. The will did provide that if she died without issue, the devise should go to testator’s “legal heirs”; but an “indefinite failure” was evidently contemplated, and, the separate use being out of the way, the fee, so far as real estate was concerned, vested in her. This phase of the case was taken for granted, since it was not alluded to either in the arguments of counsel or in the opinion of the court.</p>

At the time of the audit she was forty years of age, and, as she was unmarried and not immediately contemplating marriage with any given person when the will was made, her share was awarded to her in her own right.</p>
