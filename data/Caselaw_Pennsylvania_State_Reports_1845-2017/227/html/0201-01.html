Where an employee is guilty of acts of disobedience and of being somewhat under the influence of liquor, but the employer continues him in his employment for a year and a half after the last disobedience of orders and for nearly two years from the time of the alleged intoxication, the employer will be presumed to have condoned the offenses and cannot allege them as grounds for the discharge of the employee.</p>

The plaintiff employed a man named Tupper as a driller on the work on the Wanamaker building during the fall of 1904. At that time the defendant company had discharged Tupper, who had previously been working in the Pittsburg district. The plaintiff was aware of this discharge, and that the company had notified him not to re-employ Tupper; and in making this appointment the plaintiff violated the instructions given him by the company.</p>

The plaintiff was on several occasions, while working upon the Wanamaker building, late in his arrival at the work, getting there at 8 o’clock instead of 7:30. On these occasions his lateness was due to the fact that he had stopped at the office of the company for other business in connection with the company’s work. There were subforemen and timekeepers on the work, however, and the effect of his lateness was not to delay the commencement of the work until his arrival, it being stalled in his absence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[210,1067,1156,583]]]'>9. The plaintiff was on two occasions while on the work upon the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, in Philadelphia, somewhat under the influence of liquor. One of these was the instance narrated by himself, when he had attended the funeral of a friend; but it does not appear that at that time he appeared at his work under the influence of liquor. The other occasion was in the evening of a working day at a test made of one of the elevators of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel then in process of construction. On this occasion the plaintiff, while perceptibly under the influence of liquor, operated and tested the elevator for some considerable time during the evening.</p>

On February 2, 1906, while the plaintiff was engaged in superintending the elevator construction of the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City, he was requested by Spellman, the plumbing contractor for the Knickerbocker Hotel construction, to use the men and appliances of the Standard Plunger Elevator Company for the purpose of lowering into the basement of the building a pump which Spellman was to use in his work. Plaintiff used for this purpose, six men who were then in the employ of the defendant company, the work being begun at 1 o’clock in the afternoon and continued until 10 o’clock that night. Four of the men so used worked during the afternoon hours, which time would otherwise have been devoted to the defendant’s service, and all six worked in the evening. The main part of the rigging, ropes and tackle used <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>for this purpose were the property of Spellman, the plumbing contractor. For this work the plaintiff received from Spellman the sum of $40.00, of which he used $26.00 in paying the six men who had worked under him, and retained $14.00 for himself. The plaintiff then turned into the company, for the purpose of having it recorded upon the time sheet, information which charged the company with eight hours, or a full day’s work for each of the six men so employed. On the following morning the plaintiff, before he was aware that any complaint was made by the defendant company, came to the defendant’s timekeeper and directed the erasure of the figures showing full time on the time sheet and the insertion of the correct figures.</p>

By the contract of employment, the plaintiff agreed that he “would not engage in or become interested in any other business or calling which would require his personal attendance during business hours, and would not engage in any business, calling or enterprise which is or may be contrary to the welfare, interest or benefit of the business” of the defendant. The referee does not regard the language “business or calling” as covering the work which the plaintiff did in lowering the pump, this being a single specific act, and in no sense the undertaking of any “business or calling.” The remaining language above quoted includes the word “enterprise”; but a fair construction of the whole language would seem to be that it referred to some permanent occupation or employment which might be prejudicial to the interest of the defendant company, either by the plaintiff being employed in a competing business or by his employment in a business which would take away from the defendant his services for a large portion of the working hours which he should have devoted to the defendant’s interests. It does not appear to the referee that any language of the contract covers a mere solitary instance of a few hours’ work for the benefit of a fellow contractor. However, such an act might possibly be regarded as a breach of the contract which would justify the plaintiff’s discharge, since it is scarcely conceivable that the plaintiff could, with propriety, engage in an operation of this character in which he not only gave his own services, but used the services of men in the defendant’s employ, unless he had received permission to do <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>this from the defendant company itself. No such permission was ever asked for. The referee, however, is of the opinion that under the authorities above cited, the fact that the plaintiff was not discharged by the defendant until over a month later, when the plaintiff’s violation of his duty had been known to him the day after its occurrence, would indicate a waiver of whatever breach the plaintiff might have committed and a condonation of the offense. One month’s delay without explanation thereof would seem to be an unreasonable time to wait before exercising the right to discharge after an offense of this character. The insertion of it as a reason for discharge in the letters written dismissing the plaintiff, seemed to be more or less of an afterthought.</p>

If his acts of disobedience and his intoxication constituted causes for his discharge, they were clearly condoned by the appellant by continuing him in its employ for a year and a half after his last refusal to obey an order and for nearly two years from the time he was somewhat under the influence of liquor while at work. If the use of the defendant’s men on February 2, 1906, to assist another contractor gave the appellant the right to discharge the appellee, the learned referee has found that the right was waived and in so holding says: ‘'The fact that the plaintiff was not discharged by the defendant until over a month later, when the plaintiff’s violation of his duty had been known to them the day after its occurrence, would indicate a waiver of whatever breach the plaintiff might have committed and a condonation of the offense.
