    <p class="summary" id="b321-7" data-blocks='[["BL_321.7",321,[192,896,1154,1125]]]'>Campbell’s Est., <a href="/pa/202/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="202 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="992293" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0459-01">202 Pa. 459</a>, was not intended to change the well-settled principle of interpretation that in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention afforded by the will itself a gift to “children” will not be understood as including any more remote class of descendants. The will in that case gave vested estates to the children of the first takers, a daughter of the testator, subject to a limitation over to his other “children,” per stirpes, if she should die without leaving “ children ”; and as conditions subsequent, terminating a vested estate, are construed most strongly in favor of the first taker and against forfeiture, and if in any permissible sense of the words of the condition there has been no breach, that view will be adopted by the court, it was held that the gift to the other children of the testator did not take effect if a grandchild of the daughter survived her. The will in the present case differs most radically from that in Campbell’s Estate. The estate of those entitled at the termination of the life estate is contingent, purely. The gift is to the “children” of the first taker, living at the time of his death; and being his “child” is no less an integral part of the description of the person then becoming entitled than is the fact of being then alive.</p>
