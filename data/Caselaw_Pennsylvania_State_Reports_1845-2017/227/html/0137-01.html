The deceased was, and had been <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>for three months, employed by the Black Diamond Coal Company. The yard of this company fronts upon the Schuylkill river north of South street bridge and is intersected by the tracks of the Baltimore <em>&amp; </em>Ohio Railroad Company, part of the coal company’s yard being on the westerly or riverside and another part on the easterly side of the railroad tracks. From the part of the yard on the riverside to the part on the easterly side of the tracks a crossing was constructed by planking between the rails. This crossing is about ten feet in width and crosses the tracks diagonally in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction. At the point of the accident there are four tracks, the easterly and westerly tracks being sidings and used for freight purposes, while the two intermediate tracks are used for the general traffic of the road. The distance between the rails of each track is four feet, eight and one-half inches; while the distance between the tracks, measured parallel with the crossing, is eight feet, and measured along the crossing, at right angles to the rails, this distance is seven feet, three inches.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[332,1377,1159,636]]]'>The yard of the Black Diamond Coal Company on the westerly side of the track is inclosed by a board fence with a gate opening opposite the crossing at a distance of twenty-five and one-half feet from the westernmost rail of the westerly track. At the time of the accident, shortly after midday of February 22, 1906, the weather was clear and bright. William Hamilton was engaged in carrying railroad ties from the westernmost part of the coal company's yard across the railroad tracks to that portion of the. yard on the easterly side. These ties he carried upon his shoulder, one at a time, and had safely crossed the tracks and deposited two or three ties in the yard on the easterly side, before the accident.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[332,2024,1161,367]],["BL_171.1",171,[159,348,1152,466]]]'>When the accident occurred he had passed from the yard of the coal company on the westerly side of the track with a tie (on his right shoulder, according to the plaintiff’s witness, and on his left shoulder, according to the defendant’s witnesses), the end of which protruded for about two feet in front of him; he had walked across the westerly or' side track, across the intervening space between it and the south-bound <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>track, and when just about to step upon the south-bound track he was struck by the corner of the tender of defendant’s engine then running backward in a southerly direction. Whether the tender struck his body or head, or whether it struck only the tie which in turn struck Hamilton, is not entirely clear under the evidence. From the contact with the engine, however, he was thrown a distance of some twenty to thirty feet and injured in such a way that he died shortly afterwards.</p>
    <p id="b171-3" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[159,888,1157,1288]]]'>The evidence in this case clearly demonstrates that the proper place to have stopped, looked and listened for an approaching train was on emerging from between the freight cars standing upon the siding, which were known or -must have been known to the deceased to have been idle cars in no danger of moving. If he had stopped, as he could well and safely have stopped, at a point five and one-half feet west of the track on which the engine approached, after crossing the siding, he would have had an unobstructed view of the track for a distance of 1,870 feet; had he stopped at a point six feet back from the track on which the engine approached he would have had a view of the track for a distance of 392 feet, and at a distance of seven feet back from this track he would have had a view of ninety-two feet. At any one of these points the deceased could have stopped with perfect safety to himself. The evidence all goes to indicate that until he approached within a distance of eight feet of the track his view of the approaching engine would have been for a distance of less than ninety-five feet. The testimony of plaintiff’s witness, Ross, clearly shows that Hamilton did not stop after emerging from between the freight cars and coming within his line of vision, but that he walked forward until the tender of the engine struck him or the tie which he was carrying upon his shoulder.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[163,2186,1153,204]],["BL_172.1",172,[323,353,1182,961]]]'>The evidence of the defendant’s witnesses, Divine and Ward, also shows conclusively that from the time Hamilton emerged from the coal company’s yard on the westerly side of the railroad, a distance of twenty-five feet from the track <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>' on which he was struck, he did not stop, but walked forward with his head down, with a tie on his left shoulder, and apparently without looking to the left or to the right, until going upon or about to step upon the south-bound track, where he was struck and killed. It is, therefore, evident that the deceased did that which an ordinarily prudent man would not have done, that he did not exercise ordinary care under the circumstances. He had been working at this place for months, and was thoroughly familiar with the surroundings and conditions there existing. It was clearly his duty to have stopped before reaching the south-bound track, at a point where he could have had a view of the approaching train, and could have heard it had he listened, and this he could.safely have done either upon the side track or at a point between the two tracks where he could have stopped in perfect safety. That he did not do so is clear not only from the evidence but from the fact that he was struck by the tender of the engine either before or immediately after stepping upon the track.</p>

He would then have had a view of the train for a considerable distance in the direction from which the engine came. His unfortunate mistake was in not looking then. In answer to the question whether if he had stopped and looked before stepping on the north track he could have avoided the collision he truthfully answered in the affirmative.”</p>

It prevails in the absence of direct testimony upon the subject, but it may be rebutted by proof of facts and circumstances, as well as by direct evidence.

Penna. R. R.

Having arrived at this conclusion it becomes unnecessary for us to consider the question of negligence on the part of the defendant or the question of whether the defendant or the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company would be liable, if either.</p>
