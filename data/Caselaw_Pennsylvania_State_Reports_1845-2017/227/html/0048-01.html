Upon the death of Charles Mehaffey, the trustee was to hold the farm, exclusive of the coal mentioned for the use of his wife, Elizabeth, upon the same uses and terms, and without any liability for any debts which she may contract; upon the marriage or death of Elizabeth Mehaffey, the trustee was to hold the farm, exclusive of the coal, for the use and benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of Charles Mehaffey, their heirs and assigns. The will also authorized and empowered the executors of testator to sell and dispose of the coal underlying his farms in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, and reserved as above stated, as soon after his death as in the judgment of the trustee full and fair prices can be had for the same, the proceeds of such sale to be disposed of in accordance with the instructions contained in the will.</p>

Harry W. Hammer, one of the defendants, is the son of Elizabeth Mehaffey by a former <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>husband, and a half-brother of the remainder-men named above.</p>

This bill was filed April 22,1907, against Elizabeth Mehaffey as executrix and sole devisee of Charles Mehaffey, and Elizabeth Mehaffey, and Harry W. Hammer, James Mehaffey, Frank Mehaffey and Clyde Mehaffey, partners doing business as Mehaffey Brothers, and W. H. Hammer, manager. About sixteen years ago and during his lifetime, Charles Mehaffey made a verbal contract with Harry W. Hammer, one of the defendants, whereby the latter was to open a coal mine on the farm west of the center line of the Township road, and to mine and sell the coal therefrom, and pay to Iris stepfather a royalty of one cent per bushel for clean coal, and three-fourths of a cent per bushel for run-of-mine coal, Charles Mehaffey to find timber for pit-posts, and Hammer to pay for making them. Under this contract a mine was opened and Hammer from time to time took out and sold approximately six and one-half acres of coal, the greater part of which was taken out more than six years ago, and the total amount mined aggregated about 625,000 bushels. Such timber as was required for pit-posts in the mine was cut on the farm, the amount taken aggregating about five acres, worth $60.00 per acre.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[318,1544,1157,204]]]'>7. Charles Mehaffey built and constructed at the mouth of the pit, a platform and weigh-shanty, and Hammer constructed a tipple. These buildings have been reconstructed from time to time, and remain upon the property.</p>

The mining of the coal and cutting of timber was done openly, and so far as Hammer was concerned was done in good faith without knowledge on his part that Charles Mehaffey did not own the farm and coal, and he accounted to Mehaffey for all coal mined and paid him therefor, and has not made any payment on account of mining such coal, to either the trustee or any of the remainder-men. The fact that coal was being mined from the farm was known to James Evans, trustee, who made no objection. The mining was also known to the children of Charles Mehaffey, all of whom, with the exception of James Mehaffey, and Sarah Taylor, worked in the mine and cut timber from the farm for use in .the mine. <em>No </em>objection <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>was made by anyone to the coal being mined and sold, nor was any demand made upon Hammer for an accounting, until November 27, 1905, when the following notice was served on him:</p>

On February 6, 1905, Hammer purchased from Charles Mehaffey about two and one-fourth acres of the Mehaffey coal lying west of the center line of the Township road, for the consideration of $1,200 and received a deed therefore, made by Mehaffey and his wife, Elizabeth, dated February 6, 1905, and recorded May 10, 1905, the consideration being paid to Charles Mehaffey in full by Hammer. Subsequently, Hammer took out from this tract, twenty-seven wagon loads of coal, and on receipt of the notice of November 23, 1905, immediately ceased operations in any of the Mehaffey coal, and consulted his attorney who advised him not to mine further. From the date of that notice, Hammer did not mine or remove any of the Mehaffey coal, nor has any of it been mined since that time by any other person.</p>
    <p id="b83-14" data-blocks='[["BL_83.15",83,[177,2301,1155,98]],["BL_84.1",84,[304,361,1158,1229]]]'>10. In 1901, Hammer purchased the Hickman coal, which adjoins the Mehaffey coal, and thereupon began mining and <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>removing the same through the entry of the Mehaffey mine, and continued to do so until the bill in this case was filed, whereupon he ceased to use the Mehaffey entry and opened another entry through which he removed the Hickman coal without entering upon the Mehaffey coal or using the entry through it. The Hickman coal was an abandoned mine at the time at which Hammer purchased it. After obtaining the coal, Hammer made several openings connecting the Mehaffey mine with the Hickman.mine. The Hickman coal lay higher than the Mehaffey coal, which caused water gathered in the Hickman mine to percolate through the coal in place on the dividing line between the two farms, into the Mehaffey mine. To avoid such accumulation of water and prevent it flowing into the Mehaffey mine, Hammer at an expense of $400 constructed an outlet by tunneling from a water course into which the Mehaffey mine drained, thus providing a drain through winch the water of both mines was carried off. The roofs of two of the rooms of the Mehaffey mine from which the coal has been removed, have fallen in, rendering access to these rooms impossible except to a short distance. With this exception the mine is in fairly good condition and could be made fit for working within a few days by the expenditure of a very small sum of money.</p>
    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[303,1602,1158,800]],["BL_85.1",85,[193,382,1150,476]]]'>11. The testimony of plaintiff indicated that there were depressions upon the surface of the Mehaffey farm at certain points where the coal had been removed, that at the time the bill in this case was filed, the wall of the barn had fallen down in part, and the barn had moved a few inches on its foundation, and also that the fences upon the farm were not in good condition, and that fences separating fields had been removed. As respects the depression, they showed themselves on the surface a number of years ago during the lifetime of Charles Mehaffey. The surface on and over all of the depressions, with one exception, is susceptible to cultivation and had been cultivated. With respect to the depression not cultivated, the testimony showed that it could be plowed over at any time and made tillable. The break in the wall of the barn has been properly repaired by Elizabeth Mehaffey, the life tenant, and <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>the barn straightened, so that it is at the present time in good condition. The fencing at the present time is also in good condition. While it is true one or two fences separating fields have been removed, such removal became necessary in the working of the farm, and cannot be considered waste, the testimony indicating that the change in the lines of fields was for the advantage of the farm. The present condition of the farm is good and equal to the general condition of farms of like character in that neighborhood.</p>
    <p id="b85-3" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[192,870,1152,259]]]'>12. None of the defendants had anything to do with, or are liable for the cutting of timber from the farm, or the mining of coal from it, or the depressions resulting therefrom, except Harry W. Hammer. Nor did any of them, except Elizabeth Mehaffey, have anything to do with the permissive waste.</p>
    <p id="b85-4" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[192,1141,1152,205]]]'>13. In 1891, Harry W. Hammer was twenty-seven years of age, and John Mehaffey, Charles Mehaffey and Joseph Mehaffey, three of the remainder-men were all minors, their ages being respectively fourteen, twelve and nine years.</p>

    <p id="b85-6" data-blocks='[["BL_85.7",85,[189,1465,1155,960]],["BL_86.1",86,[295,371,1160,1500]]]'>The bill asks that defendants be restrained from further operating the mine on the Mehaffey farm and mining coal therefrom and also asks that they be compelled to account for the coal taken therefrom under the verbal contract with Charles Mehaffey, the life tenant. There seems to be no necessity for an injunction as the bill shows that no mining has been done on the premises since November 23, 1905, and the answer and testimony show that none will be done in the future. Under these facts a case for equitable relief is not made out in this respect. As to plaintiffs’ right to an accounting in this proceeding, we are of opinion they have not shown such conditions as to entitle them to have the amount, if any, due them ascertained here. That matter seems to us to be clearly a matter for determination in an action at law. The account is a mere matter of charge with no entries on the other side, at least none shown by the testimony now before us. Under these circumstances defendants are, in our opinion, entitled to have that matter settled according to the rules of law, and <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>especially is such the case under the circumstances here, where the death of Charles Mehaffey, the statute of limitations, the laches of plaintiff and also the relations existing between the parties at the time will have a great if not a controlling bearing upon the controversy. As we view the case, there is very little equity in favor of plaintiff. Hammer, the real defendant, acted in good faith in making the contract with his stepfather for taking out the coal, and in preparing to do so he was assisted if not controlled by his stepfather. And after the mine was open, he gave employment from time to time to all his stepbrothers, the remainder-men, except one, and he paid to his stepfather- a fair and reasonable price for every ton of coal mined. The trustee and several of the remainder-men, who have been of age for many years stood by and without objection permitted defendant to take out the coal and make payments to Charles Mehaffey during his lifetime, and now that the life tenant is dead and many years have intervened since the waste complained of was committed, if there is any advantage to defendant by a proceeding at law, he is entitled to that benefit. While we are of opinion that the bill might be dismissed without detriment to plaintiff, we will retain it, with leave to plaintiff to move for an injunction should defendants at any time disregard their avowed intentions not to further mine coal from the premises. The prayer for an accounting is refused, without prejudice, however, to plaintiff to institute and prosecute any proceedings at law they may deem necessary to recover any sum or sums that may be due them on account of the injury complained of in the bill.</p>
