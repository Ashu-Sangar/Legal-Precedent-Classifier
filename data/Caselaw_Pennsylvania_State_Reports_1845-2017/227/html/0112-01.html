The confession, of the defendant is not sufficient in itself to convict, unless there are such intrinsic, corroborative circumstances proved, as will when taken into connection with the confession, establish the prisoner’s guilt in the minds of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Answer: </em>This point we refuse. If the corpus delicti, that is, the crime itself, that is, the actual killing of Alfred Hallman, is proven to your satisfaction, and you believe the confessions made by the defendant that he was one of the parties who took part in the robbery, or planned the robbery, that he was at the house, and there is <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>no other testimony to show it, that of itself would be sufficient to convict the defendant, and that statement of his would need no corroboration to justify you in such conviction.

It is not the law in Pennsylvania that a person cannot be convicted upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, though it is the duty of the court to caution the jury that such testimony should be taken with allowance. But the question does not arise in this case, as Paul Fornwalt has not testified at all, and what he said in the presence of the defendant at the police station on February 3, and which was testified to you by Mr. Eshleman, the stenographer, does little, if anything, to connect the defendant with the offense charged, and the defendant has affirmed that some at least of what was said in that statement was true.

Fornwalt made a confession in the presence of the defendant, in which he (the defendant) was charged with having been one of the parties to conceive and commit the offense charged in this case. The defendant was at perfect liberty to speak, even though he was in custody, and he did so. In speaking, however, he did not deny the truth of what Fornwalt said, but said that what he said about the whisky was true, and then gave his version of the whole affair, which confirmed much of what had been said by Fornwalt in his presence. Under such circumstances we do not think that the objection to the admission of Fornwalt’s statement can be seriously made.</p>

In deciding this point the chief question is, whether the inducement held out was calculated to make the confession an untrue one. If not, it will be admissible: Wh. C. L. 318; Arch. C. P. (9th ed.) 110; 2 Rus. C. L. 845; Rex v. Thomas, 7 C. &amp; P. 345. This is a question of fact to be determined, in the first instance, by the court.” This is followed in Com. v.

Both statements- agree in all particulars, though the one made in the morning was more full. There was no evidence to show that any threat or inducement was made to lead him to make a false confession. On the other hand, it was testified that none had been, but that the confessions were voluntary, and, in addition, he was told in the evening, that no one present had any authority to hold out to him any promise that he would not have to suffer the penalty for his connection with the affair. He hesitated a moment, and then made a statement of his connection with it, and followed it up the next morning with another to the same effect, stating some things that were omitted in the one of the evening before.</p>

If afterwards the defendant testifies, or produces other witnesses who testify, that it was not voluntarily made, it becomes a question for the jury, and the court must tell the jury that they must reject it if they do not believe, from all the testimony, that it was made voluntarily: Com. v.

We can add nothing of value by further discussion of the same questions raised here.
