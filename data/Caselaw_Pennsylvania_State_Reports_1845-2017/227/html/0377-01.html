So to hold, we would be obliged to declare that a number of similar statutes are void by parity of reason. The extent and limitation of what is known as police power, has been a fruitful subject of discussion in the appellate courts of nearly every state in the union. It is universally conceded to include everything essential to the public safety, health and morals and to justify the destruction or abatement by summary proceedings of whatever may be regarded as a public nuisance, and wherever the public interests demand it, a large discretion is necessarily vested in the legislature <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>to determine not only what the interests and the public require, but what measures are necessary for the protection of such interests: Barbier v.

The duty of preserving the fish and game of a state from extinction, by prohibiting exhaustive methods of taking it, or the use of destructive instruments as are likely to result in the extermination of the young as well as the mature, is as clear as its power to secure to its citizens, as far as possible, a supply of any other wholesome food: Lawton v. Steele, <a href="/us/152/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="152 U.S. 133" data-case-ids="3574181" data-case-paths="/us/152/0133-01">152 U. S. 133</a> (14 Sup. Ct. Repr. 499). It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, integrity and patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt: Ogden v. Saunders, <a href="/us/25/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="25 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="1429818" data-case-paths="/us/25/0213-01">25 U. S. 213</a>. A reasonable doubt must be solved in favor of the legislative action and the act be sustained: Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (7th ed.), 253. When the legislature has considered the question and passed upon it, this makes a prima facie case in the law: Com. v. Vrooman, <a href="/pa/164/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="164 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="860288" data-case-paths="/pa/164/0306-01">164 Pa. 306</a>. It must be manifest that the legislative department has overstepped the boundaries marked by the constitution before the courts are justified in nullifying the statute. The legislature comes direct from the people, and by its enactment gives expression to the popular will. This will so expressed, is the law of the land, except where the constitution unquestionably forbids it: Com. v. Darmska, <a href="/pa-super/35/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="35 Pa. Super. 580" data-case-ids="872701" data-case-paths="/pa-super/35/0580-01">35 Pa.

The test as to whether the police power is validly exercised, is whether the enactment has relation to the public welfare, and it has been deemed of sufficient importance to justify the legislatures of practically all cf our states, to enact laws for the protection and preservation of game, and we <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>have seen no case which challenges this as a legislative right, clearly within the exercise of the police power.</p>

The automatic gun mentioned in this act is described as “one that is fired from the shoulder, and the recoil developed by the exploded cartridge, ejects the shell, cocks the hammer, and feeds in a fresh cartridge from a magazine into the chamber of the gun,” so that all that is required to discharge it is to pull the trigger. It is not necessary to justify the wisdom of the legislative enactment; the whole question has so frequently been the subject of discussion in the legislature and courts, that we must accept it as a result of their deliberations, that <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>an automatic gun is not a proper weapon for the killing of game, within this commonwealth. Nor are the courts concerned about a technical though trifling interference with the pleasure of a hunter, or the property interest of a gun maker in deciding a question of public interest and welfare.
