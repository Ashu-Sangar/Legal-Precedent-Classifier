The <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>widow died on June 26, 1906. Administration d. b. n. c. t. a. was taken out on the estate of Charles D. Freeman after his widow’s death. The administratrices filed an account which was confirmed absolutely on January 16, 1909. Between the date of the death of the widow and the date of the audit, May 15, 1908, a large amount of income had accrued. The court distributed one-third of the principal to the executors of the widow, but awarded all of the income to the children of the decedent.</p>

In making the decree of distribution one-third of the principal was awarded to the estate of the widow, but for some reason which does not appear in either of the opinions filed by the court below, none of the accumulations of income were awarded to her estate. Proper exceptions were filed in the court below calling attention to this fact; all of which were dismissed. The assignments of error are based upon these exceptions. They not only cover the abstract question <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>of the right of the estate of the widow to receive the accumulations of income properly apportionable to the principal awarded to her personal representatives, but they also contain numerous concrete figures concerning different items of income in the account. It is not necessary that we shall pass upon the particular sums to which the estate of the widow is entitled. We decide that her estate is entitled to all of the accumulations of income properly apportionable to the principal awarded to her personal representatives. To this extent the assignments of error are sustained, and to this extent the decree is reversed; and the record is remitted to the court below in order that distribution may be made in accordance with the above opinion.</p>
