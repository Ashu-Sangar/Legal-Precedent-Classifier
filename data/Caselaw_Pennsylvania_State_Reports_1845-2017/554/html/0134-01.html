For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court and <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>remand this matter for final disposition consistent with this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[260,404,1161,466]]]'>We granted allocatur to address four issues. The first issue involves the availability of punitive damages under the Act. The second and third issues raise the propriety of the award of counsel fees and costs to a prevailing plaintiff under the Act, and the relevance of weighing the financial resources expended by a defendant as a factor in denying the award of such fees. The final issue is whether it is proper to consider the absence of retaliatory conduct when evaluating a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>
    <p id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[256,904,1161,797]]]'>A brief recitation of the facts is necessary to resolve the issues raised in this appeal. Appellant, Ms. Louise Hoy, was employed by Appellee, Village Super Market, Inc. d/b/a Shop-Rite of Easton (Shop-Rite), as the only female meat wrapper in the store’s meat department. Appellant’s tenure with Shop-Rite began in September of 1972 and continued through August of 1994, when the store closed. Appellee Dominick Angelone’s (Angelone) employment with Shop-Rite began in 1972. Angelone was first employed as a meat cutter and, in 1980, was promoted to the position of “chief journeyman.” He also held the title of “meat manager.” Defendant, Gregory Thomas,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> became the store manager of Shop-Rite in 1980 and remained in that position at all times relevant to this case. Thomas’ responsibilities included supervision of the meat department.</p>
    <p id="b202-6" data-blocks='[["BL_202.6",202,[255,1727,1158,367]]]'>The testimony at trial established that Angelone subjected Appellant to various forms of abusive treatment. Such behavior included sexual propositions, vile and filthy language, off-color jokes, physical contact -with the back of Appellant’s knee, and the posting of sexually suggestive pictures. Angelone did not disagree that the conduct occurred, rather, he asserted that such behavior was accepted and welcomed by Appellant.</p>

Appellant’s treating physi<a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>dan testified that her condition was caused, at least in part, by the abusive conditions of her workplace. After Appellant returned to work, she provided Thomas with a letter, dated February 1, 1992, requesting that she be transferred to another department. Thomas contended that this was the first time that he became aware of Angelone’s treatment of Appellant. Appellant was ultimately transferred from the meat department in October, 1992.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[197,734,1152,692]]]'>On May 13, 1993, Appellant filed a two count complaint against Shop-Rite, Angelone, and Thomas. Count one alleged unlawful discrimination in violation of the Act. Count two alleged an intentional infliction of emotional distress. After a trial by jury, a verdict was returned in favor of Appellant. Specifically, the jury found that Angelone engaged in conduct constituting sexual harassment toward Appellant; that Angelone was a supervisory employee during the alleged incidents; that Thomas was aware, prior to February, 1992, of the sexual harassment of Appellant and failed to remedy the situation; and that Appellant had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Angelone intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon her.</p>
    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[197,1452,1152,259]]]'>The jury awarded Appellant $51,000 for her claims under the Act, $25,000 in damages against Angelone for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, $50,000 in punitive damages against Angelone, $25,000 in punitive damages against Thomas, and $250,000 in punitive damages against Shop-Rite.</p>
    <p id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[198,1739,1150,149]]]'>Subsequently, the trial court granted judgment n.o.v. and struck the punitive damages awards against Angelone and Thomas. Judgment was entered on the remaining verdicts.</p>

In a panel decision with one dissent, the Superior Court, finding sexual harassment by Angelone to be so pervasive that Thomas and Shop-Rite had constructive knowledge of the conduct, affirmed the judgment against Shop-Rite under the Act. However, the Superior Court vacated and reversed the judgment against Shop-Rite for punitive damages, finding that punitive damages were not available <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>under the Act. Finally, the Superior Court found that there was insufficient evidence of outrageousness, and thus, vacated and reversed the judgment entered against Angelone for intentional infliction of emotional distress. President Judge McEwen dissented only to the majority’s conclusion that punitive damages are not recoverable under the Act.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[262,632,1159,419]]]'>The Superior Court also rejected Appellant’s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award attorney’s fees and costs under the Act. Judge McEwen concurred in the result but departed from the rationale of the majority, finding that consideration of the amount of financial resources expended by Appellees was not relevant to the issue of entitlement of counsel fees. We granted Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[262,1085,1154,204]]]'>We first consider Appellant’s claim that she is entitled to punitive damages under the Act. As with all statutory construction, our analysis begins with the language of the statute. The Act provides in relevant part that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[300,1314,1116,527]]]'>If the court finds.that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice charged in the complaint, the court shall enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful discriminatory practice and order affirmative action which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employes, granting of back pay, or any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than three years prior to the filing of a complaint charging violations of this act.</blockquote>

    <p id="b204-8" data-blocks='[["BL_204.8",204,[257,1943,1157,149]]]'>While this provision makes no reference to punitive damages, Appellant asks us to interpret the Act to contain an implied right to exemplary damages.</p>
    <p id="b204-9" data-blocks='[["BL_204.9",204,[256,2126,1160,204]],["BL_205.1",205,[202,277,1154,259]]]'>Initially, we note that our Legislature was free to provide' for punitive damages under the Act. Indeed, even a cursory survey of other statutory enactments by our Legislature makes clear that it knew how to provide for punitive damages <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>in clear and unambiguous terms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus, as a starting point, it is reasonable to infer that the General Assembly’s use of specific language to permit the award of punitive damages in numerous statutes reflects an intention to allow such a remedy only when expressly provided for.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[203,559,1152,366]]]'>In requesting this court to read into the Act the remedy of punitive damages, Appellant focuses on that portion of the above-quoted statute, “any other legal or equitable relief’ and submits that in accord with the Act’s requirement of liberal construction, the Legislature intended a broad reading of the Act’s remedies. Appellant argues that legal relief under the Act includes punitive damages.</p>
    <p id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[203,949,1153,854]]]'>We believe that Appellant’s focus on only one part of the Act’s remedy section is unduly limiting. Rather the entire relevant language of the statute must be considered to ascertain the Legislature’s intent. When read in full, section 962(c)(3) of the Act limits remedies to <em>“affirmative action, </em>which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, granting of back pay, or any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.” (emphasis supplied). Applying the canon of statutory construction <em>ejusdem generis, </em>“[g]eneral words shall be construed to take their meanings and be restricted by preceding particular words.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. §1903(b). The general words of “legal or equitable relief’ are impacted by the preceding introductory phrase “affirmative action” and the specific remedial examples provided thereafter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, the seemingly limitless phrase “any other legal or equitable relief’ must be construed in this light.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.3",206,[261,279,1157,420]]]'>
      <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Specific examples of the “affirmative action” deemed to be appropriate under the Act are reinstatement, hiring, and back pay. While remedies under the Act are not limited to only these possible remedies, the phrase “any other legal or equitable relief’ is clearly a subset of the “affirmative action” which a court may order. Thus, we must consider whether punitive damages are properly awarded as affirmative action for purposes of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[257,734,1160,736]]]'>It is critical to note that the Act is remedial in nature. The purpose of the Act is to foster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their fullest capacities, regardless of their, <em>inter alia, </em>sex, and to safeguard their rights to obtain and hold employment without such discrimination. 43 P.S. §952. Central to the Act is the mission to make persons whole for injuries suffered as a result of discrimination. Likewise, the examples of appropriate remedies offered by the statute are make-whole measures, i.e., reinstatement, hiring, and back pay. We believe that in the context of this statute, “affirmative action” is that action which serves to achieve the remedial goals of the Act. Thus, as used in the Act, affirmative action contemplates make whole measures and remedial action.</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[254,1512,1162,689]]]'>Punitive damages are not consistent with this goal of achieving the remedial purposes of the statute and are not a make-whole remedy. Punitive damages are not awarded as an additional compensation but are purely penal in nature. <em>G.J.D. v. Geraldine T. Johnson, </em><a href="/a2d/713/1127-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="713 A.2d 1127" data-case-ids="11827356,559414" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/1127-01,/pa/552/0169-01">713 A.2d 1127</a>, 1998 Pa. Lexis 1275 (1998). As punitive damages are based on a defendant’s culpability, they are inconsistent with redressing injury. While punitive damages also serve to deter, simply put, we do not consider punitive damages to be consistent with the remedial nature of the Act. We believe that when interpreted in the context of contemplated affirmative action, the phrase “any other legal or equitable relief’ does not include punitive damages.</p>

In turn, the remedy section of Title VII was based on the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7151" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §151">29 U.S.C. §151</a> et seq.; <em>Richerson v.

The NLRA provided for the National Labor Relations Board to “take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter).” <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7160" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §160">29 U.S.C. §160</a>(c). In interpreting this section, the United States Supreme Court has held that “[t]he power to command affirmative action is remedial, not punitive ...” Thus, “affirmative action” did not encompass the award of punitive damages. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em><a href="/us/305/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="305 U.S. 197" data-case-ids="6139848" data-case-paths="/us/305/0197-01">305 U.S. 197</a>, 235-36, <a href="/us/305/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="305 U.S. 197" data-case-ids="6139848" data-case-paths="/us/305/0197-01">59 S.Ct. 206</a>, <a href="/us/305/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="305 U.S. 197" data-case-ids="6139848" data-case-paths="/us/305/0197-01">83 L.Ed. 126</a> (1938). “We think that affirmative action to ‘effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)’ is action to achieve the remedial objectives which the Act sets forth.” <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. NLRB, </em><a href="/us/311/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="311 U.S. 7" data-case-ids="6136494" data-case-paths="/us/311/0007-01">311 U.S. 7</a>, 12, <a href="/us/311/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="311 U.S. 7" data-case-ids="6136494" data-case-paths="/us/311/0007-01">61 S.Ct. 77</a>, <a href="/us/311/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="311 U.S. 7" data-case-ids="6136494" data-case-paths="/us/311/0007-01">85 L.Ed. 6</a> (1940). Thus, the Supreme Court has suggested that affirmative action contemplates remedial measures. While we note that unlike the Act, the NLRA contains no provision for legal relief, however, the Supreme Court’s description of affirmative action is strong support for the interpretation of the Act we embrace today.</p>

Appellant’s reliance upon <em>Zamantakis </em>is misplaced. <em>Zamantakis </em>was a plurality decision in which Justice Larsen opined that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (Commission) was not authorized to award damages for mental anguish and humiliation under the Act. First, as a plurality decision, <em>Zamantakis </em>lacks precedential value. More importantly, the plurality’s statement that a court may award damages for humiliation and mental anguish is consistent with an interpretation that the Act only contemplates make whole and remedial measures. Thus, <em>Zamantakis </em>is of little value to Appellant and can be interpreted to support a finding that the General Assembly did not intend for exemplary damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Specifically, the decisions which have found punitive damages to be available have been based on an overly narrow focus on the language in the Act regarding legal and equitable remedies, an approach that we now reject. Also, these decisions have relied upon our <em>Zamantakis </em>decision which, as noted above, is not binding precedent and which we interpret to be consistent with a finding that the Legislature did not intend an award of punitive damages. In consideration of the above, we believe that reliance upon the federal decisions, which predicted that this court would find punitive damages to be permitted under the Act, is misplaced.</p>

The courts have broad authority to fashion remedies without resort to punitive damages. Indeed, the Act permits, <em>inter alia, </em>injunctive relief, reinstatement, hiring and an award of back pay which “serves the dual purpose of discouraging discrimination and of restoring the injured party to his or her preinjury status.” <em>Williamsburg Community School District v.

Aspects of the various federal statutes offered by the parties, and the decisional law interpreting these statutes, can be used to support the position that punitive damages are not available under the Act, as well as the contra position that punitive damages are proper. We believe that the federal law offered by the parties is not of great value in ascertaining our Legislature's intent regarding punitive damages under our somewhat unique Act. For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 contains similar language to the Act but does not provide for "legal” relief. This statute has been interpreted to not allow for punitive damages. However, in 1991, by express Congressional enactment, punitive damages were made an available remedy under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. §1981a. Likewise, the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides for specific remedies as well as "any other means authorized by law.” 29 U.S.C. §794a(a)(2); 42 U.S.C. §2000d-1. Yet this act has been interpreted by at least one court as not authorizing punitive damages. <em>Moreno v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em><a href="/f3d/99/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="99 F.3d 782" data-case-ids="7651753" data-case-paths="/f3d/99/0782-01">99 F.3d 782</a> (6th Cir.1996). The <em>Moreno </em>court relied upon the remedial purpose of the act and the existence of a cap on punitive damages which were expressly permitted in another section of the act. Finally, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 provides that an aggrieved party may bring an action for "legal or equitable relief.” <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7626" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §626">29 U.S.C. §626</a>(b), (c)(1). The act does not contain the limiting language of "affirmative action” and still has been interpreted to not provide for punitive damages. Flowever, this determination was made in light of silence as to punitive damages and an express Congressional remedy of liquid damages also contained in the act. <em>Dean v.

The court went on to find that because the evidence did not establish a right of recovery under the Restatement, the viability of section 46 in Pennsylvania was left to another day. Because of our affirmance of the Superior Court, and the fact that the issue of whether section 46 should be adopted in our Commonwealth was not raised, briefed, or argued by the parties, we too leave to another day the issue of whether section 46 of the Restatement should be the law of Pennsylvania.

    <p id="b221-13" data-blocks='[["BL_221.14",221,[177,1260,1153,250]]]'>Appellant’s supervisor’s behavior in the workplace goes well beyond mere insults and is utterly intolerable in a civilized society. The record amply supports the jury’s finding of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Thus, I would reverse the Superior Court’s ruling on this issue.</p>
