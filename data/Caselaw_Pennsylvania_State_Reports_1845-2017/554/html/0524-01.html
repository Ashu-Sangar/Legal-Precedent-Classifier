Shulick.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At issue is whether appellant, as a customer of the securities broker PaineWebber, Inc., can maintain a state common law cause of action against PaineWebber on the basis of an alleged inadequate disclosure of payments that it received in the course of executing brokerage transactions. The pivotal question is whether federal securities regulations preempt such a suit. On the basis that the courts below properly determined that the action is precluded, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b589-10" data-blocks='[["BL_589.11",589,[225,1554,1151,528]]]'>Whenever one of PaineWebber’s clients authorizes a securities transaction, the order is routed to a particular exchange, dealer, or market maker for execution. In this process, PaineWebber commonly receives “order flow payments.” These include payments, credits, rebates, fee reductions, and other economic incentives that are provided to securities brokers by exchanges, wholesale dealers, and market makers. The payments constitute competitive enticements to place orders with the particular exchange, dealer, or market maker. They are a very common feature of the securities industry.</p>

He further avers that the payments could have caused orders to be placed through exchanges and dealers that did not provide the best execution possible in terms of price, etc. Appellant seeks an accounting of all payments received in connection with the transactions, damages in the amount of order flow payments received, attorney’s fees and costs, and a return of commissions earned on the transactions.</p>

Exchange Act Release No. 34-33026 (Oct. 6, 1993), 58 Fed.Reg. 52934, 52936. When Rule 10b-10 was first proposed by the SEC, a need for uniformity in confirmation requirements was expressly stated: “Changing business methods and the expansion of participants in the securities markets call for a uniform rule applicable to all who wish to effect transactions for or with investors----” Proposed Rulemaking, Exchange Act Release No. 34-12806 (Sept. 16, 1976), 41 Fed.Reg. 41432, 41432.

    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[224,612,1155,1063]]]'>By 1994, the SEC had considered various proposals to regulate payments for order flow and had determined that enhanced disclosure of the payments, rather than prohibition of them, was the appropriate course.

Hence, effective in 1995, Rule 10b-10 was amended to require that confirmations of transactions include “a statement whether payment for order flow is received by the broker or dealer for transactions in such securities and that the source and nature of the compensation received in connection with the particular transaction will be furnished upon written request of the customer....” <a href="/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="17 C.F.R. § 240">17 C.F.R. § 240</a>.10b-10(a)(7)(iii).

Although there must be disclosure of the fact that payment for order flow is received, there is no requirement that the amount of the payment be disclosed if there has been no written request by the customer for such information. The SEC declined to adopt a requirement that there be routine disclosure of the exact amounts of order flow payments in connection with the execution of every trade. In doing so, it took into account the prevailing view that such a requirement would be “unworkable.” Exchange Act Release No. 34-34902 (Oct. 27, 1994), 59 Fed.Reg. 55006, <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>55010. The SEC acknowledged arguments that to require such disclosure “would place an extreme burden on recipient broker-dealers to determine the amount of order flow received for each order in time for a confirmation” and cause the securities industry to incur “expenses [that] are disproportionately high in relation to the potential benefits to customers.” Exchange Act Release No. 34-34902 (Oct. 27, 1994), <a href="/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055006" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="59 Fed.

    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[235,905,1164,475]]]'>Against this background, we turn to the question of whether PaineWebber can be subjected to additional duties of disclosure that appellant asserts under state common law. At issue is federal preemption of state law requirements. Enforcement of common law duties can have the same regulatory effect as an affirmative legislative enactment. See <em>Cellucci v. General Motors Corp., </em><a href="/pa/550/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="550 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="281240" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0407-01">550 Pa. 407</a>, <a href="/a2d/706/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="706 A.2d 806" data-case-ids="11863798,281240" data-case-paths="/a2d/706/0806-01,/pa/550/0407-01">706 A.2d 806</a> (Pa.1998).
