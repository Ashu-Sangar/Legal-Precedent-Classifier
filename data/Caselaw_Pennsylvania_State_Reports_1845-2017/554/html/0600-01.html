Under the Decree, the Department was required to permit prisoners to wear civilian clothing when housed in the general population, subject to the right to impose reasonable regulations with respect to prisoner clothing based on safety, sanitary and security considerations. The district court subsequently terminated the Decree on April 27, 1998, after Congress, in 1996, passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The latest revision of these regulations was promulgated in 1984, in accordance with the notice and comment requirements of the Commonwealth Documents Law, 45 P.S. §§1102-1602 (“Documents Law”), and the regulatory oversight provisions of the Regulatory Review Act, 71 P.S. §§745.1-745.15 (“Review <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>Act”).

Penney’s, or have family members bring to them.</p>
    <p id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.6",669,[193,889,1152,892]]]'>On February 26, 1997, the Department amended DC-ADM 815 by issuing two new bulletins. The first one, DC-ADM 815-4, provides a restricted list of garments that inmates are allowed to purchase; these items are more in the nature of prison uniforms than civilian attire. The second bulletin, DC-ADM 815-5, states that effective November 27, 1997, all nonconforming apparel must be removed from the prisons. Inmates have the option of sending these garments home, donating them to charity, or having them destroyed. After that date, if a prisoner is discovered to possess non-conforming clothing, such clothing would be considered contraband, and the prisoner would be subject to disciplinary measures. According to the Department, these changes were made out of a concern for public safety and prison security, after six inmates escaped from a Pennsylvania prison the previous month. The Department alleges that possession of civilian clothing played a role in the escape.</p>

In Count I, Appellants asserted that DC-ADM 815-4 and 815-5 (the “Bulletins”) are regulations and as such should have been promulgated pursuant to the notice-and-comment provisions of the Documents Law and the regulatory oversight provisions of the Review Act. Appellants requested <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>relief in the form of a court order: (i) declaring that the Bulletins were unlawfully promulgated, (ii) enjoining the Department from enforcing them, and (in) requiring the Department to hold hearings to determine the value of clothing confiscated from Appellants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellants requested relief in the form of a court order declaring: (i) that various provisions of the Decree create “personal and property rights” in favor of Appellants, and (ii) that Appellants’ property interest in their civilian clothing cannot lawfully be terminated without a hearing and “just compensation.”</p>

    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[196,662,1154,940]]]'>On May 8, 1998, the Commonwealth Court entered a per curiam memorandum and order sustaining the Secretary’s preliminary objections, dismissing Appellants’ petition for review, and dismissing Bryan Galvin’s petition to intervene as moot. In its memorandum opinion, the court noted that it was without jurisdiction to enforce a federal consent decree. It also found that because the prisoners have the option of sending their non-conforming attire home, they are not deprived of ownership of their property, and hence no taking has occurred. Finally, the court observed that the Documents Law exempts from its notice-and-comment provisions any regulation pertaining to agency organization, management or personnel. Finding that the Bulletins pertain to prison management, the court concluded that their promulgation absent notice and a public comment period did not run afoul of the Documents Law. The court did not address whether the Bulletins should have undergone the Review Act’s regulatory oversight procedures.</p>

In their brief to this Court, Appellants claim that the Bulletins will significantly affect the general public because retail stores will no longer be able to sell clothing to inmates and the prisoners' families will no longer be able to bring them civilian clothing. Their complaint is less specific, and merely alleges that the Bulletins will "affect the substantial rights of ... the public....” This is essentially a legal conclusion which, as noted, need not be accepted by this Court. Moreover, contrary to Appellants’ claims, the Bulletins’ external effect will be <em>de minimus.</em>
