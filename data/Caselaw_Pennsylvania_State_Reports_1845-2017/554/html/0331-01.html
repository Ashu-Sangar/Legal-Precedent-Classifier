He met King, with whom he was romantically involved, and failed to return to prison as required. Instead, the two traveled to Palmyra, Pennsylvania, where they called upon Guy Goodman, with whom Martin was acquainted. Mr. Goodman, who was seventy-four years old, had written, telephoned and visited Martin in prison, identifying himself as Martin’s friend.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Soon after their arrival at Goodman’s home, Martin hit Goodman over the head with a vase from the hallway, and the pair then bound Goodman’s wrists, ankles and neck in such a manner that he could not extricate himself. They then wrapped a bathrobe around Goodman’s head, placed a plastic bag over it, sealed the bag with duct tape, and wrapped a bedspread over the bag. Finally, they carried Goodman into the basement, tying him more securely and leaving him to suffocate.</p>

After several brief <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>visits with friends in Pennsylvania, the couple fled across the country in Goodman’s car, using his checks and credit card to pay their expenses. They were ultimately apprehended in Arizona, at which time King was advised of her rights and gave a statement to federal law enforcement officials, inculpating herself and Martin in Goodman’s murder. King later reiterated her inculpatory statement to Lebanon County detectives who were investigating Goodman’s death. While in custody in Arizona, Martin was interrogated by Lebanon County detectives, who gave him <em>Miranda </em>warnings. After signing a form stating that he waived his rights, Martin inculpated himself in the robbery and murder. Subsequently, Martin made an additional statement to a corrections officer at the Lebanon County Prison, admitting that he had killed Goodman.</p>

Additionally, Martin filed a motion to suppress his incriminating statement to the Lebanon County detectives, asserting that he had been under the influence of drugs at the time he gave the statement. The trial court denied the motion. Martin chose not to testify at the jury trial that followed, but King testified on her own behalf, and her tape-recorded inculpatory statement was played for the jury.

In support of the aggravating circumstance at subsection (d)(6), the prosecutor reminded the jury that it had convicted both defendants of robbery, which is a felony, and that the killing had occurred during the commission of the robbery.

The Commonwealth introduced, through the testimony of Detective Richard Radwanski, a letter that Mr. Goodman had written to Martin. In the letter, Goodman mentioned his regular attendance of church services, his health problems, and his concern for his own mortality. He also expressed confidence, support and concern for Martin. Testimony was heard from the victim’s daughter, who responded affirmatively to the prosecutor’s question regarding whether she had been concerned for her father because he lived alone and would be unable to seek assistance if he was ever injured. Additionally, a photographer from a local newspaper testified that he had photographed the victim’s home for an article on distinctive homes, and several of these photographs were admitted into evidence.

Given that there were no signs of forced entry into Mr. Goodman’s home, the inference arose that the murder had been committed by someone who was acquainted with him and either had his own key or had been voluntarily admitted. Thus, the letter was properly admitted to establish that Martin had a prior relationship with Goodman. The testimony of the daughter was probative of the fact that Goodman resided alone. Finally, the photographs and accompanying testimony of the photographer were relevant because the pictures depicted the vase that Martin used to strike Goodman, as well as a hutch from which, according to the testimony of Goodman’s daughter, the defendants could have obtained the duct tape that they used to bind Goodman.

In that statement, King had asserted that she was married to Martin and that he was the father of her son. Therefore, it was proper for the Commonwealth to impeach King’s credibility on cross-examination by questioning her concerning the fact that she was legally married to Carl William King, who was listed on her son’s birth certificate as the child’s father.

It is no doubt constitutionally permissible, if not constitutionally required, for the State to insist that “the individualized assessment of the appropriateness of the death penalty [be] a moral inquiry into the culpability of the defendant, and not an emotional response to the mitigating evidence.” Whether a juror feels sympathy for a capital defendant is more likely to depend on that juror’s own emotions than on the actual evidence regarding the crime and the defendant. It would be very difficult to reconcile a rule allowing the fate of a defendant to turn on the vagaries of particular jurors’ emotional sensitivities with our longstanding recognition that, above all, capital sentencing must be reliable, accurate, and nonarbitrary. At the very least, nothing in <em>Lockett </em>and <em>Eddings </em>prevents the State from attempting to ensure reliability and nonarbitrariness by requiring that the jury consider and give effect to the defendant’s mitigating evidence in the form of a “reasoned <em>moral </em>response,” rather than an emotional one. The State must not cut off full and fair consideration of mitigating evidence; but it need not grant the jury the choice to make the sentencing decision according to its own whims or caprice.</blockquote>

On further questioning, Dr. Mihalikis went on to describe the physical sensations that Goodman would have experienced during suffocation, noting that there would have been a period of terror <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>when he realized his impending death. In response to further questions concerning what Goodman experienced while he suffocated, Dr. Mihalikis reiterated that the altercation, the binding and the wrappings were all “very, in fact extremely, terrorizing,” and that Goodman experienced not so much actual pain, but terror because he was not getting enough oxygen and would eventually run out of air and die.

Maj. Opinion at 780-781. As the majority does with the Appellant’s claims of error regarding the trial court’s instructions, see footnote 10, I believe it is unnecessary to address this issue in light of the conclusion that “the trial court erred in permitting the jury to consider this aggravator in its penalty determination.” <em>Id. </em>at 782.</p>

I write separately because I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the aggravating circumstance of torture was not properly placed before the jury. Although Dr. Mihalakis’ expert testimony on the issue of whether the victim experienced fear and terror while being suffocated was improperly admitted, I <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>would find this error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[204,413,1158,953]]]'>Here, the trial court erred by allowing Dr. Mihalakis to proffer expert testimony on a matter of common knowledge. By tying the victim’s hands behind his back and slowly suffocating him until the life finally ebbed out of him, appellants subjected the victim to a degree of terror and fear in the waning moments of his life which a juror does not require an expert to explain. In other words, Dr. Mihalakis did not tell the jurors anything which they did not already know by telling them that a human being would experience fear and terror as he is brutalized and suffocated. However, the same fact which renders the admission of Dr. Mihalakis’ testimony erroneous also renders such admission harmless. While an expert should generally not be permitted to testify as to a matter of common knowledge, allowing an expert to testify about truths as transparent as those at issue here should not be deemed prejudicial. To the extent that <em>Collins v. Zediker, </em><a href="/pa/421/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="259" data-cite="421 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1900353" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0052-01">421 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20776" class="citation" data-index="260" data-cite="218 A.2d 776">218 A.2d 776</a> (1966) holds to the contrary, I believe that case should be overruled.</p>
    <p id="b441-6" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[203,1415,1153,250]]]'>Thus, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that, due to the improper admission of Dr. Mihalakis’ testimony, the aggravating circumstance of torture was not properly before the jury. I concur with the remainder of the majority’s reasoning and with the result reached thereunder.</p>
