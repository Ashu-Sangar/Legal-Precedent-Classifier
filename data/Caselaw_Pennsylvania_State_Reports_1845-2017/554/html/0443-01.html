Afterwards, Sciulli sought treatment with Dr. William W. Frost, Jr. (Dr. Frost), a board certified physiatrist. Sciulli’s first visit to Dr. Frost occurred on January 17,1994 at Dr. Frost’s only office, which was within a self-contained medical facility operated by Three Rivers Rehabilitation, Inc.

Dr. Frost retained and exercised his authority to make changes or refinements to a patient’s physical therapy program. Three Rivers paid the rent for all of its office space, including the office occupied by Dr. Frost. Three Rivers’ billing department handled all billing, whether for treatment provided by Dr. Frost or other Three Rivers staff.</p>

Three Rivers evaluated Sciulli, a staff physiotherapist provided physical therapy to him in the facility of Three Rivers, and they sent all of Sciulli’s medical bills to Eighty-Four Mining for payment. After approximately three weeks of physical therapy, Sciulli returned to work without limitations.
