Appellant therein asserted that he had been a state employee serving as a district justice for over 24 years. He asserted that the Board has jurisdiction over contract actions, including quasi-contract claims, claims in quantum meruit and claims against the Commonwealth involving implied contracts for compensation. As a basis for reimbursement, Appellant again relied on 4 Pa.Code § 39.1 and also argued that under Pa. R.J.A. 505(15),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> the AOPC has the power to provide him with <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>legal services. He further contended that the denial to judicial officers of rights and privileges possessed by other Commonwealth employees was a violation of due process. The AOPC filed preliminary objections, which challenged the jurisdiction of the Board on the ground that no valid contract claim was raised. The AOPC also contended that the Board had no authority to enforce the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration.</p>

He further contended that the denial of attorney’s fees violated due process because the executive branch of government was entitled to receive attorney’s fees pursuant to the Pennsylvania Code. We reject the notion that these contentions derive from a contract, implied or otherwise, between the Commonwealth and Appellant.

    <p id="b605-4" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[190,623,1151,675]]]'>Appellant offers three reasons why he is entitled to reimbursement for legal fees following his acquittal of criminal charges that arose from his official duties as a district justice. First, he contends that the Pennsylvania Code provides for the reimbursement of reasonable legal fees. As noted in footnote five, <em>supra, </em>section 39.1 of the Administrative Code provides that the Office of General Counsel will reimburse an employee for reasonable attorney’s fees if it determines that there is no basis for the criminal prosecution as a matter of law or fact. 4 Pa.Code § 39.1(a). It further states that the Office of General Counsel may also authorize the reimbursement of reasonable attorney’s fees if the employee’s criminal defense is successful. 4 Pa.Code § 39.1(b).</p>

[tjo make rules and regulations defining the expenses for which officers and employes of the <em>executive branch </em>of state government may be reimbursed____” 71 P.S. § 249 (emphasis added). Thus, section 89.1, authorizes designated members of the executive branch to determine whether to reimburse legal fees to employees of the executive branch who are charged •with a crime.

    <p id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[268,806,1160,581]]]'>Second, Appellant contends that the disparity in the reimbursement policies of the executive branch and the judicial branch, which, according to the AOPC, denies reimbursement of legal fees for criminal prosecutions, violates due process. Appellant asserts that the executive, legislative and judicial offices are independent, co-equal branches of government. Accepting this precept as true does not lend to Appellant’s argument. As noted by the AOPC, the assertion that each branch of government must afford identical rights and privileges to its respective employees would eviscerate the very independence that each branch is constitutionally granted.</p>
