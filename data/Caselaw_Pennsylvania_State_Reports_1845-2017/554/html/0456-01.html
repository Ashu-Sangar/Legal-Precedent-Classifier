On August 18, 1994, State Farm forwarded to DiRenzo Chiropractic Center a copy of the peer review report and determination submitted by Worldwide after an initial review of the bill submitted by DiRenzo Chiropractic Center. Worldwide’s report concluded that the medical treatment rendered by DiRenzo Chiropractic Center from March 16,1994 to May 31, 1994 was “not supported by the documentation to be medically necessary for the treatment of injuries allegedly sustained in the motor vehicle accident which occurred approximately three years previously on 4/6/91.” In an accompanying letter, State Farm advised DiRenzo Chiropractic Center that it would not be issuing any payment for services rendered to Kuropatwa on March 13, 1994 and ongoing based upon Worldwide’s report.</p>

In the attached report, Worldwide’s reviewer indicated that she agreed with the initial determination made by Worldwide. The report stated that “[biased solely on the lack of documentation, the treatment rendered ... is unsupported by the documentation brought forth for review regarding medical necessity, appropriateness the [sic] motor vehicle accident dated 4/6/91 and the care being rendered three years post-trauma.” The report further noted that no day-to-day progress notes existed to support the need for treatment after March 16, 1994, and that no direct correlation could be made between the medical treatment and the 1991 accident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The peer review process does not provide a forum for the resolution of disputes regarding coverage of medical bills under an automobile insurance policy; nor does § 1797(b) provide a remedy for the nonpayment of medical bills. As we observed in <em>Terminato, </em>only the insurer participates in the peer review process, and “[t]he detachment and neutrality required of a fact-finder is conspicuously absent in the contractual relationship between a PRO and an insurer.” <a href="/pa/538/0060-02" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="538 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="475476,475555" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0060-02,/pa/538/0060-01">538 Pa. at 68</a>, <a href="/pa/538/0060-02" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="645 A.2d 1287" data-case-ids="475476,475555,7874032,7874147" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0060-02,/pa/538/0060-01,/a2d/645/1287-01,/a2d/645/1287-02">645 A.2d at 1291</a>.</p>

This argument entirely disregards the insured’s interest in the underlying <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>contract of insurance which by its terms obligates the insurer to provide coverage for medical bills arising from the insured’s involvement in an automobile accident in exchange for the payment of premiums. State Farm’s position would effectively insulate from review a dispute between an insured and insurer as to whether the insurer is required to pay for medical services or treatment under the terms of the insurance policy. Where, as here, the insurer asserts that it has no obligation to pay medical bills submitted on behalf of an insured because the medical services or treatment were not causally related to the automobile accident, the insurer may raise its defense in the action brought before common pleas by the insured for the insurer’s failure to comply with the terms of the automobile insurance policy.</p>
    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[218,1024,1152,460]]]'>Kuropatwa has standing to bring this action against State Farm to compel payment of medical bills that she asserts arose from her involvement in the 1991 automobile accident. As an insured under the insurance policy issued to her by State Farm, Kuropatwa has a direct, immediate and substantial interest in enforcing the terms of the policy and in judicial resolution of the dispute over coverage for her medical bills. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and the matter is remanded to the common pleas court.</p>

Kuropatwa also asserts that a peer review organization is not permitted under the MVFRL to determine the causation of the injuries of an insured. This issue has not been addressed by this Court, and will not be addressed in this appeal because of the limited grant of Kuropatwa's petition for allowance of appeal. See also, <em>Terminato v.
