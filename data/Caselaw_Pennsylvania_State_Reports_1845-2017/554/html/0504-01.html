      <em>From </em>1948 to 1991, Appellant worked as a millwright for a number of employers, including Atlantic Plant Maintenance (Atlantic). As a millwright, Appellant worked with gasket material and packing, pipe coverings, and turbine insulations, all of which may have contained asbestos. On September 13, 1991, Roger Abrahams, M.D. (Dr. Abrahams), a pulmonary disease specialist, diagnosed Appellant as suffering from asbestosis. Dr. Abrahams advised Appellant that he should not return to work as a millwright because the work environment would cause his asbestosis to advance. On May 1, 1992, Appellant filed Claim Petitions against Atlantic and his other employers, seeking disability benefits as of September 13, 1991 for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of asbestos exposure from 1985 to 1991. Atlantic denied his claim, and the matter went to a hearing before a Workmens’ Compensation Judge (WCJ).</p>

According to Dr. Abrahams, Appellant’s condition rendered him unable to continue to work as a millwright. Atlantic, however, presented the testimony of Joseph Renn, III, M.D. (Dr. Renn), a pulmonary disease specialist, who testified that Appellant had benign asbestos-induced pleural plaques, but not asbestosis. Dr. Renn concluded that Appellant’s condition did not disable him and he could continue to work as a millwright. Atlantic also presented Appellant’s testimony from a September 1990 deposition in another matter, in which Appellant testified that he had not been exposed to asbestos after 1978. This testimony was inconsistent with the allegation in Appellant’s Claim Petition that he had been exposed to asbestos from 1985 to 1991. The WCJ found Dr. Renn’s testimony credible and adopted it as fact. Accordingly, he concluded that Appellant had failed <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>to prove that he was disabled from asbestos exposure, and therefore denied Appellant disability benefits.</p>

The Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision of the WCAB, noting that a WCJ “has exclusive province over questions of credibility and evidentiary weight. The [WCJ] is free to accept or reject the testimony of any witness, including a medical witness, in whole or in part.” <em>Phillips v.

Atlantic argued, and the Commonwealth Court agreed, that, “because credibility determinations are not reversible, and because the sole basis of [Appellant’s] appeal to [the Commonwealth Court] is that substantial evidence does not support the [WCJ’s] credibility determination, the filing of this appeal is without foundation and an abuse of the judicial process.” <em>Phillips, </em><a href="/a2d/680/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="680 A.2d 45" data-case-ids="7858873" data-case-paths="/a2d/680/0045-01">680 A.2d at 46</a>. Thus, in accordance with Atlantic’s request, the Commonwealth Court assessed reasonable attorneys’ fees, not against Appellant, but against Appellant’s counsel.

    <p id="b575-6" data-blocks='[["BL_575.8",575,[197,783,1149,203]]]'>I am unable to conclude that Section 440 of the Workers’ Compensation Act precludes an appellate court from assessing counsel fees pursuant to Appellate Rule 2744 against a workers’ compensation claimant who pursues a frivolous appeal.</p>
    <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.9",575,[195,1013,1152,419]]]'>I agree with the majority that, although Section 440 of the Act provides for an award of attorney’s fees in favor of an employee claimant in a case where the insurer (or employer) has unreasonably contested liability, the employer has no reciprocal right under the Act to seek counsel fees from a claimant who has filed a baseless claim petition. This follows from the plain language of the statute and is consistent with its remedial purposes.</p>
    <p id="b575-8" data-blocks='[["BL_575.10",575,[194,1458,1153,575]]]'>In my view, however, it does not follow that the substantive provisions of Section 440 extend to the appellate process and supersede Appellate Rule 2744, which accords appellate courts the ability to impose sanctions as a means to control and supervise their dockets. Nor do I view the application of Appellate Rule 2744 to a workers’ compensation claimant as chilling the legitimate exercise of appellate rights. An employee is not penalized for pursuing his or her appellate rights — only an appeal deemed frivolous by the appellate court as lacking any basis in law or fact will expose a party to counsel fees.</p>
    <p id="b575-9" data-blocks='[["BL_575.11",575,[195,2068,1148,94]]]'>Since the Commonwealth Court found this appeal frivolous, and since the record supports such conclusion, I would affirm.</p>
