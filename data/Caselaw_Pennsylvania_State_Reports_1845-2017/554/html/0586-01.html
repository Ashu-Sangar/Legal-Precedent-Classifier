The Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”) court determined that trial counsel was not ineffective, and the Superior Court affirmed. For the following reasons, we now affirm the Superior Court.</p>

To satisfy the debt, Carter agreed to help appellant rob a cab driver whom appellant knew. Pursuant to their plan, appellant enlisted the services of the victim, and asked the victim to drive her to a prearranged location where Carter <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>lay in wait. Subsequently, Carter approached the vehicle, told appellant to get out, and shot the victim in the head. Carter and appellant then dragged the victim from the cab and completed the robbery.</p>

The Commonwealth agreed that it would not seek the death penalty in exchange for appellant’s agreement to waive her right to a jury trial. On October 31, 1989, following a bench trial, the trial court convicted appellant of second degree murder, criminal conspiracy, robbery, and possession of an instrument of crime. The trial court sentenced appellant to the mandatory life sentence for second degree murder, and imposed concurrent terms of imprisonment for the other charges. Appellant’s direct appeal from judgment of sentence was denied.</p>

Specifically, appellant argues that the only aggravating circumstance which even arguably applied to her was the circumstance enumerated at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), which provides: “[t]he defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony.” Appellant points out that she was only an accomplice to murder under the theory of the case advanced by the Commonwealth at trial, and contends that the legislature did not intend the aforementioned aggravating circumstance to apply to accomplices. The Commonwealth argues that Section 9711(d)(6) embraces accomplice liability, and that even if it does not, appellant has failed to establish that trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness prejudiced her. Although we <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>agree with appellant that Section 9711(d)(6) does not apply to accomplices, we find that appellant has failed to establish that she was prejudiced by trial counsel’s ineffectiveness.

Determining the scope of Section 9711(d)(6) first necessitates an iteration of basic principles of statutory construction. This Court has held that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>its provisions must be read in accordance with their plain meaning and common usage.

This Court has also noted that the ultimate principle of statutory interpretation must be that each word used by the Legislature has meaning and was used for a reason, not as mere surplusage. <em>Fisher v.

At trial, the Commonwealth espoused the theory that Carter, not appellant, was the person who shot the victim in the head and thus “completed” or “finished” the murder. <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>Thus, under the Commonwealth’s theory of the case, the Section 9711(d)(6) aggravating circumstance could not have been applied to appellant, who assisted in the planning of the murder but who was not the causal agent directly responsible for bringing the murder to completion.</p>

Clearly, trial counsel could have had no reasonable basis for failing to explain to appellant that a strong argument could be made that the death penalty could not be applied to her under Pennsylvania law.

The Commonwealth alludes to the firmly established common law principle that each accomplice bears equal criminal responsibility for the acts of his associate or confederate committed in furtherance of the common design. The Commonwealth argues that in light of this axiom, it would have been redundant of the Legislature to expressly engraft the concept of accomplice liability onto each aggravating circumstance. The Commonwealth overlooks the fact that engrafting the concept of accomplice liability is precisely what the Legislature has done in subsections (13) and (14). Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has determined that states cannot establish a capital sentencing scheme which makes accomplice liability coterminous with principal liability regardless of the level of the accomplice’s involvement. <em>See Tison v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/481/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="481 U.S. 137" data-case-ids="6211931" data-case-paths="/us/481/0137-01">481 U.S. 137</a>, 150-52, <a href="/us/481/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="481 U.S. 137" data-case-ids="6211931" data-case-paths="/us/481/0137-01">107 S.Ct. 1676</a>, <a href="/us/481/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="481 U.S. 137" data-case-ids="6211931" data-case-paths="/us/481/0137-01">95 L.Ed.2d 127</a> (1987)(participation of accomplice in the crime must be "major’’ in order for accomplice to be death-eligible).

Since this is an ineffectiveness claim, the dissents imposition of "presumptive prejudice” flies directly in the face of the PCRA, which requires that the prejudice prong of an ineffectiveness claim be <em>“plead and provefn] </em>by a preponderance of the evidence.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(emphasis added).

Like her first claim, appellant's second claim posits that her waiver was tainted by trial counsel's ineffective assistance. However, for the reasons expressed in this Opinion, appellant has failed to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by trial counsel's alleged ineffective assistance in this regard.
