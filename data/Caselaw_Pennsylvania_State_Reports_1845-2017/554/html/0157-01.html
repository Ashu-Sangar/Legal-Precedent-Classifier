    <p id="b223-8" data-blocks='[["BL_223.9",223,[174,1339,1151,687]]]'>Appellant began his employment with DER on September 7, 1993 as a probationary employee. He was classified as a Computer Systems Analyst I and assigned to work in DER’s District Mining Operations (DMO) office in Harrisburg. Pursuant to a Job Description dated November 1, 1993, which Appellant signed, his duties included: assisting in the development of computer program applications; ensuring adherence to departmental standards for hardware, software, development, security and operations; conducting initial problem diagnoses and coordinating with vendors for hardware repairs; attending Systems Coordinator meetings; performing various training functions; and designing and installing LAN’s (local area networks).</p>

Linnan encouraged Appel<a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>lant to make a detailed report regarding the alleged copyright violations.</p>
    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[264,393,1161,678]]]'>Approximately three weeks later, on January 7, 1994, Appellant met with Linnan and Lynda Ronemus (Ronemus), another supervisor, to receive an interim performance evaluation. The evaluation report noted that Appellant’s performance was lacking in a number of ways, including failure to achieve established goals. Linnan and Ronemus discussed Appellant’s performance problems with him, particularly his failure to complete certain assignments. The following week, Appellant’s supervisors gave him a list of projects to complete during the first quarter of the year. With the assistance of Appellant’s union representative, Appellant and his supervisors established and agreed to a schedule for completion of the assigned work.</p>
    <p id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[264,1093,1158,414]]]'>On April 15, 1994, Linnan and Ronemus gave Appellant a second performance evaluation. Appellant’s overall performance was rated “unsatisfactory”, and the report noted performance problems virtually identical to those noted in the first evaluation report, e.g., failure to complete assignments on time. By letter dated April 25, 1994, DER terminated Appellant’s employment, effective April 26, 1994, for failure to meet the minimum performance standards for his position.</p>

While the definition uses the phrase “to protect the interest of the public”, and that could be interpreted to apply to any statute or ordinance as used in the context of retaliation taken by an employer because of an employee’s work performance, that requirement means that a statute or regulation is of the type that the employer is charged to enforce for the good of the public or is one dealing with the internal administration of the governmental employer in question.”</blockquote>

Appellant claims that his report of alleged wrongdoing touched off a series of retaliatory actions, including negative performance evaluations, lack of cooperation from fellow employees and supervisors, withholding of information regarding computer software, and, ultimately, termination of Appellant’s employment. However, this “evidence” constitutes nothing more than Appellant’s perception of how others treated him after he made the December 20, 1993 report — a <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>perception that is obviously colored by Appellant’s interest in proving that he is a victim of retaliatory discharge.</p>
