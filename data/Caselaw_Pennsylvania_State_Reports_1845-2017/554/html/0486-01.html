Thereafter, on August 17, 1993, Mrs. Col-well, the co-executrix, and Mellon Bank, the corporate executor, sold the condominium in fee simple for $155,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The co-executors then distributed $76,199.55 to Mrs. Colwell on the theory that this sum represented the value of her life estate.

The majority of the Superior Court panel held that the distribution of funds from the sale, $76,199.55 into a separate trust for the use and benefit of Mrs. Colwell, with the remainder of the trust at her death to the charities, and $78,800.05 into the corpus of the unitrust was neither an abuse of discretion nor an error of law. The court found this disposition to be consistent with the testator’s primary concern — to care for Mrs. Colwell and to safeguard the principal which will go to the charities at Mrs. Colwell’s death. In support of this analysis, the majority cited 20 Pa.C.S. § 6113, <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>supra. And finally, since the testator’s general intent was satisfied, the majority of the Superior Court panel determined that the alleged negative tax consequences flowing from the sale of the condominium are of no legal significance.</p>

Further, the dissenter thought that Mrs. Colwell’s only interest in the proceeds from the sale of the property is in the income generated by these proceeds, payable through the Colwell-Hewitt unitrust. Finally, he agreed with the Commonwealth’s allegation that the sale of the property and the distribution to Mrs. Colwell resulted in almost $40,000 in additional taxes on the estate, and he would require Mrs. Colwell to reimburse the estate in the amount of excess taxes paid due to the sale.</p>

      <em>Ladner on Conveyancing in Pennsylvania. </em>§1.03 (4th ed.1979, Sup.1994). As to her authority to sell the condominium, she plainly had that authority in her role as coexecutrix of the estate, pursuant to Art. V(B), supra.</p>

    <p id="b557-3" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[223,272,1154,889]]]'>
      <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>The fee simple interest in the condominium was sold by the executors, and from the proceeds of this sale Mrs. Colwell was paid the value of her life estate. The question, therefore, is whether Mrs. Colwell’s interest in the proceeds of the sale of her life interest is a present interest, and if it is, whether it is subject to a future interest. The answer is straightforward. Mrs. Colwell has a present interest in the value of the life estate, but this present interest is not subject to any future interest. Section 6113, therefore, does not apply. The proceeds which are subject to the future interest are the value of the fee less the value of the life estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The remaindermen have a future interest in the fee, or its value. The value of the fee, in turn, is the purchase price of the fee less the value of the life estate. The remaindermen have no interest at all in Mrs. Colwell’s life estate. That estate belongs to Mrs. Col-well, and at her death it terminates; it does not pass to the remaindermen.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[224,1188,1155,1060]]]'>The Commonwealth argues, however, that because Mrs. Colwell joined and acquiesced in the sale of the fee interest in the condominium, the remainder interests accelerated and the unitrust is entitled to the immediate receipt of the entire proceeds of sale, just as if Mrs. Colwell had disclaimed her life estate interest. We disagree. Mrs. Colwell did not disclaim her interest; in fact, she asserted it. Moreover, the will provides that upon Mrs. Colwell’s death, or upon the testator’s death if she should predecease him, the condominium should be sold and the proceeds distributed as part of the residuary estate. Mrs. Colwell, who remains among the living, did not predecease the testator and there is no provision in the will which directs sale of the property under the circumstances of this case. The property was sold not because it was required by the will, but because it was within the discretion of the executors. Once the property was sold, the proceeds, less the value of the life estate, were properly placed in the residuary estate, not because the remainder interests accelerated, but because, in the absence of explicit direction in the will, there was no other place to deposit them.</p>

      <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>Finally, the Commonwealth argues that Section 6113 does not apply because the proceeds of the sale were already in trust inasmuch as the testator directed that the sale proceeds be distributed to the unitrust. This claim is without merit. The will directs that the proceeds shall be distributed to the residuary estate upon the death of Mrs. Colwell, or of the testator if Mrs. Colwell should predecease him. Mrs. Colwell did not die, and so no such sale was conducted, and such distribution is not, therefore, required. But even if it were, the result would be no different, for the executors have already distributed to the residuary estate the proceeds from the sale of the fee interest in the condominium.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

If the executor agreed to merge its remainder interest with the beneficiary’s life estate, sell the property, and pay the beneficiary the value of her life interest, no rule of law of which I am aware prevents that, and since the beneficiary would receive only the monetary value of what she was devised, receiving the value of the life estate does not violate the terms of the will.

Cornelius J. Moynihan, Introduction to the Law of Real Property, Chapter 2, §10 (1962); <em>see also </em>Ladner on Conveyancing in Pennsylvania, §1.03(b)(Timothy J. O’Neill 4th ed.1988). A life estate has the quality of alienability, thus the life estate can be conveyed to a third person; but, the life estate holder can not convey a greater interest than he/she possesses. Generally, the life estate holder is responsible for interest on any mortgage on the property, and has a duty to pay current taxes and assessments, by a municipality or other public authority, which do not exceed the probable duration of the life estate.

In <em>Felice, </em>this court concluded that the testator had devised to Ms. Chase, only a life estate in the residuary trust, <em>not </em>a life estate in the real property. Thus, unlike the instant case, Ms. Chase would not have been able to alienate her life estate in the real property, since she had no interest in the real property which she could sell. This result is distinct from the instant case where Mrs. Colwell possesses a life estate in the real property. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Mrs. Colwell could sell her life estate, and would be entitled to keep the proceeds from the sale of her life estate. Although, as Mr. Justice Nigro points out in his dissenting opinion, the value of a life estate is highly speculative, since a life estate is not, as a practical matter, a marketable commodity. But, I am not troubled by the use of the actuarial tables to value Mrs. Colwell's life estate, since a court would use such tables in determining the life estate holder’s portion of responsibility for any permanent improvement to the land.</p>

The majority states that, in <em>Felice, </em>the trustees owned the whole property, whereas here, the trustees had only a remainder interest in the property. The majority neglects to compare the precise language of the bequest in <em>Felice, </em>as set forth above, with that at issue here. In each will, the beneficiary was specifically provided a life estate in the property at issue, with no explicit provision for an interest in the proceeds of that property. Also, each will provided that the trustees were to sell the property at the death of the beneficiary and apply the proceeds to the residuary estate. Thus, in each case, the interest held by the trustees in the property was identical. The majority's attempt to characterize the trustee’s interest in <em>Felice </em>as a separate "ownership” interest, as opposed to the "remainder” interest held by the trustees in this matter, finds no support in the actual language of the documents. Moreover, I do not believe such a distinction would be relevant even if it did exist.

To the contrary, I believe that compelling reasons exist for continuing to adhere to this Court's decision in <em>Felice. </em>As Judge Johnson's dissent in the Superior Court aptly points out, Mrs. Colwell's actions in selling the property at issue resulted in almost $40,000 in additional and unnecessary tax liabilities to the estate. This $40,000 was also a part of the corpus of the estate to which the residuary legatees were intended beneficiaries. Allowing Mrs. Colwell to retain the net proceeds from the sale while simultaneously imposing this unnecessary $40,000 expense on the estate seems anomalous at best. As <em>Felice </em>holds, all net proceeds from the sale of the property at issue should revert to the residuary estate, with the $40,000 in expenses being deducted from <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>tílese proceeds.

Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.1990). Kenneth Hewitt bequeathed to Mrs. Colwell a life estate in his condominium, provided that she timely notified his corporate executor (Mellon Bank) that she chose to occupy it, and provided that she “keep such apartment adequately insured, maintained and repaired and ... pay all real estate taxes, water and sewer rents, assessments, carrying charges and similar charges thereon.” He also gave to his executors, Mellon Bank and Helen Colwell, the power to, <em>inter alia, </em>“sell ... any and all property, real, personal or mixed, at such times and for such prices and upon such terms and conditions as my Executors may determine.” The general power to sell, however, is limited concerning the condominium to circumstances where Colwell as beneficiary renounces her life interest before taking possession, defaults on the upkeep, or dies after taking possession.

But she may sell or lease only the interest she has — which is limited by the duration of the designated life. Thus, if Mrs. Colwell, in her capacity as beneficiary, chose to sell her interest in the condominium, the purchaser’s interest in the property would be a life estate for the duration of Mrs. Colwell’s life and would expire on Mrs. Colwell’s death. At that point, the <em>entire </em>condominium would, pursuant to Hewitt’s testamentary directive, revert to Hewitt’s residuary es<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>tate and would “be sold and the net proceeds distributed as part of [his] residuary estate as set forth in Article III.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a>

Two are described above, where Colwell the beneficiary, herself, either a) sells her life interest to a speculative buyer or b) defaults on the required maintenance, thereby curtailing her life estate. The more anticipated scenario is where Colwell the beneficiary renounces her right to the life estate by not declaring to Mellon Bank that she intends to occupy the property, and Mellon and Executor Colwell, pursuant to their powers and Hewitt’s instructions, sell the entire condominium. The proceeds would fall to Hewitt’s residuary estate and ultimately to the unitrust. The unitrust already provided Colwell the beneficiary with an annual income of six percent of the total value of the unitrust. Thus, on the sale of the condominium, her six percent would be an enhanced amount because the trust would be larger. Therefore, Colwell the beneficiary was permitted to “profit” <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>from not occupying the condominium in only one of two ways.

Beneficiary would then be the life tenant. Had Beneficiary subsequently decided to sell her interest, she could have sold only what she had — a life estate. Beneficiary would be entitled to whatever price she could get for such a speculative property interest. Beneficiary would not be entitled to go to Executor and have Executor sell the property and give Beneficiary the monetary value of her “life share.” Executor’s instructions were at all times that when the condominium was sold, the proceeds would <em>all </em>fall to the residuary estate and then to the unitrust.</p>

In this instance, the proceeds would have <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>been put into Hewitt’s charitable remainder unitrust and Beneficiary would have drawn six percent of the market value of that trust each year for the rest of her life, any remaining money being distributed to Hewitt’s charities after Beneficiary died.</p>

It is only because Executor and Beneficiary happen to be the same person that permission for Beneficiary to partake outright in the proceeds from Executor’s sale of the condominium was effected. Had Executor and Beneficiary dealt at arm’s length, Beneficiary would never have directly realized a share of the proceeds, for that was not Hewitt’s intent.</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[198,992,1153,315]]]'>Hewitt intended her to receive $300,000 plus six percent of the unitrust for life. Her interest in the condominium was to be realized either as a life estate for her use <em>or, </em>should she decline to “occupy” it, her interest in the condominium would have been realized when six percent of the unitrust, augmented by the sale proceeds, yielded more income to her each year.</p>

Thus, Colwell gets outright control over the lump sum $76,199.55. This is not what Hewitt’s testamentary wishes express and, had Executor been anyone other than Beneficiary, I believe it would not have been permitted.</p>

Under the lower courts’ scenario, Colwell wears yet a third hat as “Trustee” of this separate trust as well as being its income beneficiary. As Trustee, she has the power and authority to deplete the trust for her own benefit during her lifetime, thereby enabling her <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>to succeed to more than Hewitt intended since she is not restricted to an income of six percent of its annual value.</p>

Pursuant to Hewitt’s testamentary-intent, Colwell improperly- succeeded to the entire $76,199.55. Her only interest in the proceeds from the sale of the property is the six percent income she will draw from the unitrust where the entire proceeds properly belong.</p>

      <p id="b565-6" data-blocks='[["BL_565.7",565,[210,1657,1151,661]]]'>. The Majority Opinion seems to have determined that, since Colwell as beneficiary has the power to alienate her life estate and Colwell as executor has the power to sell the entire property in fee, the two powers combined means that the entire property may be sold with Colwell the beneficiary still entitled to her share of the proceeds, the life estate. This is simply not true. Colwell the beneficiary may alienate only her life estate. When she dies, the buyer’s rights completely extinguish and the entire property goes to the remaindermen. Similarly, Colwell the executor has the power to sell the entire property, but so long as Colwell the beneficiary has a life interest, the property may only be sold subject to the life interest. In other words, the buyer in fee owns nothing until Colwell the beneficiary dies. Only if Colwell the beneficiary gives up her life estate may the executor sell the property free of the life interest. If Colwell the beneficiary does give up her life interest, she also gives up her right to the proceeds. Neither party may override the rights and responsibilities of the other, nor may they, jointly, agree to override the testator’s intent.</p>

I pose this hypothetical merely to illustrate the difficulty the Beneficiary would have effecting the same result arrived at by the Majority had she dealt at arm’s length with an independent Executor. My dissent, however, does not, as the Majority’s footnote 5 suggests, rest on this paradigm, but on the notion that the Executor abrogated her fiduciary duties when she circumvented the testator’s intent. Portioning out the monetary value of the life estate for the life tenant's use was never expressed as part of Hewitt’s testamentary intent. In response to the Majority’s footnote 5 hypothetical, it would therefore have been a breach of any Executor’s duty to agree to "merge [the] remainder interest with the ... life estate”; the rule of law which prevents it, as Justice Castille’s dissent properly notes, is fidelity to the testator’s intent.</p>
