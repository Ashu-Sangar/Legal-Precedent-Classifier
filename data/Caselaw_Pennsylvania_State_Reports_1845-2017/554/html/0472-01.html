This area was known to Officer <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>Dawley as a high crime, high drug-trafficking area. Officer Dawley noticed three black males on the porch of the Gateway Day Care Center. Recognizing those individuals, he recalled that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for one of the three, a Mr. Ronnie Beason. He recognized the other two as Appellant and Mr. Terry Jones. As he watched the three men, they began walking in an easterly direction on East 23rd Street. Officer Dawley then yelled for them to stop in order to apprehend Mr. Beason. When they complied, the Officer told Mr. Beason that he had a warrant for him and directed him to lie down. Officer Dawley then looked at Appellant, standing approximately three feet from him, and noticed a bulge in his front left pocket. In order to allay his concerns for safety, Officer Dawley patted Appellant’s front and felt what he believed, and Appellant confirmed, to be money in his front pocket. Officer Dawley then patted Appellant’s back pockets and felt what he believed was a Lifesavers Holes container. He shined a flashlight down into the pocket and noticed a Lifesavers Holes container which appeared, and was later determined to contain, 3.37 grams of crack cocaine.</p>
    <p id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[198,1375,1151,96]]]'>Following arrest, Appellant filed a Motion to Suppress which was denied by the trial court.</p>

Further, Pennsylvania jurisprudence follows the principle that a <em>Terry </em>frisk must relate, in nature and scope, to the sole justification for the search — a pat-down for weapons to ensure the safety of the police and those nearby. <em>See Hicks, </em><a href="/pa/434/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="434 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1922558" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0153-01">434 Pa. at 158-59</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=253%20A.2d%20276" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="253 A.2d 276">253 A.2d at 279</a>. Therefore, a <em>Terry </em>frisk will only support the seizure of contraband discovered via the officer’s plain feel when the incriminating nature of that contraband is immediately apparent to the officer, based solely on the officer’s initial pat-down of the suspects outer garments. Once the initial pat-down dispels the officer’s suspicion that the suspect is armed, any further poking, prodding, squeezing, or other manipulation of any objects discovered during that pat-down is outside the scope of the search authorized under <em>Terry.</em>
