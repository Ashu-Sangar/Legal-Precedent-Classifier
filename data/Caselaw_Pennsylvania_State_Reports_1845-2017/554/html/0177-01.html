Moon had been convicted of first degree murder for killing the president judge of the Warren County Common Pleas Court and sentenced to death. His mental condition came before the court pursuant to The Mental Health Act of June 12, 1951, P.L. 533, which authorized commitment of “any person detained in any penal or correctional institution ... thought to be mentally ill or in such condition that he requires care in a mental hospital....” Section 344(a)(1). The common pleas court determined that Moon was legally sane and refused the commitment. Our court remanded for further proceedings, holding that the legislature, in using the statutorily defined term “mentally ill,” intended to broaden the test to be used in staying criminal proceedings beyond “insanity,” which was the term used in the predecessor Mental Health Act of July 11, 1923, P.L. 998.</p>

For present purposes, it is important to note that the competency issue was placed before the court by counsel who had been appointed in December of 1987 to represent Jermyn in connection with his motion under the Post-Conviction Relief Act. Following our decision affirming the denial of collateral relief, counsel had filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which was still pending when the warrant was issued scheduling the execution for the week of December 6, 1993. There was thus no question as to counsel’s authority to file the “Application for Court Determination of Defendant’s Competency” that brought the issue before the court; counsel’s appointment had not expired.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">4</a>

Moreover, as previously indicated, the Mental Health Procedures Act is inapplicable to such proceedings. Finally, there would appear to be no way in which the prisoner himself can initiate review of the issue. If he cannot comprehend the reasons for the penalty or its implications, he cannot conceive of the need to take any measures to postpone it. Conversely, if he can conceive of such a need, by definition he must comprehend the implications of the penalty, and the very filing of the application would refute its substance, i.e., the allegation of incompetency. In such cases, then, where all other litigation has been completed, it would seem that the issue of the condemned prisoner’s competency to be executed can <em>only </em>be raised by a person acting on the prisoner’s behalf.</p>

In the former situation, because the issue is virtually identical to that in <em>Whitmore, </em>i.e., next friend standing to pursue litigation that has been waived by the real party in interest, the <em>Whitmore </em>reasoning is directly applicable. The latter situation, however, presents a conundrum. Since the ultimate proposition sought to be established is that the condemned prisoner is incompetent to be executed, it makes no sense to inquire preliminarily whether the prisoner is competent to forego raising that issue himself. As noted above at p. 1019, one who is able to raise the inquiry by definition cannot be incompetent, and one who is incompetent cannot raise the inquiry. And if one cannot raise the inquiry due to incompetence, one cannot knowingly forego raising it.</p>

In the hundreds of reported cases where next friend status was noted, the relationship between the person pursuing the cause of action and the person subject to incapacity was readily apparent, as was their concern for the real party’s interests, e.g., parent-child, or husband-wife when married women were deemed legally incompetent to sue in their own right. See, e.g., <em>Dellacasse v.

Rather it was a decision made by the gover<a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>nor after Ford’s counsel “invoked the procedures of Florida law governing the determination of competency of a condemned inmate,” <a href="/us/477/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="477 U.S. 399" data-case-ids="6208971" data-case-paths="/us/477/0399-01">106 S.Ct. at 2598</a>.

Ford’s counsel attempted, unsuccessfully, to present the issue of Ford’s competency to be executed in the state courts.

Justice Marshall’s lead opinion left to the states “the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon ... execution of sentences,” <a href="/us/477/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="477 U.S. 399" data-case-ids="6208971" data-case-paths="/us/477/0399-01">106 S.Ct. at 2605</a>, observing that “instructive analogies may be found in ... procedures for determining whether a defendant is competent to stand trial ... or involuntary commitment proceedings.” <em>Id., </em>n.4.

They also challenged the evaluation of Heidnik by the court-appointed psychiatrist the previous day, as it was based upon a single brief visit. Additionally, the CLEADA attorneys contended that the common pleas court erroneously precluded the presentation of evidence relevant to Heidnik’s competency.

The Commonwealth asserted that based on the record before the common pleas court and the findings of facts and conclusions of law made by the common pleas court, the motion for a stay before this Court should be denied.
