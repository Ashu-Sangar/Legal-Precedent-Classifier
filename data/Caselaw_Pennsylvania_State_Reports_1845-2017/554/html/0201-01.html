Cohen (Cohen) appeals from an Order of the Superior Court that reversed an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Family Division (trial court) directing Lisa A. Goldberg (Goldberg) to pay Cohen approximately one hundred twenty-seven thousand dollars ($127,-000. 00) as his 50 percent share of their marital estate.

Immediately prior to the marriage, they entered into a Premarital Agreement by which both parties agreed that, if there were a divorce, they would divide the marital property equally between them. During the marriage, Cohen, a pediatric ophthalmologist, borrowed various sums of money from Goldberg, a dermatologist, to support Cohen’s failing medical practice.</p>
    <p id="b267-9" data-blocks='[["BL_267.9",267,[203,1397,1152,464]]]'>On the advice of Goldberg’s attorney and accountant, some of the loans were formalized in writing.

Goldberg also made additional loans to Cohen, totaling approximately fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), which were not evidenced by promissory notes.

This doctrine is justified on the grounds that “where the creditor’s claim against the debtor arises from the same transaction as the debtor’s claim, it is essentially a defense to the debtor’s claim against the creditor rather than a mutual obligation, and application of the limitations on setoff in bankruptcy would be inequitable.” [Quoting <em>Lee v.
