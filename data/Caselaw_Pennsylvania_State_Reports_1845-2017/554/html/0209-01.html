Appellee Ahmet Ulus, now deceased, was a psychiatrist at the Center, Appellee Anthony Scuderi was a counselor at the Center, and Appellee Harvey Friedrich was the executive director of the Center.</p>

During the therapy session, Joseph told Mr. Scuderi that his irritation with Ms. Hausler was becoming worse because that day she was returning to their apartment to get her clothing, that he was under great stress, and that he was going to kill her if he found her removing her clothing from their residence.</p>

The Superior Court affirmed, reiterating that mental health care providers currently have no duty to warn a third party of a patient’s violent propensities, and that even if such a duty existed, Appellant failed to establish a cause of action as his decedent was killed when she ignored Mr. Scuderi’s warning not to go to Joseph’s apartment.</p>

The campus police detained the patient at the oral and written request of the therapist, but released him after satisfying themselves that he was rational and exacting his promise to stay away from Ms. Tarasoff.

There, physicians advised a patient who had been exposed to hepatitis that if she had shown no symptoms within six weeks, she had not contracted the disease. The patient refrained from sexual relations for eight weeks. Approximately one month later, she was diagnosed with hepatitis B and a few months later her sexual partner was similarly diagnosed. The partner sued the physicians, alleging that they were negligent in not advising the patient to refrain from having sexual relations for six months. Although our Court held that the physicians in that case could be subject to liability to persons other than their patient, the duty, properly speaking, remained a duty regarding their treatment of the patient, i.e., to exercise reasonable care in the giving of medical advice to the patient. Harm to the third party was determined to be “within the foreseeable orbit of risk” of giving the patient erroneous advice, and thus the physicians were subject to liability for that harm. We did not hold that the physicians had a duty directly to the third party, which would be the more precise analogy to the holding here.</p>

See 50 P.S. §§ 7302 and 7303. A week after his release, he shot his former girlfriend, her boyfriend, and another man, seriously wounding the first two and killing the last. He then shot and killed himself. In an action against the hospital and one of the doctors brought by or on behalf of the victims, we held that those involved in the decision could be liable for harm to a third party resulting from a decision to discharge a mental patient which was made through willful misconduct or gross negligence. Again, the duty involved a treatment decision with respect to the patient and the foreseeable consequences if that decision were made with less than due care.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> It did not involve a direct duty to act with respect to third parties, only a duty to treat the patient in such a way as not to subject third parties to harm.</p>

Although such a relationship might make it more likely that a mental health professional would become aware of threats of harm than would other citizens, mere knowledge of the threats does not seem to be the basis for the imposition of the duty. What of other “special relationships” within which a person might feel free enough to reveal an intention to do harm? And how can the duty be limited to mental health patients and mental health professionals? If threats are specific and immediate and the person to whom the threats are revealed knows or reasonably <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>should know that there is a serious risk of harm, why would not the duty extend to them as well? To be sure, what would be considered reasonable for a mental health professional to know might differ from what would be considered reasonable for someone without specialized training to know, but a difference in what is reasonable for particular parties does not impact on the question of whether a duty should be recognized in the first instance.</p>

    <p id="b304-7" data-blocks='[["BL_304.8",304,[257,2125,1157,201]],["BL_305.1",305,[228,279,1150,148]]]'>I join in the majority’s decision recognizing a duty mandatory for mental health care professionals to warn a third party of a patient’s specific threat of immediate and serious bodily harm to that person. Additionally, I agree with the majority’s <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>determination that such a duty arises when a patient communicates a serious, specific and immediate threat of bodily harm against an identified or identifiable third party.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[227,449,1153,675]]]'>I dissent, however, because I believe that the majority has incorrectly determined that, as a matter of law, the therapist, Anthony Scuderi, discharged his duty to warn Teresa Hausler of the danger posed to her by his patient with the vague admonition not to visit the apartment. Furthermore, I take exception to the qualification the majority places on the term “reasonable under the circumstances” when the majority states that the warning “should be the least expansive based upon the circumstances.” In my view, the majority defers too greatly to the mental health care professional’s interest in maintaining patient-psychotherapist confidentiality and, in this case, suggests too lenient a standard for discharging the duty to warn.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[228,1155,1152,839]]]'>Having taken the step of establishing an affirmative duty on mental health care professionals to warn a third party of a specific threat by a patient of serious and immediate harm to that person, the majority stumbles by allowing that duty to be discharged, as a matter of law, by the very unspecific, imprecise statement of the therapist alleged here. “Reasonable under the circumstances” as the standard for discharge of the duty to warn must, of necessity, take into consideration the circumstances that give rise to the duty: the communication by the patient to the therapist of a specific and immediate threat of bodily harm to an identified or identifiable third person. To qualify this standard, as the majority does here, by sanctioning as “reasonable under the circumstances” a warning that is the “least expansive under the circumstances” fails to serve the purpose for creation of the duty in the first place: adequate notice to the person threatened.</p>
    <p id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.7",305,[227,2018,1154,309]],["BL_306.1",306,[245,282,1161,852]]]'>We need not defer, as the majority does, to the professional’s concern for his patient’s privacy in determining whether a warning is sufficient as a matter of law to discharge the duty to warn. We have already found that the public concern for notice of dangerous behavior to the person imperiled outweighs the patient’s privacy concerns when the therapist, in <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>his considered judgment based on the standards of the mental health care profession, concludes that the patient has communicated a specific and immediate threat to do serious bodily harm to an identified or identifiable individual, thus triggering his duty to warn that individual. Why, then, do we return to discounted privacy concerns when we permit a mental health care professional to discharge his duty to warn with a “warning” that does not describe the threat involved? The duty to warn established, the paramount concern no longer is the protection of the patient’s privacy but the urgent need to provide the person threatened with the information necessary to take appropriate action. <em>See Tarasoff, </em><a href="/cal-3d/17/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="17 Cal. 3d 425" data-case-ids="2292851" data-case-paths="/cal-3d/17/0425-01">17 Cal.3d at 442</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=551%20P.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="551 P.2d 334">551 P.2d at 347</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2014" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="131 Cal.

    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[243,1164,1158,310]]]'>I cannot agree with the majority’s determination that the “warning” alleged adequately discharged, as a matter of law, Mr. Scuderi’s duty to warn Ms. Hausler of the serious danger posed by his patient. Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court’s entry of judgment on the pleadings and remand for further proceedings.</p>
