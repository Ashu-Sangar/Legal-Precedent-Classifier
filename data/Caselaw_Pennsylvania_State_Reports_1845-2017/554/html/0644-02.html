For the purposes of this Court’s review, the record below establishes the following evidence:</p>
    <p id="b717-6" data-blocks='[["BL_717.6",717,[205,1303,1152,734]]]'>In early 1990, the victim, Sheila Manigault, allowed appellant, an old friend, to stay in her apartment with her three children and herself. In April of 1990, after differences developed between appellant and the victim, appellant moved to another apartment in the same building and resided with Aaron Casper and Joan Walker. On April 5, 1990, Walker refused to allow appellant to enter the apartment because she was alone and did not want him there until Casper returned. Appellant returned to Casper’s and Walker’s apartment later that evening but did not stay. That same evening, Casper met the victim in the hallway of the building and accompanied her to her apartment. When Casper left the victim’s apartment, he closed the door, which automatically locked behind him, leaving the victim and her sleeping children alone.</p>
    <p id="b717-7" data-blocks='[["BL_717.7",717,[207,2061,1150,146]],["BL_718.1",718,[252,270,1159,197]]]'>At 10:30 a.m. the next day, the victim’s four-year-old daughter and her younger brother knocked on the door of a neighbor, Madeline Dickerson, and asked her to come with them. <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>When Dickerson asked the little girl what was wrong, she answered: “Manny did it.” As the children led Dickerson to their apartment, they also stated that, “She’s in the bathroom.”</p>
    <p id="b718-5" data-blocks='[["BL_718.4",718,[250,518,1159,426]]]'>When Dickerson entered the victim’s apartment, she immediately observed blood on the walls and floor of the foyer, dining and kitchen areas. The children pulled her toward the bathroom where she found the victim in the bathtub with bloody water. Dickerson grabbed the two children and fled from the apartment. Dickerson then returned to the apartment to get the victim’s infant daughter. Upon returning to her apartment, she summoned the police.</p>
    <p id="b718-6" data-blocks='[["BL_718.5",718,[245,986,1163,746]]]'>Police officers responding to the call found blood on the door, on the floor, and on the walls in the foyer, dining and living room areas. In the bathroom, they found the victim lying in the bathtub partially submerged in blood-soaked water. A homicide detective called to the scene noticed that the victim’s older daughter had a swollen and bruised eye as well as bruise marks from what appeared to be finger or thumb prints on both sides of her neck. When he questioned the child regarding what had occurred, she stated: “Manny beat my mommy. Manny put my mommy in the bathtub and my mommy is dead.” In response to questions about what happened to her eye, the little girl stated: “Manny punched mé in the face and grabbed me around the neck and Manny kicked me in the side.”</p>
    <p id="b718-7" data-blocks='[["BL_718.6",718,[241,1782,1161,531]]]'>The detective and other police officers searched the victim’s apartment and collected evidence including photographs, blood samples, pieces of a clothes iron and portions of hair braids similar to those on the victim’s head. The detective observed that the victim had suffered scald burns to her face, right shoulder, chest, back and arm, extremely deep lacerations of her head revealing parts of her skull, and discoloration with small lacerations and punctures in the area of her left eye. The lacerations on her head were triangular in shape resembling the triangular shape of the front of a clothes iron.</p>
    <p id="b719-4" data-blocks='[["BL_719.3",719,[196,271,1152,364]]]'>
      <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>On April 19, 1990, Walker, who knew appellant was wanted for the victim’s murder, telephoned the police to inform them that she had seen appellant. Police drove Walker to the area where she had last seen appellant and arrested him after she identified appellant. Upon initial questioning, appellant identified himself as Emanuel Ali but later stated that his name was Emanuel Lester.</p>
    <p id="b719-5" data-blocks='[["BL_719.4",719,[198,682,1150,479]]]'>At trial, the victim’s oldest daughter testified that on the night of the murder, she was sleeping in the bedroom with her mother and younger brother when she heard a noise. She awoke to see appellant hitting her mother in the head with a radio and a clothes iron. When the little girl tried to stop appellant, he punched and choked her and placed a pillow over her face. Appellant then pulled the victim out of bed, pulled part of her hair out, hit her in the head and the face with the iron, and put her in the bathtub.</p>
    <p id="b719-6" data-blocks='[["BL_719.5",719,[198,1201,1151,583]]]'>The medical examiner testified at trial that the victim died from being beaten, scalded and finally drowned. She suffered second and third degree scalding burns of the neck, head, right shoulder, arm and back. The medical examiner stated that the splashing, patchy nature of the burn wounds suggested intermittent contact with hot liquid. She also suffered multiple contusions and abrasions as well as multiple lacerations of the scalp consistent with being struck with an iron. He further testified that the victim suffered all of these injuries while she was alive and that she was alive when she was placed in the bathtub.</p>
    <p id="b719-7" data-blocks='[["BL_719.6",719,[198,1846,1152,474]]]'>Evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction for first degree murder if the Commonwealth establishes that appellant acted with a specific intent to kill, that a human being was unlawfully killed, and that the killing was done with deliberation. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d); <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">528 Pa. 546</a>, 550, <a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">599 A.2d 624</a>, 626 (1991). The evidence in this case amply demonstrates that appellant committed the murder with the requisite intent and deliberation to sustain his first degree murder conviction.</p>
    <p id="b720-4" data-blocks='[["BL_720.3",720,[259,271,1163,672]]]'>
      <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>Appellant complains that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for possession of an instrument of crime because the murder weapon was a clothes iron which does not meet the statutory definition of an instrument of crime under 18 Pa.C.S. § 907(d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">6</a> Appellant here “specially adapted” the clothes iron for criminal use by breaking the plastic handle from the metal plate. He used the plate on the victim’s head creating triangular lacerations matching the front of the metal piece. The victim also suffered small puncture wounds around her left eye corresponding to a piece of the broken plastic handle found at the crime scene. Hence, the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of possession of an instrument of crime.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b720-6" data-blocks='[["BL_720.5",720,[252,1069,1163,841]]]'>Appellant makes eight separate allegations of trial court error. First, he claims that the trial court erred in failing to give a cautionary instruction to the jury regarding the graphic nature of the crime scene photographs introduced at trial and shown to the jury. The black and white photographs of the crime scene and of the victim were admitted for the purpose of demonstrating to the jury the progression of appellant’s attack on the victim and his pursuit of her through her apartment. These photos were clearly relevant and admissible to prove that appellant acted with specific intent to kill and with deliberation. The trial court cautioned the jurors during his charge to the jury that they were not to allow any type of emotional response to the photographs to affect their deliberations, but that they were to decide the case based upon the facts without regard to any emotions or sympathy connected to the photographs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">7</a> This claim is meritless.</p>
    <p id="b721-4" data-blocks='[["BL_721.3",721,[231,269,1150,402]]]'>
      <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>Appellant’s second claim of error is that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony of two witnesses regarding statements made to them by the victim’s four year old daughter. Both the investigating homicide detective and a physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where the daughter was taken for treatment after the discovery of the murder, testified at trial that she told them that appellant murdered her mother.</p>
    <p id="b721-5" data-blocks='[["BL_721.4",721,[231,709,1153,717]]]'>The admissibility of evidence is a matter which lies within the discretion of the trial court, and, absent an abuse of discretion, the trial court’s decision will not be disturbed. <em>Commonwealth v. Bronshtein, </em><a href="/pa/547/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="547 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="468674" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0460-01">547 Pa. 460</a>, 480, <a href="/a2d/691/0907-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="691 A.2d 907" data-case-ids="11915776,468674" data-case-paths="/a2d/691/0907-01,/pa/547/0460-01">691 A.2d 907</a>, 916 (1997). Here, the trial court determined that the testimony of the two witnesses, while hearsay, was admissible under the excited utterance exception. In <em>Commonwealth v. Penn, </em><a href="/pa/497/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="497 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="1775317" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0232-01">497 Pa. 232</a>, 242, <a href="/pa/497/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="439 A.2d 1154" data-case-ids="1775276,1775317" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0231-01,/pa/497/0232-01">439 A.2d 1154</a>, 1159 (1982), this Court held that a statement made to police and in response to police questioning by a child who witnessed his mother’s murder fell within the excited utterance exception even though the statement was not made immediately after the murder. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">8</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b721-6" data-blocks='[["BL_721.5",721,[229,1466,1153,565]],["BL_722.1",722,[226,270,1154,97]]]'>Appellant’s third claim of error is that he was deprived of a fair trial because trial counsel did not have sufficient time to prepare a closing statement. On Friday, November 8, 1991, the trial court granted appellant’s request that he be allowed to personally give his own closing argument to the jury and so advised the jury. The court then recessed for a three-day weekend to give appellant time to prepare his closing. On Tuesday, November 12, 1991, the trial court reversed its decision due to its concerns that, because appellant had not been present in the courtroom for much of the trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">9</a> the jurors would be prejudiced against him. The court <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>then allowed appellant time to confer with his counsel to discuss the points he wanted raised in the defense summation.</p>
    <p id="b722-5" data-blocks='[["BL_722.4",722,[224,410,1156,422]]]'>The record reveals that this claim is baseless. At the trial court’s hearing on post-verdict motions, appellant’s trial counsel repeatedly stated that, while he was surprised by the court’s decision, the court <em>had </em>allowed him enough time to prepare to close.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">10</a> Because it was counsel’s position that he had sufficient time to prepare to close, there is no merit to appellant’s contention that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b722-6" data-blocks='[["BL_722.5",722,[213,905,1165,1256]]]'>As his fourth claim of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to flight because there was no evidence that an arrest warrant was in effect during the time appellant concealed himself or that he knew, or should have known, that police were searching for him. This Court previously has held that the Commonwealth need not establish direct evidence of a defendant’s knowledge that he is sought by the police for the commission of a crime in order for a flight charge to be warranted. In <em>Commonwealth v. Rios, </em><a href="/pa/546/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="546 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="466718" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0271-01">546 Pa. 271</a>, 291, <a href="/pa/546/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="684 A.2d 1025" data-case-ids="466718,7359253" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0271-01,/a2d/684/1025-01">684 A.2d 1025</a>, 1035 (1996), this Court stated that “[i]t is permissible to infer that a defendant knows he is wanted for a crime from the circumstances attendant to his flight.” Here, the evidence demonstrated: that on the night of the murder, appellant did not return to the apartment building where the murder occurred and where he had been staying before the murder; that his grandmother, ex-wife, son and sister all knew the police were searching for him; that he avoided the places he normally frequented; that when apprehended, he possessed identification in three different names; and that he initially gave a false name to police. From this evidence, one can reasonably infer that appellant was avoiding apprehension by the police; therefore, a flight charge was appropriate.</p>
    <p id="b723-4" data-blocks='[["BL_723.3",723,[219,270,1151,783]]]'>
      <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>For his fifth allegation of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as to second degree murder because the evidence supported an inference that the killing occurred during the commission of a burglary. However, appellant was not charged with burglary and he fails to point to any evidence in his case to support his position that a burglary occurred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">11</a> The mere fact that a crime occurred inside a building, without more, is not sufficient to demonstrate burglary. It is axiomatic that a trial court should only charge a jury on an offense when the offense has been made an issue in the trial, and the evidence reasonably would support such a verdict. <em>Commonwealth v. Browdie, </em><a href="/pa/543/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="543 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="461603" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0337-01">543 Pa. 337</a>, 349, <a href="/pa/543/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="671 A.2d 668" data-case-ids="461603,7862539" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0337-01,/a2d/671/0668-01">671 A.2d 668</a>, 674 (1996).

    <p id="b723-5" data-blocks='[["BL_723.4",723,[218,1085,1156,678]]]'>Appellant’s sixth claim is that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter because he claims that the evidence demonstrated that the killing occurred in the heat of passion after the victim asked appellant to move out of her apartment. The evidence in this case could not support a verdict for voluntary manslaughter on that basis because the victim asked appellant to leave her apartment several days before the murder. The passage of time before the murder occurred would negate any suggestion that appellant acted in a rage as a result of the victim’s request. Thus, with no evidence to support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, the trial court correctly refused the requested instruction. <em>See <a href="/pa/543/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="671 A.2d 668" data-case-ids="461603,7862539" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0337-01,/a2d/671/0668-01">id.</a></em>

He testified that at the time of his apprehension, appellant had a welfare card and an entry pass to a shelter in the name of Ronald Richardson, a receipt from a boarding home, a social security card and an employment application in the name of Emanuel Ali, and applications for social security and a voter registration card in the name of Joseph Williams.

During the direct examination of the defense psychiatrist, trial counsel was attempting to establish that appellant was mentally disturbed by outlining the manner in which appellant refused to cooperate in his own defense, including physically attacking his counsel, in sum, arguing that only a mentally disturbed person would act as appellant did. Later, during his closing, counsel was once again attempting to demonstrate to the jury all of the signs that appellant was disturbed and mentioned the attack.

Here, counsel’s argument, although brief, effectively pleaded for appellant’s life, particularly in light of appellant’s courtroom disruptions and his refusal to cooperate with counsel in formulating a defense which gave his counsel very little basis from which to extract an argument. For example, appellant refused to participate in his defense and refused to cooperate with the defense psychiatrist. Given the lack of admissible evidence presented to support a defense of mental disturbance due to appellant’s obstreperousness, counsel adequately conveyed to the jury, to the limited extent possible, that appellant was mentally ill and that a mentally ill person should not be put to death.

Appellant argues that this was an impermissible attempt to link him with MOVE, a controversial cult associated with two major violent confrontations with Philadelphia authorities. Counsel’s failure to object was reasonably calculated so as not to highlight the question and give the jury reason to believe that appellant had something to hide in that regard, particularly in light of the fact that appellant’s sister responded that none of her family members use the name Africa. Because counsel had a reasonable basis for not objecting and given that the witness responded that no such relationship existed, he cannot be found ineffective.</p>

At the hearing on post-verdict motions, however, counsel testified that he called appellant’s son in an effort to avoid a death sentence and that he reviewed with appellant’s son prior to the testimony all of the questions he was planning to ask. It was a reasonable trial strategy to call appellant’s son to attempt to depict appellant as a family man, innocent of the charges.

Even if the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it must find specific intent to torture, the error was harmless as the jury found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.

N.T. 11/12/91 at 19-20.

As recognized by the majority, the trial court did not instruct the jury that the aggravating circumstance of torture requires an intent to cause pain or suffering to the victim in addition to the intent to kill the victim. This Court has required such an instruction. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The majority finds the trial court’s instruction in this case similar to the instruction approved of in <em>Commonwealth v.

However, in <em>Pursell, </em>unlike in this case, the court instructed the jury that torture requires “an intention to inflict pain, suffering or both pain and suffering.” <a href="/pa/508/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="508 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1794003" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0212-01">508 Pa. at </a>239 n. 13, <a href="/pa/508/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="508 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1794003" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0212-01">495 A.2d at </a>197 n. 13. Although the trial court’s instruction was erroneous under the above-stated authorities, a new penalty hearing is unnecessary since the jury found one other aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances. In this situation, the sentence of death is required. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(1)(iv). Thus, I concur in the result reached by the majority on this issue.</p>
