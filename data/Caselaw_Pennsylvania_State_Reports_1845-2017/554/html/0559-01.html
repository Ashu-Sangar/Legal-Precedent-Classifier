D.T. was asked whether she knew the difference between telling the truth and telling lies, and demonstrated that she knew the difference by asking a simple question about whether she was telling the truth when she described the color of a jacket she was wearing. D.T. testified that it is good to tell the truth and bad to tell lies. She said that if she told a lie, she would get in trouble, her mother would punish her, and God would feel upset. D.T. further stated that she would not tell a lie even if nobody knew about it, and that she would tell the truth in court.</p>
    <p id="b626-5" data-blocks='[["BL_626.4",626,[242,898,1161,527]]]'>On cross-examination, D.T. admitted that she had told lies “when she was little,” and that her mother became angry and gave her a beating. She stated that she had practiced her testimony with the assistant district attorney before going to court, and she remembered testifying in a prior court proceeding. Defense counsel probed D.T.’s ability to remember by asking her about how she spent recent birthdays and Christmas, and what presents she had received. D.T. said that God would be mad at her if she lied, but she nevertheless stated if her mother wanted her to, she would lie.</p>

The witness is competent.” <em>Id. </em>at 61. The trial court did not give the jury any other instructions concerning the meaning of its ruling on competency.</p>

Again, this occurred in the presence of the jury without any additional instructions concerning the meaning of the trial court’s ruling. Following trial, the jury convicted Washington of all charges. The trial court denied post trial <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>motions and sentenced him to an aggregate term of seven and one-half to twenty years incarceration.</p>

    <p id="b628-6" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[244,796,1164,1013]]]'>On the other hand, assessing the truthfulness of a child witness during trial is a function for the finder of fact when deliberating. The invariable result of a jury’s presence during competency proceedings is that the truth determining process exclusively reserved for the jury is influenced by the inquiry into competency. Moreover, the jury’s presence during the ruling of a witness’s competence can only be an endorsement by the .trial judge of the witness’s credibility. Should the witness be deemed incompetent, the likely result is a mistrial, which certainly nullifies any promise of judicial economy. A competency hearing of a child witness necessarily entails an investigation into the witness’s appreciation of the importance of telling the truth. Thus, the attorney might pose questions that are proper during a competency hearing, but which would be improper during trial- before the jury because they would be irrelevant, call for hearsay, or violate evidentiary rules and statutes. Thus, conducting the hearing in the presence of the jury also gives rise to the risk that the jury may hear inadmissible testimony.</p>

While we note that some foundational questioning may be duplicated during testimony of child witnesses in competency and trial proceedings when conducted apart from the jury, we cannot mitigate fairness over economy. Thus, we go a step further than our sister jurisdictions and create a per se rule requiring the trial court to conduct a competency hearing in the absence of the jury. Even with a cautionary instruction, which was <em>not </em>given by the trial judge in this case, permitting the competency proceedings to take place in the presence of the jury inevitably permeates into the veracity determination assigned exclusively to the jury.

In addition to asking basic questions about what it means to tell the truth and to lie, attorneys commonly ask child witnesses about how a parent, teacher, or the judge would react if they lied. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the child understands that he or she could be punished or might displease an authority figure if he or she does not tell the truth. Another common line of questioning deals with whether the child has learned about God and whether the child believes God will become angry or sad if he or she tells a lie.

The trial court's explanation for conducting voir dire in the presence of the jury was that it would not allow defense counsel to have a "minitriar’ on competency. This statement implies that the court was concerned about judicial economy and avoiding the time associated with conducting a separate proceeding to determine whether I.T. and <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>D.T. were competent to testify.

      <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>A significant reason for avoiding a per se rule is that, contrary to the majority’s presumption, the competency hearing will not always be prejudicial to the defendant. <em>See State v.

Indeed, in this case Appellant most likely benefited from the jury’s observing the competency examination because the jury had an opportunity to hear D.T. admit that she had told lies in the past, that she had practiced her testimony with the assistant district attorney before going to court, and that if her mother asked her to, she would he in court. I.T. made similar admissions during prehminary questioning. Because I reject the majority’s presumption that the defendant will always be prejudiced by the jury’s observing the competency hearing of a child witness, I must also reject the majority’s per se rule.</p>
    <p id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.4",632,[252,1091,1160,526]]]'>I prefer the approach taken by the courts of Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Thus, while I would find no fault with the court’s decision to hold the competency hearing in the presence of the jury, I would reverse Appellant’s conviction on the ground that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury appropriately.</p>

    <p id="b633-4" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[191,349,1155,1209]]]'>I respectfully dissent from the majority’s conclusion that a voir dire examination of a child witness must be conducted outside the presence of the jury. A vital part of the jury’s function is determining the credibility of witnesses, and that function cannot be usurped by the trial judge. In order for the jury to make a reasoned assessment of the credibility of a child witness, the jury must be able to determine whether the child understands the oath to tell the truth. To make that determination, the jury must be privy to the examination of the child witness regarding the oath and the child’s understanding of its meaning. If the voir dire is conducted outside the presence of the jury, the trial judge must necessarily conclude that the child witness understood the oath, thus improperly invading the exclusive province of the jury as the finders of fact. I believe, therefore, that this Court should follow the line of cases from other jurisdictions, cited by the majority in footnote 4, holding that the examination should be conducted in the presence of the jury with the trial court instructing the jury that the court’s finding of competency is not an assessment of credibility and that the jury is the sole judge of credibility. In this manner the jury itself will be in a position to more precisely determine the weight to be afforded to the testimony of a child witness.</p>
