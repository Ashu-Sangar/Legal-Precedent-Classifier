At issue is whether the evidence presented to the Board demonstrated the existence of an unnecessary hardship entitling Miryam’s to a dimensional variance and special exception from the applicable zoning ordinances. We find that the Commonwealth Court erred for two reasons. First, the Commonwéalth Court applied the standard for a use variance when Miryam’s sought only a dimensional variance. Second, the standard employed by the Commonwealth Court is too restrictive and in contrast to this Court’s precedents concerning unnecessary hardship, irrespective of whether a use or dimensional variance was sought. Therefore, we reverse.</p>

The special exception for parking was granted on the basis that Miryam’s clients would not be driving or parking motor vehicles, the clients and some of the employees would either be using public transportation or walking, public parking lots were located nearby and a neighbor had offered to lease parking spaces to the employees.</p>

Therefore, the Commonwealth Court concluded that Miryam’s had failed to demonstrate that it would suffer the “unnecessary hardship” required for the grant of a variance. In addition, the court noted that the Board made no findings of fact that the property could not be used for any permitted purpose, that the property could be arranged for the purpose only at a prohibitive expense, or that the property had either no value or only distress value.

The issue in this appeal arises from the application of the first part of the test regarding whether or not unnecessary hardship will result from the denial of the variance. This Court has previously held in the context of use variances that unnecessary hardship is established by evidence that: (1) the physical features of the property are such that it cannot be used for a permitted purpose; or (2) that the property can be conformed for a permitted use only at a prohibitive expense; or (3) that the property has no value for any purpose permitted by the zoning ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 168, <a href="/a2d/689/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="689 A.2d 225" data-case-ids="11924221,468732" data-case-paths="/a2d/689/0225-01,/pa/547/0163-01">689 A.2d at 227</a>.</p>

In that case, the owner of a vacant lot in a multiple-family residential zone sought use and dimensional variances because the owner was precluded from developing apartments on the lot due to financial difficulties and was further precluded from selling the property because environmental testing showed that the site was contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon and benzene. As a result of the potential health risks and prohibitive remediation costs, the owner sought approval from the Pittsburgh Zoning Board to use the property as an open air parking lot. The Board granted both use and dimensional variances and the trial court affirmed.</p>

Thus, under the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning, a variance applicant could not establish unnecessary hardship absent a showing that the property was practically valueless as zoned. This Court reversed the Commonwealth Court, and held that unnecessary hardship <em>may </em>be demonstrated by a showing that a property is valueless without a variance. However, this Court made clear that a variance applicant is not <em>required </em>to establish that the property is valueless without the variance in order to establish unnecessary hardship.</p>

Further, in finding that the owner in <em>Allegheny West Civic Council, Inc. </em>had met the burden of establishing unnecessary hardship, this Court considered several factors, including the prohibitive costs of developing the property as a result of contamination, the fact that the relatively small size of the lot precluded other permitted uses not involving improvements and the fact that the local property assessment board assigned the property a fair market value of zero.

In that case, the owner of a massive, one-story building sought use and dimensional variances in order to convert the “fortress-like” structure into four commercial spaces and ten one-bedroom apartments. The building had been vacant for several years and was in disrepair. The building’s heavy construction made razing it cost-prohibitive. Renovation was also expensive. Developing the property was further complicated by the fact that the building sat upon land containing hard rock and steep slopes. The Commonwealth Court reversed the grant of the variances, finding that the owner’s hardship did not result from unique property conditions because his neighbor’s property also contained rock and steep slopes.

In granting the variance and special exception, the Board made twenty-three findings of fact. It found that the building abuts a parking lot on one side and a three-story structure on the other. The Board found that the building had been used as a bank but has been vacant for many years. It also found that the area variance is necessary to use the structure most efficiently. The remaining findings of fact relate to Appellant’s proposed use of the property. The Board concluded that since the building has been vacant for many years, denying the area variance would be an undue hardship, and the lot is uniquely suited for the proposed use.</p>

Use of property as an institutional facility, however, is prohibited in a C-4 commercial district.
