Appellant and his co-conspirator worked as a team throughout the entire criminal episode which culminated in Miguel’s murder. They staked out the house together and the co-conspirator held the women and children at gunpoint in the living room while appellant dragged Iris throughout the house looking for money. They worked together to tie up their victims and they took turns watching the upstairs of the house for Miguel to arrive. In addition to the violence appellant inflicted upon the victim’s family, he repeatedly smashed Miguel’s head against the concrete basement floor, held him at gunpoint, allowed the co-conspirator to hold him at gunpoint, and conferred with the co-conspirator immediately before the fatal shot was fired.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> After stating that Miguel deserved to be shot, appellant fled <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>with the co-conspirator, leaving Miguel to die while his family stood by with their hands tied, unable to render assistance. These facts fully support the jury’s determination that appellant intended to facilitate Miguel’s death and, therefore, that he was guilty of first-degree murder. Thus, we conclude that appellant’s challenge that the evidence was insufficient to establish the requisite specific intent is without merit. Further, based upon our independent review of the record, we are satisfied that sufficient evidence was produced at trial from which the jury could have found each element of an intentional killing beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a),(d).</p>

When read in context, it becomes clear that the prosecutor’s reference to the conversation between appellant and his co-conspirator did not refer to non-record evidence. The fact that the conversation took place is not in dispute. The prosecutor merely drew the juror’s attention to the key pieces of evidence which demonstrated that appellant shared the specific intent to kill with his co-conspirator. The fact that the victim was a notorious drug dealer who was likely to seek revenge on appellant unless appellant killed him, that neighbors were likely to hear if numerous gunshots were fired from appellant’s smaller gun and the fact that the co-conspirator, who happened to be holding a more effective weapon, shot the victim immediately after the conversation with appellant, all help to establish appellant’s intent to have the co-conspirator kill the victim. The prosecutor did not state with certainty what words were spoken; rather, he merely pointed out to the jury that the surrounding evidence of the criminal episode can only lead to the reasonable and obvious inference that the conversation concerned killing the victim.

Accordingly, appellant is not entitled to a new trial on this basis.</p>

The prosecutor’s statements came after defense counsel’s closing argument in which defense counsel inferred that the emotions of the case rendered the identification testimony against appellant unreliable. The overriding theme of defense counsel’s argument was that the case against appellant was built on emotion rather than fact. For instance, defense counsel stated:</p>
