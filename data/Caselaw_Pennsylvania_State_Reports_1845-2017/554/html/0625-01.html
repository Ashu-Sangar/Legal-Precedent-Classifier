It is a moment of grave significance when we are constrained to nullify duly enacted statutes. But this Court must do as it is required to do when legislation not only encroaches into the procedural domain of the judicial system, but also conflicts with pre-existing procedural rules duly promulgated by this Court, as is the case here. Article V, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides as follows:</p>

The emphasized language imposes an affirmative obligation on this Court to suspend any statute which is inconsistent with pre-existing procedural rules promulgated by this Court. Accordingly, on August 11, 1997, this Court properly fulfilled its Constitutional obligation under Article V, Section 10 by suspending the statutory provisions which embodied CURA. In order to understand why this Court was compelled to so act, it is instructive first to understand what CURA purported to do.</p>

Instead, CURA purported to prescribe, with specificity, a detailed <em>procedure </em>by which courts were to administer capital cases, from the time the sentence of death was imposed by the jury until the time of its implementation. The most dramatic change which CURA purported to effectuate was the implementation of a <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>bifurcated, but simultaneous, post-trial review process at the trial court level for both post-sentence motions and collateral appeal. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9571(c)(suspended by this Court’s Order of August 11, 1997). CURA provided that a judgment becomes final for purposes of appeal only after the trial court’s disposition of the petition for collateral relief, and also specified that no direct appeal may take place until after the trial court has decided both the post-sentence motions and the collateral relief petition. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9571(b) (suspended by Order of August 11, 1997). CURA further specified that the direct appeal and collateral appeal were to occur simultaneously in one appellate proceeding. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9577(a)(suspend-ed by Order of August 11, 1997). CURA also implemented a variety of other procedural changes — some incidental to those detailed above and some independent of them— but it will suffice to discuss the manner in which the major provisions of simultaneous review, detailed above, were inconsistent with this Court’s pre-existing procedural rules.</p>

Thus, prior to the enactment of CURA, this Court had promulgated rules mandating that all post-conviction collateral review take place <em>subsequent </em>to exhaustion of the direct review process. CURA purported to directly contravene those rules. Since CURA directly conflicted with this Court’s pre-existing procedural rules governing both the direct and collateral appellate processes, this Court could not inquire at all into the wisdom of CURA as a policy matter. Instead, once this Court ascertained CURA’s inconsistency with its existing procedural rules, this Court was duty-bound to suspend CURA pursuant to the mandate embodied in Article V, Section 10 of our Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b693-6" data-blocks='[["BL_693.6",693,[208,1147,1155,1178]],["BL_694.1",694,[241,282,1155,95]]]'>Petitioner, the Attorney General, initially agrees that this Court may suspend laws “to the extent that they are inconsistent with rules prescribed under [Article V, Section 10].” Nevertheless, petitioner asserts that CURA is not inconsistent with any existing Court-promulgated rules since CURA prescribes a mechanism for “preappeal collateral review,” whereas the only mechanism presently promulgated by this Court is concerned with “postappeal” collateral review. However, the legislature cannot tautologically dissolve the palpable conflict between CURA and this Court’s rules simply by dubbing CURA “preappeal collateral review.” Indeed, the very crux of the inconsistency is that CURA purported to turn the exclusive process for obtaining collateral review in capital cases into a “preappeal” process, whereas the exclusive process embodied in this Court’s rules was, and is, a “postappeal” process. Under CURA, many of this Court’s procedural rules establishing a detailed “postappeal” process for collateral review would have been rendered wholly inoperative. This seems as clear a procedural conflict with this Court’s rules as is imaginable. While this Court does not question the good faith and laudable motives of either the legislature or those who seek to reinstate CURA, this Court cannot turn its back on a duty so clearly <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>enshrined in our Constitution — the duty to suspend laws which conflict with our own procedural rules.</p>
    <p id="b694-4" data-blocks='[["BL_694.4",694,[236,401,1160,1535]]]'>The driving force behind the enactment of CURA was undoubtedly the inordinate delay that has existed in the past between the imposition of the sentence of death by the jury and the carrying out of the death penalty. Indeed, under the former provisions of the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541 <em>et seq. </em>(“PCRA”), there was undue delay in this area, even in cases where the defendant chose not to seek collateral review. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em><a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">500 Pa. 16</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">454 A.2d 937</a> (1982)(execution occurring nine years after final resolution of collateral appeal); <em>Commonwealth v.

However, an examination of the historical record will reveal that the existing direct review and collateral review procedures were not the source of the undue delay in these cases. Instead, the source of the inordinate delay was the lack of a mandatory procedure for the issuance of death warrants by the Governor prior to the 1995 amendments to the PCRA. For example, in <em>Morganelli v. Casey, </em><a href="/pa-commw/166/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="166 Pa. Commw. 574" data-case-ids="1464378" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/166/0574-01">166 Pa.

In response to this situation, the legislature enacted 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(j) in 1995 as part of a series of amendments to the PCRA. The relevant section provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b694-5" data-blocks='[["BL_694.5",694,[279,1961,442,33]]]'>Issuance of warrant.—</blockquote>

Under these sections, capital prisoners may no longer idly sit by as they could previously, secure in the knowledge that they need not seek collateral relief unless and until the Governor exercises a wholly indeterminate duty to issue a death warrant. Similarly, no longer can capital prisoners be secure in the knowledge that if a Governor were to issue a death warrant, they would again be able to delay indefinitely the filing of their petition for collateral relief, for to do so would be to lose the right to file such a petition. The mandates of these two sections will achieve the underlying aims of CURA — namely, the elimination of the inordinate periods of delay formerly inherent in both the direct and collateral appellate review processes, thereby allowing the processes to advance in an orderly fashion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Thus, recent history demonstrates that since the artificial impediments to expeditious collateral review which previously existed have been removed, the PCRA courts and this Court have been able to resolve and should continue to be able to resolve these petitions in an appropriately expedient manner once a capital defendant's direct appeals are exhausted. Consequently, it is now manifest that the undue delays in capital cases were caused not by the bifurcation of the collateral appeal process from the direct appeal process, but instead by the ability of capital defendants to postpone indefinitely the collateral appeal process once their direct appeals were resolved.</p>
