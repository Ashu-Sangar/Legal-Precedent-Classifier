Appellant specifically maintains that counsel did not obtain records that would have aided the mental health experts who evaluated him, including school records reflecting a low IQ, a hospital record reflecting a fever at age two, and Department of Corrections records reflecting in part low achievement test scores and alcohol abuse.

However, the court found that counsel had a <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>reasonable basis for proceeding as they did. It explained that trial counsel employed two recognized experts in the field of psychiatry and psychology who administered tests, evaluated Appellant, and reported that there was nothing that could be used as mitigation evidence. Rather, the experts told counsel that Appellant was a sociopath. Counsel also obtained an evaluation by another psychiatrist who after evaluating Appellant, found nothing that would be beneficial in the penalty phase. Although counsel did not obtain the records identified above, the PCRA court found them not entirely helpful to Appellant and further found that counsel gave the experts whatever information they requested.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[213,927,1152,509]]]'>With respect to Appellant’s siblings’ testimony about his childhood, the PCRA court accepted trial counsel’s testimony that when they questioned Appellant and his family before trial, they did not reveal the information that they now claim should have been told to the jury. The court rejected the siblings’ testimony to the contrary. The court also stated that Appellant made contradictory statements to counsel during his representation and that counsel was reasonable in believing that their only avenue was to ask the jury to have mercy on him.</p>

In addition to concluding that counsel acted reasonably, we further find that Appellant’s claim lacks arguable merit. As recognized by the PCRA court, trial counsel employed three experts to evaluate Appellant. N.T., 3/28/96 at 68-69, 120-21. Based upon their testing, the experts found nothing helpful to Appellant’s case and diagnosed him as a sociopath. <em>Id. </em>at 122-23. The fact that Appellant now has found two experts who conclude that he has brain damage does not negate the fact that trial counsel investigated Appellant’s cognitive abilities with other experts. In addition, we agree with the PCRA court that under the facts of this case, counsel reasonably relied upon their discussions with Appellant and upon their experts to determine the records needed to evaluate his mental health and other potential <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>mitigating circumstances. <em>See </em>N.T., 3/29/96 at 27-28, 33, 38-39.

We disagree. A prosecutor’s comments do not constitute reversible error unless their unavoidable effect would be to prejudice the jury and form in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant such that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true penalty determination. <em>Commonwealth v.

Here, during deliberations in the penalty phase, the jury asked, “If a life sentence is imposed, is there any possibility of the Defendant ever being paroled?” I view this question as a clear expression of the jury’s concern about the defendant’s future dangerousness. I would therefore hold that the trial court’s refusal to explain the meaning of life without parole constituted error under <em>Commonwealth v. Clark, supra. </em>I would therefore reverse the order of the <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>court of common pleas and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[236,401,1152,523]]]'>I would go further and require an explanation of the meaning of a life sentence in all capital cases. There can be no harm in instructing juries that in Pennsylvania appellant would be statutorily ineligible for parole if sentenced to life in prison, but that a life sentence might nonetheless be commuted by the governor. On the other hand, if we do not so instruct, a jury, erroneously believing that a prisoner sentenced to life may be paroled within a period of years, may impose the death penalty for reasons which are not based in law.</p>
