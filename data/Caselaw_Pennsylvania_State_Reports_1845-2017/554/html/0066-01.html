Gibson testified that when he and appellant first arrived, they observed the victim’s two children asleep on the couch. Subsequently, appellant asked to speak to Williams in the bedroom. Gibson, who remained in the living room, testified that approximately fifteen minutes later, he heard loud voices, a “thump,” and the victim screaming, “he’s killing me.” Gibson immediately ran to the. bedroom, where he saw appellant standing over the victim, stabbing her repeatedly with a knife. Gibson testified that both appellant and the victim were nude from the waist down. Upon noticing Gibson in the room, appellant threatened Gibson that if he did not leave, appellant would kill him as well. Gibson immediately exited the apartment.</p>
    <p id="b146-7" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[254,2121,1159,205]],["BL_147.1",147,[202,276,1149,204]]]'>Approximately five minutes after Gibson exited the apartment and began walking towards his home, appellant caught up to him and tried to give him a knife with a broken handle. When Gibson refused to take the knife, appellant threw it <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>down a nearby sewer drain. Appellant and Gibson walked together to appellant’s residence, where appellant further threatened Gibson that if he ever said anything about what he had seen, appellant would implicate Gibson in the murder.</p>
    <p id="b147-4" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[201,502,1153,515]]]'>The next morning, the victim’s young children discovered their mother’s dead body and summoned a nearby pedestrian. After entering the apartment and observing the victim, the pedestrian called the police. The police arrived shortly thereafter and found the victim on her bed. An autopsy was conducted, revealing that the victim had suffered blunt force trauma injuries to her head and had been stabbed fifty-eight times in her chest, back and abdomen, fifteen times in her face, and twenty-eight times in her torso. Also, her throat had been slit.</p>
    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[201,1048,1153,630]]]'>On the front door of the victim’s apartment, Lancaster County police officers collected a bloody fingerprint sample. Expert testimony established a match between this fingerprint and fingerprints that had been taken from appellant. During the autopsy of the victim, a pubic hair was recovered from the victim’s vagina. Expert testimony established that this hair shared the same “microscopic characteristics” as hair samples taken from appellant in 1988 and 1992,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that it was “very unlikely” to find two individuals who shared the same microscopic characteristics.

Gibson testified that he reported the murder at that late date because he was tired of being threatened and afraid. In February of 1992, in spite of appellant’s repeated denials of involvement and denials that he had ever been in the victim’s apartment, appellant was arrested and charged with the murder. At the time of his arrest, appellant again denied that he had ever been in the victim’s apartment or that he even knew <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>the victim. However, at trial, appellant testified that he had engaged in consensual intercourse with the victim but that Gibson had subsequently killed her.</p>

In light of the overwhelming physical evidence, which corroborated Gibson’s eyewitness testimony, the jury was entitled to disbelieve appellant’s account of the night in question, which itself conflicted with appellant’s prior accounts. The jury was entitled to infer appellant’s specific intent to kill based on, <em>inter alia, </em>his use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim’s body. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Subsequently, officers moved appellant to an office in the detectives’ division for questioning. As a detective began reading appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant interrupted the detective, proclaimed his innocence and stated that he had never been to the victim’s apartment. After this unsolicited statement, appellant made a telephone call lasting twenty-seven minutes. Subsequently, as detectives repeatedly tried to inform him that they could not discuss his case unless he knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant again proclaimed his innocence and asserted that he had never been to the victim’s apartment. Although appellant’s statements were made before he was fully “Mirandized,” the record amply supports the suppression court’s finding that the statements were spontaneously volunteered while investigators were attempting to give appellant his Miranda warnings and immediately after appellant completed his phone call. Therefore, the statements were properly admitted. Moreover, the trial court properly admitted several other exculpatory statements that appellant made to police before his arrest (and after he had <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>been fully Mirandized) which were virtually identical in substance to the challenged statements. Hence, even if the challenged statements were improperly admitted, the error was harmless.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[262,537,1161,479]]]'>Appellant next argues that even if the statements were spontaneously uttered, they were nevertheless involuntarily uttered since they were the product of an inherently coercive environment.

All attendant circumstances surrounding the confession must be considered, including: the duration and methods of the interrogation; the length of the delay between arrest and arraignment; the conditions of detainment; the attitudes of police toward the defendant; the defendant’s physical and psychological state; and all other conditions present which may serve to drain one’s power of resistance to suggestion or undermine one’s self-determination. <em>See <a href="/pa/521/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="521 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1817459" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0423-01">id.</a> </em>Here, appellant’s spontaneous utterances were not rendered involuntary simply because he had a pair of handcuffs on his hands and a minor preexisting cut on his finger.

Immediately after this telephone call, appellant spontaneously reiterated his innocence and his assertion that he had never been in the victim’s apartment.

The four black-and-white photographs at issue were offered by the Commonwealth to corroborate the description of Detective Dennis Arnold regarding the crime scene and the condition in which the victim was found. Furthermore, defense counsel called a pathologist to testify as to the conclusions that could be drawn from the blood smear patterns seen on the victim in the photographs. The Commonwealth also called a pathologist who drew contrary conclusions to those of the defense expert. The photographs provided the jury with a point of reference by which to evaluate the testimony of these conflicting expert witnesses. The jury viewed two of the photographs for ap<a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>proximately twenty-seven (27) seconds and the other two photographs for forty-one (41) seconds.

Here, the use of the exact words to which appellant testified would not have diluted the point that the prosecutor was making — that someone with a “frozen” state of mind cannot very well engage in planned, deliberative activity. Therefore, we find that the prosecutor’s use of the words “comatose mind” instead of “froze” or “state of shock” did not have the effect of unavoidably prejudicing the jury with fixed <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>bias and hostility towards appellant.

Appellant contends that by stating, “I’m keeping it to myself,” the prosecutor improperly referred to appellant’s post-arrest silence.

Since the prosecutor here was merely suggesting that certain conclusions could not be drawn from appellant’s post-arrest statements, the prosecutor did not thereby engage in any misconduct and this claim merits no relief.
