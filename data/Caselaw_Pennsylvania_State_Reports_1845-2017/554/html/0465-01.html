    <p id="b533-4" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[206,737,1153,1019]]]'>The first element, misconduct, was clearly present, inasmuch as it was inappropriate and unacceptable behavior for an attorney or any other person conducting business in a courtroom to make such a remark. See <em>Commonwealth v. Falana, </em><a href="/pa/548/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="548 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="960446" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0156-01">548 Pa. 156</a>, 162, <a href="/a2d/696/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="696 A.2d 126" data-case-ids="12020939,12020989,960446,960464" data-case-paths="/a2d/696/0126-01,/a2d/696/0126-02,/pa/548/0156-01,/pa/548/0155-01">696 A.2d 126</a>, 129 (1997) (contemptuous misconduct is behavior that is inappropriate to the actor). Likewise, with regard to the second element, there is no dispute that the objectionable comment was made in the presence of the court. Insofar as the third element, which relates to Williams’ intent, there is less certainty. Opposing counsel claimed that Williams made the remark “under his breath.” There is no indication that the remark was even heard by the court. The amplitude of such a remark can have a bearing on whether it was intended to obstruct the proceedings. Nevertheless, we have said that “when an individual makes a remark in the courtroom while the judge is physically present, he cannot avoid a conviction for contempt simply because the judge did not hear him speak the words in question.” <em>Falana, </em>548 Pa. at 162, <a href="/a2d/696/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="696 A.2d 126" data-case-ids="12020939,12020989,960446,960464" data-case-paths="/a2d/696/0126-01,/a2d/696/0126-02,/pa/548/0156-01,/pa/548/0155-01">696 A.2d at 129</a>.</p>
