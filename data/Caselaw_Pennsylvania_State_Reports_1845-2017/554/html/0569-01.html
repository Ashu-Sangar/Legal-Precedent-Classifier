The police observed Appellant and her husband, as they arrived at 702 State Street in a Budget Rent-A-Van. After the van stopped, the officers approached, identified themselves, and explained that they were investigating the involvement of Appellant and her husband in drug trafficking. The police then administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thereafter, both Appellant and Dean Myers indicated that the van contained marijuana.</p>

Appellant was arrested, and charged with one count of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance and one count of criminal conspiracy.</p>

At trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Ms. Beverly Beshore-Strohm, the forensic scientist who conducted the police lab testing of the vegetable material at the Pennsylvania State Police Lab in Harrisburg. Beshore-Strohm’s testimony confirmed that the substance in question was marijuana. With regard to weight, Beshore-Strohm testified that she ascertained the weight with a Metier top-loading balance, and determined it to be 10.04 pounds. She stated that there was a variation in the scale of plus or minus one gram (.003 lb.), but that even with the variation, the marijuana weighed ten pounds and eighteen grams. Regarding the procedures to maintain the scale’s accuracy, Beshore-Strohm initially testified that the manufacturer came to the police lab to calibrate the scale on a yearly basis, but then later admitted that because the scale was still relatively new, she weighed the marijuana in question before the manufacturer came to the lab for the scale’s first yearly calibration. On cross-examination, Beshore-Strohm conceded that she did not verify the accuracy of the scale with a known weight prior to weighing the marijuana in question.</p>

At a June 20, 1995 sentencing hearing, no additional evidence was presented by either party regarding the weight of the marijuana. The Honorable George E. Hoffer sentenced Appellant to one to five years imprisonment pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508(a)(l)(i),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which imposes a mandatory minimum of one <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>year imprisonment for possession with the intent to deliver two to ten pounds of marijuana. The Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, claiming the sentence did not comport with the mandatory minimum for possession of ten to fifty pounds of marijuana, and was therefore too lenient. The Superior Court concluded that the sentencing court committed a manifest abuse of discretion, vacated the judgment of sentence, and remanded for resentencing in accordance with 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508(a)(1)(ii), which imposes a mandatory minimum of three years imprisonment for possession with the intent to deliver ten to fifty pounds of marijuana. We granted allocatur to determine whether the Superior Court applied an erroneous standard of review, and substituted its own assessment of the facts for that of the sentencing court. For the reasons outlined below, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court, and reinstate the sentence of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

She testified that this balance was calibrated by Metier prior to it being sent to the lab. (N.T. 3/27/95 p. 37). She testified that a representative from Metier would check the lab’s balances on a yearly basis. (N.T. 3/27/95 pp. 23, 35). While on cross examination it was elicited that the weighing in question took place prior to Metier having checked the calibration, her testimony also made clear that this was so because this particular weighing occurred within a few months of the machine’s purchase at a time when Metier was not yet scheduled to check the calibration. (N.T. 3/27/95 pp. 23-24; 35-37). She testified further that this particular machine was designed with an internal calibration mechanism which required that one simply push a button prior to each weighing whereupon the machine would self-calibrate. She explained that a known weight is not placed on this type of balance to determine if it is calibrated correctly. She testified further that she performed this self-calibration function immediately prior to her having weighed this particular marijuana. (N.T. 3/27/95 p. 35-36). When asked to explain in more detail the calibration mechanics of this machine, she testified that there are two distinct types of balances, one that is externally calibrated by placing a weight thereon; the other being one such as that used here which has all the numbers factored into the machine and which calibrates itself when that function is executed. Immediately thereafter, she was asked whether she had, in this instance, put a known weight on the balance prior to weighing this marijuana to which she responded “no.” (N.T. 3/27/95 37-38). However, as noted above, she had just testified that on a balance such as the one used here, it was not necessary to place a known weight on the scale to determine whether it is correctly calibrated.</p>

First, I believe the Majority misinterprets the Superior Court’s decision when the Majority, at page 653, finds that the Superior Court improperly concluded that the weight of the marijuana was an “adjudicated fact” of the jury. A fair reading of the entire Superior Court opinion reveals that the “adjudicated fact” to which it refers is the jury’s finding that Appellant possessed the package of marijuana; not that the weight of the marijuana was adjudicated by the jury. On this point, I interpret the Superi- or Court as noting that since the jury convicted Appellant of possessing this precise package of marijuana, and since the package was not capable of apportionment, and since, as already determined by that Court, the package was later determined by a preponderance of the evidence to weigh in excess of 10 pounds, the trial court, in deciding to sentence Appellant consistent with having possessed less than 10 pounds, in effect, improperly redetermined the adjudicated fact that she possessed the package.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

While the Majority recognizes this to be the appropriate standard of review, it seemingly disregards it by concluding, in essence, that a trial court’s findings are absolute. I submit that a review of the comments uttered by the court at sentencing supports the Superior Court’s conclusions insofar as they evidence a deliberate attempt to sentence Appellant to a more lenient sentence, not because the evidence failed to establish that the marijuana weighed at least 10 pounds, but rather, solely because the court felt she deserved a less severe sentence than her husband and son. Such discretionary sentencing is explicitly precluded by the mandatory sentencing scheme of section 7508.</p>

I point out as well that I disagree with the Majority's initial conclusion that the Superior Court improperly applied the manifest abuse of discretion standard. As the Majority so notes, “abuse of discretion” simply means that the appellate court is of the opinion that the trial court committed an error of law. In this instance, the Superior Court believed that the record evidence established that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the marijuana weighed in excess of 10 pounds and that the trial court, therefore, committed an error of law.</p>
