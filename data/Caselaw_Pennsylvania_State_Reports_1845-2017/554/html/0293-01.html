Appellant dated Tara Hodge on and off during the time period beginning in early 1993 until February 1995, when Hodge discovered that appellant had another girlfriend. They did not see each other for over a year, until March 30, 1996, when appellant re-established an intimate relationship with Hodge. Between March 30, 1996 and the night of the incident in question, Hodge was with appellant for one night on both March 30 and April 30, four days between May 10 and 13, and <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>one night on June 1,1996. Hodge met Rashawn Bass on May 26, 1996, after she responded to a personal ad in the local paper. On June 10, 1996, Hodge broke off the relationship with appellant by letter.</p>

Following her shift, Hodge met Bass at her apartment, located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where they had a pizza delivered. After eating the pizza, Bass took a shower. Shortly after midnight, while Bass was in the shower, appellant arrived at the apartment of Tara Hodge. Hodge let him into her apartment. Upon finding that Hodge had a guest at her apartment appellant and Hodge had an argument. Appellant requested that Hodge ask Bass to leave. When Hodge refused to ask Bass to leave, appellant pulled a gun out of his “sweats,” which he pointed at Hodge and shot her. Hodge heard three shots. Appellant ran by Hodge, and she fell to the floor, unconscious.</p>

The police arrived at the neighbor’s house and saw that Hodge had a head wound. Unable to speak, Hodge wrote a note directing the police to her apartment. The ambulance arrived and took Hodge to the hospital. The officer went to Hodge’s apartment and found Bass’ body in the shower. After leaving the apartment, the officer went to the hospital to speak with Tara Hodge. At the hospital, Hodge identified appellant as the person who had shot her.</p>

Bass was shot in the ear, the left side of his head, his upper and lower right chest, the lower left chest, the side of his left arm, and the back of his right hand. Twelve empty 9 millimeter shell casings were found in the apartment. The bullets from the empty shell casings were all fired from the same gun, which was manufactured by one of four possible companies, one of which was Lorcin. In Tara Hodge’s apartment, the police found a note<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>book containing appellant’s pager number. Following this, the police obtained an arrest warrant charging appellant with criminal homicide of Rashawn Bass, attempted criminal homicide of Tara Hodge and other related charges. The arrest warrant was forwarded to Prince George’s County, Maryland, where appellant was residing at his parents’ home. The following day, July 1, the Prince George’s County police paged appellant. Twenty minutes later, appellant returned the call from a local shopping center. The police did not answer the call, but proceeded directly to the shopping center where they observed appellant playing video games. The police then arrested appellant at 4:00 p.m.</p>

Appellant was advised of his Miranda rights and signed a written waiver. Appellant told police that he had last been in Carlisle at the end of May or beginning of June. In response to whether he knew anyone in Carlisle, appellant stated that he knew Tara Hodge and her family. Appellant also told police that he had spent June 29 through the afternoon of June 30 in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. Appellant also told police that he had owned a 9 millimeter handgun, which had been stolen by his niece’s boyfriend before June, and a 380 handgun, which he had sold. At 6:00 p.m., Detective Fones told appellant he was charged with criminal homicide in Carlisle and read a portion of the arrest warrant to him. Appellant then asked whether “Tara is okay.” The detective told appellant that she was okay and that she had identified appellant as the shooter. The appellant then dropped his head and moved it side to side. He denied any involvement in the shootings.</p>

Accordingly, because the photographs were of limited, if any, probative value and were highly prejudicial, we find that they were erroneously admitted into evidence by the trial court.</p>

Next we must determine whether such erroneously admitted evidence contributed to the verdict in the instant case. Evidence was presented at trial that established appellant’s intent. Hodge testified that appellant arrived at her apartment with a gun. (N.T. 81). Testimony at trial established that appellant first shot Hodge before proceeding to the bathroom where the victim was showering. In addition, Dr. Samuel Land testified that four of the six gunshots entered vital portions of Bass’ body and that any one of the four gunshots alone could have cause the victim’s death. (N.T. 177-180). Moreover, there was more than ample evidence in addition to the evidence now being challenged that appellant had prior knowledge and experience with guns, including 9 millimeter guns. At trial, testimony established that: appellant was in possession of the documents related to a 9 millimeter Lorcin handgun; 9 millimeter ammunition was found during the search of appellant’s girlfriend’s home; and, appellant told the police at the time of his arrest that he had owned a 9 millimeter gun, which was stolen by his niece’s boyfriend. In addition, testimony had established that appellant had prior experience with guns through his training in the United States Army Reserves. These photographs were merely cumulative of other substantially similar uncontested evidence admitted at trial. Accordingly, this court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneously admitted photographs did not contribute to the verdict in the instant case.</p>

      <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Appellant next contends that the Bulldog 44 SPL revolver was improperly admitted because there was no evidence that appellant had used the .44 in the commission of the instant killing. The trial court concluded that the evidence was relevant in order to support the testimony that appellant was carrying the gun in his waistband at the time of the murder. Hodge testified that appellant pulled the gun out of his “sweats” and shot her. (N.T. 81). A police officer testified that people often wrap rubber bands around the barrel of a gun to hold the gun in their waistbands. (N.T. 154). The .44 that was found during the search of appellant’s home had rubber bands wrapped around the gun barrel. (N.T. 154). Thus, the Commonwealth argued and the court agreed that the .44 was relevant to show that appellant did indeed pull the gun out of his “sweats” and that appellant had knowledge and experience in the use and possession of handguns.</p>

First, there was never any doubt that the murder weapon was a 9 millimeter gun, thus the introduction of the .44 was not relevant to the inquiry of whether the appellant had a weapon or implement suitable to commit the instant crime. In addition, Tara Hodge testified that appellant pulled a gun out of his sweats and shot her; and that the gun that appellant used was black and silver. This testimony was not disputed. We fail to see how testimony regarding where appellant had the gun on his person was of any value to the instant inquiry. Accordingly, where the testimony did not establish that rubber bands were in fact used in conjunction with the murder weapon, nor was there any testimony that would even tangentially implicate the use of a .44 in the commission of the murder, we find that the Bulldog Pug 44 SPL did not establish a material fact in the instant case and thus, was erroneously admitted into evidence at trial.</p>

At trial, Hodge testified that the appellant was the shooter in the instant case. Testimony at trial also established that when the police first approached appellant he gave an alias to the police. Use of an alias has been recognized as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. <em>Commonwealth v. Collins, </em><a href="/pa/440/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="440 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1932253" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0368-01">440 Pa. 368</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20882" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="269 A.2d 882">269 A.2d 882</a> (1970). In addition, Officer Bartos testified that immediately after reading the criminal homicide portion of the arrest warrant to appellant, appellant asked if “Tara is okay.” (N.T. 145). In addition, the evidence admitted at trial, which is uncontested here, established that appellant had the paperwork for a 9 millimeter Lorcin gun in his possession and a Maryland State Police application to purchase a 9 millimeter firearm. Moreover, the Commonwealth made it clear that the .44 was not used in the commission of the crime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> (N.T. 154).

Clearly, these items were not relevant to the inquiry of whether appellant committed the crime in question, where there was absolutely nothing in the case that even remotely connected the bulletproof vest to any of the issues in the case. As the trial court noted in its post-trial opinion, “we do not believe that the admission of the bulletproof vest and the picture of it in defendant’s drawer logically tended to establish a material fact in the case.” We believe that this logic also extends to the .44 cartridges. Thus, as the trial court acknowledged, it erroneously admitted these items into evidence.</p>

The trial court held that the reason why appellant had the guns in the house was not relevant to the inquiry of whether he used a gun on Bass and Hodge. Although normally we would agree with the trial court’s assessment, we are troubled by the fact that the Commonwealth implied that the reason that appellant possessed guns was so he would feel like a “big city man.” (N.T. 273). Moreover, the Commonwealth stated in its closing arguments that appellant’s possession of guns showed that he had the capability to form the specific intent to kill. (N.T. 273). The testimony of Mrs. Robinson was relevant to refute the Commonwealth’s contention that appellant possessed guns merely to be a “big city man.” Mrs. Robinson’s testimony would have offered a different explanation of why appellant had guns in the home — to protect the household, which included two nieces under the age of fifteen.</p>
