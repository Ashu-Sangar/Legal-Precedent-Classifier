Poserina, Jr.), the Clerk of Court for the United States District Court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court of America, have had to undertake herculean efforts to try to sift through the numerous and at times meritless filings made by the attorneys proceeding on Heidnik’s behalf. In fact, the United States Supreme Court, after a hearing, deliberated until approximately 10:00 p.m., Friday, April 18, 1997 to review the issue of whether Heidnik had competently chosen to forgo all attempts to stay his execution. Heidnik has repeatedly stated since his sentence was imposed that he did not want his sentence appealed and that he wanted no efforts undertaken on his behalf to stop his execution. At a whirlwind pace, the United States Supreme Court rendered its ruling reversing and vacating the order of the Third Circuit, and reinstating the order of the Honorable Franklin S. Van Antwerpen of the United States District Court for the Eastern <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>District of Pennsylvania, that Heidnik was competent to make a decision to forgo all attempts to stay his execution.</p>

The Commonwealth promptly responded.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[251,792,1155,313]]]'>A <em>per curiam </em>order temporarily staying Heidnik’s execution pending further action .by this Court was entered by this Court on April 18, 1997. The Commonwealth attempted to have this Court’s stay order vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court but its motion was dismissed at approximately 12:40 a.m., April 19,1997.</p>

With respect to the “Next Friend” issue, this Court has already stated that it finds the standards of <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em><a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">495 U.S. 149</a>, <a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">110 S.Ct. 1717</a>, <a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">109 L.Ed.2d 135</a> (1990) as “persuasive” and allowed the execution of Keith Zettlemoyer based upon its holding that <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas </em>precluded “Next Friend” standing in <em>Zettlemoyer. See Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em>No. 107 Capital Docket (filed May 2, 1995). Notwithstanding this Court’s adoption of the Whitmore standard in 1995, resulting in an execution, three members of this Court at this time now disregard the standard insofar as it is to be applied to Heidnik’s execution now pending.</p>

This standard has plainly not been met. In view of the order in <em>Zettlemoyer, </em>it is <em>not </em>likely that Heidnik will prevail on the merits with respect to the “Next Friend” issue, unless of course, this Court chooses to reverse it’s prior holding. Since there is virtually no merit to the “Next Friend” issue, third parties, quite simply, have <em>no </em>standing to <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>seek review or otherwise make any filing on behalf of Heidnik. He has specifically stated that he does not want third parties intervening on his behalf to stop his execution.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[208,457,1152,413]]]'>Accordingly, the application to stay Heidnik’s execution should be denied and no further review should be permitted by filings made by third parties against Heidnik’s wishes. I would further note that eleventh hour tactics such as those employed by Mr. Ñolas and his colleagues can unnecessarily jeopardize the interests of a client, and are inexcusable, especially where the interests at stake are literally a matter of life or death.</p>
