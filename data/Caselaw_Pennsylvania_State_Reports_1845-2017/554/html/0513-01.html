While in police custody, Bernstein identified Appellant as the driver of the vehicle and furthermore told the police that the burglary was Appellant’s idea and that he would be willing to testify against Appellant and Shaw.

A hearing was scheduled on this motion for July 23, 1982, and the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office obtained an order granting Bernstein immunity so that he could testify at this hearing.

That evening the three met and drove the car to within a block of Bernstein’s apartment. Raifer called Bernstein and established that he was home and Appellant instructed Raifer to leave and return to the apartment later in the evening with the car.

At this point Bernstein was rendered immobile and Appellant and Shaw dragged their victim to Raifer’s waiting automobile, leaving a thirty-foot long trail of blood stains, and threw him into the trunk. Appellant, Raifer and Shaw got into the car and drove with Bernstein still moaning in the trunk, for seven miles to a point on the River Road on the Delaware River. Appellant and Shaw then took Bernstein out of the trunk and as they began to throw Bernstein’s body into the river, Appellant told Raifer to drive back to the main road and wait for them.

By this time the girl was hysterical and corroborated Satinsky’s suspicion that it was Bernstein that he heard being beaten and dragged off in an automobile. They both went out to the street and saw the trail of blood and Bernstein’s girlfriend, Lisa Rothbarth, called the police giving them information which led them to look for Raifer’s car. Within a few hours, the police intercepted Raifer at her home and seized the blood-soaked car.
