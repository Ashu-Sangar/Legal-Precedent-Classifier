    <p id="b344-4" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[246,364,1158,411]]]'>A drug interdiction unit of the Pennsylvania State Police, Bureau of Drug Enforcement Tactical Narcotics was on duty at the Philadelphia International Airport on September 23, 1994. The purpose of the drug interdiction unit was to observe and investigate travelers who arrive from “source cities.” “Source cities” are those locations from which bulk quantities of drugs are subdivided and distributed to other locations.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[241,815,1163,734]]]'>Trooper William Knightly, a member of the unit, was on duty on September 23, 1994, when U.S. Air flight 412 arrived at approximately 6:00 a.m. Flight 412 was a nonstop flight from Los Angeles, California (a source city) to Philadelphia. Trooper Knightly observed the departing passengers, including Boswell. He testified that when Boswell exited the plane, she appeared nervous. She continuously looked around, repeatedly looked over her shoulder, and walked unusually slowly down the corridor toward the baggage claim area. Trooper Knightly, together with two other members of his unit and two officers from the Philadelphia Police Department, followed Boswell to the baggage claim area. All of the officers were dressed in plain clothes and did not display their weapons.</p>
    <p id="b344-6" data-blocks='[["BL_344.6",344,[237,1590,1162,743]]]'>Boswell retrieved a gray tweed suitcase, which a skycap carried. The officers continued to follow Boswell when she and the skycap exited the airport and proceeded to walk down the concourse. Officer Howard, a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, and Trooper Knightly approached Boswell and stood approximately two to three feet in front of her. Two other officers stood in the vicinity behind them and another officer stood off to the side. Directly behind Boswell was the walkway to the next terminal and there was a wall “a couple of feet” away to one side of Boswell. On the other side was the roadway for taxis and buses. The officers immediately identified themselves as law enforcement officers and displayed their badges. There is no indication that Boswell knew that the other officers standing in the vicinity were present.</p>

He then inquired whether she had been travelling. She responded that she had been travelling, and that she had arrived from Los Angeles. He requested to see her ticket, which she gave him. The ticket verified that Boswell had arrived on the direct flight from Los Angeles, but was in the name of Crystal Roger Parker. The officers were unaware at this point that the ticket was in a name other than Boswell’s true name. Officer Howard pointed to the gray tweed suitcase and asked if it was Boswell’s bag. She said that it was.</p>

As Officer Howard was opening the lock with a pen, Boswell told Trooper Knightly that someone else had packed the bag, and asked her to deliver it to Philadelphia. She also told him that she did not pay for the ticket and her name was not on the ticket. After successfully opening the lock, Officer Howard discovered nine packages of marijuana wrapped in cellophane in the suitcase. The officers then placed Boswell under arrest, and charged her with knowingly and intentionally <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>possessing a controlled substance,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">1</a> and possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

They inquired whether they could ask her some questions, and she agreed. One of the officers asked if she had just come in on the train, to which she stated yes, she had just come from New York. When the officer questioned whether she had a ticket or receipt, she responded that she did not. She further revealed that she did not have any identification, but told the officers her name. Jermaine then asked why they had stopped her. The officer replied that they were part of a narcotics interdiction team that was “going to stop the flow of narcotics in Philadelphia by way of Amtrak trains.” <em>Id. </em>at 506, <a href="/pa-super/399/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="399 Pa.

The Superior Court held that the evidence should not be suppressed because this interaction did not rise to the level of a seizure. The court reached this conclusion based on the following facts: the officers did not display their weapons or otherwise exert their authority to suggest coercion; neither officer physically blocked Jermaine’s path; the officers did not speak to her in a threatening manner; and, although they identified themselves as members of a drug interdiction unit, they did not inform Jermaine that they suspected her of drug activity.

The officers inquired about her route then asked to see her ticket, and she complied. When asked if she had any identification, Lidge responded that she did not and queried whether she had done anything wrong. The officers explained that she had not done anything wrong, but they were patrolling the airport and she matched the “drug courier profile,” which inspired them to speak with her. They asked her if she would mind if they searched her bag and informed her she did not have to consent and the inquiry would end. She agreed to let them search her bag, and the officers found cocaine.

In <em>Todd, </em>two officers were on patrol as part of a drug interdiction program at the Pittsburgh International Airport when they noticed Carletta Todd (Todd) disembark from a flight from Miami, Florida (a source city). The officers noted that she walked deliberately and awkwardly, as if something were restricting the movement of her legs. After seeing her carry-on luggage go through the x-ray machine at the security check and noticing two oblong packages, they approached her and identified themselves. Both officers were in plain clothes. They questioned her about where she had been, asked to see her ticket, and requested identification. She replied that she had been in Florida visiting family, but <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>she had no identification. They asked for consent to search Todd’s suitcase, and explained that she had the right to refuse. Todd consented, but then retracted her consent and refused.

Because this was inconsistent with her prior statement that she had been visiting family, the officers decided to conduct a pat-down search, which revealed four plastic bags of cocaine taped to Todd’s belly.

The officers asked to speak with the two men. Lewis and Bradley backed away from the officers, who followed for approximately five to ten feet until the men were backed up to a wall with benches.

      <em>OPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL</em>
    </p>
    <p class="author" id="b355-7" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[240,610,300,38]]]'>NIGRO, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b355-8" data-blocks='[["BL_355.7",355,[197,673,1152,259]]]'>I respectfully disagree with the Opinion in Support of Affirmance. For the following reasons I believe that the interaction between Boswell and the officers at the airport constituted a seizure and that the evidence thereby obtained should have been suppressed.</p>
    <p id="b355-9" data-blocks='[["BL_355.8",355,[198,955,1152,688]]]'>The officers claim they made an investigatory stop of Ms. Boswell at the airport because she fit several criteria related to drug traffickers, including, <em>inter alia, </em>she arrived non-stop from a “source city,” she appeared nervous, walking unusually slowly, while repeatedly looking over her shoulder. While I acknowledge the need for police to conduct intervention activities to prevent the influx of drugs and drug traffickers into the Commonwealth, I do not now address my concerns as to the adequacy of the factual basis on which this subject was stopped. I take issue, however, with police protestations that Ms. Boswell knew she was free to leave, free to refuse a search of her ticket and her luggage and that she was free to refuse to submit to their questions.</p>
    <p id="b355-10" data-blocks='[["BL_355.9",355,[199,1668,1150,412]]]'>Simply because police are plainclothed, and do not display their firearms, or that they speak in a conversational tone and couch their demands as polite requests, does not obviate that they are the police and that that, in and of itself, is intimidating. Without weapons, commands or threats of any kind, they demonstrate their authority merely by displaying their badges and, from that moment forward, the average citizen does not feel “free to leave.”</p>
    <p id="b355-11" data-blocks='[["BL_355.10",355,[201,2112,1150,203]],["BL_356.1",356,[264,270,1163,849]]]'>I would call on the Court to end the charade of these coercive detentions which, at suppression hearings, masquerade as mere encounters wherein the subject “willingly” consented to the search and the questioning. An average citizen <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>under the circumstances would not understand that she was free to leave. Therefore, I would require that police randomly-stopping someone on the basis of such a drug courier profile be required to, <em>minimally </em>inform the subject 1) that they are the police; 2) that they are investigating drug traffickers; 3) that while they would like to question the subject ... to see identification or a ticket ... would like consent to look into subject’s bag, box, luggage, etc., the subject is not required to comply and is <em>free to leave </em>without further delay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">1</a> I would require that at each successive request police must explicitly inform the subject that she is free to refuse to cooperate, and free to leave. It is only by ascertaining that such explicit release was articulated that the courts can determine that the subject understood her right to refuse to cooperate and that she made an informed waiver of her right to leave, refuse to answer, and/or refuse a search.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[260,1154,1160,364]]]'>Therefore, as I believe that an ordinary reasonable — and innocent — person would not have understood her rights under the facts presented, I cannot conclude other than that Ms. Boswell was intimidated by the authority asserted and did not make an informed, knowing waiver of such rights. I agree with the trial court’s grant of the motion to suppress and would, therefore, reverse the Superior Court decision.</p>
