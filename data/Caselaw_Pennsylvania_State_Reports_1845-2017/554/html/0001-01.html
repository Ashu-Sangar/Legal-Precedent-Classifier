Yet, he urges us to ignore that precept and independently determine White’s credibility. We decline to do so.

Application of this standard to the facts at hand shows that in neither instance did the trial court judge abuse his discretion. As to Juror No. 11, the unexplained tardiness of one juror was delaying a complicated capital case in which three co-defendants were on trial. We cannot say that the trial court judge, under such circumstances, abused his discretion in dismissing Juror No. 11. We also cannot say that the trial court judge abused his discretion in dismissing Juror No. 7. The judge stated in voir dire that he was not going to strike Juror No. 7 for cause because he believed that the trial would be done prior to the date on which her vacation was to begin. Events did not unfold as the judge had anticipated they would, and in light of changed circumstances, he felt it incumbent upon himself to dismiss Juror No. 7.

Appellant focuses on that portion of Ms. Anderson’s testimony where she described how she recognized Appellant when she walked into the courtroom to testify at the trial. Ms. Anderson testified that a few weeks prior to the murder of her brothers, Appellant had come to New York City to meet with her brothers.

Furthermore, Ms. Anderson’s complete recitation of how she recognized Appellant was critical to establishing the credibility of her identification to the jury considering the lapse of time between her brief introduction to Appellant and her viewing him four years later at his trial.
