Indeed, application of the doctrine of relaxed waiver in a PCRA proceeding runs afoul of the very terms of the Post-Conviction Relief Act, which excludes waived issues from the class of cognizable PCRA claims. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3). Upon reaching this stage of the criminal process, one who has not exercised the constitutional right to self representation has had the benefit of counsel at trial, on direct appeal, and in prosecuting the PCRA petition. Nevertheless, this court, in recognition of the fallibility of counsel and the daunting task of defending a person on trial for his life, has already considered any issues which trial counsel failed to present which were raised by counsel on direct appeal. Any meritorious claims which escape counsel’s recognition on direct appeal can then be raised on grounds of counsel’s ineffectiveness. We find these safeguards adequate to ensure the fairness of verdicts in capital cases, and that the negligible benefits of relaxed waiver at the PCRA appellate stage are more than outweighed by the need for finality and efficient use of the resources of this court.

Appellant contends that the prosecutor should not have been permitted to introduce evidence that Appellant beat his wife and engaged in an extramarital affair. Further, Appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking questions which implied that Appellant had been both unfaithful to his wife and had beaten her at times which were beyond the period for which the trial court had ruled such evidence admissible.

These questions were put to Appellant in response to his testimony that he had only hit his wife 4 or 5 times and only within a few months of the fire. <em>See </em>N.T., 8/5/80, at 59-63. Trial counsel did not object, nor could he have expected success if he did. The prosecutor’s questions regarding prior instances of bruising on Carolyn Albrecht and the abortive attempt to examine Appellant regarding a marriage proposal to a woman in North Carolina tended to impeach Appellant’s testimony that his marital difficulties were of recent origin. Previous counsel’s failure in this regard does not warrant relief because it is an inconsequential matter in light of the scant prejudice emanating from this inquiry when viewed alongside the numerous properly admitted instances of more recent violence by Appellant toward his wife.

The jury’s acceptance that arson was the cause of the fire was crucial. The identity of the arsonist was a substantially lower hurdle, which could be readily inferred without any evidence that Appellant had threatened to burn the house. The prosecution did this through the pattern of violence and hostility Appellant exhibited toward his wife, his attempts to purchase a can of gasoline, the discovery of an empty can of gas in his car, and his appearance following the fire. The purported threats were numerous and the exclusion of one, even the one closest in time to the fire, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the threat at issue was either corroborated or refuted, depending on one’s view, by Alfred Albrecht, Jr., the supposed declarant, who said that Appellant had threatened to burn Carolyn Albrecht’s dress, not the house. This latter version was corroborated by Officer Heckenswiler of the Perkasie Police Department, who responded to the report of the disturbance at the Albrecht home during which Appellant uttered <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>the disputed threat.

Appellant maintains that the PCRA court abused its discretion when it denied his motion, in January 1996, to allow Attorney Elgart to withdraw <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>as his appointed post-conviction counsel and appoint David Wycoff, an attorney from the Post Conviction Defender Organization. Appellant initially made this request on January 4, 1996, citing Mr. Elgart’s dearth of experience in death penalty cases, which the court denied on January 12, 1996. He repeated this request in a motion for reconsideration, explaining that Mr. Elgart’s representation was ineffective and that he had lost confidence in Mr. Elgart’s ability to present his claim of innocence supported by new scientific evidence and that reappointment would streamline the disposition of the petition by avoiding the later litigation of Elgart’s asserted ineffectiveness. This too the court denied, by an order dated the day following the court’s order denying post-conviction relief. Attorney Elgart was appointed in January of 1994 and the trial court ordered him to brief the issues he wished to have decided in August 1995. At that time, the court was made aware of the Post Conviction Defender Organization’s involvement through a request for a continuance to allow that organization time to secure the services of an expert to review Appellant’s case. Appellant’s motion was not filed until the court received Mr. Elgart’s brief. It contained only a bare assertion of Mr. Elgart’s ineffectiveness and an expression of Appellant’s preference for a specific attorney over the most recent one appointed to represent him.</p>

In <em>Rogers, supra, </em>we held that a court has the discretion to require an appellant to remain with counsel after briefs have been filed rather than permit the disruption of the orderly disposition of the case. More importantly, the motion contained no specific factual allegations which, if true, would <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>have established Mr. Elgart’s ineffectiveness. Therefore, the PCRA court was in a stronger position than the court in <em>Rogers, </em>which needed to weigh the movant’s constitutional right to self-representation. Here, Appellant’s letter essentially asserted that Appellant preferred to have another attorney, who was already involved in the case, appointed as his attorney of record. Clearly, the right to appointed counsel does not include the right to counsel of the defendant’s choice. <em>Commonwealth v.

Rule 1507(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that, where upon review of the petition and answer the PCRA court is convinced that no meritorious issues are presented and dismissal is appropriate without further proceedings, the court shall provide the defendant notice of its intention to dismiss and 10 days to respond with reasons why dismissal is inappropriate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Here, the PCRA court did not summarily dismiss the petition upon initial review, but rather ordered the appointment of counsel, the filing of an amended petition, and the briefing of the legal issues presented.

Appellant's claim that he was denied access to the data upon which this court’s proportionality review was conducted on direct appeal is groundless. To contest the proportionality of his sentence on direct appeal Appellant should have addressed his request to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, the caretaker of the database, prior to filing his brief to this court. Contrary to Appellant’s assertions, the public enjoys free access to these records. <em>See Commonwealth v. DeHart, </em><a href="/pa/512/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="512 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1800469" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0235-01">512 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="516 A.2d 656" data-case-ids="1800464,1800469" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0234-01,/pa/512/0235-01">516 A.2d 656</a>, 669 (Pa.1986). If Appellant requested this information in the brief he filed on direct appeal, as he contends, his request was misdirected. Appellant’s failure to procure these public records was not a result of denial of access by this court.</p>

N.T. at 105, 210. In determining that these statements do not qualify as excited utterances, the Majority essentially finds, in the first instance, that the violent argument between the Albrechts was not a sufficiently startling occurrence to render Alfred Jr.’s reflective faculties inoperable at the time he made the declarations to the Kuhns. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pronkoskie, </em><a href="/pa/477/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="477 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="1738270" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0132-01">477 Pa. 132</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="477 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="1738270" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0132-01">383 A.2d 858</a> (1978) (to come within excited utterance exception to hearsay rule, statement must be spontaneous declaration by person whose mind has suddenly been made subject to an overpowering emotion caused by some shocking occurrence, which is made so near the occurrence as to exclude the likelihood of it having emanated from declarant’s reflective faculties). I disagree. The Majority suggests that since Alfred Jr. had been subjected to numerous violent arguments between his parents in the past, experiencing one more altercation would not sufficiently traumatize him so as to <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>render him incapable of reflective thought. Regardless of how many times a child is forced to witness violent arguments between his parents, however, I cannot agree with the Majority that repetition somehow numbs the traumatizing effects such abuse has on a child. Rather, I believe that a child witnessing the physical abuse of his mother can clearly be considered a shocking event for purposes of the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Commonwealth v. McIntosh, </em><a href="/pa-super/258/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="258 Pa. Super. 101" data-case-ids="104394" data-case-paths="/pa-super/258/0101-01">258 Pa.Super. 101</a>, 106, <a href="/pa-super/258/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="258 Pa.

Zukauskas, </em><a href="/pa/501/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="501 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1782509" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0500-01">501 Pa. 500</a>, 504, <a href="/pa/501/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="501 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1782509" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0500-01">462 A.2d 236</a>, 238 (1983) (since the question is not how long one or when one is seized by an event, but rather whether he was seized at all, time itself is not dispositive of whether statement is excited utterance). The Kuhns testified that Alfred Jr. was nervous and shaken when he rang the doorbell to their home for help and told them that his father was hitting his mother again and threatening to burn down his house. N.T. at 105, 210. <em>See Commonwealth v. Watson, </em><a href="/pa-super/426/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="426 Pa. Super. 496" data-case-ids="929887" data-case-paths="/pa-super/426/0496-01">426 Pa.Super. 496</a>, 503, <a href="/pa-super/426/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="426 Pa.

Likewise, I do not believe that the additional fact that Alfred Jr. declined the Kuhns’ invitation to stay overnight after making the challenged statements establishes that the statements were not, under the circumstances of this case, excited utterances. Unlike the Majority, then, I have no difficulty finding that Alfred Jr.’s statements to the Kuhns were declarations made while experiencing overpowering emotion caused by a shocking event and there<a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>fore, properly admissible pursuant to the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[263,396,1164,580]]]'>Accordingly, I disagree with the Majority that Appellant’s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Alfred Jr.’s statements as inadmissible hearsay has arguable merit. I would find that Appellant’s claim fails on this ground. <em>See Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/527/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="527 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1827691" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0118-01">527 Pa. 118</a>, 122, <a href="/pa/527/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="527 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1827691" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0118-01">588 A.2d 1303</a>, 1305 (1991) (counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once it is determined that underlying claim is not of arguable merit). However, since the Majority ultimately rejects Appellant’s claim on the basis that he was not prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to object to these statements, I agree with the result reached by the Majority on this issue.</p>
