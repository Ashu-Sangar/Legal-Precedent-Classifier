Their lot consists of approximately 2.2 acres, and it partially surrounds the lot owned by the Fogles and borders it on two sides. Also alleged to be liable for sharing the cost of the fence is Malvern Courts, Inc., the owner of a mobile home park that borders another side of the Fogles’ property. The lot owned by the Fogles contains their residence and consists of approximately 1.5 acres. The zoning district in which all of the parties’ properties are located is residential, R-l, and the mobile home park is a lawful nonconforming use.</p>

The neighbors denied liability on the basis that the Fence Law does not apply to properties of the type involved in this case. The matter was submitted to the trial court on cross-motions for summary judgment, and judgment was entered in favor of the Fogles.

Similarly, in statutes that are distinct from the Fence Law, the legislature has used the term “division fence” to refer to a fence on the boundary line of an urban or suburban dwelling lot. 53 P.S. §§ 15173-15176 (building regulations governing division fences in cities of the first class); 53 P.S. § 37403(12) (regulation of division fences in cities of the third class).</p>

Dickerson, </em><a href="/pa/533/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="533 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1837506" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0294-01">533 Pa. 294</a>, 300, <a href="/pa/533/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="533 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1837506" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0294-01">621 A.2d 990</a>, 993 (1993) (“[W]hen a statute is not entirely free of ambiguity, we are subject to the rules of statutory construction enacted by the legislature.”). Those rules permit consideration of the occasion and necessity for the statute, the object to be attained, and former laws on the same subject. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).

However, the common law did encourage landowners to fence their properties by applying the rule of strict liability for any damages caused by their animals if they trespassed onto another’s land. See W. Keeton, Prosser and Keeton, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>§ 76 (5th ed.1984). Eventually, many states, including Pennsylvania, enacted laws combining a duty to fence with the concept of strict liability to create a firm set of rules which would prevent disputes concerning the liability for damages to crops or <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>other property caused by livestock.
