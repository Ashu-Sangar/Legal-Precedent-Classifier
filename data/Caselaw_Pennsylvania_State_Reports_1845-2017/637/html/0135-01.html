Awaiting trial, he was detained at the Clinton County Correctional Facility (the “Facility”). On or about February 20, 2014, approximately one week before his scheduled trial, Fant’s counsel received from the Commonwealth a production of recordings made at the Facility. All but two of the recordings consisted of conversations that occurred between Fant and his visitors in the Facility’s visitation room, where inmates converse with visitors, face-to-face, through a glass partition, using a telephone-like handset apparatus (“visit conversations”). As a result of these recorded visit conversations, law enforcement personnel retrieved additional evidence they sought to use at trial.</p>

He argued that the recordings violated Pennsylvania’s Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (the “Wiretap Act” or the “Act”). The Commonwealth countered that Section 5704(14) of the Act permits these recordings because it authorizes county correctional facilities to record “any telephone calls from or to an inmate,” as long as certain conditions are met.

As the foregoing reveals, the ordinary meaning of “telephone” under the Act requires both the dialing of a telephone number and the involvement of a telephone company in connecting a caller to his or her call recipient. By contrast, the visit conversations are activated when an inmate merely “punches <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>in an ID number,” not a telephone number. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 2/26/2014, at 2.

If the visit conversation recordings do not meet the statutory definition of "interception,” we would be left with a scenario involving the recording by law enforcement of ostensibly private communications. Absent a showing that Fant lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in these visit conversations, suppression is still appropriate to remedy a constitutional violation, if not a statutory one. <em>See </em>Commonwealth v. Enimpah, <a href="/pa/630/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="630 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="4277097" data-case-paths="/pa/630/0357-01">630 Pa. 357</a>, <a href="/pa/630/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="106 A.3d 695" data-case-ids="4277097,6896763" data-case-paths="/pa/630/0357-01,/a3d/106/0695-01">106 A.3d 695</a>, 703 (2014). Here, the suppression court found that Fant was alone in a room with a visitor, although separated by glass, and that there was no evidence that Fant had been warned that the conversation was not private or could be intercepted. As such, the suppression court concluded that Fant "had an expectation of privacy in this matter.” Trial Court Opinion, 4/1/2014, at 2. The Commonwealth does not argue to the contrary, either as a matter of fact or law. Further, although it appears from the record that the Facility notified inmates and outside callers that their "telephone calls” may be recorded, these notifications related to "tele<a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>phone calls,” exclusively. <em>See </em>Telephone Regulations at 1-2; <em>compare </em>Inmate Handbook at 7 (providing, under a subheading called “3001 telephone calls,” that "telephone calls are subject to monitoring, recording and may be. intercepted or divulged”) <em>with </em>id. at 9 (under subheading called "3003 Visiting,” no mention of monitoring or recording visit conversations). There is no support in the record that inmates and visitors are notified that their visit conversations may be recorded. Because the Commonwealth's alternative argument lacks any merit, our decision does not contravene either side of the right-for-any-reason debate referenced herein, as no basis exists to affirm the Superior Court’s decision. In reversing the Superior Court's order, we are upholding the trial court's ruling on grounds that were raised, briefed and adjudicated in the courts below.</p>

In my opinion, an instrument that resembles a telephone and acts as a telephone as it transmits the parties’ wire communications, is a telephone. The fact that the inmate and visitor can see each other through the glass partition is of little relevance <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>to our inquiry when considering that the parties could not hear each other absent use of the telephone provided.</p>
    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[185,467,1154,671]]]'>The majority accurately recognizes that the Wiretap Act is to be strictly construed. However, “[t]he need for strict construction does not require that the words of a penal statute be given their narrowest possible meaning or that legislative intent be disregarded ... nor does it override the more general principle that the words of a statute must be construed according to their common and approved usage.” Commonwealth v. Booth, <a href="/pa/564/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="564 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1276796" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0228-01">564 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=766%20A.2d%20848" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="766 A.2d 848">766 A.2d 848</a>, 846 (2001) (explaining that the rule of strict construction only gives the offender the benefit of ambiguity and otherwise has no effect). Here, I do not believe the term “telephone call” is ambiguous, and thus, the Court need afford it only the fair import of the term.</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[186,1171,1154,891]]]'>Even if one were to find the phrase “telephone call” ambiguous and proceed to divine legislative intent, I would reach the same conclusion—that the General Assembly did not intend to carve an exception that would protect wire communications taking place in a prison visitation room. The purpose of authorizing interception of the inmate’s telephone calls is clear, <em>ie., </em>to safeguard the orderly operation of the facility and the prosecution or investigation of any crime. See 18 Pa.C.S. § 6704(14)(i)(C) (providing that “[t]he contents of an intercepted and recorded telephone conversation shall be divulged only as is necessary to safeguard the orderly operation of the facility, in response to a court order or in the prosecution or investigation of any crime”). As the Commonwealth points out, if visitor telephone calls could not be monitored and recorded, inmates could freely use them to conspire with others to hide or destroy evidence, influence witnesses, smuggle contraband, or plot an escape.</p>

In its appeal to the Superior Court, the Commonwealth raised two issues in addition to <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>challenging the trial court’s ruling that the conversations were not telephone calls. One of the additional issues was whether the trial court erred in granting suppression absent a finding that Appellant had an expectation of privacy in the correctional facility visitation calls.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> Because the Superior Court found that the recordings at issue constituted inmate telephone calls that could be lawfully intercepted, the court declined to address the Commonwealth’s additional issues. See Commonwealth v. Fant, 109 A.3d at 781 n.5 (noting that “[b]ecause our resolution of the Commonwealth’s first issue enables us to dispose of the matter before us, it is not necessary to address separately the Commonwealth’s remaining issues”). Thus, upon reversal of the Superior Court’s ruling that the recordings constitute inmate telephone calls that were lawfully intercepted, a remand to that court is warranted to allow for disposition of the Commonwealth’s remaining issues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a>

In support of its conclusion that the participation of a telephone company is necessary for a telephone call to occur, the majority asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that under the Wiretap Act, a telephone call is a "wire communication” and that a "wire communication” requires the involvement of a "telephone ... company for hire as a communication common carrier.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5702. See Op. at 149, 146 A.3d at 1262. Section 5702’s definition of "wire communication” does not, however, mandate that a telephone company be involved, but rather describes a wire communication as aural transfers made through the use of facilities for the transmission of communication by wire or cable "including the use of such a connection in a switching station, furnished or operated by a telephone, telegraph or radio company for hire as a communication common carrier,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5702. Thus, a "wire communication” includes a communication facilitated by a telephone company, but does not require a telephone company's participation. Here, the communication was undoubtedly a wire communication using the prison's phone system. See Notes of Testimony, Feb. 25, 2014, at 16 (providing that the inmate phone company, as opposed to Verizon, records both visitor telephone calls and telephone calls to recipients outside the facility).</p>
      <p id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[286,1957,1121,421]]]'>Additionally, the majority opines that because Section 5712 of the Wiretap Act ("Issuance of order and effect”) provides that an order may direct the participation of a telephone company in an authorized interception, "the legislature understood the term 'telephone call,’ ordinarily, to be the sort of communication that relies on the operation of a telephone company.” Op. at 150, 146 A.3d at 1263. To the contrary, I do not view the General Assembly's authorization to direct a "provider of communication services” to cooperate with law enforcement authorities as a limitation on the ordinary meaning of a "telephone call.” In fact here, as noted, all internal and external calls were monitored by or through the prison’s phone system.</p>

In footnote twelve, the majority references the suppression court’s conclusion that Appellant had an expectation of privacy and notes that the Commonwealth does not argue to the contrary. See Op. at 154-55 n.13, 146 A.3d at 1265-66 n.13. The Superior Court, however, has held that any expectation of privacy that an inmate has in a conversation taking place in a prison visitation room, when separated from the visitor by a glass partition and speaking with the visitor through a closed-circuit telephone system, is unreasonable. See Commonwealth v. Prisk, <a href="/a3d/13/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="13 A.3d 526" data-case-ids="7283184" data-case-paths="/a3d/13/0526-01">13 A.3d 526</a>, 532 (Pa.Super.2011) (holding that it is unreasonable for an inmate to expect privacy in his conversations that take place in the prison visitation room as such an expectation of privacy is not one that society is prepared to recognize). Moreover, whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy is a conclusion of law subject to plenary review by an appellate court. Commonwealth v. Duncan, <a href="/pa/572/0438-02" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="572 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="716490,716551" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0438-02,/pa/572/0438-01">572 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/pa/572/0438-02" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="817 A.2d 455" data-case-ids="716490,716551,9365411,9365468" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0438-02,/pa/572/0438-01,/a2d/817/0455-01,/a2d/817/0455-02">817 A.2d 455</a>, 459 (2003).</p>
