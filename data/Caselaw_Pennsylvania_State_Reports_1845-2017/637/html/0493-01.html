Philadelphia police officers executed a search warrant for a residence where Kareem Barnes (“Appellant”) lived with his two younger brothers. The search of one of the bedrooms yielded a firearm, assorted drugs and drug paraphernalia. As a result, the Commonwealth charged Appellant with possession with intent to deliver (“PWID”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> possession of a firearm prohibited,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and other related charges. Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and proceeded to a bench trial. At trial, Appellant’s youngest brother testified that he, not Appellant, occupied the bedroom where the seized items were found and he, not Appellant, owned the contraband. The trial court, however, did not credit the brother’s testimony, and instead, found Appel<a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>lant guilty of the crimes charged. The trial court sentenced Appellant to 6 to 10 years’ imprisonment on the PWID conviction, which included a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1, based on the trial court’s finding that Appellant was in constructive possession of drugs “in close proximity to” a firearm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> No further penalty was imposed for the other convictions.</p>

As such, the High Court struck down as unconstitutional a New Jersey sentencing statute that allowed for the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence based on the sentencing court’s finding of an additional fact (that was not an element of the crime) by the lesser standard of preponderance of the evidence. Despite being filed more than two months after the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in Alleyne, Appellant’s 1925(b) statement did not raise an Alleyne challenge to his mandatory minimum sentence. Instead, Appellant only raised his two sufficiency claims.</p>

We denied review of Appellant’s two sufficiency of the evidence claims, but granted review of his Alleyne issue.

Ultimately, we concluded it was unconstitutional to apply Section 9712’s mandatory minimum <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>sentence to an individual who did not possess a firearm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Thus, the mandatory minimum sentencing challenge in Foster, which was pre-Alleyne, was not that the statute was unconstitutional on its face, but instead, unconstitutionally applied to the defendant therein, who was an accomplice to the crime at issue.</p>

As Foster did not properly preserve his challenge at the time of his sentencing, he was only entitled to relief if we determined that his issue was not waived by his failure to raise it in the trial court. The Commonwealth argued that Foster’s challenge did not implicate legality for issue preservation purposes because he could have received the same sentence under separate, albeit discretionary, authority, which allowed for the sentence imposed as well as a lesser sentence.</p>

The facts of the case now before us dictate the same disposition, as Alleyne declared a new rule of law that was announced while Appellant’s direct appeal was pending and which rendered Appel<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>lant’s mandatory minimum sentence unconstitutional. Based on this Court’s precedent, Appellant is entitled to relief.</p>
    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[183,498,1153,1451]]]'>Moreover, on balance, we agree with Appellant that his challenge implicates the legality of his sentence notwithstanding the separate, discretionary authority under which he could have received the same sentence. See supra at 502 n.10, 151 A.3d at 126 n.10. While this separate authority did, in fact, allow for the sentence Appellant received, it also authorized any lesser sentence that the sentencing court deemed appropriate, but was constrained from entertaining here. Importantly, there was no separate mandatory authority to support Appellant’s sentence. Based on the mandatory nature of Section 9712.1, at the time of sentencing, the sentencing court was without authority to enter any other sentence. As that sentencing provision has now been rendered unconstitutional on its face by Hopkins and Wolfe, it is as if that statutory authority never existed. See Wolfe, <a href="/pa/636/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="140 A.3d 651" data-case-ids="12279979,6794555" data-case-paths="/pa/636/0037-01,/a3d/140/0651-01">140 A.3d at 661</a> (quoting 16 C.J.S. Constitutional Law § 265 (2016)) (“[A]n unconstitutional, non-severable statute is ‘not a law, has no existence, is a nullity, or has no force or effect or is inoperative.’”). Accordingly, we hereby adopt the lead opinion in Foster and definitively hold that where the mandatory minimum sentencing authority on which the sentencing court relied is rendered void on its face, and no separate mandatory authority supported the sentence, any sentence entered under such purported authority is an illegal sentence for issue preservation purposes on direct appeal. Thus, Appellant is entitled to resentencing notwithstanding his failure to preserve his issue prior to seeking our review.</p>

Cunningham, </em><a href="/pa/622/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="622 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="4281018" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0543-01">622 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/pa/622/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="81 A.3d 1" data-case-ids="4281018,7301191" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0543-01,/a3d/81/0001-01">81 A.3d 1</a>, 4-5 (2013) (discussion of U.S. Supreme Court retroactivity jurisprudence). As I understand that jurisprudence, the U.S. Su<a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>preme Court recognizes that cases pending in a trial court or on direct appeal when it issues a new rule are different from those where the judgment has already become final when the High Court speaks: litigants on direct appeal are entitled to the benefit of the new rule as a matter of federal law, assuming the issue governed by the rule is properly in the case. Again, as I understand it, the U.S. Supreme Court does not concern itself with state issue preservation doctrines that may exist to afford greater retroactive application than is strictly commanded by that Court on direct appeals: in short, states have greater leeway in granting effect to new federal rules as a matter of state law, whether that law involves construction of judicial default doctrines, statutes, or some other source of law.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[265,1105,1154,1281]],["BL_539.1",539,[190,344,1152,151]]]'>Most issues, including constitutional issues, are waivable. As a general matter, then, to secure the benefit of an objection, whether encompassing a new rule or not, the defendant should preserve the issue at all stages of litigation. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Cabeza, </em><a href="/pa/503/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="469 A.2d 146" data-case-ids="1785953" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0228-01">469 A.2d 146</a> (Pa. 1983) (“[Wjhere an appellate decision overrules prior law and announces a new principle, unless the decision specifically declares the ruling to be prospective only, the new rule is to be applied retroactively to cases where the issue in question is properly preserved at all stages of adjudication up to and including any direct appeal.”); Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (“Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”). However, I am satisfied that in instances involving new federal constitutional rules issued before a case becomes final on appeal, it is appropriate to look to other interests. A necessary consequence of limiting the retroactive effect of new rules is the creation of classes of defendants, some who receive relief (here, from a mandatory sentence), some who do not. Those denied application of the new rule are denied the individualized sentencing that would otherwise be required absent the mandatory sentencing provision. To limit the effect of that imbalance, and in the absence of a governing legislative expression on the matter to the contrary, I favor a more expansive application of this sort of disruptive new rule on <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>direct appeals, even at the expense of procedural doctrines which I suspect were not necessarily intended to address this sort of complicated scenario.</p>
