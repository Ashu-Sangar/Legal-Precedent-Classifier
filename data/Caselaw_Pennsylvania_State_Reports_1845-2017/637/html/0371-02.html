Citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9738 (“Victim impact statements”), the Superior Court held, as a matter of law, such evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible at sentencing under such circumstances, the trial court therefore abused its discretion, and resentencing was required. We respectfully disagree with this broad holding and, in particular, the construction of Section 9738 as a provision circumscribing eviden-tiary relevance at sentencing. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand for resentencing consistent with both this opinion and the Superior Court’s independent grounds for remand.</p>

Appellee argued sentencing courts have no legal authority to consider victim impact evidence where, as here, the defendant is not convicted of a crime against a person. He asserted the sentencing court abused its discretion by permitting the introduction of the memorialized impact statements. Appellee further argued the trial court’s reliance on <em>Penrod </em>was misplaced as Penrod pleaded guilty to a DUI charge involving an accident which directly caused injuries to the victims, which is not the case here. Finally, appellee posed a statutory argument he did not forward at sentencing, contending the trial court was not permitted to consider victim impact testimony because the family members of Witt and Crawford were not victims under the Crime Victims Act (the Act), 18 P.S. §§ 11.101-11.5102. Section 11.103 of the Act defines “victim” as including: a direct victim; a parent of a child who is a direct victim; a minor child who is a material witness to a homicide, aggravated assault or rape against a family member; and a family member of a homicide victim. <em>See </em>18 P.S. § 11.103. Because his drug-related crimes produced no victim as that term is defined in the Act, appellee asserted the victim impact evidence was inadmissible.</p>

Notably, appellee addresses Section 9721(b) in his brief, but he focuses only on its “impact on the life of the victim” language, retaining his Crime Victims Act argument (an argument he did not present to the trial court). Appellee does not address the broader focus of the provision making relevant the impact on the community and the protection of the public. We believe there is merit in PDAA’s construction of Section 9721(b) as an indication the General Assembly “has recognized that criminal law exists to protect not only direct victims, but also the community that bears the indirect consequences of crime,” and this, in turn, affords some flexibility in the trial court considering the practical and tangential effects of a crime in fashioning a sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> PDAA Brief at 10.</p>

Contrary to the majority’s conclusion, the trial court’s comments at sentencing do not evidence sensitivity to the “level of attenuation” between the DUI-related deaths and Appellee’s drug crimes. Majority Op. at 388, 149 A.3d at 39. While noting that a jury could not have held Appellee responsible for the DUI-related deaths, the trial court nonetheless stated the following rationale for Appellee’s sentence:</p>
    <blockquote id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.6",426,[306,1672,1109,312]]]'>[Y]ou certainly were connected to a series of horrific events that led to unspeakable tragedy for the families that this [cjourt had to listen to during the sentencing phase of Mr. Malloy’s case. So I cannot turn a blind eye to it. It is simply a fact. And that was the tragic turn of events that now leads to your conviction and your sentencing.</blockquote>

Importantly, this error cannot be overcome simply by recasting the victim impact statements as “community impact evidence” as there is no basis for trial courts to admit and consider “community <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>impact evidence.” By holding otherwise, the majority dangerously broadens the definition of admissible impact evidence. Its holding, which lacks statutory, case law, or common law authorization, will permit trial courts to consider impact statements in any case where the Commonwealth is able to assert that a defendant’s conduct has impacted a community. This holding renders the statutory limitations and substantial body of case law regarding the admissibility of victim impact evidence largely nugatory, as most victim impact evidence can now be subsumed by the newly created amorphous category of admissible “community impact evidence.” I do not believe that anything in the law before the majority’s opinion has ever authorized such a result. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

Though not at issue in the instant appeal, the Superior Court also determined that the trial court improperly applied various sentencing enhancements when sentencing Appellee. Accordingly, Appellee will receive a new sentence regardless of this Court’s decision, and the only question we must answer is whether the trial court can consider the victim impact statements at the new sentencing hearing.</p>
