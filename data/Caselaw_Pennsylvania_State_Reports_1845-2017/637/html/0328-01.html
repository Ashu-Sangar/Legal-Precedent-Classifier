Kindler, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 1983 and previously was sentenced to death. Preliminarily, we must determine whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that this Court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal; thus, we do not reach the merits of the Commonwealth’s claim that the trial court erred by entering the order precluding the Commonwealth from presenting victim impact evidence at Appellee’s re-sentencing hearing.

To the extent that we must interpret the Judicial Code to determine whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, such a task is guided by the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1501-1991. Pursuant to the Statutory Construction Act, the object of all statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the General Assembly’s intention. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a).

      <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[197,1558,1152,193]]]'>. Despite the fairly obvious answer to the jurisdictional question presented in this matter, the Commonwealth contends that this Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Bryant, <a href="/pa/566/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="566 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="706291" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0307-01">566 Pa. 307</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="780 A.2d 646" data-case-ids="706291,9482686" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0307-01,/a2d/780/0646-01">780 A.2d 646</a> (2001), dictates that this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal. We disagree.</p>
      <p id="b367-6" data-blocks='[["BL_367.6",367,[229,1764,1119,268]]]'>Bryant was sentenced to death and later filed a PCRA petition. The PCRA court denied Bryant guilt-phase relief but granted him penalty-phase relief in the form of a new sentencing hearing. Bryant appealed the denial of his guilt-phase-based PCRA claims to the Superior Court but later moved to have the appeal transferred to this Court. The Superior Court denied Bryant's motion to transfer, quashed his appeal, and remanded the case for re-sentencing.</p>
      <p id="b367-7" data-blocks='[["BL_367.7",367,[230,2037,1120,353]]]'>On discretionary review, this Court concluded that the Superior Court erred by denying Bryant's motion to transfer his appeal to this Court. Notably, our conclusion in this regard was based exclusively upon the plain language of Subsection 9546(d) of the PCRA, <em>i.e., </em>the subsection of the PCRA that addresses when this Court has jurisdiction to review orders entered in PCRA proceedings. Unlike the circumstances in Bryant, Subsection 9546(d) of the PCRA has no relevance in the case <em>sub judice </em>because the order in question here was not entered in a PCRA proceeding.</p>

        <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>We acknowledge that, on one occasion, this Court applied the Bryant Court’s holding in a direct appeal that technically did not involve the PCRA. The situation presented in that case, Commonwealth v. Cooper, <a href="/pa/596/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="596 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="4088608" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0119-01">596 Pa. 119</a>, <a href="/pa/596/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="941 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="4088608,8396606" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0119-01,/a2d/941/0655-01">941 A.2d 655</a> (2007), clearly is distinguishable from this matter.</p>
      <p id="b368-7" data-blocks='[["BL_368.2",368,[289,1677,1124,705]]]'>After Cooper was sentenced to death, new counsel filed post-sentence motions raising, <em>inter alia, </em>collateral claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court held hearings on the motions and ultimately vacated the sentence of death, ordering a new penalty phase hearing based upon its conclusion that sentencing counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. The Commonwealth appealed from the portion of the order which granted Cooper a new sentencing hearing, and Cooper appealed from the portion of the order that denied his other post-sentence claims for relief. Despite the fact that the trial court had vacated Cooper’s death sentence, this Court exercised direct appeal jurisdiction over the appeals, citing Bryant and stating that in “prior cases that involved collateral review, we have characterized matters in which a lower court vacated the death sentence as ones 'in which the death penalty has been imposed,' thus triggering our review of all issues properly preserved on appeal.” Cooper, <a href="/pa/596/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="941 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="4088608,8396606" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0119-01,/a2d/941/0655-01">941 A.2d at </a>660 (citing Bryant, <a href="/pa/566/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="780 A.2d 646" data-case-ids="706291,9482686" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0307-01,/a2d/780/0646-01">780 A.2d at 648</a>). Unlike Cooper, this case does not involve collateral review or an order from a trial court vacating a sentence of death but, rather, involves pre-penalty phase proceedings.</p>
