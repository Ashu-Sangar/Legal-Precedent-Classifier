Veon, a twenty-two-year member and eventual Minority Whip of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (Fourteenth Legislative District, Beaver County), was entitled to $20,000 annually to cover business expenses associated with maintenance of a district office, as well as $4,000 for postage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Mr. Veon also was allotted up to $650 per month for a vehicle and $1,650 to be used for the monthly rent for his district office. Any unused balance of the latter $2,300 per month allotment could not be diverted for other purposes. Mr. Veon was expected to draw upon his general $20,000 allocation to pay any vehicular or rental charges in excess of those allotments. Pursuant to House Democratic Caucus (“Caucus”) procedures, Mr. Veon could seek additional funds from Caucus leadership if he exhausted his $20,000 allocation, and it was not uncommon for Caucus members to do so. However, trial testimony established that, because such supplemental allotments are matters of public record, some members hesitated to request them for fear of provoking political blowback from constituents.</p>

BIG received all of its funding from public sources, primarily through the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (“DCED”). BIG was administered by two “co-chairs,” Mr. Veon and then-State Senator Gerald Lavalle, who was invited to serve as co-chair by the individual in charge of Mr. Veon’s district office, Annamarie Perretta-Rosepink.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> However, Mr. <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>Lavalle admitted that his role in BIG’s operations was quite limited.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[260,462,1154,1322]]]'>According to John Gallo, BIG’s executive director from 1999-2003, BIG initially occupied, rent-free, the second floor of a bank-owned building in Beaver Falls, over a first-floor space occupied by Mr. Veon’s district office. When Mr. Gallo was hired, BIG effectively had conducted no operations for at least a year, its records were strewn about the office, the only furniture in its space was a large table, and the building in general was in poor condition. Thus, with Mr. Veon’s and Ms. Perretta-Rosepink’s support, Mr. Gallo took it upon himself to seek new office space for BIG, Thereafter, Ms. Perretta-Rosepink informed Mr. Gallo that she had negotiated a lease in another facility (the “Beaver Office”) at a rental rate of $2,900 per month. Because this well exceeded Mr. Veon’s $1,650 rental allotment, Ms. Perretta-Rosepink explained, BIG would take on the lease and sublet space in the new facility to Mr. Veon’s district office. Although BIG was the named lessor, Mr. Veon’s district office occupied substantially more of the space than BIG. Moreover, according to Mr. Gallo, once the two tenants were established in the new space, no sign was installed to indicate that BIG was an occupant of its own putative headquarters. Anyone seeking to visit BIG would enter through Mr. Veon’s office. BIG nonetheless paid $1,400 of the $2,900 rental fee, leaving Mr. Veon responsible for the $1,500 balance, $150 less than his $1,650 allotment for that purpose.</p>

When asked, Ms. Perretta-Rosepink told Mr. Gallo that the check had been written to the landlord of an additional office, located in Midland, Pennsylvania (“Midland Office”). She explained that, due to redistricting, Mr. Veon’s district now included Midland, which was geographically separate from the remainder of Mr. Veon’s district, and that Mr. Veon did not want Midland constituents to have to travel to the Beaver <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>Office. Because Mr. Veon had insufficient funds for a satellite office, BIG would pay the rent for the Midland office as well. Mr. LaValle testified that the Midland Office appeared to him to be functioning as a legislative office. Daniel Woodske, BIG’s director of marketing, testified that he was surprised to learn that BIG leased the Midland Office, a discovery he made when he dropped by to “say hello.” Once there, Mr. Woodske observed a door with a BIG sign on it, which opened onto “just pretty much maybe a six by eight room.” Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 2/22/2012, at 35-36. During his five years at BIG, Mr. Woodske used the Midland Office approximately twenty times, always for meetings with individuals whom he wanted to spare any inconvenience in traveling to Beaver Falls. According to Ms. Perretta-Rosepink, the rental fee for the Midland Office was $2,100.</p>

The space was located on the second floor of a building owned by Mr. Veon’s friend, Marc Adams, whose cigar shop occupied the first floor. The terms of the lease called for BIG to pay $2,500 for the first four months of occupancy, and $1,500 per month thereafter. The rented space bore no indication that it was occupied by BIG, and contained only two desks and a computer. Thomas Woodske, who succeeded Mr. Gallo as BIG’s executive director in or around 2003, learned about the lease from his son, Daniel. Thomas Woodske perceived no need for the South Side Office. The only person who used that office was Angela Bertugli. Ms. Bertugli was hired by Michael Manzo, Representative Bill DeWeese’s chief of staff, to perform legislative and policy research for the Caucus. She testified that she knew nothing about BIG prior to her employment at the South Side Office.</p>

The Superior Court determined that the jury’s verdict regarding counts 1 (conflict of interest), 3 (theft by unlawful taking), 7 (theft by deception), 11 (theft by failure to make required disposition), 15 (misapplication of entrusted property), and 19 (conspiracy) did not specify which particular legislative office was associated with the theft. Thus, the trial court had no basis upon which to assume that Mr. Veon’s thefts specifically were associated with the Beaver Falls and/or Midland offices, which, in turn, called into question the basis for the trial court’s calculations. Absent such a basis for the amount of restitution imposed, an award of restitution could not be imposed upon those counts. Id, at 772. Conversely, with respect to counts 5 (theft by unlawful taking), 9 (theft by deception), 13 (theft by failure to make required disposition), and 17 (misapplication of entrusted property), expressly concerning amounts associated with the South Side Office, the evidence established such a basis. Consequently, having determined that DCED could be a victim under the restitution statute, the Superior Court effectively affirmed just the $19,000 restitutionary penalty associated with the South Side <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>Office.

While it is true that the court in Keller considered those factors, the facts are distinguishable. At issue in Keller was a small-town mayor’s solicitation of funds for performing wedding ceremonies, funds that he promised to, and ultimately did, donate to charity. Over a period of years, approximately $16,000 passed through his personal bank account, which he donated to various charities, invariably in his own name. Accordingly, while the court agreed that these donations had considerable intangible political value to the mayor, its decision nonetheless hinged upon the proposition that the mayor’s receipt of the monies in question constituted a private pecuniary benefit, regardless of the funds’ final destination. Accord Commonwealth v. Feese, <a href="/a3d/79/1101-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="79 A.3d 1101" data-case-ids="7305565" data-case-paths="/a3d/79/1101-01">79 A.3d 1101</a>, 1127 (Pa.

Justice Donohue’s Concurring and Dissenting Opinion ("DCDO”) at 485-89, 150 A,3d at 462-64. However, there is nothing unambiguous about Section 1106 in this regard. Subsection 1106(a) provides that, "[ujpon conviction for <em>any crime </em>wherein property has been stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, <em>or </em>its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, <em>or </em>wherein the victim suffered personal injury directly resulting from the crime, the offender <em>shall </em>be sentenced to make restitution" (emphasis added). The General Assembly’s use of this disjunctive construction strongly suggests its intention to impose restitution for property crimes <em>or </em>crimes involving personal injury, not only property crimes that happen to occur in tandem with personal injury crimes, as Justice Donohue maintains. We do not read complementary statutory provisions in isolation. Given the plain language of Subsection 1106(a), the statute read in its full context is patently ambiguous regarding whether the legislature intended to impose mandatory restitution for property crimes, as such, without regard to the occurrence of personal injury. However, Section 1106, as informed by Section 11,103, unambiguously establishes that DCED cannot be a “victim” because the relevant provisions provide that there can be no restitution when there is no human victim. Thus we need not strain to reconcile the apparent mandatory imposition of restitution for property crimes in Subsection 1106(a) with the proposition that victim-hood under the statute requires a personal injury crime. That being said, Justice Donohue has identified yet another problematic aspect of the current statutory scheme governing restitution, one that the General Assembly may wish to consider in the future.</p>

Regardless of whether Mr. Veon raised a sufficiency challenge before the Superior Court, a proposition that is at best debatable given his occasional conclusory averments to that effect in his Superior Court brief, he has neither raised nor developed that argument before this Court. Justice Donohue nonetheless would grant Mr. Veon a full discharge with regard to his conflict of interest conviction based upon double jeopardy concerns that she apparently believes to be inherent in his challenge, since Mr. Veon indisputably has made no such argument and sought no such relief before this Court. Neither of the cases Justice Donohue cites validates such a result. In McDonnell v. United States, the Court recognized the potential for a double jeopardy argument, but the defendant specifically had raised it. Even so, the McDonnell Court remanded to the lower court to assess evidentiary sufficiency under the correct interpretation of the relevant statute rather than make that decision in the first instance on appeal, as Justice Donohue would do here.

In effect, Justice Donohue would employ some variation on the plain error doctrine in contravention of long-standing Pennsylvania case law without the benefit of any argument in favor of such a departure from settled law. This Court may wish to revisit its current unforgiving approach to waiver. But we did not agree to do so in the instant case, and we have no lower court consideration or appellate advocacy on that issue. Accordingly, the question must await a more suitable case.</p>

The trial court’s contrary conclusion reflects a simple misinterpretation and misapplication of a criminal statute. Appellant certainly had several avenues through which to pursue relief from this error. For instance, Appellant could have challenged the trial court’s incorrect definition of an element of the crime by objecting to the jury instruction containing the improper definition.

In his brief before this Court, Veon challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conflict of interest conviction—specifically as it relates to evidence of a private pecuniary gain—as part of his broader statutory interpretation claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Veon asserts that there was “no evidence of record” to support a finding that he received a private pecuni<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>ary gain because of his actions, as the “nature of the prosecution” did not involve a financial gain at all; rather, his prosecution for conflict of interest was based solely upon “intangible gains” that Veon experienced in the form of “favorable publicity and free publicity and enhance[d] standing in the community so that he can continue to be reelected.” Veon’s Brief at 8,10-11, 21-23 (quoting, in part, the Commonwealth’s closing argument, N.T., 3/1/2012, at 74); <em>see also </em>id. at 25 (“This case was not about Mr. Veon taking money. It was not about him using a non-profit as his personal bank account. It was not about misappropriation of funds. It was about allowing the jury to speculate on intangible political benefits that were never proven in order to meet a statutory requirement of pecuniary gain.”). In my view, under the particular circumstances of this case and because of the nature of the issues subject to our review, the sufficiency claim did not need to be raised as a standalone issue, as it is raised within and encompassed by the statutory interpretation question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

Veon raised the same challenge in the same manner before the Superior Court. <em>See </em>Veon’s Superior Court Brief at 26-27, 29 (arguing that the trial court improperly permitted the expansion of the conflict of interest statute to include "intangible political benefits,” and that there was no evidence presented that Veon or his family experienced any monetary gain as a result of his actions). Because the Superior Court found that the trial court did not impermissibly expand the conflict of interest statute to include intangible political benefits, it did not need to reach the question of whether the evidence was insufficient to establish that Veon received any monetary gain from his conduct,</p>

Veon has not challenged his conviction under the conflict of interest statute on any grounds other than his failure to receive any private pecuniary gain. Thus, we were not asked to determine whether, when authorizing or directing the payment of the funds at issue, Veon was acting as a public official or public employee as those terms are defined in the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S.A. § 1102. I note, however, that although Veon was a State Representative at the time of the conduct at issue, he did not use the “authority of his office," as required to constitute a conflict of interest, to divert the funds from BIG to his legislative offices. Veon’s role as a member of the House of Representatives did not give him any right to access BIG’s funds. Rather, it was his role as the co-chair of BIG, a private nonprofit corporation, that permitted the expenditure of the funds.</p>

Section 180-9.1 defined "victim,” in relevant part, as; “A person against whom a crime is being or has been perpetrated or attempted.” 71 P.S. § 180-9.1 (repealed Nov. 24, 1998) (emphasis added). Section 1991 of the Statutory Construction Act defines "person" as "a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, other association, government entity (other than the Commonwealth), estate, trust, foundation or natural person.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1991 (emphasis added).

The Majority suggests that the language of subsection (a) that requires restitution for "any crime wherein property has been stolen,” combined with the definition of “victim” adopted in subsection (h), renders section 1106 ambiguous with regard to whether restitution can be required in relation to property crimes that do not result in personal injury. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 473 n.29, 150 A.3d at 454 n.29. This Court has stated, however, that an ambiguity only exists where there are at least two reasonable interpretations of the statutory text under review. <em>See </em>Del. Cnty. v. First Union Corp., <a href="/pa/605/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="605 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="3698556" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0547-01">605 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/pa/605/0546-02" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="992 A.2d 112" data-case-ids="3697579,3698556,7287503,7287575" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0546-02,/pa/605/0547-01,/a2d/992/0112-01,/a2d/992/0112-02">992 A.2d 112</a>, 118 (2010). Although an undeniable tension arises in light of the universal directive of section 1106(a) and the limited definition of "victim” contained in section 11.103 (adopted in section 1106(h)), in my view, this tension does not stem from an ambiguity. It is unreasonable to read sections 1106(a) and 1106(h) together as permitting restitution where no victim, as expressly defined by section 11.103, exists. <em>See generally </em>Majority Op. at 464-65, 150 A.3d at 449 (stating that section 11.103’s definition of victim applies in the context of section 1106). Rather, in my view, the tension stems from a legislative oversight in failing to broaden the definition of "victim”—an oversight that would be improp<a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>er for this Court to cure via statutory construction. <em>See </em>Burke v.
