In that case, our Court struck the entirety of Sections 3215(b), 3215(d), 3303, and 3304 of Act 13 of Feb. 14, 2012, P.L. 87 (“Act 13”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> as violative of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and we enjoined the application and enforcement of Section 3215(c) and (e) and Sections 3305 through 3309, to the extent that they implemented or enforced the provisions of Act 13 which our Court invalidated. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the portion of the order the Commonwealth Court issued on remand, Robinson Township v.

In that regard, we stay our mandate with respect to Section 3218.1 for 180 days in order to give the General Assembly sufficient time to enact remedial legislation. Further, because we determine that Section 3241 is unconstitutional on its face, as it grants a corporation the power of eminent domain to take <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>private property for a private purpose, in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 1 and 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s order and direct this provision be stricken as well, and enjoined from further application and enforcement.</p>

In requiring the Commonwealth to act in the capacity of trustee of public natural resources, the plurality determined that Article I, Section 27 “speaks on behalf of the people, to the people directly,” and, therefore, granted to the people the right to directly enforce the Commonwealth’s trustee obligations.

In the plurality’s view, because Section 3303 <em>entirely </em>superseded all existing local environmental ordinances and regulations previously enacted by municipalities governing the activities of the oil and gas industries, and expressly preempted any and all future such local regulations, it “command[ed] municipalities to ignore their obligations under Article I, Section 27” and, also, directed them “to take affirmative actions to undo existing protections of the environment in their localities.” <a href="/pa/623/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="83 A.3d 901" data-case-ids="4344715,7264422" data-case-paths="/pa/623/0564-01,/a3d/83/0901-01">Id. at 978</a>.

Justice Baer agreed with the plurality that Act 13’s general mandate that municipalities enact specific zoning ordinances setting requirements for oil and gas production in every municipality of the Commonwealth, while only affording ineffective environmental protections and providing no other means for a municipality, zoning district, or resident thereof, to seek redress for particular objections or other remedies for the effects of drilling activities, would have an arbitrary and discriminatory impact on municipalities and residents throughout the Commonwealth. With respect to Sections 3303 and 3304, specifically, he opined that, because these sections required that municipalities enact ordinances that permit intrusion on, and accompanying damage to, private property, with no exception, nor provision of a means to remedy damage, they violated the substantive due process rights of the people, as the Commonwealth Court found.</p>

According to Citizens, this process was intended to be a quick facial examination of the terms of the ordinances by either the PUC or the Commonwealth Court to see if they comported with Section 3304, but it was not intended to be the typical type of ordinance review that local governing bodies engage in, which is characterized by deliberative fact finding with significant input from local citizens who are afforded maximum opportunity to participate. Indeed, Citizens assert, the fact that this ordinance review was restricted under these sections to only taking place in exclusively statewide forums is evidence of Act 13’s intent to purposefully exclude local citizens from meaningful participation in the process. Likewise, Citizens contend the imposition of counsel fees and financial penalties provided in Sections 3307 and 3308 was done for the purpose of enforcing statewide conformity in local ordinances governing oil and gas operations set by Sections 3304 and 3305.</p>

Although such recordation would include the identity of any chemical a physician determines is the source of the patient’s illness, Citizens suggest the plain language of Sections 3222.1(b)(10) and (b)(ll) would prevent the physician from recording such information. Citizens argue that, unlike other federal and state laws which require disclosure of industrial chemicals to medical professionals for purposes of treatment, while allowing for the protection of confidential or proprietary information, Sections 3222.1(b)(10) and (b)(ll) contain no provisions which preserve the ability of physicians to meet their legal and ethical obligations to patients.

Citizens maintain that this uncertainty as to what physicians may legally disclose to their patients or other medical providers places the physician in the untenable position of having to risk liability for improper disclosure of the identity of a chemical to a patient or fellow health care provider. In this regard, Citizens reject the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of these sections as permitting physicians to share with other treatment providers trade secrets they regard as necessary to diagnosing and treating individuals.

Citizens argue that identifying the medical conditions caused by the effects of chemicals on the human body has been a historical part of the duties of all health professionals, and the recording and sharing of information among such professionals is a necessary part of the process of developing the body of public health knowledge, which they claim these sections now inhibit.</p>

Section 3222.1(b)(10) governs a health professional’s right of access to confidential and proprietary information in the normal course of treatment of a patient in non-emergency situations. Under this section, a health professional, in order to gain access to this information, must execute a written confidentiality agreement, rules for which have yet to be written by the Environmental Quality Board, even though Section 3241 of Act 13 mandated that it promulgate such rules. Thus, even if a health professional obtains access to this information, because he or she, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, has deemed it necessary to effectively treat a patient for a medical condition, the health professional does not know whether he or she will be able to further disclose that information to other health professionals until he or she receives and executes a confidentiality agreement draft<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>ed by the vendor, service provider, or operator.

Additionally, as Judge McCullough cogently discerned in her dissenting opinion below, these narrow restrictions would also seemingly foreclose health professionals from disclosing to other health care professionals any clinical findings they make during the course of treating a patient who has been exposed to these chemicals, or from publishing such findings in medical journals, in order to facilitate the development of effective future treatment plans for such exposures. See Robinson III, 96.

In considering the question of whether these statutes violate Article III, Section 32, the salient constitutional inquiry is not whether these restrictions apply uniformly to the entire oil and gas industry, or to all health professionals, as a class, which was found by the Commonwealth Court, and presently endorsed in this appeal by the Attorney General. Rather, the pivotal consideration is whether these sections confer on the oil and gas industry, as a class, special treatment not afforded to any other class of industry, and whether this special treatment “rest[s] upon some ground of difference, which justifies the classification and has a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the legislation.” Robinson II, <a href="/pa/623/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="83 A.3d 901" data-case-ids="4344715,7264422" data-case-paths="/pa/623/0564-01,/a3d/83/0901-01">83 A.3d at 987</a>; Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, <a href="/pa/587/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="899 A.2d 1085" data-case-ids="3467679,8422490" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0347-01,/a2d/899/1085-01">899 A.2d at 1095</a>.</p>

Thus, Sections 3222.1(b)(10) and (11) grant the oil and gas industry, as a class, special protections for its trade secrets and confidential proprietary information which is enjoyed by no other class of industry. Unquestionably, the legislature’s interest in permitting “optimal development of oil and gas resources of this Commonwealth,” codified in Section 3202(1), is a legitimate one, and, in furtherance of that reasonable state interest, the legislature may afford the oil and gas industry statutory protections for its trade secrets and confidential proprietary information. However, the Commonwealth has not identified any difference between the oil and gas industry and the myriad of other industries operating within our Commonwealth, many of which use chemicals in their manufacturing processes, which justify these heavy constraints on health professionals’ access to, and ability to use or further disclose, this type of information while carrying out the vital responsibilities of their vocation, and we cannot reasonably hypothesize any such justification. In sum, then, we discern no manifest peculiarity of the oil and gas industry which warrants granting it the special treatment conferred by Sections 3222.1(b)(10) and (b)(ll), and so we hold that these statutory provisions violate Article III, Section 32’s prohibition against the enactment of special laws.

They first maintain that its distinction between notification requirements in the event of a spill between the owners and operators of public and private sources of drinking water is not reasonably related to a legitimate state purpose. Citizens note that owners and operators of both such water sources have the same need to be made aware, in the event of a spill, of its potential impact on drinking water due to its potential to affect the health of those who use the affected <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>water supplies. Indeed, Citizens aver, owners of private wells who rely on them for drinking water have an even greater need for such notification since public water supplies are routinely and regularly tested, thereby making it likely that a spill would be detected even absent such notification, whereas private wells do not undergo such a regular testing regimen. Relying on official United States Census Bureau data, Citizens contend that over three million Pennsylvania residents, most of whom live in rural areas, are dependent on private wells for their drinking water and for agricultural purposes, and, because of the great amount of oil and gas drilling occurring in these areas, they could be affected by a spill of chemicals or other water contaminants. Citizens’ Second Brief at 19. Yet, despite the need for this large number of Pennsylvania residents to be made aware of a spill so that they may take action to mitigate the spill’s effect on their drinking water and health, they are expressly excluded by this legislation from the category of individuals the DEP must notify in the event of a spill. Indeed, according to Citizens, private well owners may never receive notice of the existence of a spill until their water supply has been adversely affected, even though oil and gas well operators must “restore or replace” water supplies to a nearby well owner, who draws from the same aquifer and has been adversely affected. 58 Pa.C.S. § 3218. Citizens claim that, in such circumstances, the DEP does not issue a public notice of violation against the well operator, nor a formal determination that contamination has occurred, and this lack of warning exposes the users of an affected well, who are unaware of its condition, to the significant risk that they would use the contaminated water.</p>

Citizens submit that the DEP could readily locate the affected residents since well drillers are required under Section 3211 of Act 13 to list on a permit application filed with the DEP the name of a surface landowner whose water supply is within 1,000 feet of a proposed conventional well location or, for an unconventional well, within 3,000 feet of the vertical well bore. 58 Pa.C.S. § 3211.

Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the truth of the DEP’s assertions, which we accept are made by it in good faith, the existence of such alleged administrative burdens with respect to the notification of owners of private water supplies, in and of themselves, does not establish that Section 3218.1 comports with Article III, Section 32; rather, the circumscribed notice requirements of Section 3218.1 must also have a fair and substantial relationship to the legislative objectives of Act 13, a factor which we find the Commonwealth has not established.</p>

See 58 Pa.C.S. § 3218(a) (“[A] well operator who affects a public or private water supply by pollution or diminution shall restore or replace the affected supply with an alternate source of water adequate in quantity or quality for the purposes served by the supply.”).

As developed by Citizens, under the Public Utility Code, those activities involving natural gas do not, alone, qualify a corporation to be considered a public utility; rather, the Code specifies that only corporations “owning or operating in this Commonwealth equipment or facilities for: [producing, generating, transmitting, distributing or furnishing natural ... gas ... for the production of light, heat, or power <em>to or for the public for compensation', </em>... [transporting or conveying natural ... gas ... by pipeline or conduit, <em>for the public for compensation” </em>qualify for classification as a public utility. 66 Pa.C.S. § 102(1)(i); (v) (emphasis added). Further, the legislature has specifically directed that those producers of natural gas which do not sell gas “directly to the public for compensation” are excluded from classification as public utilities. 66 Pa.C.S. § 102(2)(iii).

Indeed, the breadth of the scope of this power is underscored by the fact that Section 3241(a) places only two limited types of property outside of its reach: (1) property which still has more than 20 percent of its recoverable oil and gas reserves, and (2) subsurface areas already owned by other gas companies, or persons engaged in the distribution of natural gas, if those areas are presently being used by those companies for storing gas as <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>part of providing service to customers. 58 Pa.C.S. § 3241(a)(1), (2).

Instead, it advances the proposition that allowing such takings would somehow advance the development of infrastructure in the Commonwealth.

They emphasize the traditional and vital historical role of local zoning laws enacted by municipalities in protecting these interests, and the long-standing recognition that municipalities can use these laws to restrict the permissible situs of industrial activity, such as fracking, occurring within their borders, in order to protect, in other areas of the community, residents’ quality of life and their ability to use and enjoy property. They point out that the various provisions of the MPC, such as those which require development of a comprehensive land use plan and allow coordinated planning between municipalities and other local governmental bodies like counties, reflect the fact that the MPC, as a whole, constitutes a well-established and deliberate policy choice that land use decisions be made at the local level by elected officials who live in the community, because they best understand the community’s special character and the unique needs of its residents.

Indeed, according to <em>amici, </em>the lack of experience and knowledge in this area was evidenced by the fact that, after the passage <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>of Act 13, the PUC was forced to hire outside counsel to advise it on zoning matters. <em>Amici </em>assert that the PUC’s already thin resources and expertise in this area would be even more severely strained if Sections 3305 through 3309 were permitted to stay in effect.</p>

In their view, Sections 3305 through 3309 retain continued viability in that they can be used whenever a municipality passes a local ordinance that violates any of the remaining provisions of Chapters 32 and 33 that have not been stricken as unconstitutional, as well as in situations where a municipality passes a local ordinance that violates the MPC.</p>

To the extent that the majority credits plurality aspects of the previous <em>Robinson Township </em>decision related to such matters, <em>see, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion, at 277 n. 35, 147 A.3d at 559 n. 35, I am unable to join the opinion.</p>

In this regard, I respectfully differ with the majority’s depiction of the role ascribed by the General Assembly to the Public Utility Commission and/or the Commonwealth Court as that of a “statewide zoning hearing board,” Majority Opinion, at 287-88, 147 A.3d at 565-66. <em>See </em>Brief for the PUC at 16 (explaining that Act 13 “leaves the procedures of the MPC intact; it merely adds an additional procedure that is necessary because the MPC does not specifically address the impact fees unique to Act 13”).</p>
    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[195,885,1155,1192]]]'>I also would not invalidate, on the basis that it comprises special legislation, the provision of Act 13 requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to notify public drinking water facilities of spills. <em>See </em>58 Pa.C.S. § 3218.1. From my point of view, the protection of public water sources is a legitimate and important state purpose fully justifying the enhanced notice requirement fashioned by the Legislature. <em>See generally Appolo Fuels, Inc. v. U.S., </em><a href="/fed-cl/62/1338-01" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="381 F.3d 1338" data-case-ids="1465186,9205367" data-case-paths="/fed-cl/62/1338-01,/f3d/381/1338-01">381 F.3d 1338</a>, 1350-51 (Fed.Cir.2004) (identifying protection of a public water supply as important government action designed to protect the health and safety of communities). Furthermore, I do not view the prohibition against special legislation as requiring the General Assembly to expand the scope of an administrative agency’s regulatory purview before the agency can be directed to accomplish a publicly-oriented task relative to public water sources. Moreover, as the Department discusses at length, there are other statutory protections serving the interests of those maintaining private water sources. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for DEP at 32 (explaining that the claim that Section 3218.1 “relieves ... industry from having to address its true impact on rural communities misleadingly omits any reference to the laws and policies that form the basis of DEP’s comprehensive spill prevention and response program”).</p>
