(“LEHB”), a nonprofit corporation that administers health and welfare benefits to Philadelphia police officers as part of the union’s collective bargaining agreement, is authorized under the Pennsylvania Nonprofit Corporation Law (“NCL”), 15 Pa.C.S. §§ 5101-6162, as well as its Articles of Incorporation, to expend its corporate funds to pay for a postcard sent to its members endorsing a candidate in a union election. For the reasons that follow, we find that nothing in the NCL nor the corporation’s Articles prohibited the action at issue and that LEHB’s action was sufficiently related to its corporate purpose to be permissible. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the trial court’s order dismissing the declaratory judgment action against LEHB.</p>

The Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 5 (“FOP”) is a union which represents the interests of Philadelphia police officers in negotiating the terms and conditions of the officers’ employment with the City of Philadelphia (“City”). Relevant to the instant matter, the FOP secured a collective bargaining agreement with the City, which provides health and welfare benefits to <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>active and retired FOP members and their families. The agreement, <em>inter alia, </em>created a Joint Trust and established a Joint Trust Board, which is comprised of five individuals—four appointed by the FOP president and one appointed by the City—who supervise and manage the delivery of the FOP’s benefits. As a result of the negotiations between the FOP and the City, the City is required to pay a specified amount per police officer per year to the Joint Trust for benefits, and the Joint Trust Board selects the entity to administer such benefits. At all relevant times, the Joint Trust Board selected LEHB to administer the benefits. LEHB is a nonprofit corporation specifically incorporated for the purpose of administering the benefits for the City’s police officers and is controlled by a Board of Directors (“the Board”).</p>

The case subsequently proceeded to a nonjury trial, and, ultimately, the trial court denied Zampogna’s request for declaratory relief. The trial court began its review with LEHB’s Bylaws, which provided the Board with the power to take any action so long as it was not inconsistent with the Bylaws, the Articles, or the law. The trial court concluded that neither LEHB’s Bylaws, nor its Articles, prohibited LEHB from making endorsements in FOP elections. Moreover, the trial court examined Section 5502 of the NCL, which enumerates the general powers of nonprofit corporations, and determined that “[njowhere in [the] statute does it state that corporations are prohibited from engaging in political activity.” Tr. Ct. Op., 5/22/2012, at 2 (citing 15 Pa.C.S. § 5502).

Instead, the majority viewed LEHB’s purpose statement as a restriction on its powers, reasoning that any action taken by the corporation must be sufficiently related to its purpose “to receive, hold, invest, administer, and distribute funds to provide health and welfare benefits for, and on behalf of, the corporation’s members (and such members’ eligible spouses and dependents).” <a href="/a3d/81/1043-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="81 A.3d 1043" data-case-ids="7304228" data-case-paths="/a3d/81/1043-01">Id. at 1048</a> (quoting Articles at 4(a)). In the majority’s view, endorsing McNesby was not a direct administration of benefits.

See Articles at 4(b) (providing LEHB with the power “to engage in such other proper purposes incidental to the [administration of benefits].”). In rejecting this argument, the majority relied on a case from 1916 which stated that a corporation’s incidental power must be “directly and immediately appropriate to the execution of the specific power granted, ... not one that has merely some slight or remote relation to it.” <a href="/a3d/81/1043-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="81 A.3d 1043" data-case-ids="7304228" data-case-paths="/a3d/81/1043-01">Id.</a> (quoting Citizens’ Elec.

Id. at 1050. The majority viewed this construct as creating a conflict of interest for the Board and opined that approving the endorsement constituted self-dealing, despite the fact that Zampogna’s complaint and brief to the Commonwealth Court made no allegation of any conflict of interest.</p>

However, the majority did not cite any authority to support its proposition that LEHB’s funds were public nor did it explain how the public character of the funds factored into the court’s analysis. <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>Moreover, the majority did not develop how an action taken in the context of a private, union election constituted prohibited “partisan activity.” Nonetheless, the majority held that the trial court erred in finding the endorsement was within the scope of the Board’s authority.

The dissent opined that, contrary to the majority’s position, “it is a restriction that must be stated in the corporation’s charter, not the authorization to conduct a specific activity,” and observed that, here, LEHB’s Articles do not limit LEHB’s ability to endorse candidates in a union election. <a href="/a3d/81/1043-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="81 A.3d 1043" data-case-ids="7304228" data-case-paths="/a3d/81/1043-01">Id. at 1055</a>.

With respect to the former, the dissent emphasized that “any act as the board of directors ... shall be presumed to be in the best interests of the corporation,” <a href="/a3d/81/1043-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="81 A.3d 1043" data-case-ids="7304228" data-case-paths="/a3d/81/1043-01">id. at 1059</a> (quoting 15 Pa.C,S. § 5715(d)), and noted that Zampogna failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption. The dissent also opined that a board’s action which it deems “-will serve the continued existence of the corporation” does not create a conflict of interest, and that the NCL specifically provides that a director’s action to retain his position does not constitute self-dealing. Id, at 1060-61 (citing 15 Pa.C.S. § 5715(e)(2)(iv)). As to the funds paid by LEHB, the dissent suggested the funds were corporate funds rather than public <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>funds because they had been paid to LEHB for services rendered, became part of LEHB’s corporate account, and, thus, had lost their public character.</p>

In LEHB’s view, the NCL grants nonprofit corporations broad powers, including: 1) the ability to make donations and contributions; 2) “[t]o have and exercise all of the powers and means appropriate to effect the purpose or purposes for which the corporation is incorporated;” and 3) to exercise all other powers vested in the corporation by law. 15 Pa.C.S. § 5502(a)(9), (18), (19). Notwithstanding these provisions, LEHB acknowledges that a nonprofit corporation’s powers are subject to any limitation or restriction imposed by statute or the corporation’s articles. 15 Pa.

Instead, like the Commonwealth Court majority, LEHB views its corporate purpose as a restriction contained within its Articles that limits its powers, conceding that any action it takes must be related to providing benefits for its members. Notwithstanding its agreement on the relevance of its corporate purpose, LEHB parts from the Commonwealth Court’s ultimate conclusion, contending that the court failed to consider the entire context of LEHB’s action when it determined the conduct was not related to LEHB’s corporate purpose.</p>

First, LEHB asserts, the FOP President appoints four of the five members of the Joint Trust Board, which has the capability of removing LEHB as the selected vendor to administer benefits. Thus, when Zampogna made what were perceived to be “intentional, material misrepresentations to members” concerning LEHB’s administration of their benefits, LEHB directors became concerned that Zampogna would negatively impact the organization if he were elected. LEHB’s Brief at 19. Second, and more importantly, LEHB directors believed that McNesby would be more efficient than Zampogna in negotiating with the City, which in turn could improve LEHB’s revenue stream and its ability to provide inexpensive benefits. For these reasons, LEHB believes the FOP President is “a matter of direct concern” to LEHB and concludes that its action in endorsing McNesby was “at the very least, incidental to the function of [LEHB],” if not directly related. Id. at 20-22. Accordingly, LEHB asserts its action was sufficiently related to its corporate purpose so as to satisfy the limitation contained within its Articles.</p>

Specifically, LEHB opines that, once the funds leave the City’s possession, the City has met its contractual obligation of contributing a specified amount of money per FOP member. LEHB notes that, thereafter, the funds are either received by the Joint Trust, which forwards the money to LEHB to administer benefits, or the City may pay LEHB directly to reimburse it for expenses which have already been incurred on behalf of an eligible member. LEHB emphasizes that, once the funds are placed in the Joint Trust or forwarded directly to LEHB, they become the private assets of the corporation and, thus, cease to retain their public character.</p>

Notably, Zampogna does not cite to any evidence of record to support the assertion that LEHB’s board acted under a conflict of interest, such as testimony suggesting that McNesby requested LEHB to endorse him. Instead, taking his lead from the Commonwealth Court’s majority opinion, Zampogna infers a conflict of interest based on the FOP President’s ability to appoint members of the Joint Trust Board.

Consistent with his argument that LEHB’s actions here did not relate to its corporate purpose, Zampogna also contends that LEHB improperly used public funds for a non-public purpose.

Just as the BCL grants to for-profit corporations, the NCL provides nonprofit corporations with “the legal capacity of natural persons to act.” 15 Pa.C.S. § 5501. Similarly, the NCL gives nonprofit corporations the same general powers as the BCL gives for-profit corporations, using nearly identical language. See 15 Pa.C.S. § 5502, Source Note—1990 (“Patterned after 15 Pa.C.S. § 1502,” which grants statutory powers to for-profit corporations).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> For example, nonprofit corporations have the authority to “exercise all of the powers and means appropriate <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>to effect the purpose or purposes for which the corporation is incorporated.” 15 Pa.C.S. § 5502(a)(18). This language is expansive, not restrictive. Additionally, the NCL gives a nonprofit corporation broad powers, such as the powers “[t]o conduct its business, carry on its operations,” and “[t]o have and exercise all other powers” otherwise vested in the corporation by law, “[sjubject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by statute ... [or] contained in its articles.” 15 Pa.C.S. § 5502(a)(15), (19). Accordingly, the NCL authorizes all nonprofit corporate actions that are not prohibited by the NCL or the corporation’s articles.</p>

Wells, supra at 585. Instead, we find that this limitation should be broadly interpreted considering the legal principles expounded above. Additionally, the NOL itself indicates that this purpose requirement is not meant to be overly <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>restrictive, as it requires nonprofit corporations to include only a “brief’ statement of purpose in their articles of incorporation. 15 Pa.C.S. § 5306(a)(3).

Thus, we find that a nonprofit corporation’s action is authorized when: 1) the action is not prohibited by the NCL or the corporation’s articles; and 2) the action is not clearly unrelated to the corporation’s stated purpose.

Because the union president has a direct impact on LEHB’s ability to function effectively, endorsing a candidate the corporation believes will better serve its members is not unrelated to its corporate purpose of administering benefits for its members.

While I agree with the first prong of this test, regarding the second, in my view, the majority’s approach— permitting all but “clearly unrelated” action—is not grounded in statute, regulation, or case law. Rather, the highly permissive standard the majority employs is based on the majority’s assumption that, because the NCL is largely modeled after the Business Corporation Law (“BCL”), and because the BCL gives modern day business corporations a nearly unlimited scope of power, we should treat nonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations as essentially one and the same, and find nearly all actions taken by a nonprofit corporation to be authorized.

Indeed, as the majority aptly notes, unlike the BCL, which permits a for-profit corporation to be incorporated for “any lawful purpose,” id. § 1301, the NCL requires a nonprofit corporation to be incorporated for a specified purpose, including or similar to those enumerated by statute, which include “athletic,” “charitable,” and “educational.” Id. §§ 5301(a), 5306(a)(3); <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2041.4" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="19 Pa.

This emphasis on corporate purpose, which was essentially eliminated for for-profit corporations under the BCL, is consistent with the differing goals of business and nonprofit corporations: while business corporations ultimately seek to make money for their owners, nonprofit corporations are organized to provide some focused benefit to society, and, as a result, each must include a statement of purpose apprising the public of its aims.

Stewart, Nonprofit Corporations, Organizations, <em>&amp; </em>Associations, 496 (6th ed. 1994) (expressing support for requirement of specific statement of corporate purpose with regard to nonprofit corporations because “the public and the organization’s own personnel ought to have clearly stated just what their organization is and does, particularly if it is to receive such legal privileges as tax exemption”); see also Johnny Rex Buckles, How Deep Are the Springs of Obedience Norms that Bind the Overseers of Charities?, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Cath.%20U.%20L.%20Rev.%20913" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="62 Cath.

Thus, rather than evaluating LEHB’s endorsement in terms of whether it was “clearly unrelated” to providing health benefits to FOP members, or in terms of whether a “reasonable person” would conclude that the endorsement was consistent with providing such benefits—tests offered by the <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>majority and concurrence, respectively, for which neither party has argued—I would apply Malone and Citizens’ Elec, and evaluate whether LEHB’s endorsement was directly or immediately appropriate to its stated corporate purpose of providing health and welfare benefits to the FOP members and their families.</p>

Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the FOP president appoints four out of the five individuals who sit on the Joint Trust Board, which, as the majority notes, directly impacts “LEHB’s ability to function effectively,” and, more specifically, its ability to provide health and welfare benefits to the FOP.

Op. at 595, 151 A.3d at 1014 (observing that, under circumstances of this case, the president of the FOP directly affects “LEHB’s revenue source and its very existence,” implicating “LEHB’s ability to function effectively”); Justice Todd’s Cone.

The burden should lie with the challenger to prove that a given action is not incidental to the stated purpose, employing a reasonable person standard to that assessment. While this standard might be more permissive than Justice Todd’s approach, she and I agree that requiring proof that a given action is “clearly unrelated” is tantamount to writing nonprofit corporations a blank check that all but entirely confounds the General Assembly’s determination that nonprofit corporations must identify a specific corporate purpose. To fail such a test, <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>a nonprofit corporation would have to undertake something having literally nothing to do with its purpose, undermining the very notion of a defined corporate purpose. Thus, LEHB presumably would be restrained from entering into the garment business, but might be found to act within its authority if it spent considerable sums to oppose enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> It seems to me that any test is too permissive that would leave the door open for LEHB to undertake something as remote as the latter hypothetical action is from managing the procurement and administration of healthcare insurance for its members.</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[254,944,1159,688]]]'>The difficulty with formulating a test of incidental authority, and the reason it requires the flexibility that an objective reasonable person test provides, is that, without a more detailed set of parameters to guide the formulation of a brief statement of purpose, a test as rigid as Citizens Electric’s undermines the breadth of authority the NCL manifestly seeks to confer. See 15 Pa.C.S. § 5502(a)(18), <em>supra </em>n.2. For these reasons, I would employ a reasonable person standard, pursuant to which a nonprofit corporation acts consistently with its stated purpose and articles of incorporation when a reasonable person would conclude that the challenged action directly or incidentally serves the corporation’s stated purpose.</p>

See Maj. Op. at 595, 151 A.3d at 1014. Providing health insurance costs money. The FOP presidency bears directly upon negotiations with the City of Philadelphia to seek funding to provide such benefits. Moreover, the FOP president, with power to appoint four of five members of the Joint Trust <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>Board, which in turn has the power to appoint and replace the administrator of benefits, holds LEHB’s very existence in the palm of his hand. Consequently, LEHB had every right and every reason to concern itself with the FOP presidential election, regardless of whether Mr. Zampogna impugned LEHB’s past performance in its administrative role.</p>

The majority discusses briefly the Commonwealth Court's determination that the "incidental” power conferred by the Articles enabled the exercise only of powers "directly and immediately appropriate to the execution of the specific power granted, ... not one that has merely some slight or remote relation to it,” which is the same Citizens Electric standard that Justice Todd would apply to determine the scope of incidental authority. See Maj. Op. at 584, 151 A.3d at 1007 (quoting the Commonwealth Court’s quotation of Citizens' Elec., supra); Justice Todd's Cone. Op. at 600-01, 151 A.3d at 1017-18. Citizens' Electric establishes that some degree of "incidental” power may be inferred even absent a specific grant of such authority by the business law or a corporation's articles of incorporation. Contemporarily, the NCL itself supports such an inference in its grant of authority to a corporation "[t]o have and exercise all of the powers and means appropriate to effect the purpose or purposes for which the corporation is incorporated.” 15 Pa.C.S. § 5502(a)(18). Moreover, especially when incidental authority is expressly granted, I would not interpret it as narrowly as Citizens Electric does, because the Citizens Electric standard confounds Subsection 5502(a)(18)’s more permissive grant of authority. Instead, I would utilize the common definition of incidental, which, in keeping with the NCL, is considerably more expansive. See, e.g,, American Heritage College Dictionary 687 (3d ed. 1993) (defining “incidental" as "1. Occurring or likely to occur as an unpredictable or minor accompaniment. 2. Of a minor, casual, or subordinate nature”).</p>
