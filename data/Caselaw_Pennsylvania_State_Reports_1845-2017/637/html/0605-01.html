The letter instructed Lerner to submit copies of his federal tax returns from the prior five years, to complete an attached worksheet, and to remit payment to the City within thirty days.

The City hoped that, confronted with an exorbitant assessment, Lerner would hand over his business records. But this failed to get Lerner’s attention. He simply ignored the bill.</p>

Six days later, Lerner sent the City a letter stating that he had never received the delinquent tax bill that the City had mailed to him three years earlier.

Approximately nine months later, on November 10, 2010, Lerner filed a petition for review with the City’s Tax Review Board. The Board held a hearing, concluded that it lacked jurisdiction in light of the collection action pending in the trial court, and dismissed Lerner’s petition. Lerner appealed the Board’s dismissal to the trial court, which consolidated Lerner’s appeal with the City’s collection action.

At the trial court level, Lerner never argued that Krug was inapposite or that an exception to the exhaustion requirement applied. Rather, Lerner consistently asserted—before, during, and after trial—that the City’s tax assessment lacked an evidentiary basis. See, e.g., Lerner’s Posh-Trial Motion, 7/8/2013, at ¶ 3 (arguing that “the assessment that [the City] prepared and forwarded to [Lerner] was a figure that they simply made up and had no basis in any evidence”). But now, on appeal before this Court, Lerner argues that his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies within the Department of Revenue did not prevent him from challenging the City’s tax assessment. It could not be more obvious that these are utterly distinct contentions. The former is a substantive challenge to the City’s assessment, whereas the latter concerns the trial court’s jurisdiction to hear such a challenge in the first place.

The current version of this statute, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1504, which is similar to its predecessor, has application here since the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, pursuant to which the Tax Review Board was created, has the status of an act of the General Assembly.

In its appellate brief filed with this Court, the City now contends that its assessment in this case was a permissible estimate based on the best evidence available. Brief of the City at 34-38. The City’s own evidence at trial, however, demonstrated that the $150,000.00 annual net income upon which the assessment was calculated was an entirely "made-up” <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>number intended to scare Lerner into cooperation. N.T., 6/26/2013, at 43-61. Without any basis in fact, it was not an estimate.</p>

To the contrary, in these cases tire City consistently presented the trial court with a firm evidentiary basis for the amount of its claim.

Majority Op. at 612-13, 151 A.3d at 1024-25. This characterization is <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>not entirely false, as the trial court sanctioned him for, inter alia, discovery abuses. I trust, however, that the Majority is not suggesting that Lerner fairly deserved to have a $280,772.67 sham judgment entered against him as a punishment for his intransigence during discovery.</p>
