When Flora assumed the Chiefs position, the OPD already was riddled with problems stemming from understaffing and underfunding, deficiencies most prominently displayed at the time by the OPD’s inability to represent juveniles facing delinquency petitions. A report prepared in the aftermath of <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>the notorious “Kids for Cash”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> scandal detailed the OPD’s abject inability to represent accused juveniles, noting that approximately fifty percent of juveniles appearing in Luzerne County’s Juvenile Court were unrepresented. Eventually, Flora was able to secure funding to create a Juvenile Unit within the OPD in order to reduce the office’s deficiencies in representing juveniles. However, in order to staff this new unit, Flora had to transfer a senior attorney out of the OPD’s Adult Unit. Although funding existed to replace the senior attorney in the Adult Unit, Luzerne County officials rebuffed Flora’s request for authorization to fill the position, thus leaving the Adult Unit understaffed to tackle its increasing caseload.</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[199,1016,1152,580]]]'>In June 2010, Flora submitted a report to the Luzerne County Board of Commissioners regarding the state of the OPD. In the report, Flora outlined his belief that, for want of sufficient resources and funding, the OPD could not provide adequate representation to Luzerne County’s indigent criminal defendants in a manner sufficient to satisfy the Public Defender Act, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In his report, Flora noted that the lack of resources created rampant deficiencies in representation, including the following:</p>

    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[255,636,1154,529]]]'>In July 2010, Flora provided the Luzerne County Board of Commissioners with a short-term plan to address the deficiencies. The plan included recommendations to hire new appellate attorneys as well as additional trial attorneys, and to create and implement a caseload-monitoring system. The Board of Commissioners denied each recommendation. Then, in his 2011 and 2012 budget proposals, Flora sought the addition of two appellate attorneys, an investigator, and a secretary. On each occasion, the Board of Commissioners rejected Flora’s requests.</p>
    <p id="b72-6" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[255,1187,1152,360]]]'>In December 2011, Flora decided to implement his 2010 proposal to decline representation to certain applicants. Faced with mounting caseloads and overwhelmed attorneys, Flora directed the OPD to reject applicants who were not incarcerated and who were charged only with minor offenses. The OPD continued to refuse representation to such individuals until June 2012.</p>

The reduction would have required the OPD to eliminate four full-time positions from its already-strained staff.

Because Luzerne County implemented a hiring freeze in February of that year, Flora could not fill the positions. By April, the OPD staff consisted of only four full-time attorneys, thirteen part-time attorneys, three investigators, four secretaries, one receptionist, and one office administrator. The OPD continued to operate with five unfilled attorney positions, <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>three full-time and two part-time. Most of the attorneys who worked for the OPD did not have their own desks, telephones, or computers. One part-time attorney informed Flora that he could not accept any more cases because, due to his current caseload, he could not satisfy his ethical duties to any additional defendants.</p>

Other than Flora, the plaintiffs identified themselves as persons charged with crimes in Luzerne County, each of whom qualified for the OPD’s services. The OPD could not provide these plaintiffs with representation due to the inadequate funding and depleted resources plaguing the office. Flora and the other plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus compelling the county to lift the hiring freeze and to increase funding to the OPD to a level that would enable the OPD to provide adequate representation to every qualified applicant. Simultaneously, the plaintiffs brought a claim under the federal Civil Rights Act, see <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>, and Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, seeking an injunction against Appellees requiring the immediate appointment of private counsel to assist them in their defenses and requiring additional funding to satisfy the OPD’s obligation to ensure that all qualified applicants receive competent legal representation.</p>

On May 10, 2012, following additional briefing and supplementation, the trial court convened a hearing to allow the parties to present oral argument on the motion for a peremptory writ of mandamus and a preliminary injunction.</p>

Each of these three individuals was indigent and facing criminal charges in Luzerne County, and each had been assigned an attorney by the OPD. However, Appellants alleged that, due to the financial straits of the OPD, and the limited time and resources that the OPD’s attorneys could devote to each case, the representation that Appellants would receive as their cases progressed would not meet constitutional norms.</p>

For instance, Flora applied for grants and reallocated funds to purchase computers for OPD lawyers. Flora also began sending OPD attorneys to initial bail hearings in an effort to decrease the amount of <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>time that defendants spent in jail, an initiative which saved Luzerne County money that could have been allocated to the OPD, but was not. Flora then worked with the OPD attorneys to shift the workload from busier lawyers to those with a lighter caseload to ensure that defendants were receiving the best representation possible. As noted above, however, Flora was fired as Chief Public Defender nonetheless.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[274,756,1150,420]]]'>Flora’s attempts to reduce the burden on the OPD did not substantially alleviate the growing crisis. Caseloads continued to mount, but no increase in funding was in the offing. When the amended complaint was filed, the OPD employed ten full-time attorneys, eleven part-time attorneys, three investigators, four secretaries, one receptionist and one office administrator. Two of the full-time positions were funded only until early 2014, when they would revert to part-time positions.</p>

Appellants first delineated six essential components of competent “legal representation” that offices servicing indigent defendants require in order to comply with the Sixth Amendment: (1) the attorneys must have adequate knowledge of the relevant areas of the law; (2) the attorneys must be assigned to represent indigent clients at the earliest possible stage; (3) the attorneys must be present at every critical stage of the client’s case; (4) the office and attorneys must be able to conduct reasonable factual and legal pre-trial investigations, pursue and comply with the discovery rules, and utilize investigators when necessary; (5) the attorneys must be able to consult with their clients to discuss the material aspects of the case, as well as the client’s substantive and procedural rights, to ensure that the client is making informed decisions regarding the case; and (6) the attorneys must be able to perform their work with reasonable diligence and promptness. These criteria, according to Appellants, comprised the necessary elements of constitutional representation of indigent defendants. Due to the lack of funds and resources, Appellants alleged that the OPD could not satisfy any one of <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>these six criteria, let alone all of them, and, therefore, could not provide constitutionally adequate representation.</p>
    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[197,466,1152,948]]]'>Regarding the first component, adequate knowledge of the relevant law, Appellants pleaded that the OPD could not sufficiently train its attorneys in the Adult Unit because there simply were no funds to do so. Those attorneys who were tasked with capital cases were required to pay out of their own pocket for the continuing legal education required for capital-qualified attorneys. Moreover, even though the OPD recently had hired one appellate attorney, many of the trial attorneys nonetheless had to brief, file, and argue the appeals that arose from their trial dockets. Because the OPD lacked the time and resources for appellate training, these trial attorneys were underqualified to perform appellate litigation, often proceeding without proficiency in the rules of appellate procedure and governing case law. As a result, the attorneys often missed deadlines or otherwise failed to comply with the technical requirements of an appeal. The time required to pursue appeals also critically reduced the OPD attorneys’ time to consult with clients and prepare for trials.</p>

Appellants asserted that the heavy caseload and inadequate resources and manpower prevented the OPD attorneys from best serving their clients’ interests at the pre-trial stages. Due to the heavy caseload, OPD attorneys frequently had to postpone hearings, which delayed cases and often forced indigent clients to spend more time in jail than they would have had counsel been more available. Additionally, their overwhelming caseloads denied OPD attorneys the time necessary to consult adequately and fully with clients <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>before those individuals had to make critical, life-altering decisions. The clients were forced to make these decisions without a full understanding of the facts of their cases, the elements of their crimes, or the potential defenses available to them. Finally, the caseloads created trial schedules that prohibited consistent representation; often, substitute attorneys filled in for unavailable attorneys while lacking critical information about the clients or the cases.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[251,783,1153,362]]]'>Next, Appellants asserted that the OPD attorneys were unable to conduct reasonable factual investigations and discovery. Time constraints often prevented any investigation. Even when an attorney obtained discovery materials, he or she rarely had any time to review the materials rigorously. Attorneys frequently entered into plea negotiations on behalf of their clients without a full understanding of the cases.</p>
    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[252,1168,1153,731]]]'>The attorneys themselves lacked the time or resources to interview witnesses, visit crime scenes, or otherwise investigate the facts alleged by the Commonwealth. The OPD also lacked the investigators necessary to perform these critical functions. At the time of the amended complaint, the OPD employed three investigators to service twenty-one attorneys and the 4000 new cases that come to the OPD every year. By way of comparison, the Luzerne County District Attorney’s Office employed ten detectives, who assisted twenty-six attorneys. OPD investigators often could not perform investigative duties during the work day because they were required to perform administrative duties, such as entering information into a case management system or delivering mail, due to the lack of support staff.</p>

Moreover, many clients met their attorney for the first time immediately before their preliminary hearing, and without any meaningful, confidential discussion about the case or the nature of the hearing itself. After the preliminary hearing, OPD attorneys rarely contacted their clients in the approxi<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>mately three months between the hearing and the status conference, or between the status conference and the pre-trial conference. Clients were left in the dark during these critical months. Similarly, Appellants maintained that the OPD attorneys were not available for substantive meetings with clients before either trial or sentencing. Stated differently, the OPD attorneys were not able to maintain regular or sustained contact with their clients, which substantially hindered the attorney-client relationship and compromised the ability to present an effective defense or to negotiate favorable plea agreements.</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[190,973,1153,368]]]'>As to the final component, Appellants pleaded that the OPD attorneys were unable to perform their work with reasonable diligence and promptness. Motions were not filed on time, and were rarely accompanied by a full review of discovery materials. Plea negotiations similarly were uninformed. Trial preparation was hasty, and often came too late to uncover the facts necessary to mount an effective defense.</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[192,1373,1153,472]]]'>Appellants detailed the workload required of each OPD attorney. In 2010 and 2011, the OPD received over 4,000 new criminal cases, 2,000 of which were felonies. There were also over 1,000 carry-over cases from prior years. In addition, the OPD processed appeals, mental health commitment proceedings, and parole hearings. Each ease requires out-of-court preparation, consultation, investigation, and, in some instances, travel. This caseload had to be managed by twenty-one attorneys, a majority of whom were part-time employees.</p>
    <p id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[193,1875,1153,529]]]'>Appellants next addressed the other problems that plagued the OPD due to underfunding. The OPD was unable to employ enough social workers, paralegals, assistants, clerical workers, or other necessary support staff. Many attorneys lacked desks, phones, or private workspaces. The circumstances improved after the County took efforts to comply with the trial court’s order granting the preliminary injunction, including providing spaces for confidential communications. Nonetheless, facilities necessary to operate a constitutionally adequate office were not provided.</p>

Regarding mandamus, Ap-pellees noted that, to be entitled to mandamus, a party must demonstrate a clear right to relief. Because budgetary decisions are discretionary, private citizens do not have a clear right to any form of relief, thus precluding a mandamus remedy. As to the alleged constitutional violations and the request for a permanent injunction, Appellees argued that Appellants had failed to demonstrate that they suffered any present injuries, the likelihood of immediate or irreparable harm, or the unavailability of other remedies at law.</p>

The Court of Appeals held that, to proceed, such plaintiffs had to show a likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury and the inadequacy of a remedy at law. In Hurrell-Harring, the New York Court of Appeals held, <em>inter alia, </em>that Strickland applies only in the post-conviction setting, and is distinguishable from pre-trial claims challenging whether states were meeting their “foundational obligation under Gideon” to provide competent legal counsel.

Appellants note that Strickland addressed two questions: (1) whether there was a right to effective assistance of counsel; and (2) if so, what legal standard governs when that right was violated but the defendant has been convicted and is seeking a new trial. Once the Supreme Court answered the first question in the affirmative, it then was required to balance the interest of the defendant in receiving effective assistance of counsel (including counsel’s professional discretion in choosing and employing trial strategies) against the state’s interest in avoiding retrial of a defendant whose counsel’s ineffectiveness had no <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>material effect on the outcome of the trial.

      <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>In their <em>amicus </em>brief, the Innocence Network and the Pennsylvania Innocence Project (collectively, “the Innocence Project”) argue that underfunding of public defenders’ offices threatens the adversarial truth-determining process. They note that inadequate representation is the largest contributor to erroneous convictions. Overburdened attorneys cannot provide the representation necessary to ensure that innocent defendants are not convicted in circumstances where competent counsel would secure an acquittal. Similarly, attorneys without the time and resources necessary to provide a meaningful defense all too often negotiate disadvantageous guilty pleas quickly to reduce their caseloads, often encouraging even innocent defendants to accept pleas in order to avoid delays in the resolution of cases and to abbreviate pretrial incarceration. Like Appellants, the Innocence Project argues that Strickland does not—and was not intended to—address pretrial claims of systematic ineffectiveness. Pennsylvania’s Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-46, also is not a viable vehicle to address systematic pretrial failures due to the strict procedural hurdles that a defendant seeking relief must overcome, including the requirement that the person be serving a sentence not only when relief is sought but throughout the sometimes lengthy period required to dispose of PCRA claims.

The Associations join Appellants in arguing that Strickland cannot remedy prospective civil claims of constructive denial of counsel. The Associations maintain that “[t]o suggest that the Sixth Amendment cannot be enforced except where deficient representation led to a wrongful conviction both contravenes [United States Supreme Court precedent] and demonstrates a misconception of the role of defense counsel in the adversarial criminal justice system.” <em>Amicus </em>Brief for the Associations at 15. The Associations assert that such a view “also underestimates the power <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>of the courts to ensure that rights are not systematically violated in addition to their important role in affording individualized remedies after a violation [has] occurred.” Id.</p>

The ABA notes that “52 years of post-Gideon history and precedent show that individual, retrospective ineffective assistance of counsel claims brought after trial cannot address chronic, systemic problems such as those alleged in this case.” Id. The ABA argues that Strickland-type post-conviction relief not only would fail to remedy the civil claims asserted by Appellants, but also would fail to hold a public defender’s office or the funding county to account for non-compliance with Gideon. Strickland can provide a remedy only to one person at a time. Such sporadic, piecemeal rulings are unlikely to compel public defender’s offices to make necessary changes, or to induce counties to provide the resources necessary to provide meaningful legal representation to indigent defendants.</p>

Furthermore, Appellants cannot direct this Court’s attention to any particular action by their lawyers that amounts to ineffective assistance. Rather, Appellants expressed dissatisfaction with the attorneys assigned to them, and “believed” that counsel ultimately would not devote enough attention to their cases.

Rather, Appellees argue that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in O’Shea provides the test that Appellants must satisfy; to wit, a plaintiff seeking prospective relief must demonstrate “the likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury and inadequacies of legal remedies.” O’Shea, <a href="/us/414/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="414 U.S. 488" data-case-ids="11716177" data-case-paths="/us/414/0488-01">414 U.S. at 502</a>, <a href="/us/414/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="414 U.S. 488" data-case-ids="11716177" data-case-paths="/us/414/0488-01">94 S.Ct. 669</a>.

The only time that Appellants, or anyone else in the class, were deprived of the right to counsel was when Flora, himself, rejected indigent applicants for representation. To date, as no deprivations have occurred by virtue of the Appellees’ actions or decisions, and because Appellants have not pleaded any facts that are more than speculative, Appellants’ claims are not ripe for review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

This seems to us to be an obvious truth. Governments, both state and federal, quite properly spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of crime. Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the public’s interest in an orderly society. Similarly, there are few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can to prepare and present their defenses. That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the wide—spread belief that lawyers in criminal cases are necessities, not luxuries. The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him.</blockquote>

The answer is obvious: Gideon’s clear command to state courts would be a dead letter if states—or the counties that comprise them—need only go through the motions.

Even so, these latter provisions are not implicated in every criminal case. By contrast, the right to counsel plays a significant role in every single case. What is more, it is relevant at almost every stage of every criminal case. In Cronic, the Supreme Court recognized this unique pervasiveness of the right to counsel, emphasizing that “[o]f all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive[,] for it affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have.” Cronic, 466 U.S. at 654, <a href="/us/466/0648-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="466 U.S. 648" data-case-ids="6204502" data-case-paths="/us/466/0648-01">104 S.Ct. 2039</a> (quoting Walter Schaefer’s “Federalism and State Criminal Procedure,” <a href="/citations/?q=70%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="70 Harv.

Convicted defendants stand in shoes very different from those worn by Appellants herein. As the Strickland Court noted in its opening paragraph, it was called upon to create a test that, if successful, would require judges to set aside criminal verdicts. In other words, Strickland is outcome-based, focusing in large part upon whether the trial itself was rendered unreliable by counsel’s deficient performance. Inherent in that outcome-based analysis is the notion that states should not suffer the burden of multiple trials if counsel’s constitutional derelictions did not affect the verdict. Other considerations undergirding the deferential two-part test included the interest in the finality of criminal convictions, the potential that court-appointed counsel would not be inclined to accept cases due to the burdens of extensive post-trial litigation, and the need for the independence of counsel. Strickland, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="235" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">466 U.S. at 690</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="236" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a>.

Appellants are not arguing individual claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellants point to no specific instances in which an attorney failed to provide constitutionally effective stewardship. Rather, Appellants’ claim centers upon the widespread and endemic inability of the OPD’s attorneys to provide counsel to indigent defendants. Appellants assert that the OPD lacks the number of attorneys and staff necessary to manage the large and increasing caseload in Luzerne County. The attorneys that the OPD does employ are so constrained in time and resources that they cannot provide the basic services that sustain and foster the attorney client relationship, and cannot devote the effort necessary to investigate and defend against the prosecution’s case. These general allegations in no way resemble the individual ineffectiveness claims that the Court considered in Strickland. There is no performance by individual counsel to evaluate, nor is there a trial, the reliability of which might be questioned. There are <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>no interests in avoiding a retrial, nor are there any decisions made by counsel that warrant deference.

Appellants asserted that the OPD could not train attorneys in the relevant, developing law, nor was the OPD able to fund mandatory continuing legal education training for its capital attorneys. Trial attorneys, untrained in appellate practice, were required to appeal their own cases, which often resulted in missed deadlines, waived issues, and unpersuasive arguments. Appellants asserted that OPD attorneys were unable to appear on behalf of clients at preliminary arraignments. Their absence resulted in clients receiving higher bail orders than necessary, serving prolonged and unnecessary pretrial incarceration, and being read a list of charges that the clients did not understand.</p>

The delays increased the anguish and anxiety attending those facing criminal charges. More importantly, the delays unnecessarily extended pretrial incarceration. The attorneys’ time was so taxed by their caseload, Appellants claimed, that, even when the attorneys were available, they were often unprepared and unable to provide meaningful advice. The same time constraints precluded the attorneys from investigating the facts and defenses of each case, and rendered them incapable of advising clients regarding constitutional rights and the effects that flow from decisions such as whether to plead guilty or whether to testify at trial.</p>

So viewed, it is evident that Appellants have alleged that, on a system-wide basis, the traditional markers of representation being provided by the OPD either are absent or significantly compromised. Furthermore, the limitations, and in some cases absences, of counsel are a result of the substantial structural deficiencies that result from a lack of adequate funding. Consequently, Appellants have demonstrated the “likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury,” and have stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. Further, based upon our discussion above, it also is clear that Strickland is not an available source of relief, and that no other remedy at law exists to redress Appellants’ claims.</p>

Hence, the fact that Appellants cannot point to a specific instance of an indigent client being actually deprived of the right to counsel is not fatal to the claim.

Indeed, we do not need to consider the first two mandamus requirements, because the issue readily may be resolved by considering only the final requirement. As noted, to be entitled to a writ of mandamus, in addition to the other requirements, Appellants must demonstrate that there is no other adequate or appropriate remedy at law. We reject Appellants’ arguments for mandamus simply because there is another remedy at law: the cause of action that we have recognized earlier in this opinion. If Appellants ultimately can prove that they are entitled to injunctive relief, the remedy afforded will be the same as if a court issued a writ of mandamus: increased funding.

I must highlight, however, that the rather simplistic manner in which I believe this appeal should be decided is dictated by the procedural posture of this case. Pleading sufficient facts to survive a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer is a rather low legal hurdle to clear. Providing evidence to substantiate those facts and proving the necessity of a writ of mandamus are far more challenging obstacles. Indeed, it is well-settled that mandamus is an extraordinary writ. See, e.g., Chilli v. Sch. Dist. of City of McKeesport, <a href="/pa/334/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="296" data-cite="334 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="1190765" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0581-01">334 Pa. 581</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%2099" class="citation" data-index="297" data-cite="6 A.2d 99">6 A.2d 99</a>, 99 (1939) (“Mandamus is not a remedy of absolute right, it is an extraordinary writ, discretionary with the court, and can only be obtained when there is a clear legal right in the relator and a positive duty of the defendant to be performed, and where there is no other adequate, specific or appropriate remedy; mandamus can never be invoked in a doubtful case.”).</p>

Such a judgment only could require Appellees to provide funding that meets minimum requirements necessary to allow the OPD to provide effective assistance of counsel, as that term is well-defined in cases involving collateral attacks on judgments of sentence.
