Tier II sexual offenses require registration as a sexual offender for 25 years. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.15(a)(2). When SORNA became effective, Hainesworth was serving a term of probation as a result of a conviction that SORNA classifies as a sexually violent offense.

After a hearing, the trial court denied the petition; however, the court’s order further stated that Hainesworth was not subject <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>to SORNA’s registration requirements. In this regard, the court posited that the application of SORNA to Hainesworth would violate due process, fundamental fairness, and the parties’ negotiated plea agreement. <a href="/a3d/82/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="82 A.3d 444" data-case-ids="7332750" data-case-paths="/a3d/82/0444-01">Id. at 446-47</a>.

Hainesworth framed the issue similarly to how the trial court viewed it, <em>ie., </em>whether the parties’ plea agreement included a term that Hainesworth does not have to register as a sexual offender, and if so, whether he is entitled to the benefit of his bargain. On the other hand, the Commonwealth believed the issue involved a question of statutory application of SORNA, which could not be avoided. Consistently, the Commonwealth argued that the Superior Court had previously upheld changes to the registration requirements of Megan’s Law applicable to registrants who are under correctional supervision, noting that registration requirements are non-punitive collateral consequences of convictions, <a href="/a3d/82/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="82 A.3d 444" data-case-ids="7332750" data-case-paths="/a3d/82/0444-01">id.,</a> and that the court should apply the same reasoning to SORNA. The Hainesworth court determined that the trial court and Hainesworth properly framed the issue in the case as one that implicated a contract law analysis. <a href="/a3d/82/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="82 A.3d 444" data-case-ids="7332750" data-case-paths="/a3d/82/0444-01">Id.</a></p>

The court did so by first rejecting the Commonwealth’s contention that, because registration under SORNA is a non-punitive collateral consequence of Hainesworth’s conviction, Hainesworth is subject to SORNA’s reporting requirements.

As to the Commonwealth’s belief regarding the alleged collateral nature of SORNA’s registration requirements, Appellees take the position that the Hainesworth court properly rejected the claim that “a promise of non-registration should not be enforced because registration is ‘collateral’ to the sentence.” Martinez/Grace Brief at 39; Shower’s Brief at 26. Indeed, Appellees echo the Hainesworth court’s determination that, for purposes of a contractual analysis of the parties’ plea agreement, the dispositive question regarding a convicted criminal’s sexual offender registration status is whether sexual offender registration was a term of the parties’ agreement, and if it was, then that term must be enforced. For the reasons that follow, we agree with Appellees.</p>

In fact, courts have long recognized that plea negotiations and agreements are essential components of the criminal justice system.

For instance, unlike a typical contract, a plea agreement does not become binding on the parties upon their consent to terms; rather, a plea agreement is not valid and binding until it is evaluated and accepted by a third party, <em>ie., </em>a trial court. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 590(A)(3) (stating that a judge may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>and that the judge shall not accept the plea unless the judge determines after inquiry of the defendant that the plea is voluntarily and understanding^ tendered).</p>

For all intents and purposes, the parties agree on this point. See Commonwealth’s Martinez/Grace Brief at 13 (“A guilty plea is a contract.”); Commonwealth’s Shower Brief at 13 (same); Martinez/Grace Brief at 30 (“Specific enforcement of a plea agreement is also supported by contract law, but with a significant distinction.”) (footnote omitted); Shower’s Brief at 20 (same).

The Commonwealth’s belief in this regard is based upon this Court’s previous decisions where we found that the registration requirements of various versions of Megan’s Law did not constitute punishment but, rather, amounted to collateral consequences of qualifying criminal convictions.

In other words, the Zuber Court did not simply conclude that Zuber was not entitled to the bargained-for sentence because the sentence was unenforceable. Instead, the Court examined the parties' agreement, found that the agreement included the unenforceable sentence, and held that Zuber was entitled to that sentence.

When a person yields rights that our federal and state Constitutions recognize as fundamental, strict performance is required of the prosecution. This is so regardless of a subsequent change in the law, and irrespective of whether such change affects only a collateral consequence of the guilty plea. In Commonwealth v. Hainesworth, <a href="/a3d/82/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="82 A.3d 444" data-case-ids="7332750" data-case-paths="/a3d/82/0444-01">82 A.3d 444</a> (Pa. Super. 2013) <em>(en banc), </em>the Superior Court correctly insisted upon strict performance in such circumstances, and the Majority wisely does so in the cases <em>sub judice.</em>

The record in each case demonstrates beyond peradventure that the plea bargain was predicated, at least in part, either upon avoiding Megan’s Law entirely or upon limiting that provision’s application to ten years instead of for the offender’s lifetime. Not all cases are as patent as these ones, nor is the record always so demonstrative. Often, the particulars of the out-of-court negotiations will not appear in the official transcripts or the certified record, or what does appear of record will not be clear.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[269,1612,1151,689]]]'>In such instances, it is incumbent upon the trial court in the first instance to consider the facts and circumstances in order to determine which terms, if any, were included in the actual agreement reached by the parties and presented to the court for approval. Much, if not all, of the complexity and confusion that can arise in these situations can easily be avoided. To ensure that both parties receive that for which they bargained, and to ensure that constitutional rights are not waived without a full understanding of the consequences of pleading guilty, the parties should present a complete recitation of their agreement on the record before the court accepts or rejects the plea. Failure to do so unnecessarily jeopardizes the good faith bargain that the parties have negotiated.</p>
