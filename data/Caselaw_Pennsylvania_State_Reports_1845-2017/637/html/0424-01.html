Appellate Counsel filed a post-sentence motion raising, as relevant here, a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, but the trial court denied relief. Appellate Counsel then filed a notice of appeal to the Superior Court, whereupon the trial court issued an order directing him to file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Appellate Counsel filed a document styled as a “preliminary” concise statement, wherein he raised three issues: (1) whether Appellant’s sentence was “an abuse of discretion”; (2) whether the trial court erred in excluding evidence that the alleged victim had previously accused her father of sexual abuse; and (3) whether a juror fraudulently concealed bias during <em>voir dire. </em>Appellate Counsel also attached a copy of his post-sentence motion to the “preliminary” concise statement, erroneously believing that doing so would preserve the claims raised therein for purposes of appeal, and requested additional time to file a “final” concise statement, which the trial court granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, Appellate Counsel never filed a revised concise statement, and, accordingly, the trial court considered the three claims raised in the extant concise statement, and issued a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion rejecting those claims. Appellate Counsel then filed an appellate brief with the Superior Court, in which, deciding to abandon the three claims raised in his concise statement and addressed by the trial court, he raised as his sole appellate issue the unpreserved sufficiency claim.</p>

Unlike the case in Lantzy, Halley, and Liebel, ... Reed’s direct appeal counsel’s conduct in the instant case did not deprive Reed of his constitutional right to appeal. Significantly, Reed’s direct appeal counsel filed a timely notice of appeal, which was docketed with the prothonotary. Although the Superior Court ... opined that counsel’s failure to provide appropriate citation to authority and a copy of the notes of testimony resulted in waiver of Reed’s argument, the court did not quash Reed’s appeal. Indeed, the issues apparently were sufficiently presented to allow the court to address the merits of Reed’s arguments, as the court indicated that it reviewed the evidence and the record. ... At most, the Superior Court’s review of Reed’s arguments on the record before it may be viewed as a “narrowing of the ambit” of Reed’s appeal. Moreover, to extend the [doctrine of ineffective assistance of counsel <em>per </em>se] to cases involving a defect in an appellate brief essentially would transform the exception into a rule, as many appellate briefs contain at least one arguable defect.</blockquote>

As demonstrated <em>supra, </em>this Court has, since Halley, held that errors which <em>completely </em>foreclose appellate review amount to a constructive denial of counsel and thus ineffective assistance of counsel <em>per se, </em>whereas those which only <em>partially </em>foreclose such review are subject to the ordinary Strickland/Pierce <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>framework. Moreover, contrary to the suggestion of the lower courts and the Commonwealth, Reed did not modify this analytical approach, but, rather, confirmed it. Indeed, as detailed above, Reed involved an appellate brief which, although the Superior Court opined was so deficiently developed as to warrant a finding of waiver, was “apparently ... sufficiently presented to allow the court to address the merits of Reed’s arguments.” Reed, <a href="/pa/601/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="971 A.2d 1216" data-case-ids="4194847,7299224" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0257-01,/a2d/971/1216-01">971 A.2d at 1226</a>. In light of Halley’s distinction between errors completely foreclosing review and those merely “narrowing the ambit” of appellate review, this fact was critical, as this Court reasoned, noting that, “[a]t most, the Superior Court’s review of Reed’s arguments on the record before it may be viewed as a ‘narrowing of the ambit’ of Reed’s appeal.” <a href="/pa/601/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="971 A.2d 1216" data-case-ids="4194847,7299224" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0257-01,/a2d/971/1216-01">Id. at 1226-27</a>. In other words, the brief in Reed was not so underdeveloped as to completely foreclose appellate review, but, rather, presented a less robust version of Reed’s underlying evidentiary claim, which the Superior Court reviewed on its merits, precluding a finding that his attorney’s errors caused a complete deprivation of merits review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

There is no meaningful difference between an attorney who fails to file a notice of appeal, Rule 1925(b) statement, brief, or petition for allowance of appeal—thereby forfeiting his client’s right to appeal—and one who makes all necessary filings, but does so relative solely <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>to claims he has not preserved for appeal, producing the same end.

    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[259,519,1153,1372]]]'>Furthermore, although the Commonwealth’s view that its proposed limitation on Lantzy and its progeny is more judicially administrable because it draws a clear distinction between claims of ineffective assistance of counsel <em>per se </em>and those subject to the Strickland/Pierce framework is well-taken, we do not view it as significantly more advantageous in this context than the rule in Halley. Particularly where, as herein, an attorney has matter-of-factly forfeited <em>all </em>preserved claims of error in favor of unpreserved ones, it is a straightforward matter for an appellate court to conclude the claims are waived. Indeed, unlike in Reed, where the Superior Court was required to contemplate the degree to which review could be performed despite counsel’s errors, and could consider the merits of issues from the arguments made with respect to them in the brief, here, no such analysis was required: due to counsel’s actions, the only claim raised, by virtue of its omission from the Rule 1925(b) statement, was manifestly waived. Moreover, as we indicated in Halley, the distinction between errors causing complete deprivation of review and those causing only partial deprivation of review plainly “addresses the .., concern that the presumption should not extend to every circumstance in which a defendant may claim no effective appeal.” Halley, <a href="/pa/582/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="870 A.2d 795" data-case-ids="650294,9019354" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0164-01,/a2d/870/0795-01">870 A.2d at 801</a>.

I am of the view that the waiver of all claims presented on direct appeal, as occurred in Reed—resulting in a complete forfeiture of as-of-right direct appellate review—'is tantamount to a complete denial of counsel. <em>Accord id. </em>at 276-77, <a href="/pa/601/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="971 A.2d 1216" data-case-ids="4194847,7299224" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0257-01,/a2d/971/1216-01">971 A.2d at 1227</a> (Saylor, J., dissenting). Indeed, from my point of view, the majority’s effort to distinguish <em>Reed </em>is in tension with the salutary thrust of its opinion. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 439,150 A.3d at 434 (“[T]he filing of a brief that raises only waived issues ... [is] akin to failing to file documents perfecting an appeal.”); <em>id. </em>at 439 n.ll, 150 A.3d at 434 n.ll (distinguishing “a brief so poor as to warrant a finding of waiver” from “one which is merely deficient in some aspect or another”); <em>id. </em>at 439-40, 150 A.3d at 434 (“There is no meaningful difference between an attorney who fails to file a notice of appeal, Rule 1925(b) statement, brief, or petition for allowance of appeal— thereby forfeiting his client’s right to appeal—and one who <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>makes all necessary filings, but does so relative solely to claims he has not preserved for appeal, producing the same end.”).</p>
