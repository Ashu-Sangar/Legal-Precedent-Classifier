H. at 1088. In so ruling, the Commonwealth Court considered itself to be bound by its prior en banc decisions in Mohn and Raffle. With respect to PSEA’s due process claims, the Commonwealth Court granted PSEA’s cross-motion for summary judgment, holding that the RTKL is procedurally deficient because it does not provide affected individuals with necessary due process when their personal information is requested. Id. at 1084-85. The Commonwealth Court stated that this Court permitted PSEA’s petition for declaratory judgment to proceed based primarily on due process concerns. Id. at 1084. As a result, the Commonwealth Court decided that the lack of procedural due process under the RTKL eviscerates the legislature’s intent under the personal security exception, and accordingly, violates the statutory scheme of the RTKL. Id. at 1086. The Commonwealth Court did not announce that the RTKL was unconstitutional, as PSEA had requested, and instead fashioned a remedy designed to apply when a school district receives a request for personal employee information (such as a home address).

PSEA contends that the home addresses of its member public school employees are exempt from disclosure under the “personal security” exception in Section 708(b)(l)(ii) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. § 67.708(b)(l)(ii), which requires recognition of the constitutional right to privacy guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Constitution. Brief of Appellant/PSEA at 30. Applying section 1922(4) of the Statutory Construction Act, PSEA contends that when interpreting a statute, there is a presumption that “when a court of last resort has construed the language used in a statute, the General Assembly in subsequent statutes on the same subject matter intends the same construction to be placed upon such language.” Id. at 35 (citing 1 Pa. C.S.A. § 1922(4)). PSEA asserts that the now-repealed RTKA and the current RTKL contain the same “personal security” exclusion from disclosures of personal information, and that this Court, in Sapp Roofing, Penn State and Bodack, had interpreted this exclusion to require recognition of a constitutional right to informational privacy. Id. at 35-37. Based upon application of statutory construction principles, PSEA submits that the “personal security” language in the current RTKL must be similarly interpreted. Id. at 37. PSEA argues that “if the ‘personal security’ exemption in section 708(b)(1)(ii) is not <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>interpreted to include a constitutional balancing test, ... it violates the Right to Privacy and is unenforceable.” Id, at 42.

The OOR posits that the language surrounding the phrase “personal security” in the current RTKL differs from that of the prior RTKA, and thus the prior protections for home addresses are now gone. Id. at 20. Relying instead on the Commonwealth Court’s decisions in Mohn and Raffle, the OOR contends that when the legislature enacted the RTKL, it chose not to carry over the statutory privacy exception and its attendant balancing test.

This right of privacy typically arises when the government seeks information related to persons accused of crimes or other malfeasance, and requires an assessment of the extent to which the government’s demands invade the bounds of the person’s subjective privacy interest, which in turn requires consideration of the extent to which the person’s privacy interests are reasonable. As such, when considering the extent to which the government must recognize privacy rights under Article 1, section 8, this Court has routinely required a factual examination of whether (1) the person has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy in the items to be searched or disclosed, and (2) whether society is prepared to recognize this expectation as reasonable and protectable.

First, the OOR misconstrues the nature of the protection afforded to RTKA requests for personal information, as explained in Sapp Roofing, Penn State and Bodack. Balancing tests were never required to satisfy any statutory language in the RTKA (which in fact contained no language requiring balancing), but rather were required to protect the rights of informational privacy granted to our citizens under, inter alia, Article 1, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Commonwealth Court decided to locate the balancing test under the “personal security” exception because personal security and privacy raise “similar concerns,” Times Publ., <a href="/pa-commw/159/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="633 A.2d 1233" data-case-ids="1452542" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/159/0398-01">633 A.2d at 1239</a>, and perhaps also because the RTKA contained no specific provision relating to privacy concerns. We note, for instance, that the RTKA, unlike the RTKL, contained no catchall exception from disclosure. See 65 P.S. § 67.305(a)(3) (a record is not presumed to be a public record if “the record is exempt from disclosure under any other Federal or State law or regulation or judicial order or decree.”).

On the one hand, the public school employees have strong privacy interests in protecting their home addresses from disclosure, in response to broad and generic requests based upon no criteria other than their occupation. As PSEA indicates, public school employees just want to work, and should not be required to forfeit their privacy merely as a precondition to, or by virtue of, their decision to be employed as public school employees. Brief of Appellant/PSEA at 45. On the other hand, the OOR has identified no public benefit or interest in disclosure of perhaps tens of thousands of addresses of public school employees. We likewise perceive no public benefit or interest to disclosure in response to such generic requests for irrelevant personal information of these particular public employees who have undertaken the high calling of educating our children. To the contrary, nothing in the RTKL suggests that it was ever intended to be used as a tool to procure personal information <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>about private citizens or, in the worst sense, to be a generator of mailing lists.

Although the issue is mooted in this case, we reiterate to the OOR, and to the General Assembly, our previously expressed concerns regarding the disjointed and scant procedural protections at both the request and appeal stages of the RTKL. Given the breadth of the disclosure anticipated by the RTKL and the public’s demonstrated appetite for information from and about the government, we wait for the inevitable next case to rule definitively on the procedural challenges.</p>

As the learned majority demonstrates, such protection clearly does exist.

Notwithstanding its analysis of the RTKA and the RTKL, the majority astutely stresses <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>that “constitutionally protected privacy interests must be respected even if no provision of the RTKL speaks to protection of those interests,” Id. at 156. Were we simply interpreting the language of the RTKL as distinct from that of the RTKA, the Office of Open Record (“OOR”)’s statutory interpretation argument would be plausible.

The majority explains that, instead, the statutory provisions demonstrate that the General Assembly “has, in essence, already performed a balancing test for those categories.” Id. I would not go as far as the majority in attempting to harmonize the legislature’s actions in this regard with the constitutional text and spirit. While it is of course the province of the legislative branch to balance the full panoply of policy and political considerations, it is not for the legislature to adjudicate constitutional rights, nor balance those rights one against the other. The OOR’s contention that our decision renders the statutory language superfluous should receive a candid response from us: it does indeed.

Although individuals voluntarily may reveal their home addresses in a <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>variety of contexts, i.e., obtaining various licenses, going to court, or owning property, this voluntary disclosure is legally distinct from and irrelevant to the question of whether a public employer must produce its employees’ home addresses upon demand. Nor is it relevant as a matter of constitutional law that home addresses are available in the public domain and accessible through internet searches or particular websites. That such information may be uncovered by private citizens through industry or skullduggery does not mean that government must employ public resources to assist in that activity.</p>
