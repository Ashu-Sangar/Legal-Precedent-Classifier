The DOE points out that every school district that has students attending the charter school must provide funding to the charter school (which, inter alia, includes money for the charter school’s employer contribution to PSERS). Nonetheless, section 8327(b)(2) requires only the chartering school district to cover the charter school’s delinquent PSERS contributions and, depending on the number of the chartering school district’s students attending the charter school, this amount may not be recoverable by withholding the monthly payments that it must make to the charter school. Thus, according to the DOE, the contention of the School District and PSBA that section 8327(b)(2) operates solely as a “pass through” is unsupportable. Id. at 32-34. The DOE asserts that its interpretation of section 8327(b)(2) is just, as the School District is in the best position to oversee the financial dealings of the Charter School and is able to ensure payments to PSERS are timely made.

      <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>Justice Dougherty seemingly imposes an additional duty upon a chartering school district that was never contemplated under the law. He fails to explain what the School District could have done if it had known that the Charter School failed to make its PSERS payments. Our research reveals no provision, in the Charter School Law or otherwise, that permits a chartering school district to prospectively withhold payments to a charter school based upon its own investigation of a charter school’s financial improprieties. The School District’s relief from the consequences of a financially irresponsible Charter School is to seek revocation of the charter. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1729-A(a)(3) (permitting a chartering school district to revoke or refuse to renew a charter based upon fiscal mismanagement by the charter school). This was the remedy sought by the School District in 2008. Justice Dougherty seems to suggest that the School District could have avoided the lengthy legal proceedings involved with revoking the charter because the School District simply could have withheld payments from the Charter School. The Charter School Law does not allow a school district to starve a charter school out of existence.</p>

Section 8327(b)(2) generally provides that a charter school’s unpaid PSERS obligations are to be deducted from the chartering school district’s funding.

PSERS Board’s Brief at 16-18. Justice Dougherty, in his Dissenting Opinion, adopts a variation of this argument, contending that section 8327(b)(2) is "intended to facilitate the Commonwealth’s obligation as guarantor [of PSERS contributions],” requiring only the transfer of "Commonwealth monies” to PSERS to cover a charter school’s missed payments. Dissenting Op. (Dougherty, J.) at 538-39, 151 A.3d at 148. Although it is true that the money withheld from a school district to pay PSERS for a charter school’s delinquency comes directly from the Commonwealth, it is money that the school district is otherwise entitled to receive as part of its funding from the Commonwealth. The amounts used to pay PSERS for the charter school’s delinquency is deducted from the chartering school district’s funding. <em>See </em>Letter Filing Petition for Appeal, 9/2/2014 (Attachment). Put another way, while PSERS is paid by the Commonwealth for a charter school’s delinquencies, the payment is made with money that would otherwise be allocated to the school district for its general use. As such, these arguments pervert the reality of the funding mechanism.</p>

DOE’s Brief at 24; PSERS Board’s Brief at 21. To determine whether the teachers will in fact lose a year of credited service because of the Charter School’s failure to remit the required PSERS payments involves the synthetization and interpretation of several statutory provisions (not briefed or argued); denial of benefits by PSERS; and, in that eventuality, factual determinations (not of record) regarding the teachers’ remittance of their member contributions; consideration of whether teachers can be held responsible for the Charter School's default when the law, as written, does not permit teachers to make payments directly to PSERS; and countless other issues potentially implicated by the Charter School's financial defalcations—none of which are before our Court. <em>See, e.g., </em>24 P.S. § 17-1724-A(c); 24 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 8102, 8302, 8303, 8306(a), 8321(a), 8322.1, 8323, 8326, 8327(a), 8506(c), 8507(d), 8522.

Nonetheless, the Commonwealth and the PSERS Board raise a valid concern. Our holding today reveals and underscores the grievous funding risk manifest by the CSL and Retirement Code provisions at issue in this case. This risk is realized when a charter school operator ignores its duty to contribute to the fund on behalf of its employees. Today’s case uncovers a yawning gap in the pension funding scheme for Pennsylvania’s charter school employees.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[193,1075,1157,1023]]]'>It is incumbent upon the General Assembly to provide a workable funding mechanism. When a charter school operator neglects its duty to contribute to the PSERS fund on behalf of its employees, and then absconds, defrauds, defaults, or ceases to exist, the Commonwealth (i.e., the taxpayers of Pennsylvania) should not be responsible for the operator’s delinquency. Likewise, charter school employees should not be faced with the risk of losing rightfully earned credits (i.e., dollars). As the law currently stands, a charter school operator, such as the one at the center of this dispute, has no accountability. It seems clear as day that the General Assembly proactively should impose procedural safeguards that will attach while a charter school is still viable and operating, as a hedge against any prospect of future default. For example, the General Assembly could choose to amend the CSL by requiring charter schools to post bond sufficient to ensure compliance with their PSERS contribution obligations. Obviously, an inability to post bond would raise a red flag signaling that a charter should not be approved.</p>

The OAJC reasons that because a charter school ceases to exist upon revocation of its charter, no appropriations “would otherwise be paid” to the charter school after the school has closed. Id. at 526, 151 A.3d at 140-41.

In a similar vein, the OAJC reasons that the operative date under the statute is when appropriations would be paid, thus, whether a school district is the chartering district under Section 8327(b)(2) must be determined at the time the funds are withheld, which occurred after the charter was revoked.

The subsequent revocation of the charter has no bearing on the issue as Section 8327(b)(2) does not direct a deduction only where there is a finding that the charter school currently remains in existence. Thus, the revocation of the charter in June of 2014, prior to when the deduction was made in August of 2014, is inconsequential for purposes of applying Section 8327(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a>

The statutory language directs that the amount to be deducted is the amount of unpaid PSERS contributions existing on the date the appropriation would otherwise be paid to the charting school district. The entity subject to the deduction is clearly the “chartering school district.” The statute requires only that the Retirement Board certify to the Department that the charter school failed to make required payments to the Fund and was determined to be delinquent, and the Department must then deduct the amount due from the subsidy of the chartering school district and pay the Fund.

While this provision of the CSL was enacted later in time than Section 8327(b) of the Retirement Code, I am unpersuaded that the General Assembly intended for Section 17—1729—A(i) to restrict application of the PSERS payment mechanism set forth in Section 8327(b)(2). Had the legislature possessed such intent, it likely would have achieved such goal by amending the Retirement Code, which governs PSERS payments, rather than adding a sentence to a provision of the CSL dealing with charter school closings. In other words, when the General Assembly enacted Section 17-1729-AG), it did not provide any explicit or implicit intention that it should prevail over Section 8327(b)(2).

In my view, Section 8327(b)(2) of the Public School Employees’ Retirement Code (Retirement Code), 24 Pa.C.S. § 8327(b)(2), need not be read <em>in pari materia </em>with Section 1729-A(i) of the Charter School Law (CSL), 24 P.S. § 17-1729-A(i), because the statutes address different subjects: one provides a payment mechanism for PSERS contributions, Section 8327(b)(2), and one describes the protocols for closure of charter schools, Section 1729-A(i). I recognize that both provisions address charter schools. However, Section 8327(b)(2) was added to a narrowly focused pension provision in order to provide that charter schools—as employers required by Section 8327(a) to make quarterly contributions to the PSERS Fund—are also subject to the payment mechanism applicable to other PSERS Fund employers found in Section 8327(b)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_1" id="ref_footnote_5_1">1</a> Additionally, I would conclude the mandates of the Retirement Code are not subsumed by the CSL.

By enacting Section 8327(b)(2), the General Assembly authorized the redirection of Commonwealth appropriations to the PSERS Fund in the event of a charter school’s failure to make statutorily mandated PSERS contributions, thus ensuring the balances in PSERS Fund are not diminished. I recognize the last sentence of Section 1729-A(i) states that, in the event of the closure of a charter school, neither school entities with children enrolled in the charter school nor the Commonwealth shall be liable for outstanding liabilities or obligations of the charter school.

Section 1728-A(a) places upon the chartering school district an obligation to monitor a charter school and, therefore, the school district should be aware of financial deficiencies, particularly in circumstances where the school district engages in an ongoing battle to revoke a charter as occurred here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_4" id="ref_footnote_5_4">4</a> As evidenced by the School Dis<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>trict’s revocation resolution, it was keenly aware of the Charter School’s alleged financial mismanagement and failure to comply with the mandates of the CSL. The School District had the ability to determine whether the Charter School was current on its PSERS contributions, but seemingly failed in its supervisory duties under the CSL. In my view, a chartering school district’s responsibilities do not end upon issuance of a charter. The CSL empowers and thus requires a chartering school district to be diligent in fulfilling its obligations in order to protect the quality and integrity of the public education funded by the Commonwealth and its taxpayers. The result of the School District’s failure to do so here is further harm to teachers who not only lost their jobs with the closure of their school, but may now be denied credit for time worked, because the School District has successfully argued before this Court that the Department of Education is unable to redirect Commonwealth appropriations as authorized by Section 8327.</p>
