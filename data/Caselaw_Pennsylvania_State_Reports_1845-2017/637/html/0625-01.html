Even more, there is evidence that a single month of exposure to asbestos may double an individual’s risk of contracting meso-thelioma. Id.

According to the brief of the amicus physicians and scientists, “[t]o require quantification where it is almost always impossible and unnecessary to do so, would be a public health travesty. That is, this would have the effect of creating an impossible burden of proof, and no claim would be able to meet this impossible standard .... ” Amicus Brief of Fifty-Eight Physicians/Scientists at 9. Moreover, Dr. Frank testified that it is not scientifically possible to quantify the precise quantity of asbestos inhalation that is required to initiate the disease process or to identify the particular exposure or exposures that caused the disease.

At bottom, the contention of the dissenting justices is that Rost’s exposure to asbestos at Metropolitan Edison, given its longer duration, was more causative than was his shorter exposure at Smith Motors, thereby precluding recovery against Ford. As explained hereinabove, however, multiple asbestos-containing products may be substantial factors causative of a plaintiffs mesothelioma. It is for the finder of fact, and not the courts, to make these determinations regarding substantial causation.</p>

N.T., 9/19/2011 (AM), at 121. As a result, Rost’s other exposures to asbestos (at Metropolitan Edison and elsewhere) were irrelevant to the jury’s consideration of substantial causation in this case. The dissenting justices’ concern about whether the jury could understand whether the bucket of water was placed in a bathtub or an ocean, Dissenting Op. at 674, 151 A.3d at 1061-63 (Saylor, C.J., dissenting), misses the mark entirely, since Dr. Frank testified that Rost’s exposures at Smith Motors, without more, were sufficient to cause his cancer.</p>

The dissenting justices implicitly concede that the Rosts satisfied these requirements, but simply cannot square Dr. Frank’s expert opinion on the low quantum of asbestos exposure sufficient to cause mesothelioma with opposing views on how mesothelioma is caused. <em>See </em>Gregg, <a href="/pa/596/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="943 A.2d 216" data-case-ids="4087317,8388303" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0274-01,/a2d/943/0216-01">943 A.2d at 228</a> (Cappy, C.J., dissenting). To bridge this apparent gap, the dissenting justices seek to place on plaintiffs in asbestos disease cases an evidentiary burden not borne by plaintiffs in other tort actions.

N.T., 9/19/2011 (P.M.), at 16-55. Ford also called two expert witnesses in efforts to discredit and contradict Dr. Frank’s testimony, including Dr. Michael Graham, M.D., a professor of pathology at St. Louis University, and Dr. Herman Gibb, Ph.D., who worked at the United States Environmental Protection Agency for more than thirty years. Drs.

First, consolidation “stripped away Ford’s ability to cross-examine adverse witnesses,” including in particular Dr. James Millette, a plaintiffs’ expert in the Wasekanes case who used tests of Ford brakes to explain his research into asbestos release from brakes. Ford’s Brief at 38. Second, Ford contends that the defendants in the three cases all pursued different defense theories at trial. In the Graver case, for example, Foster Wheeler attempted to prove that the plaintiffs exposure to its boiler did not cause the plaintiffs mesothelioma, which Ford argues was inconsistent with its attempt to demonstrate that Rost’s exposure to the boilers at Metropolitan Edison was the cause of his mesothelioma.

Id. In addition, Ford complains that in closing arguments, counsel for Sears attempted to distinguish itself as a mere retailer of brakes, in contrast to a manufacturer of such products.

Dr. Frank made no attempt to even roughly quantify either the dose experienced by Mr. Rost at Smith Motors or his cumulative exposure or dose. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., Sept. 19, 2011 (P.M.), at 22 (reflecting Dr. Frank’s recognition that aspects of Mr. Rost’s industrial exposure "could have been high, it could have been low” and his statement that: “I can't speak to what his level of exposure was.”). I have found nothing on the record as far as Mr. Rost's individual susceptibility goes, or anything to relate such concept to Dr. Frank’s opinion concerning substantial-factor causation. Biological plausibility in the abstract goes more to general causation than to establishing substantial-factor causation, particularly where the issue is presented in terms of risk. In terms of the epidemiological evidence pertaining to mesothelioma in auto workers, Dr. Frank’s discussion was vague, with specific-study treatment focusing mostly on his discounting of ones that were inconsistent with his position. <em>See </em>N.T., Sept. 19, 2011 (A.M.), at 103-05. <em>Compare Yates v.

Unlike many tort actions, latent disease eases cannot be demonstrated through a direct causal link but, instead, involve the imposition of liability based on an assessment of the increased risk resulting from the alleged exposures. Pursuant to Gregg, contact with asbestos cannot be deemed a substantial causal factor unless it involved frequent, regular, and proximate exposure creating more than a <em>de minimis </em>risk of developing the disease. Once an exposure to asbestos fibers is determined to be sufficiently frequent, regular, and proximate, a fact-finder should consider factors such as the potency, concentration, and duration of the exposure in light of the plaintiffs other asbestos exposures to determine if it is reasonable to deem the defendant’s product legally responsible as a substantial causal factor in the development of the disease, in contrast to merely being a cause-in-fact.</p>
