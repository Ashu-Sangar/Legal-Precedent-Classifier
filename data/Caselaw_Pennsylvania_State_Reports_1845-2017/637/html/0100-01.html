The MDJ convicted Ball of a lesser included offense, implicitly acquitting him of the greater charged offense. Ball appealed his conviction to the court of common pleas (“the trial court”) for a de novo trial pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 462(A),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> whereupon the Commonwealth sought to re-try him on the greater offense. The trial court allowed the Commonwealth to try Ball on the original charge, notwithstanding Ball’s objection that reinstating that charge violated the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.</p>

Finding merit in Ball’s double jeopardy claim, the Superior Court reversed the trial court and discharged Ball. We granted <em>allocatur </em>to determine whether the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy barred the Commonwealth from reinstating Ball’s implicitly-acquitted greater offense. We now hold that the Commonwealth may not prosecute a defendant for the greater offense under these circumstances. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court on this issue.</p>

On this issue, we conclude that the Superior Court did err. A MDJ has the authority, <em>sua sponte, </em>to convict a defendant of an uncharged, lesser included offense, and the defendant has a right to have that conviction reviewed by a court of record. Therefore, we reverse the Superior Court’s order in part, and remand the case to the trial court for a trial <em>de novo </em>limited only to the lesser included offense.</p>

On January 14, 2013, a Mechanicsburg police officer stopped Ball for speeding. Upon reviewing Ball’s driver’s history, the officer learned that Ball’s license had been suspended as a result of prior convictions for driving-under-the-influence (“DUI”). The officer cited Ball for driving while operating privileges were suspended related to the DUI convictions (“DUS-DUI”), 75 Pa.C.S. 1543(b)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ball proceeded to a summary trial before a Cumberland County MDJ, where he was found guilty of driving while his operating privileges were suspended (“DUS”), 75 Pa.C.S. 1543(a),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> indisputably a lesser included <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>offense of DUS-DUI.

    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[182,570,1157,530]]]'>Ball appealed to the trial court for a <em>de novo </em>trial pursuant to Rule 462(A). Before the trial court, the Commonwealth sought to reinstate the DUS-DUI charge. Ball objected, arguing that allowing the Commonwealth to re-try him on DUS-DUI would subject him to double jeopardy because he had already been acquitted of that charge before the MDJ and was appealing only the DUS conviction. The trial court disagreed. Relying upon Commonwealth v. Lennon, <a href="/a3d/64/1092-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="64 A.3d 1092" data-case-ids="7311089" data-case-paths="/a3d/64/1092-01">64 A.3d 1092</a> (Pa.Super.2013), the court held that Ball had waived his double jeopardy protections by appealing for a <em>de novo </em>trial.</p>

Following his guilty plea, the defendant appealed to the court of common pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In response to the defendant’s appeal, the Commonwealth sought to reinstate the withdrawn charges so that it could try the defendant on all charges. The defendant argued that he could not be re-tried on the dismissed charges without being put twice in jeopardy. The trial court rejected both parties’ arguments and ordered specific performance of the plea agreement. The defendant appealed to the Superior Court, which held that the trial court erred in preventing the defendant <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>from exercising his rule-based right to have his case reviewed at a de novo trial. However, the Superior Court also held that the defendant had waived his double jeopardy protections by voluntarily opting for a new trial instead of accepting the terms of his plea agreement. The Superior Court remanded the case, informing the defendant that he either could accept the plea agreement or proceed to a new trial on the full panoply of charges originally lodged against him.</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[263,791,1150,474]]]'>In the present case, the trial court concluded that, although Ball was appealing from a conviction and not a guilty plea, his case was indistinguishable from Lennon because Rule 462(A) allows for appeals from both convictions and guilty pleas. Accordingly, the trial court overruled Ball’s objections and reinstated the DUS-DUI charge. Following the <em>de novo </em>trial, Ball was convicted of DUS-DUI, and sentenced to sixty days’ imprisonment and a $1000 fine. Ball then appealed this conviction to the Superior Court.</p>

The court began by recognizing that both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions prohibit a person from being “twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” See Pa. Const. art. I, § 10; U.S. Const, amend. V. The court explained that this prohibition was designed to protect individuals from being tried or punished more than once for the same allegation or offense. Specifically, the court recognized that the double jeopardy clauses protect against a second prosecution follow<a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>ing an acquittal or conviction, see Commonwealth v.

The court also made clear that the protection against double jeopardy applies with full force in summary cases. See Commonwealth v. Walczak, <a href="/pa-super/440/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="440 Pa. Super. 339" data-case-ids="715967" data-case-paths="/pa-super/440/0339-01">440 Pa.Super. 339</a>, <a href="/pa-super/440/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="655 A.2d 592" data-case-ids="715967,7866164" data-case-paths="/pa-super/440/0339-01,/a2d/655/0592-01">655 A.2d 592</a>, 596 (1995) (stating that, in a criminal proceeding before a MDJ, “jeopardy attaches ... when the court begins to hear evidence.

    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[198,1034,1155,1355]]]'>Turning to the present case, the Superior Court determined that, after a fact-finding hearing, the MDJ had acquitted Ball of DUS-DUI, the offense for which he was charged. Therefore, the court held, “it was impermissible to retry Ball, and the trial court’s adjudication of guilt at the <em>de novo </em>bench trial was a legal nullity.” Ball, <a href="/a3d/97/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="97 A.3d 397" data-case-ids="6925020" data-case-paths="/a3d/97/0397-01">97 A.3d at 400</a>. The Superior Court emphasized that Ball’s voluntary appeal for a trial <em>de novo </em>had no bearing upon its holding because Ball’s acquittal by the MDJ constitutes an unassailable legal finality. See Walczak, <a href="/pa-super/440/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="655 A.2d 592" data-case-ids="715967,7866164" data-case-paths="/pa-super/440/0339-01,/a2d/655/0592-01">655 A.2d at 596</a> (stating that “a fact-finder’s verdict of not guilty is accorded absolute finality. It is completely insulated from appellate review.”) (citation omitted). The Superior Court disavowed the trial court’s reliance upon Lennon, opining that Lennon was inapposite because the defendant in that case had appealed from a guilty plea, after entering a negotiated plea agreement, thereby validly waiving his double jeopardy challenge, whereas here, Ball had pled not guilty to DUS-DUI, and was acquitted of that offense. Ball, <a href="/a3d/97/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="97 A.3d 397" data-case-ids="6925020" data-case-paths="/a3d/97/0397-01">97 A.3d at </a>400 (citing Lennon, <a href="/a3d/64/1092-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="64 A.3d 1092" data-case-ids="7311089" data-case-paths="/a3d/64/1092-01">64 A.3d at 1101</a>). Finally, without citing precedent, the Superior Court held that Ball’s conviction for DUS by the MDJ was “of no moment” because Ball had not been charged with that offense. Without addressing either of the remaining issues raised by Ball, the Superior Court reversed Ball’s judgment of sentence, and discharged him. The Commonwealth sought reargument, which was denied.</p>

The Commonwealth contends that Ball volunteered to be subjected to a second prosecution, which he could have avoided by merely accepting the MDJ’s ruling. Essentially, the Commonwealth argues that Ball was in the same position as a defendant who enters a guilty plea. In doing so, the Commonwealth overlooks an important distinction between a guilty plea and a conviction: A guilty plea is a knowing and voluntary relinquishment of rights, always preceded by an extensive colloquy that is undertaken specifically to ascertain and confirm that the defendant understands the constitutional rights that he is waiving in exchange for his admission of guilt. Conversely, a conviction follows a trial where the defendant has challenged the prosecution’s charges and no inquiry into the defendant’s acceptance and understanding of a voluntary plea has been made. The notice form that a defendant must complete in order to appeal from a conviction before a MDJ includes the name and contact information of the defendant, his attorney, and the issuing judge as well as inquiries into the nature of the offense, the sentence, and the grounds for appeal. See Notice of Appeal from Summary Criminal Conviction, 7/24/2013 at 1. Importantly, that form does not include any waiver provision, nor any notice of constitutional rights. Choosing to complete this form is not the same as making a knowing and intelligent waiver, particularly <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>when Ball was not instructed in any way of such a consequence. Ball did not enter a voluntary plea in exchange for a lesser sentence. Instead, the MDJ elected to convict him of an uncharged, lesser included offense, and Ball exercised his right to have that conviction reviewed by a court of record pursuant to the procedure established by Rule 462(A).</p>

We are unaware of any constitutional right that can be waived by operation of a rule of procedure that does not explicitly provide for the waiver.

Larkins' direct appeal was unsuccessful, but, in 1995, he sought post-conviction relief and was granted a new trial. At his retrial for first-degree murder, Larkins requested a jury instruction also on third-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. The trial court denied Larkins' request on grounds that it would put him twice in jeopardy for charges of which he had been acquitted. Larkins appealed a second time, arguing that the jury should have been instructed on the lesser charges at his second trial. The Superior Court recognized that the double jeopardy clauses did not bar the jury from being instructed on the lesser included offenses because waiver or double jeopardy is theoretically possible, but held that Lar-kins had failed to preserve the argument that he could waive double jeopardy. Notably, in order to avoid such anomalies, the practice of acquitting a defendant of lesser degrees of murder when the defendant is convicted of the higher degree has been disapproved by this Court.

When a defendant appears before a MDJ and maintains his innocence, or merely elects to stand on the protection provided by our Constitutions and defend himself, and the MDJ then convicts him of a lesser charge nonetheless, the defendant has not received a “break.” He has received a conviction.</p>

Thus, when a defendant appeals a conviction pursuant to Rule 462(A), a trial court judge should hold a new trial on the entire case, as if no trial had occurred in the magisterial district court.

Commonwealth v.

These clauses shield a citizen from: retrial by the Commonwealth for the same offense after an acquittal; retrial by the Commonwealth for the same offense after a conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense. <a href="/citations/?q=286%20A.2d%20638" class="citation" data-index="177" data-cite="286 A.2d 638">Id.</a> There can be no question that the rights provided by the Double Jeopardy Clauses are deeply rooted in the history and tradition of our country and Commonwealth.

However, it is well-settled that defendants can waive even the most fundamental of constitutional rights. In fact, when a defendant pleads guilty to committing a crime, he waives several important constitutional rights, including his right to a jury trial. See Commonwealth v. Petrillo, <a href="/pa/340/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="181" data-cite="340 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1203358" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0033-01">340 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%2050" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="16 A.2d 50">16 A.2d 50</a>, 56 <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>(1940) (stating that, “[b]ut though the Constitution guarantees to a defendant charged with crime a trial by jury, he may waive trial by jury and plead guilty”). While the word “waiver” can take on several meanings in the law, it ordinarily connotes some kind of voluntary relinquishment of a right. Green v. United States, <a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">355 U.S. 184</a>, 191, <a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">78 S.Ct. 221</a>, <a href="/us/355/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="185" data-cite="355 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6164126" data-case-paths="/us/355/0184-01">2 L.Ed.2d 199</a> (1957). Importantly, defendants can waive constitutional rights in a number of ways, including by implication and conduct or through a colloquy. Commonwealth v.

As I observed above, the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the state and federal Constitutions bar the Commonwealth from re-prosecuting a defendant for an offense that the defendant already has been convicted of committing. However, Rule 462(A) grants a defendant convicted by a MDJ the right to appeal his conviction and have his case decided <em>de novo </em>by a judge of a court of common pleas. Obviously, under these circumstances, the Commonwealth again prosecutes the defendant.</p>

In other words, a defendant’s appeal under Rule 462(A) automatically is successful in that it results in a vacated sentence and conviction and in a new trial without any need to establish that the MDJ erred by convicting or sentencing the defendant. While a defendant who appeals a conviction pursuant to Rule 462(A) receives these benefits, the tradeoff pursuant to this rule is that the defendant waives any double jeopardy defense to the Commonwealth’s second prosecution of the defendant for the same offense that led to his initial conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> More<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>over, as I discussed above, Rule 462(A) puts the defendant on notice that the Commonwealth can seek to prosecute him at a trial <em>de novo </em>for the case that led to his magisterial-district-court conviction if the defendant chooses to appeal that conviction.</p>

When a defendant voluntarily invokes Rule 462(A) to appeal a conviction of a lesser-included offense of the crime with which he was charged, he does so knowing that his sentence and conviction are vacated, that he will receive a new trial on his case, and that a judge from a court of common pleas will hear the entire case, as if the trial before the district magistrate court had never occurred.

These community-level courts act as gatekeepers in relatively minor criminal matters. They are called upon to dispense justice in a less formal and more efficient manner than are the courts of common pleas. MDJs undoubtedly need a number of tools at their disposal in order to fulfill their roles effectively and within the bounds of the law.</p>

See Trial Court Opinion, 1/21/2014, at 4. This is so because, while a MDJ’s non-record decision to convict a defendant in a lenient fashion may be well intended, a defendant now can invoke Rule 462(A) to manipulate that leniency into a potential windfall. Consequently, I caution MDJs to consider carefully whether to convict a defendant of anything less than the Commonwealth’s evidence demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt, even when the Commonwealth agrees that leniency toward a defendant is the preferred outcome. It is indeed unfortunate that Appellee and this Court’s Majority may well <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>have deprived future defendants of reasoned judicial compassion with this decision.</p>
