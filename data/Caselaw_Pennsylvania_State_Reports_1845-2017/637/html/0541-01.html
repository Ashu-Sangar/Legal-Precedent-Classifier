According to Officer Bates’ testimony, APO Anglemeyer recognized Appellant as one of his parolees,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and asked Officer Bates to stop the vehicle. APO Anglemeyer walked toward Appellant, and then summoned Appellant to come and speak with him. APO An-glemeyer told Appellant that he was his assigned probation officer, and proceeded to give him reporting instructions. APO Anglemeyer then asked Appellant if he could search him, and Appellant declined, stating, “Come on, man. You gonna do me like that? I just got out of jail.” N.T. Hearing, 11/14/13, at 16. Notwithstanding Appellant’s objection, APO Anglemeyer performed a pat-down search of Appellant and felt a bulge in the right coin pocket of Appellant’s pants. APO Anglemeyer reached into Appellant’s pocket and retrieved what appeared to be crack cocaine. APO Anglemeyer then “turned the case over to Officer Bates,” who arrested Appellant. Id at 18. A search incident to his arrest revealed that Appellant was carrying a second bag of cocaine, a digital scale, a cell phone, and $21.</p>

In Wilson, the appellant was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>persons not to possess firearms, and sentenced to 2½ to 5 years incarceration, followed by 3 years probation. As a condition of probation, the trial court authorized warrantless, suspicionless searches of the appellant’s residence for weapons. The appellant challenged the propriety of the condition allowing random searches, arguing that the condition violated his rights under both the Fourth Amendment and Article I, Section 8, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and that the condition was in conflict with Section 9912. This Court determined that, notwithstanding the language of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9754(c)(13), which authorizes a trial court to require a probationer to satisfy conditions “reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the defendant and not unduly restrictive of his liberty or incompatible with his freedom of conscience,” sentencing courts “are not empowered to direct that a probation officer may conduct warrantless, suspicionless searches of a probationer as a condition of probation,” because such a condition violates Section 9912(d).

As we stated in Williams, in deciding whether a warrantless search by a parole officer conducted pursuant to a parolee’s signed parole agreement authorizing warrantless searches could survive constitutional scrutiny, we “must balance the governmental interests involved in granting parole and supervising parolees with that interest of the private individual, i.e., the parolee, which has been affected by the governmental action.” Williams, <a href="/a2d/692/1031-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="692 A.2d 1031" data-case-ids="11919392,468611" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1031-01,/pa/547/0577-01">692 A.2d at 1035</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Thus, although we have suggested that a parolee has “a more narrowly protected privacy interest than that afforded a free individual,” <a href="/a2d/692/1031-01" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="692 A.2d 1031" data-case-ids="11919392,468611" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1031-01,/pa/547/0577-01">id. at 1036</a>, we have recognized that the government’s interest in enforcing the terms of parole and probation cannot entirely displace a parolee’s protected privacy rights.</p>
