Later that day, Appellants filed in this Court an emergency application requesting that we assume plenary jurisdiction over the action pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 726. See Appellants’ Emergency Application for Extraordinary Relief at 11 (asserting that “[i]t is virtually certain that any order issued by the Commonwealth Court in this matter would be appealed to this Court.

On September 16, 2016, this Court entered a <em>per curiam </em>order denying Appellants relief on the ground that they did not present a compelling reason for reargument but, rather, sought a new avenue of relief. We emphasized that the grant of Appellants’ request for extraordinary jurisdiction pursuant to Section 726 of the Judicial Code removed the case from the lower court so that this Court could impose a final order in the matter. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 726 (providing that “the Supreme Court may, on its own motion or upon the petition of any party, in any matter pending before any court or magisterial district judge of this Commonwealth involving an issue of immediate public importance, assume plenary jurisdiction of such matter at any stage thereof and enter a final order or otherwise cause right and justice to be done”). This Court’s order denying reconsideration further distinguished the deadlock on the Court, which related to whether Appellants had a clear right to the requested relief, from the Court’s unanimous judgment in the matter, which <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>maintained the <em>status quo </em>prior to the filing of the litigation. We concluded that a remand for the Commonwealth Court to consider the case anew would be unprecedented, unsupported by legal authority, and outside the scope of Pa.R.A.P. 2543. Justice Todd filed a dissenting opinion to the <em>per curiam </em>order, which was joined by Justice Wecht, in which she opined that this Court should remand the matter to the Commonwealth Court for it to address the legality of the ballot question’s phrasing.</p>

The Secretary sought dismissal of Appellants’ petition, contending that: (1) the action was barred by the doctrines of <em>res judicata, </em>laches, and “law of the case;” (2) relitigation of this Court’s September 2, 2016 order would violate Article V, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution; (3) the ballot question is fair, accurate, and clearly apprises voters of the question to be voted on; (4) the Secretary and Attorney General are entitled to act free of interference under the political question doctrine; and (5) Appellants are not entitled to injunctive relief.

The court reasoned that four conditions must exist for <em>res judicata </em>to apply: (1) identity of the issues; (2) identity of causes of action; (3) identity of persons and parties to the action; and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the parties suing or sued.

The Commonwealth Court found all of these requisites satisfied as the two actions <em>(ie., </em>the action adjudicated by this Court by order dated September 2, 2016 and the action filed in Commonwealth Court on September 19, 2016) shared identity of issues, causes of action, and parties. Finding that this Court adjudicated the claims raised by the same parties in its September 2, 2016 <em>per curiam </em>order, the Commonwealth Court held that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>precludes that court’s reconsideration of the same matter.</p>

Citing language from this Court’s September 2nd order indicating that we lacked authority to grant the requested relief due to an inability to reach consensus, Appellants submit that we likewise lacked authority to adjudicate the merits of their claim, which is a prerequisite to the application of <em>res judicata. </em>They further rely on distinguishable case law suggesting that the legal effect of a deadlock in a jurisdiction’s highest appellate court is the same as if no appeal had been taken. From this tenet, Appellants conclude that this Court’s September 2nd order maintaining the <em>status quo </em>is a nullity, having no legal effect whatsoever. They argue that the facts presented should be viewed as though this Court never granted their request for extraordinary jurisdiction, leaving the matter ripe for adjudication by the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[190,1163,1154,790]]]'>In his answer to Appellants’ emergency application, the Secretary joins Appellants’ request that this matter be resolved as expeditiously as possible, without further briefing, and attaches his brief filed in Commonwealth Court. He contends that we should affirm summarily the well-reasoned decision below, which held that this Court’s unanimous September 2nd <em>per curiam </em>order maintaining the <em>status quo </em>effectively denied the relief Appellants sought and constitutes a final adjudication on the merits for purposes of <em>res judicata, </em>rather than the absence of a decision as Appellants suggest. The Secretary asserts that the legal effect of an evenly divided judicial body in Pennsylvania is that the requested relief is denied, both implicitly and as a matter of law. Accordingly, he submits, the Commonwealth Court may not revisit this Court’s determination, to which the parties are bound.</p>

See Pa. Const, art, V, § 2(a). He argues that what Appellants essentially seek is for the Commonwealth Court to be this Court’s tiebreaker in contravention of the structure of the unified judicial system.

Here, the various opinions attached to this Court’s September 2nd unanimous <em>per curiam </em>order clearly establish that Appellants actually litigated in this Court the issue of whether the ballot question is legal and whether they are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief. Because this Court evenly divided as to the legality of the ballot question, the Court’s unanimous <em>per curiam </em>order determined that Appellants were not entitled to relief and that the <em>status quo, </em>prior to the filing of the litigation, must be maintained. Thus, the order constitutes a valid and final judgment, as it disposed of all claims and of all parties.

Similarly, if the Court accepts extraordinary jurisdiction over a case where no judgment has been entered by a lower tribunal and we deadlock, then we enter a final <em>per curiam </em>order that maintains the <em>status quo </em>of the matter prior to the filing of the lawsuit, as occurred in this case. See Creamer, supra. In both situations, the moving party failed to convince a majority of the Court to take affirmative action. Because the Court in this circumstance cannot grant relief, relief is denied by operation of law, and the <em>status quo </em>is maintained, which in this case results in the constitutional amendment as advertised remaining on the November 8, 2016 general election ballot.</p>

First, caselaw from the Supreme Court of the United States does not control our Court’s determination of the preclusive effect of our orders on the adjudication of state constitutional claims, inasmuch as our Court is the final arbiter of such pure questions of Pennsylvania law.

Greenhow, the petitioner sought a writ of <em>mandamus </em>from the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia to compel the treasurer of Richmond to accept petitioner’s tender of state issued bonds as payment of his state tax obligations without deducting additional state tax from their redemptive proceeds. Petitioner claimed that the statute under which the treasurer asserted authority to make this deduction violated the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution. The Virginia Supreme Court divided 3-3 on the merits of that question, which, under Virginia law, constituted a denial of the issuance of the writ. The narrow jurisdictional question which the United States Supreme Court addressed as a threshold matter, from which the OISA’s quotation derives, was whether the split decision of the Virginia Supreme Court constituted “a final judgment or decree” under the Judiciary Act of 1787, and the federal high Court concluded that it did since the effect of the judgment was to deny the writ of <em>mandamus </em>and to finally conclude that litigation. Importantly, though, the high Court did not purport to opine on whether the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>barred the parties from <em>re-litigating </em>the issue of the propriety of the denial. Indeed, the high Court went on in its opinion to conclude that the statute was in fact repugnant to the United States Constitution and granted petitioner relief. The high Court’s ruling, therefore, <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>has no bearing on the question of the preclusive effect of an order of a state’s highest court on further litigation in the tribunals of that state, which is the issue we are considering in the present appeal.</p>

The OISA claims that Appellants’ choice to seek extraordinary relief from our Court at the time they originally commenced their action in the Commonwealth Court somehow precluded them from further seeking relief in the Commonwealth Court after our Court could not render a decision on their claims. The OISA deems Appellants’ effort to seek a final determination from this Court regarding a paramount question of constitutional interpretation “tactical litigation,” contending:</p>

Although Hartman involved an equally divided state court, it did not address any preclusive effect of that deadlock. Instead, the issue in Hartman was whether the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over the appeal, <em>i.e., </em>whether it was a "final judgment or decree” as defined by the Judiciary Act of 1789, Id, at 674. The portion of Hartman quoted by the OISA (see OISA at 407, 150 A.3d at 21) simply explains why the state court’s deadlock was amenable to the U.S. Supreme Court’s jurisdiction.</p>

But just in case, suggests the OISA, Appellants’ inability to obtain an adjudication here is, after all, somehow their own fault, the "result of their own tactical litigation plan.” Id. at 409, 150 A.3d at 22-23.</p>

It bears repeating that <em>res judicata </em>applies only when there has been a final adjudication on the merits. See Balent, <a href="/citations/?q=669%20A.2d%20809" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="669 A.2d 809">669 A.2d at 313</a>. For example, this Court has held that our denial of an application for extraordinary relief is not a final adjudication on the merits, and "the petitioning party is free to pursue his claim in any appropriate forum.” County of Berks ex rel. Baldwin, <a href="/a2d/678/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="678 A.2d 355" data-case-ids="11734120,463550" data-case-paths="/a2d/678/0355-01,/pa/544/0541-01">678 A.2d at 359</a>. Similarly, when we issue an order explaining that “this Court is without authority to grant relief” to either party <em>{Per Curiam </em>Order, 9/2/2016, at 1), we have not fully and finally adjudicated the litigants’ claims on the merits.</p>
      <p id="b453-8" data-blocks='[["BL_453.8",453,[225,1965,1121,428]]]'>The OISA distinguishes County of Berks ex rel, Baldwin from the instant matter on the basis that we assumed plenary jurisdiction over Appellants’ action and the parties "litigated 1he issues through briefing.” OISA at 408-09, 150 A.3d at 22. That is irrelevant. The critical inquiry is whether our September 2 order was a full and final merits adjudication of Appellants’ constitutional challenge. The OISA concedes that "the Court issued multiple opinions on the legal issue presented,” none of which gained the support of a majority of the Justices. M. at 409-10, 150 A.3d at 22. How this Court managed to adjudicate Appellants' claim on the merits while simultaneously failing to resolve "the legal issue presented” is beyond my understanding.</p>

In a prior filing of record, Appellee Cortés himself took the position that failing to inform voters that the current judicial retirement age is 70, "would likely leave the voter wondering what the current requirement is—or worse yet, leave the voter with the impression that there is currently no requirement at all." See Answer of Secretary of the Commonwealth Pedro A. Cortés, 29 MM 2016. For reasons unknown and undisclosed, Secretary Cortés seems to have changed his mind quite completely. Nonetheless, the OISA has exaggerated the Secretary’s role here by asserting that he "framed” the misleading ballot question. OISA at 400-01, 150 A.3d at 17. He did not frame it; indeed, he initially opposed it, and then later chose to acquiesce in it. The distinction for artful draftsmanship is owed not to the Secretary but to the General Assembly. See H.R. 783 2015 (directing the Secretary to remove the previously drafted ballot question from the April 26, 2016 primary election ballot and to place the language now at issue on the November 8, 2016 general election ballot).</p>

This critique misconstrues our use of these sources. As the OISA itself recognizes (id. at 401-02, 150 A.3d at 18), today’s dispute concerns a question of law: to wit, whether our September 2 <em>per curiam </em>order precludes Appellants’ right to a merits adjudication on <em>res judicata </em>grounds. The material facts are undisputed. The litigation before us addresses a matter of substantial public importance and notoriety. In such circumstances, it is not only proper but indeed expected that jurists will marshal secondary sources (law review articles, news reports, commentary, etc.) to persuasive effect. There is no evidentiary record here which Justices of this Court can either refine or improve. There is a disagreement on a question of law. In this disagreement, jurists will employ the tools that are appropriate to the persuasive task at hand.</p>

The argument is over the facts but not over the record. The opinions are trying to persuade us to put the dispute in one context rather than another. Until we do that, we don’t know which law applies; we don’t know how to construct analogies or make distinctions. ... Once we leave the domain of proof and enter that of persuasion, there is not a great deal that can be said in the abstract. What counts as persuasive depends on both the speakers and the listeners; it shifts over time and depends on the circumstances. It depends as well on the ability to present the case in a compelling manner. The court, like the rest of us, must be persuaded.</blockquote>
