Justice Todd joins Parts I, II, and III(B) of the opinion. Justice Baer joins Part 11(C) only.\nOPINION\nJUSTICE WECHT\nWe granted allowance of appeal to consider whether Pennsylvania\u2019s statute criminalizing conflicts of interest, which prohibits public officials from leveraging the authority of their offices for \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit,\u201d extends to what the trial court in this case referred to as \u201cintangible political gain.\u201d As well, we must determine whether the Commonwealth may receive restitution following prosecution of a public official for a crime involving unlawful diversion of public resources.\nI. Background\nAppellant Michael R. Veon, a twenty-two-year member and eventual Minority Whip of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (Fourteenth Legislative District, Beaver County), was entitled to $20,000 annually to cover business expenses associated with maintenance of a district office, as well as $4,000 for postage. Mr. Veon also was allotted up to $650 per month for a vehicle and $1,650 to be used for the monthly rent for his district office. Any unused balance of the latter $2,300 per month allotment could not be diverted for other purposes. Mr. Veon was expected to draw upon his general $20,000 allocation to pay any vehicular or rental charges in excess of those allotments. Pursuant to House Democratic Caucus (\u201cCaucus\u201d) procedures, Mr. Veon could seek additional funds from Caucus leadership if he exhausted his $20,000 allocation, and it was not uncommon for Caucus members to do so. However, trial testimony established that, because such supplemental allotments are matters of public record, some members hesitated to request them for fear of provoking political blowback from constituents.\nIn 1991, Mr. Veon formed the Beaver Initiative for Growth (\u201cBIG\u201d), a non-profit corporation. BIG received all of its funding from public sources, primarily through the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (\u201cDCED\u201d). BIG was administered by two \u201cco-chairs,\u201d Mr. Veon and then-State Senator Gerald Lavalle, who was invited to serve as co-chair by the individual in charge of Mr. Veon\u2019s district office, Annamarie Perretta-Rosepink. However, Mr. Lavalle admitted that his role in BIG\u2019s operations was quite limited.\nAccording to John Gallo, BIG\u2019s executive director from 1999-2003, BIG initially occupied, rent-free, the second floor of a bank-owned building in Beaver Falls, over a first-floor space occupied by Mr. Veon\u2019s district office. When Mr. Gallo was hired, BIG effectively had conducted no operations for at least a year, its records were strewn about the office, the only furniture in its space was a large table, and the building in general was in poor condition. Thus, with Mr. Veon\u2019s and Ms. Perretta-Rosepink\u2019s support, Mr. Gallo took it upon himself to seek new office space for BIG, Thereafter, Ms. Perretta-Rosepink informed Mr. Gallo that she had negotiated a lease in another facility (the \u201cBeaver Office\u201d) at a rental rate of $2,900 per month. Because this well exceeded Mr. Veon\u2019s $1,650 rental allotment, Ms. Perretta-Rosepink explained, BIG would take on the lease and sublet space in the new facility to Mr. Veon\u2019s district office. Although BIG was the named lessor, Mr. Veon\u2019s district office occupied substantially more of the space than BIG. Moreover, according to Mr. Gallo, once the two tenants were established in the new space, no sign was installed to indicate that BIG was an occupant of its own putative headquarters. Anyone seeking to visit BIG would enter through Mr. Veon\u2019s office. BIG nonetheless paid $1,400 of the $2,900 rental fee, leaving Mr. Veon responsible for the $1,500 balance, $150 less than his $1,650 allotment for that purpose.\nWhen Mr. Gallo returned from a month-long leave of absence from his position with BIG, he found that Ms. Perretta-Rosepink had drawn a check for $2,100 from BIG\u2019s account to the benefit of a person whom Mr. Gallo did not recognize. When asked, Ms. Perretta-Rosepink told Mr. Gallo that the check had been written to the landlord of an additional office, located in Midland, Pennsylvania (\u201cMidland Office\u201d). She explained that, due to redistricting, Mr. Veon\u2019s district now included Midland, which was geographically separate from the remainder of Mr. Veon\u2019s district, and that Mr. Veon did not want Midland constituents to have to travel to the Beaver Office. Because Mr. Veon had insufficient funds for a satellite office, BIG would pay the rent for the Midland office as well. Mr. LaValle testified that the Midland Office appeared to him to be functioning as a legislative office. Daniel Woodske, BIG\u2019s director of marketing, testified that he was surprised to learn that BIG leased the Midland Office, a discovery he made when he dropped by to \u201csay hello.\u201d Once there, Mr. Woodske observed a door with a BIG sign on it, which opened onto \u201cjust pretty much maybe a six by eight room.\u201d Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.T.\u201d), 2/22/2012, at 35-36. During his five years at BIG, Mr. Woodske used the Midland Office approximately twenty times, always for meetings with individuals whom he wanted to spare any inconvenience in traveling to Beaver Falls. According to Ms. Perretta-Rosepink, the rental fee for the Midland Office was $2,100.\nIt was Mr. Veon who arranged to rent a third space, located in Pittsburgh\u2019s South Side neighborhood (the \u201cSouth Side Office\u201d), which was leased by BIG from March 2005 through November 2005. The space was located on the second floor of a building owned by Mr. Veon\u2019s friend, Marc Adams, whose cigar shop occupied the first floor. The terms of the lease called for BIG to pay $2,500 for the first four months of occupancy, and $1,500 per month thereafter. The rented space bore no indication that it was occupied by BIG, and contained only two desks and a computer. Thomas Woodske, who succeeded Mr. Gallo as BIG\u2019s executive director in or around 2003, learned about the lease from his son, Daniel. Thomas Woodske perceived no need for the South Side Office. The only person who used that office was Angela Bertugli. Ms. Bertugli was hired by Michael Manzo, Representative Bill DeWeese\u2019s chief of staff, to perform legislative and policy research for the Caucus. She testified that she knew nothing about BIG prior to her employment at the South Side Office.\nMr. Veon and Ms. Perretta-Rosepink took primary responsibility for BIG\u2019s operations, with Ms. Perretta-Rosepink paid to serve as the organization\u2019s fiscal director. Mr. Veon made the hiring decisions for BIG.\nBIG subsisted entirely, or almost entirely, on public monies obtained by Mr. Veon through applications prepared by Mr. Veon, signed pro forma by Mr. Gallo, and filed with DCED. After Mr. Gallo\u2019s tenure ended, Thomas Woodske took over as signatory for the grant applications. Thomas Woodske testified that Ms. Perretta-Rosepink would present him with only the signature page of these applications, and that she explained that his signature was required to ensure that no legislative employee would sign applications seeking Commonwealth grants.\nBased upon these facts, Mr. Veon was charged with various offenses. After some charges were withdrawn, Mr. Veon went to trial on nineteen counts. He and Ms. Perretta-Rosepink were tried before a jury over a three-week period. Following the parties\u2019 presentations and before closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury. In the portion of the jury charge that is relevant to Mr. Veon\u2019s instant challenge, the court defined the pecuniary requirement in the conflict of interest statute as follows: \u201cPrivate pecuniary benefits in-eludes [sic] intangible political gain such as garnering favorable publicity, obtaining free publicity, enhancing standing in the community or the like.\u201d N.T., 3/1/2012, at 23-24.\nOn March 5, 2012, a jury convicted Mr. Veon of one count of restricted activities, conflict of interest (count 1); two counts each of theft by unlawful taking or disposition (counts 3 and 5) (hereinafter \u201ctheft by unlawful taking\u201d), theft by deception (counts 7 and 9), theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received (counts 11 and 13) (hereinafter \u201ctheft by failure to make required disposition\u201d), and misapplication of entrusted property and property of government or financial institutions (counts 15 and 17) (hereinafter \u201cmisapplication of entrusted property\u201d); and one count of criminal conspiracy (theft by unlawful taking or disposition) (count 19).,\nOn June 19, 2012, the trial court sentenced Mr. Veon to an aggregate twelve to forty-eight months\u2019 incarceration, to be followed by forty-eight months of intermediate punishment. The court further ordered Mr. Veon to pay court costs, $1,500 in fines, and $119,000 in restitution, subject to further proceedings to determine a more precise amount of restitution. Mr. Veon then filed post-sentence motions. The court denied relief on all but one of Mr. Veon\u2019s claims, granting his request for a hearing concerning restitution. On September 24, 2012, Mr. Veon filed a notice of appeal to the Superior Court. On September 25, 2012, the trial court convened the restitution hearing.\nOn November 8, 2012, the trial court refined Mr. Veon\u2019s restitutionary sentence to $135,615, payable to DCED. See Order, 11/8/2012. On December 7, 2012, Mr. Veon filed a notice of appeal of the modified restitution order. The trial court associated $116,615 of the restitution obligation, concerning the office rents for the Beaver and Midland Offices, with counts 1, 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19 (conflict of interest, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, theft by failure to make required disposition, misapplication of entrusted property, and conspiracy, respectively), and imposed it jointly and severally with co-defendant Ms. Perretta-Rosepink. The remaining $19,000, associated with the South Side Office, was imposed solely upon Mr. Veon at counts 1, 5, 9,13, 17, and 19 (conflict of interest, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, theft by failure to make required disposition, misapplication of entrusted property, and conspiracy, respectively). Id.\nOn February 6, 2015, in a published decision, the Superior Court affirmed Mr. Veon\u2019s judgment of sentence in part, but upheld the restitution order only as to certain counts, vacating it as to others. See Commonwealth v. Veon, 109 A.3d 754 (Pa. Super. 2015). The Superior Court determined that the jury\u2019s verdict regarding counts 1 (conflict of interest), 3 (theft by unlawful taking), 7 (theft by deception), 11 (theft by failure to make required disposition), 15 (misapplication of entrusted property), and 19 (conspiracy) did not specify which particular legislative office was associated with the theft. Thus, the trial court had no basis upon which to assume that Mr. Veon\u2019s thefts specifically were associated with the Beaver Falls and/or Midland offices, which, in turn, called into question the basis for the trial court\u2019s calculations. Absent such a basis for the amount of restitution imposed, an award of restitution could not be imposed upon those counts. Id, at 772. Conversely, with respect to counts 5 (theft by unlawful taking), 9 (theft by deception), 13 (theft by failure to make required disposition), and 17 (misapplication of entrusted property), expressly concerning amounts associated with the South Side Office, the evidence established such a basis. Consequently, having determined that DCED could be a victim under the restitution statute, the Superior Court effectively affirmed just the $19,000 restitutionary penalty associated with the South Side Office. However, the Superior Court directed the trial court upon remand \u201cto determine if there is an appropriate method to calculate restitution in light of [the court\u2019s] decision regarding\u201d counts 1, 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19, the counts associated with the Beaver and/or Midland Offices. Id. at 773.\nII. Analysis\nMr. Veon filed a timely petition for allowance of appeal, which this Court granted on August 20, 2015. We granted review as to the following questions:\n1. Whether the Pennsylvania conflict of interest law is unconstitutionally vague on its face, and whether, as applied in this case, the trial court improperly expanded the definition of \u201cprivate pecuniary interest\u201d to include \u201cintangible political gain,\u201d thereby threatening the constitutional rights of all elected officials in Pennsylvania[?]\n2. Whether the restitution ordered in this case was improper[ ] because the Commonwealth cannot be a victim under the subject criminal statutes[?]\nSee Commonwealth v. Veon, 121 A.3d 954 (Pa. 2015) (per curiam). We heard argument on May 10, 2016. The case is ripe for disposition.\nA. Concerning the constitutional question.\nBefore we can analyze Mr. Veon\u2019s challenge to the conflict of interest statute, we must determine the correct analytic framework for the inquiry. Mr. Veon\u2019s presentation conflates several distinct lines of argument, and appears substantially to meld questions of constitutional vagueness and overbreadth, while focusing upon the putative infringement of Mr. Veon\u2019s protected right to freedom of speech in his capacity as an elected representative. At root, however, Mr. Veon\u2019s challenge begins with the simpler question of whether the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Section 1102 and its consequent jury charge conformed to that statute\u2019s terms.\nWe acknowledge that the lower courts did not address Mr. Veon\u2019s challenge as a non-constitutional challenge. However, their rulings necessarily turned upon their respective determinations regarding Section 1102\u2019s scope. Neither they nor we can assess a question of statutory vagueness or overbreadth without first determining the intended meaning of the statute, and we are bound to interpret a statute, where possible, in a way that comports with the constitution\u2019s terms. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922 (directing us to presume \u201c[t]hat the General Assembly does not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or of this Commonwealth\u201d).\nWe reach a constitutional challenge only when we find no tenable interpretation of the statute in question that obviates the necessity of doing so. \u201cWhen the validity of [a statute] is drawn in question, and if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional] question may be avoided.\u201d Commonwealth v. Monumental Props., Inc., 459 Pa. 450, 329 A.2d 812, 827 (1974) (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)). In MCI WorldCom, Inc. v. Penna. Pub. Utility Comm\u2019n, 577 Pa. 294, 844 A.2d 1239 (2004), we explained the governing principle as follows:\nThe \u201ccanon of constitutional avoidance\u201d provides that when a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter. See Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 555, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) .... Pennsylvania explicitly recognizes this canon by statute in instances where construction of a Pennsylvania statute is at issue. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922; see also Commonwealth v. Bavusa, 574 Pa. 620, 832 A.2d 1042, 1050-51 (2003).\nMCI WorldCom, 844 A.2d at 1249-50; see Mt. Lebanon v. Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 470 Pa. 317, 368 A.2d 648, 650 (1977) (\u201c[W]e should not decide a constitutional question unless absolutely required to do so.\u201d). Thus, the threshold statutory interpretation directed by our case law necessarily is encompassed by the duly preserved constitutional challenge.\nThe premise underlying all of Mr. Veon\u2019s arguments\u2014both below and before this Court\u2014is that the trial court impermis-sibly expanded the conduct specifically proscribed by Section 1102 when it instructed the jury that it could find a \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d if the Commonwealth established that Mr. Veon received an \u201cintangible political gain\u201d through prohibited activities. See Veon, 109 A.3d 754, 761-62 (asking, inter alia, \u201cwhether the trial court improperly expanded the definition of ... \u2018private pecuniary interest\u2019 to include intangible political gain?\u201d). Thus, we are presented first with a question of statutory interpretation. For the reasons set forth below, we find that Section 1102 is amenable to an interpretation that eliminates the necessity of constitutional inquiry. In fact, the only reasonable interpretation of Section 1102 preempts such an inquiry.\nB. The extension of the conflict of interest statute to encompass \u201cintangible political gain.\u201d\nSection 1103, \u201crestricted activities,\u201d provides that \u201c[n]o public official or public employee shall engage in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest.\u201d Section 1102 defines a \u201cconflict\u201d or \u201cconflict of interest\u201d as follows:\nUse by a public official or public employee of the authority of his office or employment or any confidential information received through his holding public office or employment for the private pecuniary benefit of himself, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he or a member of his immediate family is associated. The term does not include an action having a de minimis economic impact or which affects to the same degree a class consisting of the general public or subclass consisting of an industry, occupation or other group which includes the public official or public employee, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he or a member of his immediate family is associated.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102 (emphasis added).\nTo determine whether a jury instruction faithfully characterized the statute upon which it is based, we first must determine the scope and meaning of the provision in question, thus furnishing a rubric for our inquiry. Statutory interpretation presents a question of law, which we resolve de novo. Robinson Twp., Washington Cnty. v. Commonwealth, 623 Pa. 564, 83 A.3d 901, 943 (2013). Once we have established the meaning and scope of the statute, we must determine whether the trial court, which enjoys broad discretion in fashioning its jury charge, \u201cclearly, adequately, and accurately\u201d related the law, so understood, to the jury. Commonwealth v. Lesko, 609 Pa. 128, 15 A.3d 345, 397 (2011). \u201cOnly when the court commits an abuse of discretion or provides the jury with an inaccurate statement of law is there reversible error.\u201d Commonwealth v. Brown, 605 Pa. 103, 987 A.2d 699, 712 (2009) (citing Commonwealth v. Hall, 549 Pa. 269, 701 A.2d 190, 207 (1997)). Further more, even if an instruction is erroneous, relief is due only when the error is prejudicial. Commonwealth v. Thompson, 543 Pa. 634, 674 A.2d 217, 219 (1996).\nBecause the conflict of interest statute provides no specific definition of \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d or any of its constituent words, we must look first to the words\u2019 common and approved usage, with the emphasis upon \u201cpecuniary.\u201d See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903 (\u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage .... \u201d). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, they are presumed to be the best indication of legislative intent.\u201d Kirsch v. Public Sch. Employees\u2019 Ret. Bd., 603 Pa. 439, 985 A.2d 671, 674 (2009) (quoting Chanceford Aviation Props., L.L.P. v. Chanceford Twp. Bd. of Supervisors, 592 Pa. 100, 923 A.2d 1099, 1104 (2007)). Only if the words are not explicit on the question presented may we resort to principles of statutory construction. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Fedorek, 596 Pa. 475, 946 A.2d 98, 98-99 (2008)). When the statute\u2019s language is unambiguous, we will not disregard its meaning under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. Id.\n\u201cPecuniary\u201d commonly is defined as \u201c[o]f, relating to, or consisting of money; monetary.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1312 (10th ed. 2014); see American Heritage College Dictionary 1006 (3d ed. 1993) (\u201cOf or relating to money\u2019). \u201cPecuniary benefit,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201c[a] benefit capable of monetary valuation.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 188 (10th ed. 2014); see Commonwealth v. Moran, 629 Pa. 68, 104 A.3d 1136, 1147 n.12 (2014) (noting that the Ethics Act Section 1102 \u201cspecifically limits the type of benefit prohibited\u201d to a \u201cpecuniary\u201d benefit); cf. 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 403, repealed by Act of Oct. 15,1998, P.L. 729, No. 93 \u00a7 6(a)(2) (Ethics Act\u2019s predecessor provision to Sections 1102 and 1103, which prohibited receipt of something of \u201cmonetary value\u201d including \u201ca gift, loan, political contribution, reward or promise of future employment\u201d).\nIndeed, our own Crimes Code offers a definition of \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d that pays due regard to the conventionally understood meaning of the word \u201cpecuniary\u201d: \u201cBenefit in the form of money, property, commercial interests, or anything else the primary significance of which is economic gain.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501 (emphasis added). However, by its terms, and with certain caveats, that definition applies only within Title 18. Outside of Section 1102, \u201cpecuniary\u201d appears in only one other provision in Title 65: a party who has wrongfully sought a remedy under the Ethics Act may be liable to the subject of his action for \u201c[a]ny specific pecuniary loss that has resulted from the proceedings.\u201d 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1110(d)(3).\nWhile the absence of a formal definition from Title 65, viewed in tandem with the express limitation of Title 18\u2019s definition to that Title, urges caution upon us in importing the latter to the former, we may nonetheless consider Section 4501\u2019s definition when delineating the common and approved meaning of \u201cpecuniary.\u201d As noted, supra, nowhere in Title 18 or Title 65 does the word \u201cpecuniary\u201d suggest anything but a monetary benefit. Perhaps of greatest salience to this matter is 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701, which provides that a person is guilty of bribery in official and political matters, inter alia, \u201cif he offers, confers or agrees to confer upon another, or solicits, accepts or agrees to accept ... any pecuniary benefit as consideration for [a] decision, opinion, recommendation, vote or other exercise of discretion as a public servant, party official or voter by the recipient.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701(a)(1). That provision, of course, is governed by the Section 4501 definition, such that bribery occurs when one offers, confers, solicits, or accepts any \u201c[bjenefit in the form of money, property, commercial interests or anything else the primary significance of which is economic gain.\u201d Notably, Subsections 4701(a)(2) and (3) establish that bribery also may be found where \u201cany benefit\u201d is solicited or accepted as \u201cconsideration\u201d for certain acts. Section 4501, in turn, defines \u201cbenefit,\u201d simpliciter, as follows:\nGain or advantage, or anything regarded by the beneficiary as gain or advantage, including benefit to another person or entity in whose welfare he is interested, but not an advantage promised generally to a group or class of voters as a consequence of public measures which a candidate engages to support or oppose.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501. Consequently, it is clear not only that the General Assembly recognizes the distinction between pecuniary benefits and benefits of other kinds but also that it has chosen in the past to address the two as distinct violations within the same statutory section.\nFinally, although somewhat more obliquely, our own interpretations of other aspects of the Ethics Act underscore the General Assembly\u2019s intention in that title to address financial conflicts of interest. In In re Carroll, for example, we observed that \u201c[t]he intent and purpose of the Ethics Act is not shrouded in mystery.\u201d 586 Pa. 624, 896 A.2d 566, 573 (2006). Quoting Section 1101.1 of the Act, we opined that \u201c[t]he substantive focus of this declaration is on financial interests, and particularly, how complete disclosure of financial interests may ... assure the public that .the \u2018financial interests\u2019 of public officials \u2018do not conflict with the public trust.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a)); see Rendell v. Penna. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 603 Pa. 292, 983 A.2d 708, 714 (2009) (\u201cIn Carroll, this Court credited the candidate\u2019s argument that the Ethics Act, at its core, is designed to expose possible financial conflicts .... \u201d (emphasis added)).\nFrom these sources, we derive the proposition that pecuniary gain (or loss) consistently is defined in ways that imply amenability to quantification. A pecuniary benefit or detriment must be financial. While it may not be possible to come up with a to-the-dollar value of a given pecuniary benefit, various statutes make clear that difficulties with precise quantification do not preclude grading of the offense by assessment of value. See generally 18 Pa.C.S. 3903(c)(1) (\u201cGrading of theft offenses\u201d) (providing that \u201cvalue means the market value of the property at the time and place of the crime, or if such cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property within a reasonable time after the crime\u201d); cf. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 910 A.2d 80 (Pa. Super. 2006) (finding pecuniary benefit sufficient to establish bribery where official received sexual favors from prostitutes that would have cost $30 to $50 on the open market).\nIn fairness to the trial court, that court believed that its broad definition of \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d was compelled by the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in Keller v. State Ethics Commission, 860 A.2d 659 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004), which the trial court construed as holding \u201cthat private pecuniary gain (or benefit) includes the utilization of misappropriated funds to garner favorable publicity, to obtain free publicity, to enhance standing in the community, or to otherwise achieve political gain.\u201d See Trial Court Opinion, 1/23/2013, at 5. While it is true that the court in Keller considered those factors, the facts are distinguishable. At issue in Keller was a small-town mayor\u2019s solicitation of funds for performing wedding ceremonies, funds that he promised to, and ultimately did, donate to charity. Over a period of years, approximately $16,000 passed through his personal bank account, which he donated to various charities, invariably in his own name. Accordingly, while the court agreed that these donations had considerable intangible political value to the mayor, its decision nonetheless hinged upon the proposition that the mayor\u2019s receipt of the monies in question constituted a private pecuniary benefit, regardless of the funds\u2019 final destination. Accord Commonwealth v. Feese, 79 A.3d 1101, 1127 (Pa. Super. 2013) (\u201cWhether a political party, a charity, or an individual\u2019s bank account is the ultimate recipient of the misappropriated funds and resources is irrelevant to establishing a violation of the conflict of interest provision of the Ethics Act.\u201d). Thus, Keller does not establish that intangible political benefits are sufficient to sustain a conflict of interest conviction.\nAfter reviewing Keller, the Superior Court in the instant matter offered only the following conclusory rationale:\n[Mr.] Veon focuses on the trial court\u2019s alleged extension of the statutory term \u201cprivate pecuniary gain\u201d to include various \u201cintangible political benefits\u201d as improper. He argues that he received no gain whatsoever. But political gain costs money. The blatant and substantial \u201cintangible political gain,\u201d as described in this case, constitutes private pecuniary gain\u2014the misappropriated money [e]nured to Veon\u2019s benefit.\nVeon, 109 A.3d at 765. The court followed this brief analysis with a lengthy recitation of Mr. Veon\u2019s \u201cscheme.\u201d That account certainly could be construed to demonstrate Mr. Veon\u2019s effort to secure political advantage. However, by itself, it does not support the proposition that \u201cpolitical gain costs money\u201d; or that the General Assembly intended to establish a basis for prosecuting misuse of public monies where it is not personal receipt or retention of those monies, but rather intangible political benefit, that is sought; or that Mr. Veon\u2019s \u201cintangible political gain\u201d constituted in any reasonable sense a \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d as those terms commonly are understood. Thus, the Superior Court failed to set forth a rationale justifying its affirmance of the trial court\u2019s expansion of \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d to encompass \u201cintangible political gain.\u201d\nThe trial court\u2019s understanding of what constitutes a \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d is unduly broad. In a recent case presenting some of the same concerns that we confront here, the Supreme Court of the United States noted that \u201ca statute in this field that can linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a scalpel should reasonably be taken to be the latter.\u201d McDonnell v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 2355, 2373, 195 L.Ed.2d 639 (2016) (quoting United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal., 526 U.S. 398, 408, 119 S.Ct. 1402, 143 L.Ed.2d 576 (1999)). The trial court\u2019s jury instruction here made of the statute a meat axe, finding (or creating) a conflict of interest on every dais, at each parade, and at every ribbon-cutting, given that the very nature of seeking to satisfy one\u2019s constituents and secure re-election all but requires the taking of official action to secure intangible political gains. This criminalization of politics is a bridge too far.\nOur General Assembly evidently did not intend to enact such a broad proscription, and we know better than to infer one in the face of more restrictive language. Based upon the plain language of Section 1102, we hold that, to prove \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d as used in the conflict of interest statute, the prosecution must show some private financial gain. Consequently, the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that Section 1102 may be violated when the only benefit to Mr. Veon was political in nature. Furthermore, nothing about the remainder of the jury charge, viewed as a whole, cured the infirmity created by the trial court\u2019s erroneous statement of the law. In so erroneously and expansively interpreting Section 1102, the trial court necessarily undermined confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict to an extent requiring vacatur of Mr. Veon\u2019s judgment of sentence for conflict of interest.,\nC. DCED\u2019s eligibility to receive restitution.\nWe now must determine whether the Commonwealth was eligible to receive restitution under the circumstances of this case. In relevant part, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106, \u201cRestitution for injuries to person or property,\u201d provides as follows:\n(a) General rule.\u2014Upon conviction for any crime wherein property has been stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein the victim suffered personal injury directly resulting from the crime, the offender shall be sentenced to make restitution in addition to the punishment prescribed therefor.\n\u215c * * *\n(c) Mandatory restitution.\u2014\n(1) The court shall order full restitution:\n(i) .,. so as to provide the victim with the fullest compensation for the loss. The court shall not reduce a restitution award by any amount that the victim has received from the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Board or other governmental agency but shall order the defendant to pay any restitution ordered for loss previously compensated by the board to the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund or other designated account when the claim involves a government agency in addition to or in place of the board. ...\n(ii) If restitution to more than one person is set at the same time, the court shall set priorities of payment. However, when establishing priorities, the court shall order payment in the following order:\n(A) The victim.\n(B) The Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Board.\n(C) Any other government agency which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\n(D) Any insurance company which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\n* * # *\n(h) Definitions.\u2014As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection:\n* \u215d \u215d *\n\u201cVictim.\u201d As defined in section 479.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L. 177, No. 176), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. The term includes the Crime Victim Compensation Fund if compensation has been paid by the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund to the victim and any insurance company that has compensated the victim for loss under an insurance contract.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106 (footnote omitted).\nSection 479.1, formerly codified at 71 P.S. \u00a7 180-9.1, since has been recodified in the Crime Victims Act, 18 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 11.101, et seq. (the \u201cCVA\u201d). See Commonwealth v. Brown, 603 Pa. 31, 981 A.2d 893, 896 n.9 (2009). The CVA defines \u201cvictim\u201d as follows:\n(1) A direct victim.\n(2) A 'parent or legal guardian of a child who is a direct victim, except when the parent or legal guardian of the child is the alleged offender.\n(3) A minor child who is a material witness to any of the following crimes and offenses under 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to crimes and offenses) committed or attempted against a member of the child\u2019s family:\nChapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide).\nSection 2702 (relating to aggravated assault).\nSection 3121 (relating to rape).\n(4) A. family member of a homicide victim, including stepbrothers or stepsisters, stepchildren, stepparents or a flan-e\u00e9, one of whom is to be identified to receive communication as provided for in this act, except where the family member is the alleged offender.\n18 P.S. \u00a7 11.103 (emphasis added). A \u201c[djirect victim\u201d is defined by the same section as \u201c[a]n individual against whom a crime has been committed or attempted and who as a direct result of the criminal act or attempt suffers physical or mental injury, death or the loss of earnings under this act.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\nIn the instant matter, the Superior Court based its determination that DCED was entitled to restitution upon this Court\u2019s decision in Brown, which itself can be understood as a corrective to our earlier decision in Commonwealth v. Runion, 541 Pa. 202, 662 A.2d 617 (1995), which interpreted a previous version of Section 1106. We discuss these cases in chronological order; together, they provide a framework for understanding Section 1106 in its present incarnation.\nIn Runion, we considered whether the Department of Public Welfare (\u201cDPW\u201d), which had covered medical expenses for a victim of a violent crime who was on public assistance at the time of the attack, was entitled to restitution under Section 1106 as it then was formulated. At that time, Section 1106 defined a \u201cvictim\u201d as \u201c[a]ny person, except an offender, who suffered injuries to his person or property as a direct result of the crime.\u201d Runion, 662 A.2d at 619 (quoting then-effective 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(h)) (emphasis added). Nothing in the statute specified whether the Commonwealth or its agencies could qualify as a \u201cvictim.\u201d For guidance, the Court turned to the Statutory Construction Act, which then, as now, defined \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201ca corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, other association, government entity (other than the Commonwealth), estate, trust, foundation or natural person.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991. The Court thus found that the plain and ordinary meaning of the word \u201cperson\u201d excluded Commonwealth agencies \u201cwhere the legislature has not otherwise spoken.\u201d Runion, 662 A.2d at 619. Accordingly, DPW was not entitled to restitution.\nIn so ruling, however, the Court paused to bemoan the outcome, complaining that it was at odds with the historic purpose to be served by restitutionary sanctions. We noted the well-established principle \u201cthat the primary purpose of restitution is rehabilitation of the offender by impressing upon him that his criminal conduct caused the victim\u2019s loss or personal injury and that it is his responsibility to repair the loss or injury as far as possible.\u201d Id at 618. Regarding the inexorability of our plain-language reading, however, we observed that, while the contrary interpretation \u201cwould favor the public policy of rehabilitation of an offender for an offender\u2019s criminal conduct through restitution, such a reading would not be consistent with our rules requiring a strict interpretation of penal provisions.\u201d Id. at 619. \u201c[Ujnless or until the legislature enacts language to the contrary,\u201d we concluded, \u201cwe must find that [DPW], as a Commonwealth entity, is expressly excluded from the definition of a \u2018person[,\u2019] and as such may not be considered as a victim under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106.\u201d Id. at 621.\nNotably, shortly before Runion was decided on July 18, 1995, the General Assembly revised Section 1106\u2019s definition of \u201cvictim\u201d to the text set forth supra, defining such by reference to CVA Section 11.103\u2019s predecessor provision, and specifically as including the Crime Victim Compensation Fund and insurance companies where either has provided compensation to the victim of crime. See Act of May 3, 1995, P.L. 999, No. 12, \u00a7 1 (effective in 60 days), as codified by 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(h). In turn, Section 11.103 defines \u201cvictim\u201d as set forth above. First, a victim may be a \u201cdirect victim,\u201d which is defined as an \u201cindividual\u201d who suffers \u201cphysical or mental injury, death or the loss of earnings under this act\u201d as a consequence of a criminal act. The remaining categories of \u201cvictim\u201d are defined, in the only relevant particulars, as any of a \u201cparent or legal guardian,\u201d a \u201cminor child,\u201d or a \u201cfamily member.\u201d 18 P.S. \u00a7 11.103. Thus, although the General Assembly removed the word \u201cperson\u201d from Section 1106\u215b definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d the Section 11.103 definition cross-referenced by Section 1106 describes only \u201cpersons\u201d as commonly understood\u2014\u201cindividuals\u201d who suffered harms such as injury, death, and loss of earnings; and \u201cparents,\u201d \u201cguardians,\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d and \u201cfamily members.\u201d\nIn 2009, considering Section 1106 in its current form, this Court issued its decision in Brown. In that case, the question presented was whether Medicare was entitled to share in a Section 1106 restitutionary award when it had made payments directly to a medical provider for care provided to a victim of crime. In setting a framework for our analysis, we observed that, \u201cgenerally speaking, restitution is the requirement that the criminal offender repay, as a condition of his sentence, the victim or society, in money or services.\u201d Brown, 981 A.2d at 895. Echoing Runion, we emphasized that \u201cthe primary purpose of restitution is rehabilitation of the offender.\u201d Id. Consequently, \u201crecompense to the victim is only a secondary benefit, as restitution is not an award of damages,\u201d id. a proposition reinforced by the General Assembly\u2019s 1998 amendment of Section 1106 making restitution mandatory rather than discretionary. See supra n.25.\nTurning to Section 1106, we found guidance in Subsection (c)(l)(ii), which establishes the priority order in which various categories of potential recipients will receive restitution in the event that \u201crestitution to more than one person is set at the same time.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(c)(l)(ii) (emphasis added). In order, restitution is to be paid as follows to:\n(A) The victim.\n(B) The Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Board.\n(C) Any other government agency which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\n(D) Any insurance company which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(c)(l)(ii). Noting that the relevant definition of \u201cvictim\u201d did not specify any government entities except the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund, we nonetheless found a manifestation of intent to allow restitution in the General Assembly\u2019s inclusion of government agencies that have reimbursed a victim of crime in the description of the priority order for receiving restitution. However, what agencies were eligible to receive restitution, and under what circumstances, remained unclear. Consequently, we found that, in this regard, the intention reflected in Section 1106 could not be gleaned from the plain language alone, requiring the court to consider the legislative history behind Section 1106, the object to be obtained by the statute, and the consequences of the competing interpretations. Brown, 981 A.2d at 898-99.\nWith regard to the legislative history, we reviewed our decision in Runion, in which we noted the incompatibility of our plain language interpretation with the presumptive legislative intent and the traditional objectives of restitution. We observed that, after Runion, the General Assembly\u2019s amendment of Section 1106 \u201cexpanded] the class of entities eligible\u201d to receive restitution to include the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund and government agencies that had provided reimbursement to the victim, as well as insurance companies that had done the same. Id. at 899.\nHaving so concluded, we sought to identify the government agencies to which the expansion applied. In so doing, we focused upon the question of \u201creimbursement\u201d as a necessary precondition for a government agency\u2019s entitlement to receive restitution under Subsection 1106(c)(l)(ii)(C). The question then arose whether Medicare had effectively reimbursed the victim despite the fact that it had, in fact, made payment directly to healthcare provider(s) who had treated the victim. We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that, where a government agency makes payment to a third party, even on a victim\u2019s behalf, it falls outside the ambit of the statutory language. We emphasized that, in broadening Section 1106\u2019s coverage, \u201cthe General Assembly not only expressed an increased focus on the importance of mandatory restitution, it believed that criminal offenders should both provide restitution to the victim directly, and to entities incurring expenses on the victim\u2019s behalf.\u201d Id. at 900. Furthermore, this reading was consistent with the rehabilitative mandate that animated Section 1106. \u201c[T]o find restitution available only to those entities which directly paid the victim would place form over substance.\u201d Id. at 901.\nFinally, we turned to consider the consequences of our proffered interpretation:\n[Interpreting Section 1106 to embrace those government entities that indirectly provide reimbursement to a victim would serve the salutary purposes of making manifest to criminal offenders the egregious nature of their actions, impressing upon defendants that they are responsible for their conduct, deterring repeat malfeasance, and encouraging these individuals to live in a responsible way. Furthermore, we do not believe that such an interpretation would result in the adverse consequences suggested by [the defendant] and posited by the Superior Court in [Commonwealth v. Figueroa, 456 Pa.Super. 620, 691 A.2d 487 (Pa. Super. 1997) ], where restitution is transformed into a reimbursement to society. Rather, such an interpretation is limited to those government agencies which make payments on behalf of a victim of a crime. It is on this basis that the Superior Court below cogently distinguished its decision in Figueroa, in which the government entity provided the medical services itself, rather than a government agency that paid monies on behalf of a victim.\nBrown, 981 A.2d at 901-02 (emphasis added).\nOur suggestive validation of the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Figueroa warrants consideration of that case. In Figueroa, a defendant was ordered to pay restitution to the Department of Corrections for medical care administered to the victim of an assault committed by the defendant. The Superior Court held that reimbursement must be understood \u201cin the classic sense which, by definition, is *[t]o pay back, to make restoration, to repay that expended; to indemnify, or make whole.\u2019 \u201d Figueroa, 691 A.2d at 490 (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed.)). Thus, to qualify for restitution \u201cthe governmental agency must have compensated the victim in a monetary fashion as a result of the loss of \u2018property [which] has been stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein the victim suffered personal injury directly resulting from the crime.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(a)).\nIn enlarging the category to other government agencies that provide such compensation, the court held, \u201cthe Legislature never intended to include the numerous governmental agencies [that] provide social, medical and supportive services to victims of crime. The victim is not being given compensation by such agencies and the agencies are not entitled to restitution as reimbursement for the service.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). Because medical care for a prisoner is an entitlement, not compensation, such care was not reimbursable, and, consequently, could not be the subject of restitution. Rejecting the dissent\u2019s contrary analysis, the majority suggested that granting restitution in the case before it would leave courts responsible for supervising restitution to entities such as \u201cChildren and Youth Services, mental health agencies, every hospital and clinic in Pennsylvania, the Departments of Welfare, Education, and Corrections, the Department of Health and others of the more than 230 departments under state control in Pennsylvania.\u201d Id. \u201cAll of these agencies,\u201d the court noted, \u201cin one form or another, receive state and/or federal aid and all, at one time or another, may be impacted by additional costs to [serve] a victim.\u201d Id. The court concluded that \u201cRestitution was not meant to be a reimbursement system to government but a compensation system to victims identified as such in the definitional section of the statute.\u201d Id. at 491.\nIn any event, in Brown we relied heavily upon the implications of Subsection 1106(c)(l)(ii)\u2019s prioritization of payment. That provision is not directly implicated in this case, because the trial court directed that restitution be paid solely to DCED; absent two or more designated recipients of restitution, no priority order of payment comes into play. But that does not materially change Brown\u2019s implications for this case, because the potential recipients of restitution as to which Subsection 1106(c)(l)(ii) sets the priority order correspond directly to the potential recipients of restitution identified in Subsection 1106(e)(l)(i), which is not restricted to the multiple-payee scenario. Subsection 1106(c)(l)(i) provides for the mandatory payment of \u201cthe fullest compensation\u201d to the victim for his loss, and provides for payment of restitution to the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund, \u201cother designated account when the claim, involves a government agencyand/or any insurance company, \u201cfor loss previously compensated\u201d by those entities. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(e)(l)(i) (emphasis added). Under either subsection, it is clear that no restitution may be paid except to a \u201cvictim,\u201d the two categories of government entities that the General Assembly has authorized to compensate victims (when they have, in fact, done so), or victims\u2019 insurance policies for monies paid to insured victims.\nNotwithstanding any legislative expansion of the definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d it is clear that the plain text of Section 11.103 still envisages \u201cvictims\u201d as \u201cpersons\u201d commonly understood. A \u201cvictim\u201d under Section 11.108 must be \u201ca direct victim,\u201d ie., an \u201cindividual\u201d who has suffered injury, death, or loss of earnings; or a \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cparent,\u201d \u201cguardian,\" or \u201cfamily member.\u201d Every relevant noun unequivocally describes a human being, not a government agency, and nowhere else is there a relevant definition that persuades us to broaden the common understanding of these words. There can be no serious doubt that DCED, the agency designated to receive the restitution ordered in this case, does not qualify as a direct victim. And neither, of course, is DCED a parent, guardian, child, or family member of a homicide victim. Although Subsection 1106(c)(l)(i)\u2019s provisions regarding \u201cvictims\u201d and \u201cother government agencies]\u201d reveals that the General Assembly intended that restitution reach certain Commonwealth agencies in a manner that did not depend upon identifying such agencies as \u201cvictims,\u201d it nonetheless required first that the agency in question have provided compensation to a victim so defined. That is what necessitates our determination that DCED is not entitled to restitution in this case.\nIn short, to qualify for restitution under Subsection 1106(c)(l)(i), a Commonwealth agency either must be a victim as that term is used in that subsection or must have reimbursed a victim as defined by Section 11.103, directly or by paying a third party on behalf of the victim. DCED, itself, cannot be a victim under Section 11.103. Furthermore, DCED received no compensation from another Commonwealth agency in this case. Thus, DCED is not entitled to restitution under Section 1106.\nThis circumstance leaves us only to reiterate the same misgivings we expressed in Runion. Denying restitution of any sort in this matter deprives the Commonwealth of a tool we have long recognized as essential, first and foremost, to the rehabilitative process. Concomitantly, those who unabashedly divert public monies to serve their own non-pecuniary interests may not be subject to the same restitutionary obligations imposed upon those who victimize individuals.\nIt cannot be denied that, in this case, public funds were diverted to inappropriate purposes and thus were unavailable to be used in the ways intended, effectively victimizing the Commonwealth and its citizens. As a consequence of this ruling, these are monies that the Commonwealth will never recover. That being said, as in Runion, to rule otherwise would require us to discard the language of the statute in pursuit of its spirit. Should the General Assembly wish to rectify this apparent gap in its restitution scheme, it may do so. We, on the other hand, may not. Accordingly, we now hold that, in this case, DCED is neither a \u201cdirect victim\u201d nor a reimbursable compensating government agency under Section 1106. Thus, it was error for the trial court in this case to order such restitution and for the Superior Court to uphold (in part) that aspect of Mr. Veon\u2019s judgment of sentence.\nIII. Conclusion\nA.\nHaving held that the trial court committed prejudicial error in its jury charge regarding conflict of interest, and that it erred in awarding restitution to DCED, we now must determine the appropriate remedy. Typically, when we determine that a trial judge has delivered an erroneous and prejudicial instruction to the jury, we vacate the defendant\u2019s judgment of sentence and remand for a new trial. See Von der Heide v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., 553 Pa. 120, 718 A.2d 286 (1998) (new trial required when an instruction palpably misleads jury); Commonwealth v. Whiting, 501 Pa. 465, 462 A.2d 218 (1983) (trial court\u2019s improper expressions of opinion during jury charge required reversal of judgment of sentence and remand for new trial); Commonwealth v. Joyner, 441 Pa. 242, 272 A.2d 454, 457 (1971) (directing reversal of judgment of sentence and remanding for new trial where trial court\u2019s charge erroneously removed question of voluntariness from jury); Stegmuller v. Davis, 408 Pa. 267, 182 A.2d 745, 747 (1962) (requiring new trial where law misstated). Detecting no reason to break with these cases, we vacate Mr. Veon\u2019s judgment of sentence, and we remand for a new trial on conflict of interest or for other proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nB.\nFinally, we note that we have disturbed the sentencing scheme as to conflict of interest, which is only one of several counts for which the trial court imposed its restitutionary sentence, and have also deemed illegal the imposition of any restitutionary sanction in favor of the Commonwealth. This leaves a comprehensive sentencing scheme unmoored from its foundation, such that we must afford the trial court the opportunity to revisit its entire sentencing approach and determine what modifications, if any, are warranted in light of our ruling. See Commonwealth v. Wolfe, 636 Pa. 37, 140 A.3d 661, 663 n.7 (2016) (holding that \u201cthe entire sentencing plan must be reevaluated in instances in which a defendant [successfully] challenges one of several interdependent sentences\u201d).\nConsequently, we vacate Mr. Veon\u2019s entire judgment of sentence and we remand, leaving the trial court to reconsider its entire sentencing plan.\nJustice Dougherty joins the opinion. Chief Justice Saylor and Justice Donohue join the opinion with respect to Parts I, II, and III(B) except with respect to footnote 29. Justice Baer joins the opinion with respect to Part II(C). Justice Todd joins the opinion with respect to Parts I, II, and III(B).\nJustice Baer files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nJustice Donohue files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice Saylor joins and in which Justice Todd joins with respect to Part II.\n. See 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(a) (conflict of interest), deemed unconstitutional in part by Shaulis v. Penna. State Ethics Comm'n, 574 Pa. 680, 833 A.2d 123 (2003) (holding Subsection 1103(g) unconstitutional \u201cto the extent that it regulates the conduct of former government employees who are also attorneys\u201d); see also 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102 (defining \"conflict of interest\u201d).\n. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106 (restitution for injuries to person or property).\n. The following factual narrative is based upon the Commonwealth's evidence. Due to the nature of our disposition, it is unnecessary to note Mr. Veon\u2019s disputes with the Commonwealth\u2019s account.\n. Ms. Perretta-Rosepink was charged simultaneously with Mr. Veon for various offenses arising out of the events detailed herein. They were tried before, and convicted by, the same jury. The Superior Court affirmed Ms. Perretta-Rosepink\u2019s several convictions. Commonwealth v. Perretta-Rosepink, 120 A.3d 372 (Pa. Super. 2015) (unpublished). Ms. Perretta-Rosepink has filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, and we have deferred disposition of that petition pending the outcome of the instant appeal. See Commonwealth v. Perretta-Rosepink, Order, 194 MAL 2015, Aug. 21, 2015 (per curiam).\n. Mr. Veon was tried separately for his direct involvement with the improper award of bonuses to Commonwealth employees for performing campaign work on state time. On or about June 18, 2010, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, at 4656 CR 2008, entered a judgment of sentence against Mr. Veon on fourteen counts of, inter alia, theft of services, conflict of interest, theft by deception, and conspiracy, sentencing him to an aggregate five years and nine months to fourteen years\u2019 incarceration and imposing restitution of nearly $1.9 million. Mr. Veon\u2019s direct appeal of his judgment of sentence was quashed as untimely. Most recently, the Superior Court dismissed as untimely his petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541, et seq. See generally Commonwealth v. Veon, 1128 MDA 2014, 2015 WL 7301687 (Pa. Super. April 10, 2015) (unpublished). That decision has not been appealed, and those proceedings have no bearing upon our disposition of the instant matter.\n. 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(a) (\"Conflict of interest\u2019\u2019) provides that \u201d[n]o public official or public employee shall engage in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest.\u201d \"Conflict of interest\u201d is defined as follows:\n\"Conflict\u201d or \"conflict of interest.\u201d Use by a public official or public employee of the authority of his office or employment or any confidential information received through his holding public office or employment for the private pecuniary benefit of himself, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he or a member of his immediate family is associated. The term does not include an action having a de minimis economic impact or which affects to the same degree a class consisting of the general public or a subclass consisting of an industry, occupation or other group which includes the public official or public employee, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he or a member of his immediate family is associated.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102.\n. Notably, the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument relied upon the jury charge in this regard. See N.T., 3/1/2012, at 74 (\"We\u2019re not limited to money. All this reference to Mike Veon didn't get paid by [BIG], that this money didn\u2019t go directly into his pocket, that\u2019s not what our burden of proving to you is. ... There are other benefits, intangible benefits, that Representative Veon received, and that\u2019s gamering favorable publicity and free publicity and enhancing his standing in the community so he can continue to be reelected.\u201d).\n. 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(a). The verdict sheet specified the putative financial elements of this charge as \"(Rent/legislative district office); and/or (Rent/South Side Pittsburgh office); and/or (Foreman retainer).\u201d This is relevant insofar as the jury acquitted Mr. Veon of a second count of conflict of interest.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3921(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3922(a)(1).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3927(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4113(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.\n. The jury also acquitted Mr. Veon of a second count of conflict of interest (\"Delta/Mark Veon higher salary\u201d) (count 2); and one count each of theft by unlawful taldng, theft by deception, theft by failure to make required disposition, and misapplication of entrusted property, which specifically pertained to \"Foreman retainer\u201d (counts 6, 10, 14, and 18, respectively). See Verdict Slip, 3/5/2012, at 1-4.\n. For conflict of interest and each of Mr, Veon's convictions for theft by unlawful taking (counts 1, 3, and 5, respectively), the court sentenced Mr. Veon to twelve to forty-eight months' incarceration, to run concurrently with one another. The court further found that count 7 (theft by deception) and count 11 (theft by failure to make required disposition) merged for sentencing with count 3, and that counts 9 (theft by deception) and 13 (theft by failure to make required disposition) merged for sentencing with count 5. For counts 15 and 17 (misapplication of entrusted property), the court imposed forty-eight-month intermediate punishment sentences to run concurrently with one another, and for conspiracy, the court sentenced Mr. Veon to twelve to forty-eight months' incarceration, to run concurrently with counts 1, 3, and 5. See Sentencing Order, 6/28/2012. The trial court further directed that Mr. Veon\u2019s sentences for supervision would run consecutively to the sentence imposed upon Mr. Veon for his earlier conviction at 4656 CR 2008, see supra n.5.\n, The Superior Court, observing correctly that restitution is a sentence, and thus determining that the court\u2019s second order merely modified the existing judgment of sentence, quashed Mr. Veon's second appeal, viewing the first appeal of his judgment of sentence as the appropriate vehicle to challenge all aspects of his judgment of sentence. See Veon, 109 A.3d at 762-63; see generally Commonwealth v. Harner, 533 Pa. 14, 617 A.2d 702, 704 (1992) (recognizing Section 1106 restitution as a \"direct sentence\u201d). Despite the fact that the Superior Court quashed Mr. Veon's second appeal and purported to modify its caption, both Superior Court docket numbers remained in the caption of its published decision. Accordingly, Mr. Veon filed his petition for allowance of appeal at both Superior Court dockets.\n. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of Mr. Veon\u2019s argument that Sections 1102 and 1103 are void for vagueness. The Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission has filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of the Commonwealth\u2019s position that those sections are neither facially unconstitutional nor unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case.\n. The Superior Court\u2019s detailed parsing of the award's components and the sufficiency of the evidence as to each has not been challenged by either party.\n. Usages of \"pecuniary\u201d are common in our Crimes Code, particularly in service of grading offenses. See, e.g., 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3304 (grading criminal mischief by monetary damage thresholds), 3307 (same, institutional vandalism), 3309 (same, agricultural vandalism); see also 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4958 (criminalizing an offer of \"pecuniary or other benefit\u201d to prevent the reporting of child abuse), 5108(a) (\"A person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree if he accepts or agrees to accept any pecuniary benefit in consideration of refraining from reporting to law enforcement authorities the commission or suspected commission of any offense or information relating to an offense.\u201d), 5904 (proscribing, in unfortunately anachronistic terms, the \u201cexhibit[ion] in any place, for pecuniary consideration or reward, any insane, idiotic or deformed person, or imbecile\u201d).\n. A pecuniary gain, financial by its very definition, must be quantifiable in the broad sense we use herein, which allows for the fact that, just because something is quantifiable in principle, the quantity need not be ascertainable in precise terms in a given case to maintain its character as pecuniary.\n. See United States v. Blagojevich, 794 F.3d 729, 734-39 (7th Cir. 2015) (discussing, in the context of a Hobbs Act bribery prosecution of the then-Governor of Illinois, the distinction between accepting something of value for an official act and \"logrolling,\u201d the solicitation of political favors in exchange for same; observing that, for example, under an expansive interpretation, it would be criminal for a sitting governor to solicit federal funds for public works projects in exchange for appointing a particular individual to a vacant Senate seat); cf, Moran, 104 A.3d at 1147 (holding that bribery only occurs \"where there is some offer of special treatment in exchange for something of value\u201d).\n. For reasons set forth at greater length in Section III, infra, this, in turn, requires us to vacate Mr. Veon\u2019s entire judgment of sentence, not just the particular sentence imposed for his conflict of interest conviction.\n. We express no opinion regarding the various so-called \"Bonusgate\u201d convictions for conflicts of interest that involved the deployment of state employees during business hours as campaign operatives. While there are similarities in such circumstances, there also, arguably, are differences, specifically in connection with the quantification principle. In Feese, 79 A.3d at 1121, the Superior Court held that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that Mr. Feese had sustained a private pecuniary benefit because \"taxpayer[-]funded offices and equipment were used for campaign purposes,\u201d providing electoral support that otherwise would have come out of independent campaign funds or the candidate\u2019s pocket. Id. at 1121; see Commonwealth v. Veon, 1128 MDA 2014, 2015 WL 7301687 (Pa. Super. April 10, 2015) (unpublished) (same).\n. This, too, presents a question of law, which we review de novo. Robinson Twp., 83 A.3d at 943.\n. Restitution was discretionary until 1998, when the General Assembly amended Section 1106 to make it mandatory. See Act of Dec. 3, 1998, P.L. 933, No. 121, \u00a7 1 (immediately effective).\n. In Brown, unlike in this case, the court sentenced the defendant to pay a portion of the mandatory restitution to a government agency and another portion to the victim directly. In this case, the restitution ordered was payable solely to DCED.\n. This Court adopted a similar definition of reimbursement in Commonwealth v, Garzone, 613 Pa. 481, 34 A.3d 67, 80 n.ll (2012) (adopting the definition of reimbursement from the eighth edition of Black's Law Dictionary as \u201c[c]ompensation for loss; esp., full or partial compensation paid by a criminal to a victim ... ordered as part of a criminal sentence or as a condition of probation\u201d).\n. The Commonwealth agrees that Brown relied upon the priority order of restitution rather than the designation of DPW, itself, as a victim. The Commonwealth further agrees that no reimbursement was paid in this case, impliedly accepting that, if we must approach this case as we did Brown, no restitution will lie. However, the Commonwealth attempts to work around this difficulty by insisting that DCED is a \u201cdirect victim\u201d for purposes of restitution. See Brief for Commonwealth at 41-43. For the reasons set forth herein, this argument cannot prevail.\n. In her learned concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Donohue proposes that Section 1106, as informed by Section 11.103, unambiguously authorizes restitution only for crimes that involve personal injury. Justice Donohue\u2019s Concurring and Dissenting Opinion (\"DCDO\u201d) at 485-89, 150 A,3d at 462-64. However, there is nothing unambiguous about Section 1106 in this regard. Subsection 1106(a) provides that, \"[ujpon conviction for any crime wherein property has been stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein the victim suffered personal injury directly resulting from the crime, the offender shall be sentenced to make restitution\" (emphasis added). The General Assembly\u2019s use of this disjunctive construction strongly suggests its intention to impose restitution for property crimes or crimes involving personal injury, not only property crimes that happen to occur in tandem with personal injury crimes, as Justice Donohue maintains. We do not read complementary statutory provisions in isolation. Given the plain language of Subsection 1106(a), the statute read in its full context is patently ambiguous regarding whether the legislature intended to impose mandatory restitution for property crimes, as such, without regard to the occurrence of personal injury. However, Section 1106, as informed by Section 11,103, unambiguously establishes that DCED cannot be a \u201cvictim\u201d because the relevant provisions provide that there can be no restitution when there is no human victim. Thus we need not strain to reconcile the apparent mandatory imposition of restitution for property crimes in Subsection 1106(a) with the proposition that victim-hood under the statute requires a personal injury crime. That being said, Justice Donohue has identified yet another problematic aspect of the current statutory scheme governing restitution, one that the General Assembly may wish to consider in the future.\n. But see 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1109(c) (\"Any person who obtains financial gain from violating any provision of [Chapter 65], in addition to any other penalty provided by law, shall pay a sum of money equal to three times the amount of the financial gain resulting from such violation into the State Treasury or the treasury of the political subdivision.\u201d). We express no opinion regarding the applicability of this section under the circumstances of this case. We merely note that the General Assembly saw fit to provide a specific mechanism by which the Commonwealth might recover funds misappropriated in ways proscribed by the Ethics Act. See Commonwealth v. Gray, 6 Pa. D. & C.4th 504 (C.P. Dauphin 1989).\n. In Commonwealth v, Perzel, 116 A.3d 670 (Pa. Super. 2015), this author wrote a published opinion for a unanimous three-judge panel of the Superior Court that reached a contrary conclusion regarding restitution. In Perzel, the panel was precedentially bound by the Superior Court\u2019s prior decision in this very case, which we now reverse.\n. This ruling is not without precedent in our more recent case law. In Commonwealth v. Garzone, 613 Pa. 481, 34 A.3d 67 (2012), echoing Figueroa, we held that the compensation of Commonwealth personnel cannot be recovered as restitution under Section 1106. Although that case focused upon the recoverability of costs of prosecution under 16 P.S. \u00a7 7708, in a footnote we rejected any analogy to Section 1106, and, in so doing, rejected \"the legal construct that the state, 'as the representative for society as a whole,\u2019 acts as the injured party in criminal matters.\u201d Garzone, 34 A.3d at 80 n.11 (quoting In re Hickson, 573 Pa. 127, 821 A.2d 1238, 1244 (2003)).\n. Regardless of whether Mr. Veon raised a sufficiency challenge before the Superior Court, a proposition that is at best debatable given his occasional conclusory averments to that effect in his Superior Court brief, he has neither raised nor developed that argument before this Court. Justice Donohue nonetheless would grant Mr. Veon a full discharge with regard to his conflict of interest conviction based upon double jeopardy concerns that she apparently believes to be inherent in his challenge, since Mr. Veon indisputably has made no such argument and sought no such relief before this Court. Neither of the cases Justice Donohue cites validates such a result. In McDonnell v. United States, the Court recognized the potential for a double jeopardy argument, but the defendant specifically had raised it. Even so, the McDonnell Court remanded to the lower court to assess evidentiary sufficiency under the correct interpretation of the relevant statute rather than make that decision in the first instance on appeal, as Justice Donohue would do here. See 136 S.Ct. at 2375. And in Burks v. United States, the Court distinguished between appeals that succeeded specifically due to evi-dentiary insufficiency and those that succeeded based upon allegations of trial court error. See 437 U.S. 1, 13, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (\u201cThe principle that [the Double Jeopardy Clause] does not preclude the Government\u2019s retrying a defendant whose conviction is set aside because of an error in the proceedings leading to conviction is a well-established part of our constitutional jurisprudence.\u201d (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)).\nThis Court consistently has rejected the employment of a rule equivalent to Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), which allows federal courts to remedy \"[a] plain error that affects [a defendant\u2019s] substantial rights .,. even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d In Pennsylvania, a defendant must preserve on peril of waiver even an issue of constitutional dimension. See Commonwealth v. Castillo, 585 Pa. 395, 888 A.2d 775, 782 (2005) (\"[Tins] Court has abrogated the policy against enforcing waiver in the face of basic or fundamental error affecting substantive rights, ... as distinct from the practice of many other jurisdictions including the federal courts, which allow for discretionary plain error review in exceptional circumstances.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Edmondson, 553 Pa. 160, 718 A.2d 751, 752 (1998) (finding defendant waived challenge to allegedly coercive jury instruction by failing to object at trial). There are appealing arguments for applying the plain error doctrine, and a considerable number of jurisdictions have done so, but we emphatically are not among them. In effect, Justice Donohue would employ some variation on the plain error doctrine in contravention of long-standing Pennsylvania case law without the benefit of any argument in favor of such a departure from settled law. This Court may wish to revisit its current unforgiving approach to waiver. But we did not agree to do so in the instant case, and we have no lower court consideration or appellate advocacy on that issue. Accordingly, the question must await a more suitable case.",

        "text": "CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION\nJUSTICE BAER\nI join Part II.C. of the Majority opinion disposing of Appellant\u2019s restitution issue given my agreement that a Commonwealth agency cannot be a \u201cvictim,\u201d as that word is statutorily defined, entitled to mandatory restitution under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(a). However, for the reasons that follow, I respectfully disagree with the manner in which the Majority disposes of Appellant\u2019s issue regarding his conflict-of-interest conviction. Accordingly, I cannot join Parts II.A, II.B., or III of the Majority opinion.\nI agree with the Majority\u2019s holding that \u201cto prove \u2018pecuniary benefit\u2019 as used in the conflict of interest statute, [65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1102-03, ] the prosecution must show some private financial gain,\u201d Majority Opinion at 463, 150 A.3d at 448, and therefore, a conflict-of-interest conviction cannot be predicated on mere intangible political gain. The trial court\u2019s contrary conclusion reflects a simple misinterpretation and misapplication of a criminal statute. Appellant certainly had several avenues through which to pursue relief from this error. For instance, Appellant could have challenged the trial court\u2019s incorrect definition of an element of the crime by objecting to the jury instruction containing the improper definition. He also could have raised an insufficiency of the evidence ehal-lenge in the Superior Court. Both of these challenges present clear standards of review and straightforward avenues for relief. If we determined that the trial court abused its discretion by improperly instructing the jury, then Appellant would be entitled to a new trial. If we determined that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction, then Appellant would be entitled to an acquittal.\nHowever, the only question Appellant has presented throughout this litigation, including in his petition seeking this Court\u2019s review, is a convoluted constitutional challenge, which makes no mention of any jury instruction. The Majority goes to great lengths to explain why it can address Appellant\u2019s constitutionally-framed issue as one challenging an erroneous jury instruction, despite Appellant\u2019s focus on what he repeatedly self-describes, and the Majority recognizes, as a constitutional challenge. See Maj. Op. at 454-56, 150 A.3d at 443-44 (Part II.A \u201cConcerning the constitutional question\u201d). Moreover, and dispositively, the Majority does not point to where Appellant specifically objected to the erroneous jury instruction. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 647(C) (\u201cNo portions of the charge nor omissions from the charge may be assigned as error, unless specific objections are made thereto before the jury retires to deliberate.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Gwynn, 555 Pa. 86, 723 A.2d 143, 152 (1998) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s failure to challenge the jury charge before the jury retires to deliberate prevents appellate review.\u201d).\nI can appreciate the Majority\u2019s inclination to correct a clear trial court error. However, we can only grant relief based on preserved issues that are argued and developed by the parties. See, e.g., Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114, 117 (1974) (abolishing the fundamental error theory as a basis for reviewing jury instructions to which the appellant had not objected). In my view, Appellant\u2019s constitutional framing of his issue is a wholly inapt vehicle by which to challenge his conflict-of-interest conviction. Rather than act as Appellant\u2019s advocate and reinvent his arguments, I would find that his failure to present the proper challenge constitutes waiver precluding this Court from granting him relief. Thus, I find myself constrained to affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction for conflict-of-interest.\nFor these reasons, I would vacate the Superior Court\u2019s order and Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence and remand for resentencing based on the trial court\u2019s erroneous grant of restitution to a Commonwealth agency.\n. Section 1103 provides that \"[n]o public official ... shall engage in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest.\u201d 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103. The immediately preceding section defines conflict of interest as \"[u]se by a public official ... of the authority of his office ... for the private pecuniary benefit of himself ....\u201d 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102.\n. Interestingly, the Majority recognizes that \"[Appellant] has not preserved any claim regarding the sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d Maj. Op. at 474 n.32, 150 A.3d at 455 n.32, and thus \"we will not pass upon the question of evidentiary sufficiency,\u201d Id I agree. However, the Majority provides no persuasive explanation for its inconsistent application of the waiver doctrine, as a challenge to Appellant\u2019s jury instructions is just as waived as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.",

        "text": "CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION\nJUSTICE DONOHUE\nI. Statutory Interpretation\nI join the Majority in its conclusion that to constitute a conflict of interest as defined in 65 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1102, the \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d must consist of a monetary gain. Having concluded that the trial court improperly expanded the definition of a conflict of interest to include \u201cintangible political gain,\u201d I further agree that there is no basis to engage in an analysis of whether section 1103, which prohibits a public official or public employee from engaging in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest, was unconstitutional as applied in this case. See Mt. Lebanon v. Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 470 Pa. 317, 368 A.2d 648, 650 (1977) (\u201cwe should not decide a constitutional question unless absolutely required to do so\u201d); 65 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1103(a).\nA decision finding that a statutory provision is unconstitutional as applied is based upon a conclusion that the law, as written, cannot be constitutionally applied to a party under particular circumstances. See, e.g., In re J.B., 630 Pa. 408, 107 A.3d 1, 20 (2014); Clifton v. Allegheny Cty., 600 Pa. 662, 969 A.2d 1197, 1229 (2009); Nixon v. Commonwealth, 576 Pa. 385, 839 A.2d 277, 286-90 (2003). The as-applied challenge posed by Veon arises as a consequence of the trial court\u2019s expanded definition of \u201cprivate pecuniary interest.\u201d In this sense, Veon\u2019s contention is more aptly expressed as a claim that the statute is \u201cunconstitutional as interpreted\u201d rather than \u201cunconstitutional as applied.\u201d\nAs the question is presented and as a matter of law, we necessarily must address, at the outset, whether the courts below properly interpreted the provision at issue. I therefore agree with the learned Majority that our conclusion that the courts below erred in their interpretation of the statute\u2019s plain text obviates the constitutional question.\nII. Remand for Retrial\nWe are thus left with a crime that cannot be committed unless there is a private pecuniary benefit, i.e., a financial gain. As the Majority observes, this has always been the correct interpretation of the conflict of interest statute; the plain language of the statute bespeaks of no other definition. The Majority nonetheless declines to review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a private financial gain, maintaining that Veon waived consideration of this claim by failing to raise the argument before this Court or request discharge in his prayer for relief. Majority Op. at 475-76 n.33, 150 A.3d at 456 n.33. I respectfully disagree with each premise for finding waiver. In his brief before this Court, Veon challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conflict of interest conviction\u2014specifically as it relates to evidence of a private pecuniary gain\u2014as part of his broader statutory interpretation claim. Veon asserts that there was \u201cno evidence of record\u201d to support a finding that he received a private pecuniary gain because of his actions, as the \u201cnature of the prosecution\u201d did not involve a financial gain at all; rather, his prosecution for conflict of interest was based solely upon \u201cintangible gains\u201d that Veon experienced in the form of \u201cfavorable publicity and free publicity and enhance[d] standing in the community so that he can continue to be reelected.\u201d Veon\u2019s Brief at 8,10-11, 21-23 (quoting, in part, the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument, N.T., 3/1/2012, at 74); see also id. at 25 (\u201cThis case was not about Mr. Veon taking money. It was not about him using a non-profit as his personal bank account. It was not about misappropriation of funds. It was about allowing the jury to speculate on intangible political benefits that were never proven in order to meet a statutory requirement of pecuniary gain.\u201d). In my view, under the particular circumstances of this case and because of the nature of the issues subject to our review, the sufficiency claim did not need to be raised as a standalone issue, as it is raised within and encompassed by the statutory interpretation question.\nFurther, Veon\u2019s failure to specifically request discharge in his prayer for relief in no way impedes our ability to grant this relief if we conclude it is appropriate. In a case that likewise involved double jeopardy concerns, the United States Supreme Court made clear that in determining the proper resolution of an appeal, courts are not limited by the remedy requested by the appellant. Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (\u201c[I]t makes no difference that a defendant sought a new trial as one of his remedies, or even as the sole remedy. It cannot be meaningfully said that a person \u2018waives\u2019 his right to a judgment of acquittal by moving for a new trial.\u201d).\nI therefore disagree with the esteemed Majority that remand for retrial on the conflict of interest charge is the appropriate outcome here. Instead, drawing upon the teachings of the United States Supreme Court in McDonnell v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 2355, 195 L.Ed.2d 639 (2016), I would conclude that the conflict of interest charge against Veon should be dismissed at this level.\nLike the case at bar, McDonnell involved a question of statutory construction; specifically, the definition of the phrase \u201cofficial act\u201d required for convictions of honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges. See id. at 2361, 2365. As reflected by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s lengthy explanation of the precise meaning of the phrase, see id. at 2368-71, the language of the statute defining \u201cofficial act\u201d was, in part, ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations, requiring the McDonnell Court to \u201cchoose between ... competing definitions^]\u201d Id. at 2368. Based upon (1) its novel interpretation of what constitutes an \u201cofficial act,\u201d (2) the fact that the parties had not had the opportunity to brief the question of whether the defendant\u2019s actions constituted an \u201cofficial act\u201d under that new definition, and (3) its conclusion that the evidence presented at trial was susceptible to competing interpretations, the McDonnell Court found that remand was appropriate for the Court of Appeals to determine, in the first instance, whether the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of committing or agreeing to commit an official act (per the new definition), thereby warranting retrial. W. at 2375. In remanding the case, however, the Court included an unequivocal mandate: if the court below found there was insufficient evidence presented at the original trial that the defendant committed or agreed to commit an \u201cofficial act\u201d as now defined, \u201cthe charges against him must be dismissed.\u201d Id.\nIn contrast, in this case, the Majority\u2019s vacatur of Veon\u2019s conflict of interest conviction is premised upon its conclusion that the Commonwealth and the trial court misinterpreted the clear and unambiguous meaning of the phrase \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d contained in section 1102. See Majority Op. at 462, 150 A.3d at 447. No detailed statutory interpretation was required, as the words of the statute supported only one definition. See Barasch v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 516 Pa. 142, 532 A.2d 325, 331 (1987) (\u201cwhere the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity, a court may go no further\u201d); 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b). Nor are we announcing a new definition of \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit.\u201d To the contrary, the Majority reached its conclusion based upon \u201cthe plain language of [sjection 1102.\u201d Majority Op. at 462-63, 150 A.3d at 447-48.\nTo prove that Veon engaged in a conflict of interest, the Commonwealth was required to prove that (1) Veon, as a public official or public employee, (2) used the authority of his office or employment or confidential information (3) to obtain a private pecuniary benefit for himself, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he or his immediate family member is associated, and (4) the economic impact was more than de minimus. 65 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1102, 1103(a). The jury convicted Veon, at count one, of engaging in a conflict of interest, which charge was based upon Veon improperly diverting money from Beaver Initiative for Growth (\u201cBIG\u201d) to make payments related to his legislative offices. See Criminal Information at 1; Trial Court Order, 3/5/2012. Throughout the entire case\u2014from the charging document through closing arguments (and continuing on appeal)\u2014the Commonwealth contended that the \u201cprivate pecuniary benefit\u201d that Veon received was the political benefit that flowed from his actions. The Commonwealth adduced no evidence that Veon obtained any private pecuniary benefit through the actions alleged.\nWhen viewed in the context of how this case was charged and tried by the Commonwealth, the Majority\u2019s decision to limit its discussion to the jury instruction defining private pecuniary benefit is, in my view, a myopic basis for the decision of this matter. As stated herein, and argued by Veon at every level, the entire premise of the Commonwealth\u2019s case was that Veon received intangible political benefits from his actions, and the receipt of intangible political benefits satisfies the element of private pecuniary gain to constitute a conflict of interest. There was never an allegation nor any evidence presented that Veon or his family members received a financial benefit from his use of BIG money to pay the rent for his legislative offices. To the contrary, the Commonwealth forcefully argued to the jury that a conflict of interest was \u201cnot limited to money,\u201d and that Veon was guilty of the crime because of his receipt of \u201cintangible benefits\u201d including \u201cgarnering favorable publicity and free publicity and enhancing his standing in the community so he can continue to be reelected.\u201d N.T., 3/1/2012, at 74.\nSimply put, because of its erroneous interpretation of the statute, the Commonwealth failed to establish a material element of the crime of conflict of interest. As there is no question that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conflict of interest conviction, the charge \u201cmust be dismissed.\u201d McDonnell, 136 S.Ct. at 2375 (emphasis added); see also Commonwealth v. Arrington, 624 Pa. 506, 86 A.3d 831, 840 (2014) (stating that evidence is sufficient if it supports a conclusion that the Commonwealth proved every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt); cf Burks, 437 U.S. at 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141 (\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u201d). Thus, I would vacate the judgment of sentence and dismiss the conflict of interest charge.\nIII. Restitution\nTurning to the propriety of the restitution award, I agree with the Majority that the Department of Community and Economic Development (the \u201cDCED\u201d) is not entitled to restitution pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106. My review of the statutory language, however, reveals a more fundamental problem than the fact that the DCED is not a person, see Majority Op. at 471-72,150 A.3d at 453, as the Legislature has made no provision for restitution for crimes that only result in a loss of property or money.\nIn arriving at its conclusion, the Majority relies upon the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d in section 1106 of the Crimes Code and section 11.103 of the Crime Victims Act, the \u201cmandatory restitution\u201d requirement of section 1106(c)(1), and our prior decisions in Commonwealth v. Brown, 603 Pa. 31, 981 A.2d 893 (2009), and Commonwealth v. Runion, 541 Pa. 202, 662 A.2d 617 (1995), both of which interpreted the law to determine whether a Commonwealth agency is entitled to restitution for medical payments made on behalf of a victim of simple assault, a crime involving personal injuries. See Majority Op. at 465-73,150 A.3d at 449-55. However, the substance of the restitution statute, including the provisions upon which the Majority relies and the case law it discusses, all relate solely to victims of personal injury crimes.\nAs the Majority recognizes, section 1106(h) defines \u201cvictim\u201d by incorporating the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d contained in section 11.108 of the Crime Victims Act. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106(h). Section 11.103 includes the following relevant definitions:\n\u201cDirect victim.\u201d An individual against whom a crime has been committed or attempted and who as a direct result of the criminal act or attempt suffers physical or mental injury, death or the loss of earnings under this act. The term shall not include the alleged offender. The term includes a resident of this Commonwealth against whom an act has been committed or attempted which otherwise would constitute a crime as defined in this act but for its occurrence in a location other than this Commonwealth and for which the individual would otherwise be compensated by the crime victim compensation program of the location where the act occurred but for the ineligibility of such program under the provisions of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-473, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10601 et seq.).\n\u215c \u215c \u215c\n\u201cVictim.\u201d The term means the following:\n(1) A direct victim.\n(2) A parent or legal guardian of a child who is a direct victim, except when the parent or legal guardian of the child is the alleged offender.\n(3) A minor child who is a material witness to any of the following crimes and offenses under 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to crimes and offenses) committed or attempted against a member of the child\u2019s family:\nChapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide).\nSection 2702 (relating to aggravated assault).\nSection 3121 (relating to rape).\n(4) A family member of a homicide victim, including stepbrothers or stepsisters, stepchildren, stepparents or a fiance, one of whom is to be identified to receive communication as provided for in this act, except where the family member is the alleged offender.\n18 P.S. \u00a7 11.103 (emphasis added).\nAs the above-quoted definitions make clear, a \u201cvictim,\u201d as that term is defined by the Crime Victim\u2019s Act, only exists in situations where the result of the crime is death, injury, or a loss of earnings. It follows that the victim of a property crime that does not have such a result is not a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of section 11.103 and, by extension, section 1106.\nI note that section 1106(a), which sets forth the general rule regarding restitution, states:\nUpon conviction for any crime wherein property has been stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime, or wherein the victim suffered personal injury directly resulting from the crime, the offender shall be sentenced to make restitution in addition to the punishment prescribed therefor.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106(a) (emphasis added). Although, at first glance, this suggests that a court must sentence an offender to make restitution for any and all theft-related crimes, further review of section 1106 reveals that the words \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201crestitution\u201d are both defined terms that expressly apply only to a \u201cvictim.\u201d The statute defines \u201cproperty\u201d as \u201c[a]ny real or personal property including currency and negotiable instruments, of the victim.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. 1106(h) (emphasis added). It defines \u201crestitution\u201d as \u201c[t]he return of the property of the victim or payments in cash or the equivalent thereof pursuant to an order of the court.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Thus, pursuant to section 1106(a), the victim of a theft is only entitled to restitution if he or she died, was injured or suffered a loss of earnings as a result of the theft. While we presume the General Assembly did not intend a result that is absurd or incapable of execution, see 1 Pa.C.S.A, \u00a7 1922(1), we are prohibited from disregarding the plain language of a statute \u201cunder the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b).\nSection 1106, as it is currently written, has no provision requiring or permitting restitution for a crime where the victim suffers only a loss of money or property, regardless of whether the victim is a government agency or a person. We are bound by the plain language of the current statute, which clearly and unambiguously requires restitution to be paid only to a \u201cvictim\u201d as defined by section 11.103, As we have repeatedly held, \u201crestitution is a creature of statute and, without express legislative direction, a court is powerless to direct a defendant to make restitution as part of a sentence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Harner, 533 Pa. 14, 617 A.2d 702, 704 (1992) (citing Commonwealth v. Walton, 483 Pa. 588, 397 A.2d 1179 (1979)). Because Veon was not convicted of any personal injury-related crimes, the trial court was not empowered to order that he pay restitution to anyone, including the DCED.\nIV, Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, I join sections I, 11(A) and 11(B) of the Majority Opinion. I join section 11(C) of the Majority Opinion (with the exception of footnote 29) and its finding that the DCED is not entitled to restitution, subject to my additional analysis of the restitution statute. I respectfully dissent from the Majority\u2019s determination, contained in section 111(A), that Veon may be retried on the conflict of interest charge, but join the Majority\u2019s conclusion, contained in section III(B), that we must remand the matter for resentencing.\nChief Justice Saylor joins this concurring and dissenting opinion.\nJustice Todd joins this concurring and dissenting opinion with respect to Part II.\n. Veon raised the same challenge in the same manner before the Superior Court. See Veon\u2019s Superior Court Brief at 26-27, 29 (arguing that the trial court improperly permitted the expansion of the conflict of interest statute to include \"intangible political benefits,\u201d and that there was no evidence presented that Veon or his family experienced any monetary gain as a result of his actions). Because the Superior Court found that the trial court did not impermissibly expand the conflict of interest statute to include intangible political benefits, it did not need to reach the question of whether the evidence was insufficient to establish that Veon received any monetary gain from his conduct,\n. Thus, contrary to the Majority\u2019s accusation, I do not invoke the plain error doctrine to decide that the evidence was insufficient to support Veon\u2019s conflict of interest conviction. See Majority Op. at 475-76 n. 33, 150 A.3d at 456 n. 33. Rather, as discussed, my review of the record and Veon\u2019s brief before this Court reveal that he has adequately preserved and presented the argument within his statutory construction claim,\n. Specifically, the Commonwealth charged Veon, at count one, as follows:\nOn or about divers dates in and between 2003 and 2006, the [a]ctor, Michael R. Veon, a public official or public employee, engaged in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest by using the authority of his office for his own private pecuniary benefit; namely, the actor, while employed as a State Representative by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, authorized, directed and/or approved the payment of public funds in the form of [BIG] grant monies for the payment of rent of a legislative district office, and/or the payment to Terry Van Home for [BIG] work never performed, and/or the payment of the rent of a South Side Pittsburgh office and/or the payment of a monthly retainer to Jeff Foreman as a personal favor and/or as compensation for legislative and/or political work, thereby committing the offense of [c]onflict of [i]nterest[.]\nCriminal Information at 1. The jury acquitted Veon of the second conflict of interest charge, which related to allegations that Veon authorized funds to be paid from BIG to Delta Development to secure a higher salary for his brother. See id; Trial Court Order, 3/5/2012.\n. Notably, like his sufficiency claim, Veon raises his challenge to the jury instruction within his statutory interpretation claim and not as a standalone issue for this Court\u2019s review. I agree with the Majority that the jury instruction in question was erroneous, and his objection thereto was preserved before the trial court. See N.T., 03/01/2012, at 50-51.\n. Veon has not challenged his conviction under the conflict of interest statute on any grounds other than his failure to receive any private pecuniary gain. Thus, we were not asked to determine whether, when authorizing or directing the payment of the funds at issue, Veon was acting as a public official or public employee as those terms are defined in the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1102. I note, however, that although Veon was a State Representative at the time of the conduct at issue, he did not use the \u201cauthority of his office,\" as required to constitute a conflict of interest, to divert the funds from BIG to his legislative offices. Veon\u2019s role as a member of the House of Representatives did not give him any right to access BIG\u2019s funds. Rather, it was his role as the co-chair of BIG, a private nonprofit corporation, that permitted the expenditure of the funds.\n. The definition of \u201cvictim\u201d in section 1106(h) refers to the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d contained in now-repealed section 180-9.1 of the Administrative Code of 1929, See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106(h). When the Legislature repealed sections 180-9 to 180-9.11, it expressly recodified the repealed provisions with the statutory provisions of the Crime Victims Act. 18 P.S. \u00a7 11.5102; see also S.B. 1192, Act 1998-111, Reg. Sess. (Pa. 1998).\n. Within its definition of 'Victim,\u201d subsection (h) also \"includes the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund if compensation has been paid by the Crime Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund to the victim and any insurance company that has compensated the victim for loss under an insurance contract.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106(h).\n. It is obvious that a legislative remedy for this appreciable gap in the statute is necessary. That being said, the Legislature, by its definitions, excluded restitution in these instances.\nIt is worth noting that the prior definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d contained in 71 P.S. \u00a7 180-9.1, accounted for restitution payable to the victim of a theft-related crime, but the DCED would not have been entitled to restitution. Section 180-9.1 defined \"victim,\u201d in relevant part, as; \u201cA person against whom a crime is being or has been perpetrated or attempted.\u201d 71 P.S. \u00a7 180-9.1 (repealed Nov. 24, 1998) (emphasis added). Section 1991 of the Statutory Construction Act defines \"person\" as \"a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, other association, government entity (other than the Commonwealth), estate, trust, foundation or natural person.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1991 (emphasis added). The General Assembly, however, expressly disavowed its adherence to this definition of \"victim\u201d when it passed the Crime Victims Act.\n. The Majority suggests that the language of subsection (a) that requires restitution for \"any crime wherein property has been stolen,\u201d combined with the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d adopted in subsection (h), renders section 1106 ambiguous with regard to whether restitution can be required in relation to property crimes that do not result in personal injury. See Majority Op. at 473 n.29, 150 A.3d at 454 n.29. This Court has stated, however, that an ambiguity only exists where there are at least two reasonable interpretations of the statutory text under review. See Del. Cnty. v. First Union Corp., 605 Pa. 547, 992 A.2d 112, 118 (2010). Although an undeniable tension arises in light of the universal directive of section 1106(a) and the limited definition of \"victim\u201d contained in section 11.103 (adopted in section 1106(h)), in my view, this tension does not stem from an ambiguity. It is unreasonable to read sections 1106(a) and 1106(h) together as permitting restitution where no victim, as expressly defined by section 11.103, exists. See generally Majority Op. at 464-65, 150 A.3d at 449 (stating that section 11.103\u2019s definition of victim applies in the context of section 1106). Rather, in my view, the tension stems from a legislative oversight in failing to broaden the definition of \"victim\u201d\u2014an oversight that would be improper for this Court to cure via statutory construction. See Burke v. Independence Blue Cross, 628 Pa. 147, 103 A.3d 1267, 1273-74 (2014) (concluding that the statutory text \"reveals, not an ambiguity, but an asymmetry stemming from an apparent legislative oversight\u201d).",
