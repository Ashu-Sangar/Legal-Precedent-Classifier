        "text": "OPINION\nJUSTICE TODD\nIn this appeal, we consider whether filing an appellate brief which abandons all preserved issues in favor of unpreserved ones constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel per se. After careful review, we hold that it does, and so we vacate the Superior Court\u2019s order and remand to that court for further proceedings.\nThe factual and procedural history of this matter is straightforward. In 2012, Appellant Frankie Rosado was accused of sexually abusing his former girlfriend\u2019s teenage daughter, whereupon he was charged with one count each of indecent assault, corruption of minors, and unlawful contact with minor. Appellant, then represented by a public defender, proceeded to trial, whereafter he was convicted of the aforementioned offenses and later sentenced to an aggregate term of 33 to 69 months imprisonment.\nAppellant hired new counsel (hereinafter \u201cAppellate Counsel\u201d) to represent him at the post-sentencing and appellate stages of his case. Appellate Counsel filed a post-sentence motion raising, as relevant here, a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, but the trial court denied relief. Appellate Counsel then filed a notice of appeal to the Superior Court, whereupon the trial court issued an order directing him to file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Appellate Counsel filed a document styled as a \u201cpreliminary\u201d concise statement, wherein he raised three issues: (1) whether Appellant\u2019s sentence was \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d; (2) whether the trial court erred in excluding evidence that the alleged victim had previously accused her father of sexual abuse; and (3) whether a juror fraudulently concealed bias during voir dire. Appellate Counsel also attached a copy of his post-sentence motion to the \u201cpreliminary\u201d concise statement, erroneously believing that doing so would preserve the claims raised therein for purposes of appeal, and requested additional time to file a \u201cfinal\u201d concise statement, which the trial court granted. However, Appellate Counsel never filed a revised concise statement, and, accordingly, the trial court considered the three claims raised in the extant concise statement, and issued a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion rejecting those claims. Appellate Counsel then filed an appellate brief with the Superior Court, in which, deciding to abandon the three claims raised in his concise statement and addressed by the trial court, he raised as his sole appellate issue the unpreserved sufficiency claim.\nIn an unpublished memorandum opinion, the Superior Court, while noting the three issues preserved in Appellant\u2019s concise statement, found the sufficiency claim to be waived, as it was not included therein. Commonwealth v. Rosado, No. 2754 EDA 2012, 2013 WL 11259105 (Pa. Super, filed Jul. 23, 2013). Accordingly, the court did not address any of Appellant\u2019s preserved claims or his sufficiency claim, and, as a result, it summarily affirmed.\nAppellant later filed a Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d) petition asserting, inter alia, that Appellate Counsel\u2019s above-detailed conduct constituted ineffective assistance of counsel per se, and thus seeking reinstatement of his appellate rights nunc pro tunc. The PCRA court held an evidentiary hearing, at which Appellate Counsel testified that he believed that attaching his post-sentence motion to his concise statement was sufficient to preserve the claims raised for purposes of appeal, and that he abandoned the three preserved claims in an effort to more persuasively argue his sufficiency claim. Ultimately, the PCRA court found that Appellate Counsel\u2019s conduct did not amount to ineffectiveness per se, and, accordingly, denied relief. Appellant appealed to the Superior Court.\nIn an unpublished memorandum opinion, the Superior Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Rosado, No. 2474 EDA 2014, 2015 WL 7352584 (Pa. Super, filed Apr. 17, 2015). The court first quoted extensively from the PCRA court\u2019s Rule 1925(a) opinion regarding the doctrine of ineffective assistance of counsel per se as it applies to appeals in Pennsylvania:\nThere are two types of ineffective assistance of counsel. The first is ineffectiveness under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668[, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674] (1984), as adopted in Pennsylvania by Commonwealth v. Pierce, [515 Pa. 153, ]527 A.2d 973 (Pa. 1987), which requires the defendant to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by an act or omission of his attorney.\n* \u215b *\nThe second type of ineffectiveness of counsel is ineffectiveness per se under United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648[, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657] (1984), decided the same day as Strickland, in which the United States Supreme Court categorized circumstances where prejudice will be presumed and need not be proven. The presumption is based on the High Court\u2019s recognition that there are \u201csome circumstances so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d (Id. at 658[, 104 S.Ct. 2039]).\nIn Commonwealth v. Brown, 18 A.3d 1147 (Pa. Super. 2011), our Superior Court collected cases that outline the various situations where counsel has been held to be ineffective per se and analyzed the differences between a Cronic violation and a Strickland/Pierce allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n* t \u215c\nThe recognized instances of per se ineffectiveness entitling a defendant to automatic relief are extremely narrow. Commonwealth v. Halley, 582 Pa. 164, 870 A.2d 795 (2005) (counsel did not file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement and waived all issues, thereby denying the defendant his constitutional right to direct appeal); Commonwealth v. Liebel, 573 Pa. 375, 825 A.2d 630 (2003) (attorney did not file a petition for allowance of appeal, as requested by the defendant, and denied his client the right to seek discretionary review with our Supreme Court); Commonwealth v. Lantzy, 568 Pa. 214, 736 A.2d 564, 572 (1999) (lawyer did not file a direct appeal, despite defendant[\u2019]s request); see also Commonwealth v. Burton, 973 A.2d 428 (Pa. Super. 2009) (filing of an untimely 1925(b) statement); Commonwealth v. Bennett, 593 Pa. 382, 930 A.2d 1264 (2007) (not filing an appellate brief so defendant did not obtain direct review).\nOn the other hand, the types of actions or inactions that are not subject to Cronic are legion. E.g. Commonwealth v. Reed, 601 Pa. 257, 971 A.2d 1216,1226 (2009) (\u201cfiling an appellate brief, deficient in some aspect or another, does not constitute a complete failure to function as a client\u2019s advocate so as to warrant a presumption of prejudice under Cronic\u201d); ... [sic] Commonwealth v. Reaves, 592 A.2d [Pa.] 134, 923 A.2d 1119 (2007) (narrowing ambit of reviewable issues on appeal does not constitute per se ineffectiveness^.]\nRosado, No. 2474 EDA 2014 at 6-8 (quoting PCRA Court Opinion, 10/31/14, at 6-9). The Superior Court then rejected Appellant\u2019s claim that Appellate Counsel\u2019s conduct constituted ineffective assistance of counsel per se:\nHere, Appellant\u2019s appeal was timely filed, a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement was filed, and this Court acknowledged the claim Appellate Counsel chose to raise on appeal. These facts vitiate Appellant\u2019s claim of per se ineffectiveness. As discussed above, because Appellate Counsel litigated Appellant\u2019s direct appeal, Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness must be reviewed using the tripartite test of Strickland/Pierce. See also Commonwealth v. West, 883 A.2d 654, 658 n.5 (Pa. Super. 2005) (explaining that per se ineffectiveness does not occur when counsel elected to pursue certain issues in the Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement and omitted others).\nIn Appellant\u2019s direct appeal, we found Appellant waived the only issue appellate counsel chose to raise. This fact, however, does not transform his claim into one of per se ineffectiveness. See [Reed, 971 A.2d at 1226] (\u201cfiling an appellate brief, deficient in some aspect or another, does not constitute a complete failure to function as a client\u2019s advocate so as to warrant a presumption of prejudice under Cronic\u201d).\nId. at 8-9. Accordingly, the court concluded that Appellant was required to demonstrate that Appellate Counsel\u2019s errors caused him prejudice, and, finding he had not done so, affirmed the PCRA court\u2019s denial of relief.\nAppellant timely sought, and this Court granted, allowance of appeal to consider whether filing an appellate brief which abandons all preserved issues in favor of unpreserved ones constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel per se. Commonwealth v. Rosado, 129 A.3d 1237 (Pa. 2015) (order).\nBefore us, the parties\u2019 arguments essentially offer two views of our jurisprudence in this area. Appellant contends that the Superior Court erred in rejecting his claim because it ignored \u201cclear similarities\u201d between the attorneys\u2019 conduct in Lantzy, Halley, Bennett, and Liebel\u2014ie., the failure to file a requested appeal, concise statement, appellate brief, and petition for allowance of appeal, respectively\u2014and Appellate Counsel\u2019s conduct herein. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8. Specifically, Appellant submits that Appellate Counsel\u2019s filing of a brief containing no preserved issue is functionally equivalent to not filing a brief\u2014as was the case in Bennett\u2014and, in any event, Appellate Counsel\u2019s actions caused the complete forfeiture of merits review\u2014as was the case in each of the aforementioned cases. Thus, Appellant views our earlier decisions in this area as drawing a distinction between attorney errors which cause complete deprivation of appellate review\u2014which constitute ineffective assistance of counsel per se\u2014and attorney errors causing partial deprivation of appellate review\u2014which do not.\nThe Commonwealth, by contrast, advances a competing view, consistent with the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning below, that this Court\u2019s decisions in Lantzy and its progeny apply only where counsel fails to file a document necessary to preserve review, and that, once those documents are properly filed, any defects therein are governed by Reed\u2019s holding that merely filing a brief which is deficient in some way does not give rise to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel per se. See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 10. Moreover, the Commonwealth echoes our concern, expressed in Reed, that extending Lantzy to the context of defective appellate briefs would \u201ctransform the exception\u201d of ineffective assistance of counsel per se \u201cinto a rule,\u201d as, in its view, \u201c[t]o delve into the substance of the actual content [of a brief] in order to make a finding of per se ineffectiveness would in practice, do away with the Strickland/Pierce standard.\u201d Id. at 11-12.\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The right to counsel is not a mere hollow formality satisfied by \u201ctrial alongside ... a person who happens to be lawyer,\u201d but, instead, \u201cis the right to the effective assistance of counsel\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 685-66, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 769, 771 n.14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970)) (emphasis added); see also Commonwealth v. Albert, 522 Pa. 331, 561 A.2d 736, 738 (1989) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the right to counsel includes the concomitant right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d).\nGenerally, an accused asserting that he has been denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that counsel engaged in errors which caused him prejudice\u2014i.e., that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s ... errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In Pennsylvania, we have set forth the Strickland standard as a three-part test, requiring an accused to show that (1) his underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) counsel\u2019s action or inaction lacked a reasonable strategic basis; and (3) but for counsel\u2019s conduct, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. See Pierce, supra. However, in certain limited circumstances, including the actual or constructive denial of counsel, prejudice may be so plain that the cost of litigating the issue of prejudice is unjustified, and a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel per se is warranted. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658-59, 104 S.Ct. 2039 (\u201cThere are ... circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified. Most obvious, of course, is the complete denial of counsel.\u201d (footnote omitted)); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cActual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally presumed to result in prejudice.\u201d); Lantzy, 736 A.2d at 571 (\u201c[Ajctual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel falls within a narrow category of circumstances in which prejudice is legally presumed.\u201d).\nThis Court has considered claims that an accused\u2019s attorney\u2019s errors amounted to a constructive denial of counsel in the context of appeals, and has done so with special solicitude for an accused\u2019s Pennsylvania constitutional right to appeal. See Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 9; Commonwealth v. Wilkerson, 490 Pa. 296, 416 A.2d 477, 479 (1980) (\u201c[A]n accused has an absolute right to appeal ... and counsel can be faulted for allowing that right to be waived\u201d). In Lantzy, we addressed an accused\u2019s claim that his counsel\u2019s failure to perfect an appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel per se. In an opinion authored by then-Justiee, now-Chief Justice Saylor, we held that counsel\u2019s errors were so egregious as to amount to a constructive denial of counsel, and therefore constituted ineffective assistance of counsel per se:\nStrickland ... expressly acknowledges that actual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel falls within a narrow category of circumstances in which prejudice is legally presumed. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2062. Since the failure to perfect a requested appeal is the functional equivalent of having no representation at all, Strickland, on its own terms, establishes the right to relief. Additionally, ... since Article V, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution guarantees a direct appeal as of right, see [Wilkerson], a failure to file or perfect such an appeal results in a denial so fundamental as to constitute prejudice per se.\nLantzy, 736 A.2d at 671 (some citations omitted).\nSubsequently, in Liebel, we considered an accused\u2019s challenge to his counsel\u2019s failure to file a requested petition for allowance of appeal to this Court. We held that this error, too, amounted to a constructive denial of counsel and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel per se:\nIn Lantzy, ... [w]e reasoned that counsel\u2019s unjustified failure to perfect a requested appeal is the functional equivalent of having absolutely no representation at all on direct appeal, a clear violation of the federal and state constitutional right to counsel.\n[W]e find the reasoning of Lantzy equally persuasive in the circumstances presented by this case. Here, appellate counsel ... simply failed to file a [petition for allowance of appeal] on [the accused\u2019s] behalf.... Such a failure cannot be regarded as anything less than providing [the accused] with no representation at all on that [petition for allowance of appeal], a clear violation of [the accused\u2019s] rule-based right to counsel.\nLiebel, 826 A.2d at 635.\nNext, in Halley, we addressed an accused\u2019s claim that his counsel\u2019s failure to file a court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, which resulted in waiver of all his claims for purposes of appeal, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel per se. In another opinion authored by now-Chief Justice Saylor, we concluded that extending Lantzy was \u201cbut a modest and incremental step\u201d:\nLantzy\u2019s reasoning expressly subsumed not only the unjustified failure to file a requested direct appeal, but also, the failure to perfect the appeal. See Lantzy, 736 A.2d at 571 (indicating that \u201ca failure to file or perfect such an appeal results in a denial so fundamental as to constitute prejudice per se\u201d (emphasis added)). Since ... the submission of a court-ordered Rule 1925(b) statement is a prerequisite to appellate merits review, the Rule 1925(b) statement (when directed) is elemental to an effective perfection of the appeal. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1173 (8th ed. 2004) (defining the act of perfecting as \u201ctak[ing] all [the] legal steps necessary to complete, secure, or record a claim, right, or interest\u201d). Thus, Lantzy\u2019s reasoning applies by its terms to counsel\u2019s dereliction in this case, which left Appellant without an ability to challenge his conviction and sentence by means of the direct appeal.\nHalley, 870 A.2d at 800 (some citations omitted and emphasis and alterations original). We distinguished counsel\u2019s failure to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, occasioning waiver of all claims for purposes of appeal, from a failure to preserve particular claims; we held the first constitutes ineffectiveness per se, while the second does not:\n[I]t is well established that the decision whether to presume prejudice or to require an appellant to demonstrate actual prejudice \u201cturns on the magnitude of the deprivation of the right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d As we observed in Lantzy, the failure to perfect a requested direct appeal is the functional equivalent of having no representation at all.... The difference in degree between failures that completely foreclose appellate review, and those which may result in narrowing its ambit, justifies application of the presumption in the more extreme instance.\nId. at 801 (citations omitted and emphasis added). Additionally, we found that maintaining the distinction between errors causing waiver of all claims and those failing to preserve particular claims appropriately prevented the exceptional doctrine of ineffective assistance of counsel per se from engulfing the general rule that an accused must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s errors caused him prejudice. Id. (\u201c[T]he limiting principle arising from the recognition of such difference in degree addresses the ... concern that the presumption should not extend to every circumstance in which a defendant may claim no effective appeal,\u201d (citations omitted)).\nOur subsequent decisions have maintained Halley\u2019s distinction between errors which completely foreclose merits review and those which merely \u201cnarrow its ambit.\u201d Thus, in Reaves, we held an attorney\u2019s failure to file a post-sentence motion preserving a particular sentencing claim \u201cdid not operate to entirely foreclose appellate review,\u201d but merely \u201cwaive[dj ... those claims subject to issue preservation requirements which were not otherwise properly preserved.\u201d Reaves, 923 A.2d at 1128-29. By contrast, in Bennett, wherein an accused\u2019s counsel failed to file an appellate brief, we explained that the claim emanated from Lantzy and Halley, as counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief was not a \u201csituation ... in which counsel has narrowed the ambit of appellate review\u201d but, rather, \u201chas failed to file an appeal at all.\u201d Bennett, 930 A.2d at 1273. In Commonwealth v. Mallory, 596 Pa. 172, 941 A.2d 686 (2008), we held that counsel\u2019s failure to object that his client was not afforded a jury trial waiver colloquy was \u201cunlike the presumed prejudice scenarios found in Lantzy and Halley, where counsel\u2019s lapse caused the complete default of direct appeals requested by the client.\u201d Id. at 197, 870 A.2d 795. Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Steele, 599 Pa. 341, 961 A.2d 786 (2008), we held that an attorney who, at the penalty phase of his client\u2019s capital murder case, gave a cursory argument and then exited the courtroom, leaving co-counsel in place, had not \u201centirely failed to function as [the client\u2019s] advocate.\u201d Id. at 810-12.\nFinally, and of particular importance herein, in Reed, we considered whether filing a deficiently composed appellate brief warranted a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel per se. Therein, the accused was convicted at a bench trial of murder and related offenses, and sentenced to life imprisonment; he appealed, raising an evidentiary claim that the admission of certain prior bad acts evidence had undermined his extant diminished capacity defense. Id. at 1217-19. The Superior Court concluded that the accused had waived his claims by failing to adequately prepare his appellate brief and certified record:\nWe have examined the record in light of these standards, and conclude that [Reed] is not entitled to relief for several reasons. First, [Reed\u2019s] argument is not developed sufficiently for us to conduct meaningful appellate review. Failure to provide argument with appropriate citation to authority results in waiver of the issue.\nSecond, [Reed\u2019s] brief refers to evidence in the notes of testimony, but the notes of testimony are not included in the certified record. Thus, we are unable to read the testimony and evaluate [Reed\u2019s] argument.\nIt is an appellant\u2019s duty to ensure that the certified record is complete for purposes of review. We decline to review this issue with an incomplete record, and consider the issue to be waived.\n971 A.2d at 1219 (quoting Commonwealth v. Reed, No. 2909 EDA 2003, 2005 WL 2177622, unpublished memorandum at 7-9 (Pa. Super, filed June 9, 2005)). Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that the accused had not waived his claim, the court rejected it, reasoning: (1) his argument was undermined by the fact that he was convicted at a bench trial, where the presiding judge is presumed not to be influenced by exposure to prejudicial evidence; and (2) the evidence was admissible under the rule that prior bad acts evidence may be introduced to show Reed\u2019s degree of preparation and, more generally, the res gestae of the case. Id\nThe accused subsequently filed a PCRA petition challenging his appellate attorney\u2019s failure to develop his brief as ineffective assistance of counsel per se, and the lower courts denied relief. On appeal to this Court, we reviewed some of the foregoing authorities, and rejected his claim:\n[W]e ... conclude that the filing of an appellate brief, deficient in some aspect or another, does not constitute a complete failure to function as a client\u2019s advocate so as to warrant a presumption of prejudice under Cronic. Unlike the case in Lantzy, Halley, and Liebel, ... Reed\u2019s direct appeal counsel\u2019s conduct in the instant case did not deprive Reed of his constitutional right to appeal. Significantly, Reed\u2019s direct appeal counsel filed a timely notice of appeal, which was docketed with the prothonotary. Although the Superior Court ... opined that counsel\u2019s failure to provide appropriate citation to authority and a copy of the notes of testimony resulted in waiver of Reed\u2019s argument, the court did not quash Reed\u2019s appeal. Indeed, the issues apparently were sufficiently presented to allow the court to address the merits of Reed\u2019s arguments, as the court indicated that it reviewed the evidence and the record. ... At most, the Superior Court\u2019s review of Reed\u2019s arguments on the record before it may be viewed as a \u201cnarrowing of the ambit\u201d of Reed\u2019s appeal. Moreover, to extend the [doctrine of ineffective assistance of counsel per se] to cases involving a defect in an appellate brief essentially would transform the exception into a rule, as many appellate briefs contain at least one arguable defect.\nId. at 1226-27 (citations omitted).\nUpon review of these cases, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s interpretation of our jurisprudence in this area is correct. As demonstrated supra, this Court has, since Halley, held that errors which completely foreclose appellate review amount to a constructive denial of counsel and thus ineffective assistance of counsel per se, whereas those which only partially foreclose such review are subject to the ordinary Strickland/Pierce framework. Moreover, contrary to the suggestion of the lower courts and the Commonwealth, Reed did not modify this analytical approach, but, rather, confirmed it. Indeed, as detailed above, Reed involved an appellate brief which, although the Superior Court opined was so deficiently developed as to warrant a finding of waiver, was \u201capparently ... sufficiently presented to allow the court to address the merits of Reed\u2019s arguments.\u201d Reed, 971 A.2d at 1226. In light of Halley\u2019s distinction between errors completely foreclosing review and those merely \u201cnarrowing the ambit\u201d of appellate review, this fact was critical, as this Court reasoned, noting that, \u201c[a]t most, the Superior Court\u2019s review of Reed\u2019s arguments on the record before it may be viewed as a \u2018narrowing of the ambit\u2019 of Reed\u2019s appeal.\u201d Id. at 1226-27. In other words, the brief in Reed was not so underdeveloped as to completely foreclose appellate review, but, rather, presented a less robust version of Reed\u2019s underlying evidentiary claim, which the Superior Court reviewed on its merits, precluding a finding that his attorney\u2019s errors caused a complete deprivation of merits review.\nMoreover, the filing of a brief that raises only waived issues, while technically distinct, is nonetheless akin to failing to file documents perfecting an appeal. There is no meaningful difference between an attorney who fails to file a notice of appeal, Rule 1925(b) statement, brief, or petition for allowance of appeal\u2014thereby forfeiting his client\u2019s right to appeal\u2014and one who makes all necessary filings, but does so relative solely to claims he has not preserved for appeal, producing the same end. In both situations, counsel has forfeited all meaningful appellate review.\nFurthermore, although the Commonwealth\u2019s view that its proposed limitation on Lantzy and its progeny is more judicially administrable because it draws a clear distinction between claims of ineffective assistance of counsel per se and those subject to the Strickland/Pierce framework is well-taken, we do not view it as significantly more advantageous in this context than the rule in Halley. Particularly where, as herein, an attorney has matter-of-factly forfeited all preserved claims of error in favor of unpreserved ones, it is a straightforward matter for an appellate court to conclude the claims are waived. Indeed, unlike in Reed, where the Superior Court was required to contemplate the degree to which review could be performed despite counsel\u2019s errors, and could consider the merits of issues from the arguments made with respect to them in the brief, here, no such analysis was required: due to counsel\u2019s actions, the only claim raised, by virtue of its omission from the Rule 1925(b) statement, was manifestly waived. Moreover, as we indicated in Halley, the distinction between errors causing complete deprivation of review and those causing only partial deprivation of review plainly \u201caddresses the .., concern that the presumption should not extend to every circumstance in which a defendant may claim no effective appeal.\u201d Halley, 870 A.2d at 801. Accordingly, we hold that the filing of an appellate brief which abandons all preserved issues in favor of unpreserved ones constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel per se.\nHere, although preserving three claims of trial court error in his Rule 1925(b) statement, Appellate Counsel completely abandoned those claims on appeal and, instead, raised an unpreserved sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, occasioning a complete waiver of all merits review. In light of this complete default, we find the Superior Court\u2019s observations that \u201cAppellant\u2019s appeal was timely filed, a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement was filed, and [the Superior Court] acknowledged the claim [Appellate Counsel] chose to raise on appeal\u201d of little value. Com. v. Rosado, No. 2474 EDA 2014 at *8, 2015 WL 7852584 (Pa. Super, filed Apr. 17, 2015). Nor do we agree with the Superior Court\u2019s characterization that Appellate Counsel \u201clitigated Appellant\u2019s direct appeal.\u201d Id. On the contrary, Appellate Counsel\u2019s errors herein precluded litigation of Appellant\u2019s direct appeal.\nThus, we vacate the Superior Court\u2019s order affirming Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence, and we remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices Baer, Donohue and Dougherty join the opinion.\nChief Justice Saylor files a concurring opinion in which Justices Wecht and Mundy join.\n. As detailed below, an accused seeking relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must typically demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s errors caused him prejudice; however, in certain limited circumstances, he may alternatively demonstrate that his counsel's errors are so plainly egregious as to amount to a constructive denial of counsel, which constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel per se. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 692-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3126, 6301, and 6318, respectively.\n. In the \"preliminary\u201d concise statement, Appellate Counsel refers to or incorporates the post-sentence motion only in two respects: with respect to the procedural background set forth therein, and with respect to the claim that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing Appellant.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541 et seq.\n. Appellant also presents a single-paragraph argument that, even if Appellate Counsel\u2019s conduct does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel per se, he has established that Appellate Counsel's conduct caused him prejudice, and, thus, is entitled to relief under the Strickland/Pierce framework. Appellant\u2019s claim in this regard is outside the scope of our grant of allowance of appeal, which was limited to the issue of whether Appellate Counsel was ineffective per se.\n. Appellant\u2019s claim is based on the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel, which applies, via the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process, to state proceedings carrying a potential sentence of imprisonment. See Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972).\n. Ineffectiveness per se may also be shown, inter alia, where (1) the state interferes with the assistance of counsel; (2) counsel fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing; or (3) counsel\u2019s representation is affected by his or her representation of adverse interests. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691-93, 104 S.Ct. 2052; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658-62, 104 S.Ct. 2039; Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 695-96, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002).\n. Therein, Lantzy pled guilty to theft and related offenses, and was sentenced accordingly, whereupon counsel filed post-sentence motions seeking to withdraw the plea or modify his sentence, as well as a notice of appeal. Lantzy, 736 A.2d at 565. The trial court did not expressly grant reconsideration, but nevertheless entertained the motions, and, in the interim, Lantzy's time to file his appellate brief lapsed. Id. at 565-66. Meanwhile, Lantzy and the Commonwealth reached an agreement whereby Lantzy would abandon his appeal in exchange for a lesser sentence, and the trial court approved the same, issuing an order modifying his sentence, and permitting counsel to withdraw his appearance. Id. at 556. Lantzy, now pro se, filed another set of post-sentence motions, which the trial court denied, and a notice of appeal. Id. The Superior Court, reasoning that Lantzy\u2019s initial appeal had lapsed and that the trial court\u2019s failure to grant reconsideration divested it of jurisdiction to issue its order modifying his sentence, quashed the appeal and reinstated the original sentence, leaving Lantzy with no way to appeal. Id.\n. See Commonwealth v. Lord, 553 Pa. 415, 719 A.2d 306, 309 (1998).\n. Notably, now-Chief Justice Saylor dissented, opining that Reed\u2019s attorney's failure to develop his brief had \"foreclose[d] effective merits review,\u201d that such error was \"the functional equivalent of having no counsel at all,\u201d and that the distinction between undeveloped briefs that completely foreclosed merits review and those that did not was a sufficient limiting principle. Reed, 971 A.2d at 1227 (Saylor, X, dissenting).\n. Indeed, we observe that the Superior Court has itself noted the distinction between a brief so poor as to warrant a finding of waiver, which gives rise to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel per se, and one which is merely deficient in some aspect or another. See Commonwealth v. Franklin, 823 A.2d 906 (Pa. Super. 2003) (finding that filing a brief so underdeveloped as to waive all claims for purposes of appeal constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel per se); Commonwealth v. Mikell, 968 A.2d 779 (Pa. Super. 2009) (relying on Halley to conclude that a brief that waived some claims for purposes of appeal did not give rise to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel per se ); Commonwealth v. Fink, 24 A.3d 426 (Pa. Super. 2011) (noting that filing a brief so underdeveloped as to waive all claims for purposes of appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel per se, and distinguishing Reed on the basis that the Superior Court therein was able to conduct merits review, in some measure, of Reed\u2019s evidentiary claim).",
