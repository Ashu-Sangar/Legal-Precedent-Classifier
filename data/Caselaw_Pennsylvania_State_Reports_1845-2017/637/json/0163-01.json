        "text": "OPINION\nJUSTICE WECHT\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) provides that arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 213(e) requires the consolidation of survival and wrongful death actions for trial. A representative of Extendicare Health Facilities, Inc., d/b/a Havencrest Nursing Center (\u201cExtendicare\u201d), executed an arbitration agreement with Anna Marie Taylor (\u201cDecedent\u201d) requiring the arbitration of claims arising from Decedent\u2019s stay at the Extendicare facility. Following Decedent\u2019s death, Daniel and William Taylor (\u201cthe Taylors\u201d) brought wrongful death claims on behalf of themselves as wrongful death beneficiaries and survival claims on behalf of Decedent\u2019s estate against Extendicare and two other defendants. Extendicare moved to bifurcate the wrongful death and survival actions, and to compel arbitration of Decedent\u2019s survival claim pursuant to the arbitration agreement and the FAA.\nThe trial court relied upon Rule 213(e) to deny Extendi-care\u2019s motion to bifurcate, and the Superior Court affirmed. We granted review to determine whether the FAA preempts the lower courts\u2019 application of Rule 213(e) under the facts presented. Upon review, we conclude that the FAA preempts the application of Rule 213(e), and requires arbitration of the survival claim against Extendicare. We therefore reverse the Superior Court, and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\nIn 2010, Decedent was admitted to Mon-Vale Non-Acute Care Service, Inc., d/b/a The Residence at Hilltop (\u201cThe Residence\u201d), a nursing home facility where, on February 1, 2012, she fell and fractured her right hip. Decedent underwent surgery at Jefferson Health Services, d/b/a Jefferson Regional Medical Center (\u201cJefferson Medical Center\u201d). Following surgery, Decedent was admitted to one of Extendicare\u2019s skilled nursing facilities. On February 9, 2012, as part of the admissions paperwork and pursuant to a power of attorney authorizing him to act on Decedent\u2019s behalf, William Taylor executed the Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement (\u201cADR Agreement\u201d) that is central to this appeal. The ADR Agreement, to which only Decedent (by William Taylor) and Extendicare are parties, provides that any covered disputes arising between the parties are to be submitted to binding arbitration:\nVoluntary Agreement to Participate in ADR. The Parties agree that the speed, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the ADR process, together with their mutual undertaking to engage in that process, constitutes good and sufficient consideration for the acceptance and enforcement of this Agreement. The Parties voluntarily agree that any disputes covered by this Agreement ([hereinafter] referred to as \u201cCovered Disputes\u201d) that may arise between the Parties shall be resolved exclusively by an ADR process that shall include mediation and, where mediation does not successfully resolve the dispute, binding arbitration. ... The Parties\u2019 recourse to a court of law shall be limited to an action to enforce a binding arbitration decision or mediation settlement agreement entered in accordance with this Agreement or to vacate such a decision based on the limited grounds set forth in [the Uniform Arbitration Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7301, et seq.]\nReproduced Record (\u201cR.R.\u201d) at 83a-84a. The ADR Agreement purported to require the resolution of all disputes in a single arbitral forum as follows:\nCovered Disputes. This Agreement applies to any and all disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement or to [Decedent\u2019s] stay at [Extendicare\u2019s facility] that would constitute a legally cognizable cause of action in a court of law sitting in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and shall include, but not be limited to, all claims in law or equity arising from one Party\u2019s failure to satisfy a financial obligation to the other Party; a violation of a right claimed to exist under federal, state, or local law or contractual agreement between the Parties; tort; breach of contract; fraud; misrepresentation; negligence; gross negligence; malpractice; death or wrongful death and any alleged departure from any applicable federal, state, or local medical, health care, consumer or safety standards. ... All claims based in whole or in part on the same incident, transaction or related course of care or services provided by [Extendicare] to [Decedent] shall be addressed in a single ADR process.\nR.R. at 84a.\nFollowing her admission into the Extendicare facility, Decedent quickly developed numerous medical complications. She died on April 3, 2012. On October 15, 2012, the Taylors, as co-executors of Decedent\u2019s estate, commenced this litigation, ultimately filing a complaint asserting wrongful death and survival claims against Extendicare, The Residence, and Jefferson Medical Center. The Taylors alleged that the combined negligence of the three defendants caused or contributed to Decedent\u2019s injuries and death.\nIn response, Extendicare filed preliminary objections in the nature of a motion to compel arbitration of the Taylors\u2019 wrongful death and survival claims, arguing that both claims should be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the ADR Agreement. In support of its motion, Extendicare asserted that the Taylors\u2019 wrongful death claim was derivative of the survival claim and, because the survival claim was within the scope of the ADR Agreement, both claims must be submitted to arbitration.\nOn November 20, 2013, the trial court heard oral argument on Extendicare\u2019s motion. Although Extendicare maintained that the ADR Agreement required the court to compel arbitration of both of the Taylors\u2019 claims against it, Extendicare conceded that the Superior Court recently had held that an arbitration agreement signed only by a decedent did not bind the decedent\u2019s wrongful death beneficiaries. See Pisano v. Extendicare Homes, Inc., 77 A.3d 651, 660-61 (Pa. Super. 2013). Shifting its litigation strategy to account for Pisano, Extendicare requested for the first time the bifurcation of the Taylors\u2019 two causes of action against it, and an order compelling arbitration just of the survival claim, while the wrongful death claim remained pending for judicial resolution.\nFollowing argument, the trial court overruled Extendicare\u2019s preliminary objections. It agreed with Extendicare and the Taylors that, in accord with Pisano, the Taylors could not be compelled to arbitrate their wrongful death claim against Extendicare because they, as wrongful death beneficiaries, were not parties to the ADR Agreement. Trial Ct. Op., 1/29/2014, at 3; see Pisano, 77 A.3d at 660-61 (holding that because wrongful death actions are not derivative of the decedent\u2019s rights, the wrongful death beneficiaries were not bound by an arbitration agreement executed by the decedent); see also E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House, 534 U.S. 279, 293, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (2002) (holding that, notwithstanding the federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, the FAA does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so).\nThe trial court also refused Extendicare\u2019s request to sever the survival action from the wrongful death action in order to send the former to arbitration. The trial court explained that it found no authority within the FAA to support severance. To the contrary, the trial court opined that severance would not advance the purpose of the FAA, which, it explained, was \u201cto ease the burden of litigation on the parties and this Court\u2019s docket.\u201d Trial Ct. Op., 1/29/2014, at 3-4 (citing Joseph Muller Corp. Zurich v. Commonwealth Petrochem., Inc., 334 F.Supp. 1013, 1019 (S.D.N.Y. 1971)). Examining Rule 213(e) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, the trial court held that it was required to consolidate for trial the wrongful death and survival actions. Pa.R.C.P. 213(e).\nExtendicare appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed. Taylor v. Extendicare Health Facilities, Inc., 113 A.3d 317 (Pa. Super. 2015). The Superior Court rejected Extendi-care\u2019s argument that the Taylors\u2019 wrongful death action is dependent upon the rights that Decedent possessed before she died, and that the wrongful death and survival claims together must be submitted to arbitration. The court relied upon Pisano to hold that \u201can arbitration agreement signed by the decedent or his or her authorized representative is not binding upon non-signatory wrongful death beneficiaries, and they cannot be compelled to litigate their claims in arbitration.\u201d Taylor, 113 A.3d at 320-21.\nTurning to Extendicare\u2019s alternative argument that the trial court should have bifurcated the two claims and compelled arbitration of the survival action pursuant to the ADR Agreement, the Superior Court recognized that this was an issue of first impression in Pennsylvania. The court relied upon Rule 213(e) to hold that the wrongful death and survival actions could not be bifurcated, but must be consolidated for trial. The Superior Court explained that the General Assembly had considered the overlap between wrongful death and survival actions, as well as the potential for duplicative awards, and made the legislative policy decision to require consolidation. Taylor, 113 A.3d at 322 (citing the Wrongful Death Statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301(a)). The Superior Court recognized that Rule 213(e) implemented this policy decision by detailing how and where such claims must be consolidated. Taylor, 113 A.3d at 325.\nAttempting to avoid consolidation, Extendicare relied upon the FAA, which was \u201cintended to foreclose state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.\u201d Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 3, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984). Extendicare argued that the FAA preempted Rule 213(e), and relied upon Marmet Health Care Ctr., Inc, v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 132 S.Ct. 1201, 182 L.Ed.2d 42 (2012) for support. In Marmet, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the FAA preempted a state law which precluded the enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements in nursing home disputes involving personal injury or death. See id. at 1204 (observing that West Virginia\u2019s prohibition was \u201ca categorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim,\u201d and therefore was contrary to the requirements of the FAA). According to Extendicare, the FAA likewise preempted Rule 213(e) to the extent that the rule purported or operated to bar the arbitration of a claim otherwise subject to an arbitration agreement.\nEngaging in a conflict preemption analysis, the only form of preemption implicated in this case, the Superior Court disagreed with Extendicare. According to the court, Rule 213(e) did not prohibit the arbitration of wrongful death and survival claims, rendering this case distinct from the categorical prohibition struck down in Marmet. Rather, the Superior Court viewed the procedural rule as \u201cneutral regarding arbitration generally, and the arbitration of wrongful death and survival actions specifically.\u201d Taylor, 113 A.3d at 325. The Superior Court further observed that wrongful death and survival actions may proceed together in arbitration when all of the parties, including the wrongful death beneficiaries, have agreed to arbitration. Id.\nIn this case, however, the Superior Court found no agreement to arbitrate the wrongful death claim, or to arbitrate the survival actions against The Residence or Jefferson Medical Center. Id. at 326. Rather, the court observed, the only claim subject to an agreement to arbitrate is the Taylors\u2019 survival claim against Extendicare. Id. The court observed that the piecemeal disposition Extendicare sought involved \u201cwholly redundant proceedings with a potential for inconsistent verdicts and duplicative damages.\u201d Id. The Superior Court held that the wrongful death beneficiaries\u2019 constitutional right to a jury trial and the state\u2019s interest in litigating wrongful death and survival actions in one proceeding required that all claims proceed in court. Id. at 328. The court viewed its holding as consistent with one of the primary objectives of arbitration, i.e., \u201cto achieve streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,\u201d id. (citing AT & T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 346, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011)), and affirmed the trial court order overruling Extendicare\u2019s preliminary objection seeking to compel arbitration.\nExtendicare sought discretionary review in this Court. We granted review as to the following issues:\nDoes the Superior Court\u2019s decision, which refused to compel arbitration of the arbitrable survival claim, violate the [FAA] requirement that arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable[,] and enforceable[,] save upon [such] grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u201d?\nDoes the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that [Pa.R.C.P. 213(e)] require[s] the consolidation of the otherwise arbitrable survival action with the non-arbitrable wrongful death action on grounds of efficiency violate the [FAA] as it has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court which has consistently ruled that arbitration is required when there is an agreement to arbitrate even when compelling arbitration results in duplication and piecemeal litigation?\nTaylor v. Extendicare Health Facilities, Inc., 632 Pa. 653, 122 A.3d 1036, 1037 (2015) (per curiam). Because these are questions of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. See Wert v. Manorcare of Carlisle Pa., 633 Pa. 260, 124 A.3d 1248 (2015).\nExtendicare concedes that, pursuant to Pisano, the Taylors\u2019 wrongful death claim must be litigated in the trial court. Extendicare contests only the trial court\u2019s refusal to sever the arbitrable survival claim from the non-arbitrable wrongful death claim. Relying upon the FAA\u2019s directive that arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, Extendicare argues that the United States Supreme Court has interpreted this language as expressing a national policy favoring arbitration that preempts any state law that stands in the way of an agreement to arbitrate.\nExtendicare criticizes the Superior Court for premising its decision upon notions of expediency and efficiency. In this respect, Extendicare relies upon a line of cases establishing that the FAA\u2019s pro-arbitration mandate trumps litigation efficiency. See KPMG LLP v. Cocchi, 565 U.S. 18, 132 S.Ct. 23, 26, 181 L.Ed.2d 323 (2011) (\u201c[W]hen a complaint contains both arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims, the [FAA] requires courts to \u2018compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.\u2019 \u201d (internal citation omitted)); Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 218, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985) (\u201c[T]he [FAA] requires district courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbi-trable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.\u201d); Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 20, 108 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (\u201c[The FAA] requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement.\u201d).\nExtendicare observes that state and federal court decisions in Pennsylvania currently differ regarding the issue presented herein. While the Superior Court in this case relied upon Rule 213(e) to refuse to compel arbitration of an arbitrable claim, the federal courts sitting in Pennsylvania uniformly have rejected Taylor or its rationale. According to these federal courts, whenever Rule 213(e) would prevent the operation of a valid arbitration agreement by prohibiting the bifurcation of an arbitrable survival claim from a non-arbitrable wrongful death claim, it is preempted by the FAA.\nIn response, the Taylors argue that the trial court\u2019s and Superior Court\u2019s rulings are not contrary to the FAA or any controlling authority. According to the Taylors, the FAA preempts only state laws or rules that expressly prohibit certain arbitration proceedings. See, e.g., Marmet, 132 S.Ct. 1201; Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.S. 483, 491, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426 (1987). The Taylors argue that Rule 213(e), conversely, is arbitration-neutral. Because the rule does not target arbitration, the Taylors perceive no conflict between the rule and the FAA for purposes of preemption. Indeed, the Taylors echo the Superior Court by asserting that Rule 213(e) is only implicated in this case because Extendicare failed to procure signatures from the wrongful death beneficiaries. According to the Taylors, had Extendicare obtained the appropriate signatures on the ADR Agreement, both the survival and wrongful death claims would be subject to arbitration.\nThe Taylors also advance alternative arguments that the ADR agreement is unenforceable under state law for reasons that include mistake, lack of consideration, impracticability, frustration of purpose, and unconscionability. Recognizing that the lower courts did not consider these arguments, the Taylors urge this Court either to address them or to remand them to the trial court for resolution.\nWith these arguments in mind, we begin our analysis by reviewing federal preemption doctrine, which springs from the Supremacy Clause. Federal law is paramount, and state laws that conflict with federal law are \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Dooner v. DiDonato, 601 Pa. 209, 971 A.2d 1187, 1193 (2009) (quoting Altria Group, Inc. v. Stephanie Good, 555 U.S. 70, 76, 129 S.Ct. 538, 172 L.Ed.2d 398 (2008)). Although federal preemption of state laws may be found in any of three ways, see supra, n.6; Stone Crushed P\u2019ship v. Kassab Archbold Jackson & O\u2019Brien, 589 Pa. 296, 908 A.2d 875, 881 (2006), Extendicare advocates solely for a finding of conflict preemption. See Volt Info. Set., Inc. v. Bd. of Tr. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 477, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989) (\u201cThe FAA contains no express pre-emptive provision, nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.\u201d). Conflict preemption typically arises where compliance with both federal and state law is impossible, or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of the United States Congress. Holt\u2019s Cigar Co. v. City of Philadelphia, 608 Pa. 146, 10 A.3d 902, 918 n.4 (2011); see Volt, 489 U.S. at 477, 109 S.Ct. 1248.\nTurning first to the relevant state law, Rule 213(e) is a rule of compulsory joinder, providing that wrongful death and survival actions \u201cmay be enforced in one action, but if independent actions are commenced they shall be consolidated for trial.\u201d Pa.R.C.P. 213(e). If independent actions are filed or pending in the same court, or are commenced in different courts, the trial courts \u201cshall\u201d order them to be consolidated. Id. This procedural rule facially addresses scenarios where the litigants seek to resolve survival and wrongful death claims in court, mandates a single judicial action, and expresses the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in the efficient judicial resolution of survival and wrongful death claims and the avoidance of duplicative recoveries. See Pezzulli v. D\u2019Ambrosia, 344 Pa. 643, 26 A.2d 659, 662 (1942) (\u201c[Tjhere is an important limitation on the right to bring actions under both the death acts and the survival statute, namely, that it must not work a duplication of damages.\u201d). Rule 213(e) is silent regarding arbitration, because it does not contemplate the scenario where one claim that is subject to compulsory joinder is also subject to arbitration due to the contractual agreement of the parties.\nThe FAA is in tension with Rule 213(e). It is neither exaggeration nor hyperbole to characterize the rise of arbitration over the last century as revolutionizing the rule of law and access to justice. Prior to the 1925 enactment of the FAA, courts across the country disparaged arbitration as a renegade form of adjudication, and refused to enforce private arbitration agreements. See Thomas E. Carbonneau, The Revolution in Law Through Arbitration, 56 Clev. St. L. Rev. 233, 244 (2008); see also Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 270-71, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995) (discussing the historical background of the FAA); Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 24, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991) (same). During this time, when arbitration occurred primarily in the commercial context between businesses of equal bargaining power, see Margaret M. Harding, The Clash Between Federal and State Arbitration Law and the Appropriateness of Arbitration As A Dispute Resolution Process, 77 Neb. L. Rev. 397, 400 (1998), the business interests that favored the enforcement of private arbitration agreements began to lobby state governments and Congress for legislation compelling the courts to enforce their bargains. Michael G. McGuinness & Adam J. Karr, California\u2019s \u201cUnique\u201d Approach to Arbitration: Why This Road Less Traveled Will Make All the Difference on the Issue of Preemption Under the Federal Arbitration Act, 2005 J. Disp. Resol. 61, 63 (2005). Congress answered the call by enacting the FAA, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14, in 1925 as modest legislation to rehabilitate arbitration, Carbonneau, The Revolution, 56 Clev. St. L. Rev. at 245, and to \u201creverse centuries of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements by placing them on equal footing with other contracts.\u201d Shearson/Am. Express v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 225-26, 107 S.Ct. 2332, 96 L.Ed.2d 185 (1987).\nThe FAA was intended by Congress \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d to ensure judicial enforcement of arbitration agreements into which parties had entered. Dean Witter, 470 U.S. at 220, 105 S.Ct. 1238. Although Congress was not \u201cblind to the potential benefit of [the FAA] for expedited resolution of disputes,\u201d id. at 219, 105 S.Ct. 1238, the Supreme Court has rejected \u201cthe suggestion that the overriding goal of the [FAA] was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims.\u201d Id To address its preeminent concern, Section 2 of the FAA makes arbitration agreements \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The text of this section not only embodies Congress\u2019 intent to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced like any other contract, but also includes the FAA\u2019s so-called \u201csavings clause,\u201d by which courts may refuse to enforce agreements to arbitrate under state laws that \u201carose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\u201d Perry, 482 U.S. at 492 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2520.\nOriginally, the FAA was perceived to be a procedural statute applicable only in federal courts. See Lyra Haas, The Endless Battleground: California\u2019s Continued Opposition to the Supreme Court\u2019s Federal Arbitration Act Jurisprudence, 94 B. U. L. Rev. 1419, 1424 (2014). From these humble origins, however, the FAA has evolved through the Supreme Court\u2019s application of conflict preemption into what one commentator has characterized as \u201ca redefinition of civil justice, a modification of the Bill of Rights, and the implicit emendation of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d Carbonneau, The Revolution, 56 Clev. St. L. Rev. at 246. According to some, the Supreme Court has interpreted the FAA as a \u201cpreemption juggernaut,\u201d Lisa Tripp & Evan R. Hanson, AT & T v. Concepcion: The Problem of A False Majority, 23 Kan. J. L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y 1, Fall 2013, defining the contours of the FAA to eradicate any state law that \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d of the FAA. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 352, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (citing Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)); McGuinness & Karr, California\u2019s \u201cUnique\u201d Approach, 2005 J. Disp. Resol, at 65 (\u201cThe Court has broadly interpreted the FAA provisions that direct courts to enforce arbitration agreements, while narrowly construing those provisions that limit the reach of the FAA\u201d.). *\nBeginning with Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967), the Supreme Court established the doctrinal underpinnings for transforming the FAA into a \u201cpreemption juggernaut\u201d by holding that federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction were obligated to apply the FAA. Tripp & Hanson, AT & T v. Concepcion: The Problem of A False Majority, 23 Kan. J. L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y, at 1. Twenty years later, in Moses H. Cone, the Court relied upon the Supremacy Clause to hold that the FAA established \u201ca body of federal substantive law of arbitrability.\u201d 460 U.S. at 24, 103 S.Ct. 927. Shortly thereafter, the Court held that state and federal courts are bound by the FAA, and that Congress intended to preclude state attempts to undermine the enforceability of arbitration agreements. Southland, 465 U.S. at 10, 104 S.Ct. 852 (\u201c[i]n enacting \u00a7 2 of the [FAA], Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration. ... \u201d); see Mitsubishi Motors Corp, v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985) (stating that the question of whether claims are arbitrable must be decided with a \u201chealthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration\u201d).\nSince federalizing arbitration in Southland, the Supreme Court has continued to reaffirm its commitment to arbitration by striking down conflicting state laws. In much of its FAA preemption jurisprudence pre-dating Concepcion, the Supreme Court appeared to hold that it was only when a state law expressed an anti-arbitration policy that it was preempted by the FAA. For example, in Doctor\u2019s Assoc., Inc, y, Casarot-to, the Court held that the FAA preempted a state statute that conditioned the enforceability of an arbitration clause upon a specific notice requirement. 517 U.S. 681, 688, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996) (explaining that the national policies embodied in the FAA are \u201cantithetical to threshold limitations placed specifically and solely on arbitration provisions\u201d). Casarotto clarified that, although states generally may regulate contracts, they may not decline to enforce arbitration agreements solely because they are arbitration agreements.\nBy striking down state laws targeting arbitration agreements, the Supreme Court has limited the role of state courts to regulating contracts to arbitrate under general contract law principles in accord with the savings clause, under which it has held that only \u201cgenerally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening \u00a7 2.\u201d Casarotto, 517 U.S. at 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652; see Allied-Bruce, 513 U.S. at 281, 115 S.Ct. 834; Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 483-84, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989); Shearson/Am. Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 226, 107 S.Ct. 2332, 96 L.Ed.2d 185 (1987); Perry, 482 U.S. at 492 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2520 (explaining that \u201c[sjtate law, whether of legislative or judicial origin, is applicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally\u201d). These cases instruct that courts are obligated to enforce arbitration agreements as they would enforce any other contract, in accordance with their terms, and may not single out arbitration agreements for disparate treatment.\nBut the prerogatives of state courts to regulate arbitration agreements even in accord with generally applicable contract defenses such as unconscionability have been called into question. Indeed, in recent years the Supreme Court\u2019s preemption juggernaut has gathered momentum. In Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 131 S.Ct. 1740, the Court held that the FAA preempted California\u2019s common-law rule of unconscionability (the \u201cDiscover Bank Rule\u201d), which it viewed as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of the FAA. In Discover Bank v. Superior Court, 36 Cal.4th 148, 30 Cal.Rptr.3d 76, 113 P.3d 1100 (2005), the California Supreme Court had applied the California Code, which allowed courts to refuse to enforce any contract found to be unconscionable at the time it was made, to conclude that class action waivers are unconscionable and void under certain circumstances. The Discover Bank rule was facially neutral, and applied to class action waivers in arbitration as well as litigation.\nThe Concepcions had responded to an advertisement by AT & T for a free phone, and had entered into an agreement for the sale and servicing of the phone. When they were billed $30.22 in sales tax based upon the phone\u2019s retail value, they attempted to sue AT & T in federal court. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 336-37, 131 S.Ct. 1740. Their action later was consolidated with a putative class action alleging that AT & T had engaged in false advertising and fraud. Id. at 337, 131 S.Ct. 1740. However, the Concepcions and other members of the class were met with AT & T\u2019s attempt to compel arbitration under the contract. Id. The Concepcions opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawful under the Discover Bank Rule because it disallowed class actions. H. at 338, 131 S.Ct. 1740. The district court denied AT & T\u2019s motion, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed pursuant to the Discover Bank Rule, which it held was not preempted by the FAA. Id.\nIn a 5-4 decision authored by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the United States Supreme Court reversed. The Court held that the FAA\u2019s savings clause did not protect the Discover Bank Rule from preemption. According to the Court, \u201c[w]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.\u201d Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 341, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (citing Preston v, Ferrer, 552 U.S. 346, 353, 128 S.Ct. 978, 169 L.Ed.2d 917 (2008)). The inquiry is more complex, however, when a generally applicable doctrine, such as unconscionability, is alleged to have been applied in a manner hostile to arbitration. Id. The Supreme Court reiterated that a court may not \u201crely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would enable the court to effect what ... the state legislature cannot.\u201d Id. at 341, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (citing Perry, 482 U.S. at 493 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2520). Although the FAA, through Section 2\u2019s savings clause, preserves generally applicable contract defenses, the Court held that it did not suggest \u201can intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s objectives.\u201d Id. at 343, 131 S.Ct. 1740. In this respect, the Court held that the Discover Bank Rule, by requiring the availability of class-wide arbitration, interfered with the \u201cfundamental attributes of arbitration\u201d and therefore was \u201can obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u201d in enacting the FAA. Id. at 344, 352, 131 S.Ct. 1740.\nThe Supreme Court defined the \u201cfundamental attributes of arbitration\u201d as \u201clower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.\u201d Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 348, 131 S.Ct. 1740. The Court further defined the \u201coverarching purpose\u201d of the FAA as twofold: to ensure \u201cthe enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms,\u201d and \u201cto facilitate streamlined proceedings.\u201d Id. at 344, 131 S.Ct. 1740. In Concepcion, the majority found that these two goals did not conflict. Id. at 345, 131 S.Ct. 1740. Acknowledging that the state rule was arbitration-neutral, the Court focused upon the rule\u2019s practical effect rather than its text. The rule\u2019s application, according to the Court, interfered with the fundamental attributes of arbitration, and thus was preempted. Id. at 344, 131 S.Ct. 1740. In reaching this conclusion, the majority rejected the argument that class-arbitration waivers shield corporations from numerous, low-value claims, which can either be brought as a class action or not at all, explaining that \u201c[sjtates cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.\u201d Id. at 351, 131 S.Ct. 1740.\nJustice Clarence Thomas concurred, providing the fifth vote for the Supreme Court\u2019s preemption holding, based not upon the purposes and objectives of the FAA, but upon a textual analysis of the statute. In Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion, the savings clause, by referring to \u201crevocation,\u201d suggested that it applied only to defenses that relate to the formation of the contract, rather than to general contract defenses. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 354, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (Thomas, J., concurring). For Justice Thomas, the only question presented in Concepcion was whether the Discover Bank Rule pertained to the making of a contract. Id. at 356, 131 S.Ct. 1740. Because the Discover Bank Rule was premised upon public policy, rather than a defense related to contract formation, Justice Thomas did not believe it was a ground for revocation under Section 2\u2019s savings clause. Id. at 356-57, 131 S.Ct. 1740.\nConcepcion is relevant to our analysis not only because it limited application of state law under the savings clause, but also because it defined the \u201coverarching purpose\u201d of the FAA as twofold: to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms, and to facilitate streamlined proceedings. Although the Court held that the arbitration agreements at issue in Concepcion could be enforced according to their terms, and that doing so would facilitate streamlined proceedings, when these two purposes conflict, the Court has mandated that enforcement trumps efficiency.\nIn Moses H. Cone, for example, the hospital plaintiff in a state court proceeding, who resisted arbitration, filed claims against two defendants. 460 U.S. at 5, 103 S.Ct. 927. The claims against one defendant, Mercury, were subject to an arbitration agreement. Id. Before the Supreme Court, the plaintiff argued that if it was forced to arbitrate its claims against Mercury, it would be forced to resolve its related disputes in separate forums. Id. at 19-20, 103 S.Ct. 927. The Court did not share the plaintiffs concern for avoiding piecemeal resolution of its claims:\nThat misfortune ... occurs because the relevant federal law requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement. Under the [FAA], an arbitration agreement must be enforced notwithstanding the presence of other persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement. If the dispute between Mercury and the Hospital is arbitrable under the Act, then the Hospital\u2019s two disputes will be resolved separately\u2014one in arbitration, and the other (if at all) in state-court litigation.\nId. at 20, 103 S.Ct. 927.\nSimilarly, in Dean Witter, 470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, the Court examined how to proceed in a lawsuit against a single defendant in which the plaintiff raised a non-arbitrable federal claim (premised upon federal securities law) and a pendent, arbitrable state law claim. The lower court had observed that the denial of arbitration is justified when the facts supporting all of the claims are intertwined, because arbitration could produce results that would bind the judicial forum through issue preclusion. Byrd v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 726 F.2d 552, 554 (9th Cir. 1984). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that, under such circumstances, upon the motion of one of the parties, the FAA requires district courts to compel arbitration of the arbitrable claims, \u201ceven where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.\u201d Dean Witter, 470 U.S. at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238. Examining the mandatory language of Section 2 of the FAA, the Court found that the district court had no discretion not to compel arbitration of an arbitrable claim. Id. at 218, 105 S.Ct. 1238 (quoting 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (providing that arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d)). The Court further rejected the efficiency argument that, by declining to compel arbitration, \u201cthe court avoids bifurcated proceedings and perhaps redundant efforts to litigate the same factual questions twice.\u201d Id. at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238. Rather, the Court expressly elevated Congress\u2019 intent to enforce arbitration agreements over any concern it bore for efficiency, and held that any conflict between the FAA\u2019s two goals must be resolved in favor of enforcement. Id. at 221, 105 S.Ct. 1238 (\u201cThe preeminent concern of Congress in passing the Act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered, and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate, even if the result is \u2018piecemeal\u2019 litigation, at least absent a countervailing policy manifested in another federal statute.\u201d).\nSubsequently, in KPMG, 132 S.Ct. 23, nineteen plaintiffs sued three defendants, raising, inter alia, five claims against KPMG, two of which were subject to an arbitration agreement. The state trial court refused to compel arbitration of any of the claims, and the state appellate court affirmed. Id. at 24. In a brief per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court summarily reversed. Relying upon Dean Witter, the Court held that state courts must \u201cexamine with care\u201d complaints seeking to invoke their jurisdiction to sever arbitrable from non-arbitrable claims, and \u201cmay not issue a blanket refusal to compel arbitration merely on the grounds that some of the claims could be resolved by the court without arbitration.\u201d Id.\nCollectively, Moses H. Cone, Dean Witter and KPMG instruct that the prospect of inefficient, piecemeal litigation proceeding in separate forums is no impediment to the arbitration of arbitrable claims. Indeed, where a plaintiff has multiple disputes with separate defendants arising from the same incident, and only one of those claims is subject to an arbitration agreement, the Court requires, as a matter of law, adjudication in separate forums.\nMoreover, while state courts have attempted to reconcile their state law contract defenses and public policy protections with the preemptive effect of the FAA, see, e,g., Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 342, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (recognizing that \u201cthe judicial hostility toward[] arbitration that prompted the FAA had manifested itself in \u2018a great variety' of \u2018devices and formulas\u2019 declaring arbitration against public policy\u201d), the United States Supreme Court has endeavored to compel judicial acceptance of private agreements to arbitrate. The FAA is now perceived as applying to almost every arbitration agreement, although the savings clause envisions a limited role for state law. In this respect, arbitration has come a long way from its origin as a mutually agreed-upon method of dispute resolution by two business entities of equal bargaining power, and now is employed in a variety of contracts, many of which are contracts of adhesion. As arbitration clauses proliferate, individuals will ever more broadly exchange their right to a jury trial for basic consumer products or nursing home care.\nOne of the striking consequences of the shift away from the civil justice system and toward private adjudication is that corporations are routinely stripping individuals of their constitutional right to a jury trial. See U.S. Const. amend. VII (preserving the right to a trial by jury); Pa. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 6 (same). While one\u2019s right to a jury trial may be waived, it is not at all apparent that signatories to arbitration agreements are aware that they waive their right to a jury trial upon the execution of an arbitration agreement.\nThe West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals highlighted this constitutional concern in Brown et al. v. Marmet Health Care Ctr. et al., 228 W.Va. 646, 724 S.E.2d 250 (2011). Relying in part upon the state constitution\u2019s provision of the right to a jury trial, W. Va. Const. art. Ill, \u00a7 13, the West Virginia court criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions granting the FAA sweeping preemptive effect. Brown, 724 S.E.2d at 278 (\u201cWith tendentious reasoning, the United States Supreme Court has stretched the application of the FAA from being a procedural statutory scheme effective only in the federal courts, to being a substantive law that preempts state law in both the federal and state courts.\u201d). Based upon its belief that Congress did not intend for all arbitration agreements to be governed by the FAA, the state court held that the FAA did not apply to pre-dispute agreements to arbitrate negligence claims in nursing home contracts. Id. at 291-92 (\u201c[A]s a matter of public policy under West Virginia law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission agreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence that results in personal injury or death, shall not be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concerning the negligence.\u201d).\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court was unsympathetic to the state court\u2019s concern for the right to a jury trial. In a cursory per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court reversed, and chastised the West Virginia court for \u201cmisreading and disregarding the precedents of this Court interpreting the FAA.\u201d Marmet, 132 S.Ct. at 1202. The Court held that the state\u2019s public policy rationale constituted \u201ca categorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim,\u201d which the Court held was \u201ccontrary to the terms and coverage of the FAA\u201d and, therefore, preempted. Id. at 1204; see Nitro-Lift Tech., L.L.C. v. Howard, 568 U.S. 17, 138 S.Ct. 500, 501, 184 L.Ed.2d 328 (2012) (per curiam) (invalidating a state law that required the validity of non-compete provisions in employment contracts to be resolved judicially).\nWith this Supreme Court jurisprudence in mind, and solicitous of our obligation to consider questions of arbitrability with a \u201chealthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration,\u201d Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 20, 103 S.Ct. 927, we observe that Section 2 of the FAA binds state courts to compel arbitration of claims subject to an arbitration agreement. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (providing that arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d). This directive is mandatory, requiring parties to proceed to arbitration on issues subject to a valid arbitration agreement, even if a state law would otherwise exclude it from arbitration. Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 58, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995).\nThe only exception to a state\u2019s obligation to enforce an arbitration agreement is provided by the savings clause, which permits the application of generally applicable state contract law defenses such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, to determine whether a valid contract exists. Casarotto, 517 U.S. at 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652; Volt, 489 U.S. at 476, 109 S.Ct. 1248; Perry, 482 U.S. at 492 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2520. Pursuant to the savings clause, the compulsory joinder mandate of Rule 213(e) could bar the trial court from bifurcating the Taylors\u2019 arbitrable survival action from its pending litigation in state court only if it qualifies as a generally applicable contract defense. Rule 213(e), however, is not a substantive defense, but a procedural mechanism to effectuate the state\u2019s interest in the efficient resolution of wrongful death and survival actions in one judicial forum. Thus, it does not fall within the savings clause.\nMoreover, even if Rule 213(e) was a generally applicable contract defense, it would fail the test established in Concepcion. There, the Supreme Court instructed that although the savings clause may save a state law from FAA preemption, it will not do so when a state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, when a generally applicable contract defense is applied in a manner hostile to arbitration, or when the state rule stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s objectives. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 341-43, 131 S.Ct. 1740.\nAs noted, the FAA\u2019s objectives are to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements and facilitate streamlined proceedings. Arbitration of a single claim under the facts presented herein, with multiple plaintiffs and defendants and several causes of action remaining in state court, likely will not lower costs or enhance efficiency. Therefore, the scenario that we are addressing arguably presents a conflict between the two objectives of the FAA, where enforcing the ADR Agreement between Decedent and Extendicare will satisfy the enforcement objective at the expense of efficiency. Under such circumstances, we are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s directive to favor enforcement over efficiency. See Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 20, 103 S.Ct. 927; Dean Witter, 470 U.S. at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238; KPMG, 132 S.Ct. at 24. The Supreme Court has made clear that bifurcation and piecemeal litigation is the tribute that must be paid to Congressional intent. Dean Witter, 470 U.S. at 217, 105 S.Ct. 1238.\nIn reaching this conclusion, we focus upon the application of Rule 213(e) in practice rather than upon its text or its purpose. See Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 344, 131 S.Ct. 1740. Whether one characterizes Rule 213(e) as a contract defense or as an arbitration-neutral procedural rule, it was applied in this case to defeat arbitration of the survival claim that Extendicare and Decedent (through her legal representative) agreed to submit to arbitration. Like the Discover Bank Rule that the Supreme Court held was preempted in Concepcion, the application of Rule 213(e) herein \u201cstands as an obstacle\u201d to achieving the objectives of Congress in enacting the FAA, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 352, 131 S.Ct. 1740. Thus, as applied herein, Rule 213(e) conflicts with the FAA, and is preempted.\nWe recognize that Rule 213(e) is a procedural mechanism to control case flow, and does not substantively target arbitration. However, the Supreme Court directed in Concepcion that state courts may not rely upon principles of general law when reviewing an arbitration agreement if that law undermines the enforcement of arbitration agreements. We cannot require a procedure that defeats an otherwise valid arbitration agreement, contrary to the FAA, even if it is desirable for the arbitration-neutral goal of judicial efficiency. See Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 351, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (\u201cStates cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.\u201d). Declining to bifurcate the wrongful death and survival actions against Extendicare in the interest of efficiency would nullify the ADR Agreement, a result not permitted by the Supreme Court\u2019s FAA jurisprudence.\nIn its decision that Rule 213(e) barred bifurcation, the Superior Court expressed concern for the wrongful death beneficiaries\u2019 constitutional right to a jury trial. We share the Superior Court\u2019s concern, which appears to derive from the potential preclusive effect of arbitration upon the wrongful death beneficiaries in the judicial proceedings, through application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. However, the preclusive effect of an arbitration award upon judicial proceedings is not presently before this Court. Moreover, although the appellate courts of the Commonwealth have held that \u201ca judicially confirmed private arbitration award will have collateral estoppel effect, even in favor of non-parties to the arbitration, if the arbitrator actually and necessarily decided the issue sought to be foreclosed and the party against whom estoppel is invoked had full incentive and opportunity to litigate the matter,\u201d Frog, Switch & Mfg. Co. v. Pa. Human Relations Comm\u2019n, 885 A.2d 655, 661 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005), we have not addressed this question. Notably, when the United States Supreme Court considered whether courts should resolve arbitrable pendent claims when a non-arbitrable claim is before it, in order to avoid the possible collateral estoppel effect of the arbitration proceeding in a subsequent court proceeding, the Court acknowledged that the preclusive effect of arbitration proceedings in such circumstances was not well-settled. Dean Witter, 470 U.S. at 222, 105 S.Ct. 1238 (observing that \u201c[t]he full-faith-and-credit statute requires that federal courts give the same preclusive effect to a State\u2019s judicial proceedings as would the courts of the State rendering the judgment, and since arbitration is not a judicial proceeding, ... the statute does not apply to arbitration awards\u201d); see McDonald v. W. Branch, 466 U.S. 284, 287-88, 104 S.Ct. 1799, 80 L.Ed.2d 302 (1984) (refusing to accord an arbitration ruling collateral estoppel effect because \u201carbitral factfinding is generally not equivalent to judicial factfinding\u201d); Barrentine v. Ark.Best Freight Sys., 450 U.S. 728, 101 S.Ct. 1437, 67 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981). Thus, the preclusive effect of arbitration in judicial proceedings is uncertain.\nWe sympathize with the position of the AARP as amicus curias in support of the Taylors that \u201c[t]he prevalence of abuse and neglect in nursing facilities ... make[s] it imperative that victims and their families have fair access to complementary remedial measures available through the civil justice system-particularly when the bad conduct results in the suffering and death of a vulnerable person.\u201d Amicus Curiae Brief of AARP at 4; id. at 7 (detailing the evidence of significant levels of abuse and neglect in nursing home facilities). As AARP observes, the contract formation process that attends nursing facility admission can be a crisis-driven, stress-laden event involving the superior bargaining power of one party over the other. Id. at 14-15. Indeed, nursing home defendants have reaped significant benefits from channeling medical malpractice claims into arbitration to the detriment of medical malpractice victims. We cannot, however, disregard or defy controlling precedent from the United States Supreme Court in order to redress these inequities and deficiencies. DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 463, 468, 193 L.Ed.2d 365 (2015) (observing that the \u201cSupremacy Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source\u201d); Marmet, 132 S.Ct. at 1202 (chastising the state court for misreading and disregarding controlling federal authority).\nTo the extent the Taylors have presented generally applicable contract defenses to this Court, we decline to address them at this juncture. Because of the trial court\u2019s decision not to bifurcate the Taylors\u2019 claims, and Extendicare\u2019s immediate appeal of that issue, the Taylors have not had the opportunity to present these issues in the lower courts. Nor has Extendi-care had the opportunity to respond to them. Moreover, we did not grant allowance of appeal to resolve them. Upon remand to the trial court, the parties will have the opportunity to litigate whether there is a valid and enforceable arbitration contract in accord with generally applicable contract defenses and the FAA\u2019s savings clause.\nAccordingly, we reverse the Superior Court\u2019s order affirming the trial court, and remand to the trial court for the resolution of the Taylors\u2019 outstanding issues. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice Saylor and Justices Baer and Dougherty join the opinion.\nChief Justice Saylor files a concurring opinion in which Justice Baer joins.\nJustice Donohue files a dissenting opinion in which Justice Todd joins.\n. The Superior Court has explained the distinction between survival and wrongful death causes of action as follows:\nThe survival action has its genesis in the decedent\u2019s injury, not his death. The recovery of damages stems from the rights of action possessed by the decedent at the time of death. ... In contrast, wrongful death is not the deceased's cause of action. An action for wrongful death may be brought only by specified relatives of the decedent to recover damages on their own behalf, and not as beneficiaries of the estate. ... This action is designed only to deal with the economic effect of the decedent\u2019s death upon the specified family members.\nPisano v. Extendicare Homes, Inc., 77 A.3d 651, 658-59 (Pa. Super. 2013) (quoting Frey v. Pa. Elec. Co., 414 Pa.Super. 535, 607 A.2d 796, 798 (1992)).\nIn this case, the survival action against Extendicare was brought on Decedent's behalf by the Taylors as her co-executors, while the wrongful death action against Extendicare was brought on behalf of the Taylors as the statutory wrongful death beneficiaries. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301 (providing that a wrongful death action exists only for the benefit of \u201cthe spouse, children or parents of the deceased\u201d).\n. Rule 213(e) provides as follows:\n(e) A cause of action for the wrongful death of a decedent and a cause of action for the injuries of the decedent which survives his or her death may be enforced in one action, but if independent actions are commenced they shall be consolidated for trial.\n(1) If independent actions are commenced or are pending in the same court, the court, on its own motion or the motion of any party, shall order the actions consolidated for trial.\n(2) If independent actions are commenced in different courts, the court in which the second action was commenced, on its own motion or the motion of any party, shall order the action transferred to the court in which the first action was commenced.\n(3) If an action is commenced to enforce one cause of action, the court, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may stay the action until an action is commenced to enforce the other cause of action and is consolidated therewith or until the commencement of such second action is barred by the applicable statute of limitation.\nPa.R.C.P. 213(e).\n. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7320(a)(1) (providing that an appeal may be taken from \"[a] court order denying an application to compel arbitration\u201d).\n. Neither Jefferson Medical Center nor The Residence participated in the appeal, because they were not parties to the ADR Agreement.\n. Section 8301(a) provides as follows:\n(a) General rule.\u2014An action may be brought, under procedures prescribed by general rules, to recover damages for the death of an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect or unlawful violence or negligence of another if no recovery for the same damages claimed in the wrongful death action was obtained by the injured individual during his lifetime and any prior actions for the same injuries are consolidated with the wrongful death claim so as to avoid a duplicate recovery.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301(a).\n. As the Superior Court recognized, there are several types of preemption. Express preemption is implicated when the federal law contains a provision expressly preempting state law. Pac, Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev, Comm., 461 U.S. 190, 204, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983). The second form of preemption is field preemption, where the federal statute \"reflects a Congressional intent to occupy the entire field\u201d of law. Taylor, 113 A.3d at 323 (quoting Volt Info. Sci., Inc, v. Bd. of Tr. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ,, 489 U.S. 468, 477, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989)). \"Finally, 'a state enactment will be preempted where a state law conflicts with a federal law.\u2019 \u201d Stone Crushed P'ship v.

Neither the trial court nor the Superior Court addressed the Taylors\u2019 alternative arguments against the ADR Agreement\u2019s enforcement, including mistake, lack of consideration, frustration of purpose, impracticability, and unconscionability, These arguments were raised before the trial court in response to Extendicare\u2019s request for bifurcation. Because the trial court denied Extendicare\u2019s motion to bifurcate, it was unnecessary for it to resolve these alternative arguments.\n. See, e.g., Marmet, 132 S.Ct. at 1204 (holding that \"a categorical rule\" prohibiting the arbitration of personal injury or wrongful death claims was contrary to the FAA); Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 341, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (\u2018\u2018When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: the conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.\u201d); Southland, 465 U.S. at 10, 104 S.Ct. 852 (\"In enacting \u00a7 2 of the [FAA], Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.\u201d); Moses H.

As a result, all disputes under these agreements\u2014whether they would have otherwise been brought as class or individual claims\u2014will now be shunted into the hermetically-sealed vault of private arbitration, where there is no public, transparent decision-making process, much less stare decisis, or common law development. For entire categories of cases that are ushered into this vault\u2014from consumer law, to employment law, to much of antitrust law\u2014common law doctrinal development will cease. This, quite literally, represents the end of law.\nMyriam Gil\u00edes, The Day Doctrine Died: Private Arbitration and the End of Law, 2016 U. Ill. L. Rev. 371, 372 (2016).\n.

The Discover Bank court explained the rule as follows:\n[W]hen the [class action] waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages, and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, then, at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by California law, the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party \"from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another,\u201d (Civ.Code, \u00a7 1668.) Under these circumstances, such waivers are unconscionable under California law and should not be enforced.\n30 Cal.Rptr.3d 76, 113 P.3d at 1110.\n, Justice Thomas explained that although he preferred to engage in a textual analysis of the savings clause, the parties did not develop arguments along those lines. He therefore joined the Majority opinion, but took the opportunity to explain his preferred approach. Moreover, any suggestion that Concepcion resulted in a plurality decision was put to rest in DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 463, 468, 193 L.Ed.2d 365 (2015), in which the Supreme Court, in a clear majority, applied Concepcion to set aside a California court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitration agreement. Although the Court acknowledged that Concepcion was \"a closely divided case,\u201d it held that the states were obligated to apply it. DIRECTV, 136 S.Ct. at 468 (\"The Federal Arbitration Act is a law of the United States, and Concepcion is an authoritative interpretation of that Act.

Interestingly, upon remand from the Supreme Court, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals again declared that the arbitration agreements at issue could be invalid, this time based upon common-law grounds of unconscionability, and remanded for the development of a record to assess these common-law arguments. Brown et al. v. Marmet Health Care Ctr. et al., 229 W.Va. 382, 729 S.E.2d 217, 223 (2012).\n. The Supreme Court\u2019s case law, though, provides little guidance as to what state laws might survive a preemption challenge, because it consistently has held that the FAA preempts state law. See Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 344, 131 S.Ct. 1740; Doctor's Assocs., 517 U.S. at 688, 116 S.Ct. 1652; Perry, 482 U.S. at 491-92, 107 S.Ct. 2520; and Southland, 465 U.S. at 10, 104 S.Ct. 852.\n. The dissent speculates that we have interpreted the FAA to divest wrongful death beneficiaries of their statutorily created right to bring a claim in this Commonwealth. The dissent asserts that, under our analysis, a wrongful death action based upon facts which also led to an arbitrable survival action cannot be maintained in court because the wrongful death beneficiaries will not be able to establish that \u201cany prior actions for the same injuries are consolidated with the wrongful death claim so as to avoid a duplicate recovery.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 201-02, 147 A.3d at 514 (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301(a)). This novel interpretation of Subsection 8301(a) has not been advanced by the parties in this case, is beyond the scope of our grant of review, and is not before us.\nMoreover, we differ with the dissent\u2019s reading of Subsection 8301(a). First, once there is a valid arbitration agreement, the claims that are encompassed within that agreement are transferred to a private arbitration forum for deliberation, and no longer are pending in court. There is, therefore, no legal action for the plaintiff to consolidate with the wrongful death claim. Second, once an issue has been referred to arbitration, any judicial proceeding involving that issue is stayed pending the outcome of arbitration. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7304(d). Therefore, the survival claim arbitration will be resolved before the wrongful death action can proceed in the court of common pleas. Thus, the court hearing the wrongful death action may account for any damages awarded in the survival arbitration and \"avoid duplicate recovery\u201d as required by Subsection 8301(a). Nothing in this opinion suggests a willingness to countenance duplicative damages. Finally, although the dissent, unlike the parties, has focused upon the Wrongful Death Act rather than Rule 213(e), our preemption analysis herein applies equally to the consolidation requirement of the Wrongful Death Act.\nThe dissent\u2019s interpretation of Subsection 8301(a) to bar the arbitration of a claim subject to a valid arbitration agreement is precisely the sort of obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA's objectives that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected. In the face of this controlling authority, the dissent would nonetheless permit a party to avoid a contractual agreement to arbitrate a survival action by adding a wrongful death claim under Subsection 8301(a). The dissent\u2019s novel jurisprudence would allow state legislatures to invalidate or nullify federal law simply by including a requirement that is inconsistent with arbitration as an element of a statutory cause of action by, for example, requiring all related issues to be filed in the court of common pleas. The Supreme Court of the United States repeatedly has struck down attempts by state courts to relieve parties of their obligation to arbitrate by relying upon state substantive and procedural laws. We need not like this result. It is what the Supremacy Clause commands.\n. As we have explained, collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, \"forecloses re-litigation in a later action, of an issue of fact or law which was actually litigated and which was necessary to the original judgment.\u201d Hebden v. W.C.A.B. (Bethenergy Mines, Inc.), 534 Pa. 327, 632 A.2d 1302, 1304 (1993) (quoting City of Pittsburgh v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Pittsburgh, 522 Pa. 44, 559 A.2d 896, 901 (1989)). Collateral estoppel will preclude relitigation of an issue determined in a previous action if five criteria are met:\n(1) the issue decided in the prior case is identical to the one presented in the later action; (2) there was a final adjudication on the merits; (3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party or in privity with a party in the prior case; (4) the party or person privy to the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding; and (5) the determination in the prior proceeding was essential to the judgment. Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Kiesewetter, 585 Pa. 477, 889 A.2d 47, 50-51 (2005).\n. See also Dyer v. Travelers, 392 Pa.Super. 202, 572 A.2d 762, 764 (1990); Ottaviano v. Southeastern Pa. Trans. Auth., 239 Pa.Super. 363, 361 A.2d 810, 814 (1976).\n. One academic has observed that special problems arise when arbi-tral collateral estoppel is applied in cases involving non-arbitrable claims. G. Richard Shell, Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel Effects of Commercial Arbitration, 35 UCLA L. Rev. 623, 655 (1988) (\"Even if all the requisites of collateral estoppel are met in such cases, there still remains the question of whether the findings of arbitrators ought to have preclusive, perhaps dispositive, effects on a nonarbitrable claim, i.e., a claim that the arbitrators are not permitted to hear.\u201d). Professor Shell opines that the differences between arbitration and court litigation make the rationales for applying judicial preclusion inapplicable to arbitral preclusion, particularly because of the differences in the social and institutional interests implicated, the relative modes of fact-finding utilized in each forum, and because arbitration awards are frequently unexplained and difficult to interpret. Id. at 659-60.\n. See, e.g., Myriam Gil\u00edes, Operation Arbitration: Privatizing Medical Malpractice Claims, 15 Theoretical Inquiries L. 671, 673-74 (2014) (examining studies to conclude that long-term-care facilities generally fare better in arbitration than in litigation).",

For the reasons that follow, I conclude that it is incorrect to focus the analysis on the dispensability of Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 213(e) under the pressure of the herculean FAA. Instead, the pinpoint question is whether the FAA can divest wrongful death heirs of their statutorily created right to bring a wrongful death action in this Commonwealth. Because 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8301 (the \u201cWrongful Death Act\u201d) preconditions the maintenance of heirs\u2019 claims on their joinder with any claim pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8302 (the \u201cSurvival Act\u201d), severance defeats the heirs\u2019 right to recover under the statutorily created cause of action. Although the Majority may be correct in its apocalyptic recitation of existing United States Supreme Court precedent, the FAA does not and cannot deprive a citizen of this Commonwealth of the right to pursue a cause of action.\nIf no recovery for personal injuries is obtained by an injured person during her life, Pennsylvania law allows for the bringing of two distinct actions after her death. The Pennsylvania legislature created the first of these actions by enacting what is now 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8301, authorizing certain enumerated relatives of a person killed by another\u2019s negligence to sue for damages. Tulewicz v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 529 Pa. 588, 606 A.2d 427, 431 (1992) (explaining that a wrongful death action was unknown at common law); see 42 Pa.C.S.A, \u00a7 8301. The second of these actions \u201cmerely continues in the [decedent\u2019s] personal representative the right of action which accrued to the deceased at common law because of the tort.\u201d Tulewicz, 606 A.2d at 431; see 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8302. In the case of the Wrongful Death Act, the current statute requires, in pertinent part, that the action be brought (1) \u201cunder procedures prescribed by general rules\u201d and (2) only so long as \u201cany prior actions for the same injuries are consolidated with the wrongful death claim so as to avoid a duplicate recovery.\u201d See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8301.\nWrongful Death Act damages are measured by \u201cthe pecuniary loss [the statutory relatives] have sustained as a result of the death of the decedent\u201d and include \u201cthe present value of the services the deceased would have rendered to the family, had she lived, as well as funeral and medical expenses.\u201d Kiser v. Schulte, 538 Pa. 219, 648 A.2d 1, 4 (1994). Survival Act damages are measured by the pecuniary loss sustained by the decedent, and therefore by her estate, as a result of the negligent act that caused her death. Id. They also include the decedent\u2019s pain and suffering prior to death. Id The potential for overlapping damages is obvious. In a foundational case involving a Wrongful Death Act claim and a Survival Act claim which had been consolidated and tried together, this Court emphasized that while \u201cthere is nothing novel or unusual in the law giving a right or redress to two or more persons for the infliction of a single personal injury,\u201d it is imperative that the two actions not \u201cresult in a duplication of damages.\u201d See Pezzulli v. D\u2019Ambrosia, 344 Pa. 643, 26 A.2d 659, 661 (1942).\nIndeed, in Pezzulli, we recognized that \u201cthere is an important limitation on the right\u201d to bring a wrongful death action, \u201cnamely, that it must not work a duplication of damages\u201d where a survival action is also brought. Id. at 662. We determined that \u201cwhenever [these] two actions are brought ... they must be consolidated and tried together.\u201d Id Accordingly, we directed the promulgation of Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 213(e) which reiterates and implements the aforementioned requirement, pursuant to Pezzulli and apparent on the face of the current Wrongful Death Act, that \u201cif independent wrongful death and survival actions are commenced, they must be consolidated for trial.\u201d Tulewicz, 606 A.2d at 431 (emphasis in original); Pezzulli v. D\u2019Ambrosia, 26 A.2d at 662. As Appellees argue, \u201cthe mandatory consolidation and joint trial of wrongful death and survival actions in Pennsylvania has not only been an unshakeable procedural rule for the better part of a century,\u201d but is also a requirement of the cause of action codified at Section 8301. See Appellees\u2019 Brief at 33. It is incorrect to label the consolidation requirement embedded in the Wrongful Death Act (as implemented in Rule 213(e)) as a procedure to promote judicial efficiency. The mandate is a substantive requirement imposed by the legislature to prevent a duplication of damages as a result of the statutorily created cause of action.\nAs a general and indisputable proposition, in order to maintain a cause of action, a plaintiff must comply with the dictates of the statute setting forth his right to sue. Cf. Frazier v. Oil Chem. Co., 407 Pa. 78, 179 A.2d 202, 204-05 (1962) (acknowledging that the right to sue under the Wrongful Death Act is cabined by the terms granted by the legislature, because no such right existed at common law); accord Rich v. Keyser, 54 Pa. 86, 90 (1867) (explaining that for a landlord \u201cto obtain the statutory remedy [of possession], performance of the statutory conditions is necessary, and hence the three months\u2019 notice. And as it is a necessity that grows out of the statute it must be regulated by the very terms of the statute\u201d). Yet in holding that the FAA preempts Rule 213(e)\u2014because the Rule \u201cwas applied in this case to defeat arbitration of the survival claim\u201d and therefore \u201cstands as an obstacle to achieving the objectives of Congress in enacting the FAA, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court\u201d\u2014the Majority makes it impossible for the wrongful death beneficiaries to comply with a core statutory condition, i.e. the consolidation requirement, and effectively deprives them of their cause of action. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8301; Tulewicz, 606 A.2d at 431; Pezzulli, 26 A.2d at 662. This result is absurd.\nI do not dispute that United States Supreme Court precedent mandates FAA preemption with respect to \u201cstate substantive or procedural policies\u201d that disfavor arbitration. See Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp, 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). And I do not dispute that the FAA pre-empts \u201cstate laws which require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration,\u201d see Volt Info. Seis., Inc, v. Bd. of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 478-79, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989) (citing Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984)), or which stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s objectives. See AT & T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 343, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011) (holding that FAA preempted California\u2019s common law unconscionability rule). But Rule 213(e) does none of these things. To the extent it is procedural at all, see Majority Op. at 180, 195-96, 147 A.3d at 500, 510, Rule 213(e) is procedural in name only. In substance, it is a surrogate for the Wrongful Death Act, a cause of action through which the legislature chose to vest a legal right in certain statutory relatives to bring suit, but only so long as their action is consolidated with any survival action that has also been initiated. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8301; see also Pezzulli, 26 A.2d at 662.\nTo my knowledge, the United States Supreme Court has never concluded that the FAA is powerful enough to deprive a state court plaintiff of the substantive right to bring a statutory cause of action, nor would it. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that a statutory cause of action is a property right protected by the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles Et Commerciales, S. A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 209, 78 S.Ct. 1087, 2 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1958) (reading a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure in light of the \u201cproperty\u201d protections of the Due Process Clause and concluding that there are \u201cconstitutional limitations upon the power of courts ... to dismiss an action without affording a party the opportunity for a hearing on the merits of his cause\u201d); Martinez v. State of Cal, 444 U.S. 277, 281-82, 100 S.Ct. 553, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980) (acknowledging the likelihood that a state\u2019s statutorily created cause of action for wrongful death is a constitutionally protected \u201cspecies of \u2018property\u2019 \u201d); Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 428, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982) (recognizing that \u201ca cause of action is a species of property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause\u201d); Tulsa Profl Collection Servs. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 485, 108 S.Ct. 1340, 99 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988) (noting, in reference to a cause of action for an unpaid bill, that \u201c[l]ittle doubt remains that such an intangible interest is property-protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d). Accordingly, I would hold that the FAA does not, indeed cannot, preempt Rule 213(e). The Majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary amounts to an unconstitutional deprivation of the wrongful death beneficiaries\u2019 property rights.\nIn addition, it bears noting that the law is clear that when a party agrees to arbitrate a statutory claim, it \u201cdoes not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral ... forum.\u201d Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U.S. 346, 359, 128 S.Ct. 978, 169 L.Ed.2d 917 (2008). The Majority, in an overzealous effort to give the FAA its due force, instead produces this patently improper outcome, i.e., that the wrongful death beneficiaries, who did not agree to arbitrate at all, are themselves forced to forgo a substantive right, because, absent joinder with the survival action, their claim for wrongful death cannot be maintained.\nFinally, in the alternative, I would conclude that even if Rule 213(e) is preempted, bifurcation of the Wrongful Death Act claims and the Survival Act claims is unwarranted. Absent Rule 213(e), the Wrongful Death Act\u2019s consolidation requirement would remain intact on the face of Section 8301. As there is simply no support in the FAA preemption cases to conclude that the federal policy favoring arbitration agreements can supplant a statutory cause of action, consolidation of the claims in a single judicial proceeding should nonetheless be ordered.\nI respectfully dissent.\nJustice Todd joins this dissenting opinion.\n. Section 8301 provides, in relevant part:\n(a) General rule\u2014An action may be brought, under procedures prescribed by general rules, to recover damages for the death of an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect or unlawful violence or negligence of another if no recovery for the same damages claimed in the wrongful death action was obtained by the injured individual during his lifetime and any prior actions for the same injuries are consolidated with the wrongful death claim so as to avoid duplicate recovery.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8301. The Editors\u2019 Notes provide that Section 8301 is \u201csubstantially a reenactment of act of April 15, 1851 (P.L. 669), \u00a7 19 (12 P.S. \u00a7 1601), act of April 26, 1855 (P.L. 309), \u00a7 1 (12 P.S. \u00a7 1602) and act of May 13, 1927 (P.L. 992)(No. 480), \u00a7 1 (12 P.S. \u00a7 1604).\u201d\n. Pa.RX.P. 213 provides:\n(e) A cause of action for the wrongful death of a decedent and a cause of action for the injuries of the decedent which survives his or her death may be enforced in one action, but if independent actions are commenced they shall be consolidated for trial.\n(1) If independent actions are commenced or are pending in the same court, the court, on its own motion or the motion of any party, shall order the actions consolidated for trial.\n(2) If independent actions are commenced in different courts, the court in which the second action was commenced, on its own motion or the motion of any party, shall order the action transferred to the court in which the first action was commenced.\n(3) If an action is commenced to enforce one cause of action, the court, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may stay the action until an action is commenced to enforce the other cause of action and is consolidated therewith or until the commencement of such second action is barred by the applicable statute of limitation.\nPa.R.C.P. 213 (amended on October 1, 1942, just six months after our decision in Pezzulli, to add paragraph (e)).\nThis Court\u2019s power to promulgate rules of procedure is derived from Article V, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution which provides, in relevant part, that \"the Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts, if such rules are consistent with this Constitution and neither abridge, enlarge nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant, nor affect the right of the General Assembly to determine the jurisdiction of any court or justice of the peace, nor suspend nor alter any statute of limitation or repose.\u201d Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10.\n. The Majority states that both parties \"have, at this juncture, confined their arguments solely to the application of Rule 213(e).\u201d Majority Op. at 180 n. 11, 147 A.3d at 500 n. 11. This is incorrect. As noted, supra, Appellees explicitly posit that both Rule 213(e) and the Wrongful Death Act require consolidation and argue that the Superior Court\u2019s decision, which also discussed both the rule and the statute, does not offend the Federal Arbitration Act. See Appellees\u2019 Brief at 18, 33. As Appellees point out, only Appellants have confined their arguments solely to the application of Rule 213(e): \"despite the Superior Court\u2019s reliance upon both procedural and statutory law, [Appellants] completely ignore the Wrongful Death Act\u2019s application to this case. See Taylor v. Bxtendicare Health Facilities, Inc., 113 A.3d 317, 322 (Pa. Super. 2015). Accordingly, they have waived any argument regarding the same.\u201d Id. at n. 26.\n. The Due Process Clause, found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, establishes that \"[n]o person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d See 10 U.S. Const, amend. V; see id. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 (\"[N]o state shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d). The Pennsylvania Constitution additionally provides that \"[a]ll courts shall be open; and every man for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\u201d Pa. Const, art. I, \u00a7 11.",
