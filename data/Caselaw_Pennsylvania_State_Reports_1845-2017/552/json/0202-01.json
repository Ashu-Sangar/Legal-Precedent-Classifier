The September 29, 1995 order was a denial of Appellant\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion for Relief,\u201d filed that same day. Appellant\u2019s pro se notice of appeal should have been construed as an appeal from the order denying the \u201cEmergency Motion for Relief,\u201d in which case it was timely filed and should not have been quashed as untimely by the Superior Court.\nThe order of the Superior Court, dated January 11, 1996, is vacated. This case is remanded to the Superior Court for consideration of the appeal on the merits.",
