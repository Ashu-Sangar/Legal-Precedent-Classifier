        "text": "OPINION\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nAppellant American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (American Express) asks this Court to decide whether certain of its money orders are negotiable instruments pursuant to the Pennsylvania version of the Uniform Commercial Code, 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101, et seq., (Commercial Code) and if they are, whether appellee Robert J. Triffin (Triffin) has the rights of a holder in due course who may recover the face value of those money orders from American Express. We hold that the money orders in question are negotiable instruments and Triffin has the rights of a holder in due course, entitling him to recover the value of the money orders from American Express.\nFACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nAmerican Express, among other endeavors, sells money orders through its authorized agents. In a typical transaction, an agent collects an amount of cash from the purchaser, also known as the sender, equal to the face value of the money order plus a small fee. The sender receives a partially completed money order embossed with the amount of the money order and blank spaces for the sender to fill in his or her own name and address, the name of the payee and the date.\nOn an unknown date, three American Express money orders were stolen from the premises of one of its agents, Chase Savings Bank. In an apparently unrelated incident, one hundred American Express money orders were stolen while being shipped to another agent, I.W. Levin & Company. When they were stolen, all of the money orders contained the pre-printed signature of Louis Gerstner, then Chairman of American Express, but they were blank as to amount, sender, payee and date.\nOn December 11, 1990, Stacey Anne Dillabough (Dillabough) presented two American Express money orders for payment at Chuekie Enterprises, Inc. (Chuckie\u2019s), a check cashing operation in Philadelphia. The money orders were in the amounts of $550.00 and $650.00, respectively, and listed Dillabough as the payee and David W. (last name indecipherable) of 436 E. Allegheny Avenue as the sender. On February 25, 1991, Robert Lynn (Lynn) presented one American Express money order at Chuckie\u2019s in the amount of $200.00, which listed himself as payee and Michael C. Pepe as the sender. In each instance, Charles Giunta (Giunta), the owner of Chuckie\u2019s, recognized Dillabough and Lynn from their previous visits to Chuckie\u2019s. Dillabough and Lynn provided photographic identification to Giunta and properly endorsed their money orders. Giunta paid the face amounts of the money orders to Dillabough and Lynn, less his standard 2 percent fee.\nGiunta was unaware the American Express money orders that he cashed had been stolen. The two Dillabough money orders were stolen from the premises of Chase Savings Bank and the Lynn money order was stolen from the shipment to I.W. Levin and Company. After being cashed at Chuckie\u2019s, the money orders traveled the regular bank collection routes and were presented for payment at the United Bank of Grand Junction, Colorado. Because American Express had noted on its \u201cfraud log\u201d that the money orders were stolen, they were returned to Chuckie\u2019s bearing the stamp \u201cREPORTED LOST OR STOLEN \u2014 DO NOT REDEPOSIT.\u201d American Express refused to pay Chuckie\u2019s the face amounts of the money orders. Chuckie\u2019s then sold the Dillabough and Lynn money orders to Triffin, a commercial discounter. Pursuant to written agreements, Chuckie\u2019s assigned all of its right, title and interest in the money orders to Triffin.\nTriffin filed separate complaints in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (trial court) against Dillabough and American Express on July 16, 1992, and against Lynn and American Express on August 20, 1992, seeking payment of the money orders. The trial court consolidated the two actions. Triffin obtained default judgments against Dillabough and Lynn and proceeded to a non-jury trial with American Express. The trial court found that the money orders were not negotiable instruments and entered a verdict in favor of American Express. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the trial court and held that the money orders were negotiable instruments and Triffin had the status of a holder in due course, entitling him to recover the face amount of the money orders from American Express. We granted American Express\u2019 Petition for Allowance of Appeal from the Order of the Superior Court, and we now affirm.\nDISCUSSION\nWhen this Court entertains an appeal originating from a non-jury trial, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, unless those findings are not based on competent evidence. Thatcher\u2019s Drug Store v. Consolidated Supermarkets, Inc., 535 Pa. 469, 636 A.2d 156 (1994). The trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, are not binding on an appellate court because it is the appellate court\u2019s duty to determine if the trial court correctly applied the law to the facts. Id.\nI. Negotiability\nThe Superior Court has described the purpose of negotiable instruments and the Commercial Code as follows:\nA negotiable instrument is an instrument capable of transfer by endorsement or delivery. Negotiability provides a means of passing on to the transferee the rights of the holder, including the right to sue in his or her own name, and the right to take free of equities as against the assign- or/payee. [Citations omitted]. The purpose of the Commercial Code is to enhance the marketability of negotiable instruments and to allow bankers, brokers, and the general public to trade in confidence. [Citations omitted]. As a matter of sound economic policy, the Commercial Code encourages the free transfer and negotiability of commercial paper to stimulate financial interdependence.\nManor Bldg. Corp. v. Manor Complex Assocs., 435 Pa.Super. 246, 252-53, 645 A.2d 843, 846 (1994) (en bane). With these principles in mind, we turn to a discussion of the American Express money orders at issue here.\nThe threshold question is whether the money orders qualify as negotiable instruments under Division Three of the Commercial Code, 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3101, et seq., which governs negotiability. Both parties agree that if the money orders are not negotiable instruments then Triffin\u2019s claims against American Express must fail. Initially, we note that the Commercial Code does not specifically define the term \u201cmoney order\u201d, nor does it provide a descriptive list of financial documents that automatically qualify as negotiable instruments. Instead, 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104(a) sets forth the following four part test to determine if a particular document qualifies as.a negotiable instrument:\n(a) Requisites to negotiability.-Any writing to be a negotiable instrument within this division must:\n(1) be signed by the maker or drawer;\n(2) contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money and no other promise, order, obligation or power given by the maker or drawer except as authorized by this division;\n(3) be payable on demand or at a definite time; and\n(4) be payable to order or to bearer.\n13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104(a).\nThe Superior Court described the face of the money orders in question as follows:\nPrior to being stolen[,] the American Express money orders read: \u201cAMERICAN EXPRESS MONEY ORDER ... CHASE SAVINGS BANK . .. DATE (blank). PAY THE SUM OF (blank), NOT GOOD OVER $1,000, TO THE ORDER OF (blank). Louis V. Gerstner, Chairman. SENDER\u2019S NAME AND ADDRESS (blank). Issued by American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., Englewood, Colorado. Payable at United Bank of Grand Junction, Downtown, Grand Junction, Colorado.\u201d The two Dillabough instruments were in this form. The third Lynn instrument was identical, except it did not bear an authorized agent\u2019s name, e.g., Chase Savings Bank, and was not good for over $200.\nTriffin v. Dillabough, 448 Pa.Super. 72, 82, 670 A.2d 684, 689 (1996). When presented at Chuckie\u2019s, the sections for date, amount, payee and sender had been completed.\nThe first requisite of negotiability, a signature by the drawer or maker, \u201cincludes any symbol executed or adopted by a party with present intention to authenticate a writing.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1201. \u201cAuthentication may be printed, stamped or written; it may be by initials or by thumbprint... . The question always is whether the symbol was executed or adopted by the party with present intention to authenticate the writing.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1201, Comment 39. Additionally, section 3307(a)(2) states that when the effectiveness of a signature is challenged, it is presumed to be genuine or authorized unless the signer has died or become incompetent. 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3307(a)(2). Here, the drawer, American Express, affixed the pre-printed signature of Louis Gerstner, its then Chairman, to the money orders in question before forwarding them to its agents. American Express does not argue that Gerstner\u2019s signature was affixed to the money orders for any reason other than to authenticate them. Accordingly, the money orders satisfy the first requisite for negotiability.\nThe second requisite, American Express argues, is lacking because the money orders do not contain an unconditional promise or order to pay. Specifically, American Express claims that a legend it placed on the back of the money orders qualifies an otherwise unconditional order on the front directing the drawee to \u201cPAY THE SUM OF\u201d a specified amount \u201cTO THE ORDER OF\u201d the payee. The legend provides as follows:\nIMPORTANT\nDO NOT CASH FOR STRANGERS\nTHIS MONEY ORDER WILL NOT BE PAID IF IT HAS BEEN ALTERED OR STOLEN OR IF AN ENDORSEMENT IS MISSING OR FORGED. BE SURE YOU HAVE EFFECTIVE RECOURSE AGAINST YOUR CUSTOMER.\nPAYEE\u2019S ENDORSEMENT\nAccording to American Express, this legend renders the order to pay conditional on the money order not being altered, stolen, unendorsed or forged and destroys the negotiability of the instrument.\nWe disagree. In a factually similar case, the Louisiana Court of Appeal construed a legend on the back of an American Express money order similar to the one at issue here. Hong Kong Importers, Inc. v. American Express Co., 301 So.2d 707 (La.App.1974:). The legend there stated \u201cCASH ONLY IF RECOURSE FROM ENDORSER IS AVAILABLE. IF THIS MONEY ORDER HAS NOT BEEN VALIDLY ISSUED OR HAS BEEN FRAUDULENTLY NEGOTIATED, IT WILL BE RETURNED.\u201d Id. at 708. The money order also had the following language printed on its face: \u201cKNOW YOUR ENDORSER CASH ONLY IF RECOURSE IS AVAILABLE.\u201d Id. The Louisiana Court held that the legend on the back and the language on the front did not convert the money order into a conditional promise to pay, but merely operated as a warning to the party cashing the money order to protect himself against fraud. Although Hong Kong was decided before Louisiana adopted the Uniform Commercial Code, we find its rationale to be persuasive and applicable to 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104.\nAmerican Express attempts to distinguish Hong Kong by asserting that the legend in this case is more specific because it explicitly conditions payment on the money orders not being altered, stolen, unendorsed or forged. This argument misses the point. \u201cAny writing which meets the requirements of subsection [ (a) ] and is not excluded under Section [3103] is a negotiable instrument, and all sections of this [Division] apply to it, even though it may contain additional language beyond that contemplated by this section.\u201d 13 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3104, Comment 4 (emphasis added). An otherwise unconditional order to pay that meets the section 3104 requirements is not made conditional by including implied or constructive conditions in the instrument. 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3105(a)(1). Moreover, purported conditions on an otherwise negotiable instrument, that merely reflect other provisions of the law, do not vitiate negotiability. State v. Phelps, 125 Ariz. 114, 608 P.2d 51 (1979); see also Falk\u2019s Food Basket, Inc. v. Selected Risks Ins. Co., 214 Pa.Super. 522, 257 A.2d 359 (1969); 4 William D. Hawkland & Larry Lawrence, Uniform Commercial Code Series \u00a7 3-105:03 (Clark Boardman Callaghan) (1994). Here, the alleged conditions on the back of the money orders are nothing more than a restatement of American Express\u2019 statutory defenses against payment because of alteration, 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3407, theft, 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3306(4), absence of signature, 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3401, and forgery, 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3404. Contrary to American Express\u2019 claims, expressing those statutory defenses in a legend with the conditional phrase \u201cTHIS MONEY ORDER WILL NOT BE PAID IF ...\u201d does not elevate the legend to a condition for the purposes of 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104(a) because it is merely a restatement of the defenses present in the Commercial Code. See 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104, Comment 4; Phelps. The legend is simply a warning that American Express has reserved its statutory defenses. Whether these defenses are effective against Triffin is a separate question to be answered after resolving the issue of negotiability. See 13 Pa.C.S \u00a7 3104, Comment 4. We hold, therefore, that the money orders contain an unconditional order to pay, and satisfy the second requisite of negotiability.\nThe third requisite, that the writing be payable on demand or at a definite time, and the fourth requisite, that the writing be payable to order or bearer, are clear from the face of the money orders and are not disputed by the parties. Thus, the American Express money orders qualify as negotiable instruments pursuant to 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104.\nAmerican Express contends that even if the money orders are facially negotiable, they should not be viewed as negotiable instruments because they were never issued or otherwise \u201cplaced in the stream of commerce.\u201d Issue is defined as \u201c[t]he first delivery of an instrument to a holder or a remitter.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3102. Delivery is defined as the \u201cvoluntary transfer of possession.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1201. American Express argues that because the money orders were incomplete when stolen and subsequently completed without authorization, the money orders were never delivered and it should have no liability for them.\nAuthorized completion and delivery, however, are not listed as requisites to negotiability in section 3104. 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104. Moreover, section 3115 specifically permits the enforcement of incomplete and undelivered instruments and provides as follows:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 When a paper whose contents at the time of signing show that it is intended to become an instrument is signed while still incomplete in any necessary respect it cannot be enforced until completed, but when it is completed in accordance with authority given it is effective as completed.\n(b) Unauthorized completion. \u2014 If the completion is unauthorized the rules as to material alteration apply (section \u25a08407), even though the paper was not delivered by the maker or drawer; but the burden of establishing that any completion is unauthorized is on the party so asserting.\n13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3115 (emphasis added). Section 3407 provides that the defense of unauthorized completion discharges a party from liability to any person other than a holder in due course. 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3407(a)(2); 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3407(b). \u201cA subsequent holder in due course may in all cases enforce the [negotiable] instrument according to its original tenor, and when an incomplete instrument has been completed, he may enforce it as completed.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3407(c); see also National Loan Investors, L.P. v. Martin, 488 N.W.2d 163 (Iowa 1992) (holder in due course can enforce notes completed without authorization where notes signed in blank); Virginia Capital Bank v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 231 Ya. 283, 343 S.E.2d 81 (1986) (subsequent holder in due course can enforce note as completed even though completion unauthorized). Additionally, section 3305 provides that a holder in due course takes a negotiable instrument free from the defense of nondelivery. See 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3305, Comment 3.\nWhen read together, sections 3115, 3407 and 3305 demonstrate that unauthorized completion and non-delivery do not prevent enforcement of an otherwise negotiable instrument. Instead, the three sections permit a holder in due course to enforce the undelivered instrument as completed. The Comment to section 3115 explains the rationale for this rule as follows:\nSince under this [Division] (Sections 3305 and 3407) neither non-delivery nor unauthorized completion is a defense against a holder in due course, it has always been illogical that the two together should invalidate the instrument in his hands. A holder in due course sees and takes the same paper, whether it was complete when stolen or completed afterward by the thief, and in each case he relies in good faith on the maker\u2019s signature. The loss should fall upon the party whose conduct in signing blank paper has made the fraud possible, rather than upon the innocent purchaser. The result is consistent with the theory of decisions holding the drawer of a check stolen and afterwards filled in to be estopped from setting up the non-delivery against an innocent party.\n13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3115, Comment 5; see also 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3407, Comment 4. The next question then, is whether Triffin has the rights of a holder in due course who can enforce the negotiable money orders.\nII. Triffin\u2019s Status As A Holder In Due- Course\nSection 3302(a) describes a holder in due course as follows:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 A holder in due course is a holder who takes the instrument:\n(1) for value;\n(2) in good faith; and\n(3) without notice that it is overdue or has been dishonored or of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person.\n13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3302(a). Because the trial court held that the money orders were not negotiable instruments, it never answered the question of Triffin\u2019s status as a holder in due course. Ordinarily, determining the elements of holder in due course status is a task for the trier of fact. Budget Charge Accounts, Inc. v. Mullaney, 187 Pa.Super. 190, 144 A.2d 438 (1958); Northside Bank v. Investors Acceptance Corp., 278 F.Supp. 191 (W.D.Pa.1968). In this case, however, where the facts are undisputed and conclusive, we can determine Triffin\u2019s holder in due course status as a matter of law. See UAW-CIO Local # 31 Credit Union v. Royal Ins. Co., 594 S.W.2d 276 (Mo.1980); see also Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co. v. Murphy, 369 F.Supp. 11, 13 (W.D.Pa.1974), ajfd, 517 F.2d 1398 (3d Cir.1975).\nTriffin obtained the money orders from Chuckie\u2019s pursuant to a written agreement by which Chuckie\u2019s assigned all of its right, title and interest in the money orders to Triffin. Triffin could not become a holder in due course in his own name because he had notice of American Express\u2019 defenses when he took the money orders from Chuckie\u2019s. 13 Pa.C.S \u00a7 3302(a)(3). However, Triffin could acquire the status of a holder in due course from Chuckie\u2019s through the assignment if Chuckie\u2019s was a holder in due course because a transferee acquires whatever rights the transferor had, even if the transferee is aware of the defenses to enforcement. 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3201; see also Finalco, Inc. v. Roosevelt, 235 Cal.App.3d 1301, 3 Cal.Rptr.2d 865 (1991); DH Cattle Holdings Co., v. Kuntz, 165 A.D.2d 568, 568 N.Y.S.2d 229 (1991); Great Western Bank and Trust Co. v. Pima, Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n, 149 Ariz. 364, 718 P.2d 1017 (1986). Therefore, the focus of our inquiry is whether Chuckie\u2019s was a holder in due course.\nThe parties do not dispute that Chuckie\u2019s took the money orders for value. Giunta testified that he paid Dillabough and Lynn the face value of the money orders, minus a two percent fee. Thus, section 3302(a)(1) is satisfied. The second element of section 3302(a), good faith, is defined as \u201c[h]onesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1201. The evidence established that Giunta recognized Dillabough and Lynn from previous transactions and required them to present photographic identification. Additionally, although the trial court did not discuss each element of Chuckie\u2019s holder in due course status, it did opine in a discussion of its legal conclusions on the record that Chuckie\u2019s acted in good faith. Notes of Testimony, September 14, 1994 at 115-16. Moreover, American Express does not argue that Chuckie\u2019s failed to act in good faith. Based on Giunta\u2019s actions, we cannot say that the trial court erred in concluding that Chuckie\u2019s acted in good faith. Therefore, section 3302(a)(2) is satisfied. Regarding section 3302(a)(3), there was no evidence presented that Chuckie\u2019s had any notice that the Dillabough and Lynn money orders were stolen when he cashed them. Accordingly, the record demonstrates as a matter of law that Chuckie\u2019s was a holder in due course. Because Triffin stands in Chuckie\u2019s shoes as its assignee, Triffin has attained the status of a holder in due course. 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3201.\nAmerican Express further contends that even if Triffin qualifies as a holder in due course, the money orders are still not enforceable because the legend on their backs limits the \u201ctenor\u201d of the instruments. Pursuant to 13 Pa.C.S \u00a7 3413(a), American Express claims that it is only obligated to pay an instrument \u201caccording to its tenor.\u201d The 1979 Commercial Code does not define \u201ctenor.\u201d The 1992 amendments to section 3413(a), however, substitute the word \u201cterms\u201d for the word \u201ctenor.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3413(a) (1992). The Comments accompanying the 1992 amendments to section 3413 indicate that new subsection (a) is consistent with its predecessor. Therefore, it appears that no substantive change was intended by the substitution of the word \u201cterms\u201d for the word \u201ctenor\u201d and we will treat these words synonymously. Thus, American Express is essentially arguing that each money order should be enforced according to its terms, which state that the money order \u201cWILL NOT BE PAID IF IT HAS BEEN ALTERED OR STOLEN OR IF AN ENDORSEMENT IS MISSING OR FORGED.\u201d\nAs previously discussed, the legend on the back of the money orders is merely a warning that restates American Express\u2019 defenses against persons other than holders in due course in the event of alteration, theft, lack of endorsement or forgery. These defenses are ineffective against a holder in due course. 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3305; 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3407(c). Because Triffin has attained holder in due course status through the assignment of the money orders from Chuckie\u2019s, American Express cannot enforce the defenses against him. Accordingly, American Express is liable to Triffin for the face value of the money orders.\nThe Order of the Superior Court is affirmed and this matter is remanded to the trial court for the entry of an order consistent with this Opinion.\nCASTILLE, J., files a dissenting opinion in which CAPPY, J., joins.\n. Triffin testified that he regularly purchases various types of choses in action from members of the check cashing industry. Although a law school graduate, Triffin is not a member of the Pennsylvania Bar and he is proceeding pro se in this appeal.\n. Dillabough and Lynn did not appeal the default judgments entered against them to the Superior Court and they are not parties to the present appeal before this Court.\n. On July 9, 1992, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted amendments to the Commercial Code, effective July 9, 1993. All of the transactions in this case occurred before the effective date of the 1992 amendments, and therefore, the Commercial Code as it existed before the 1992 amendments controls this case. References in this Opinion to the Commercial Code are to the Act of November 1, 1979, P.L. 255, No. 86, \u00a7 1, unless otherwise noted. Although the Commercial Code has been revised, its basic provisions survived the 1992 amendments. We expect that this Opinion will provide guidance for transactions conducted pursuant to the Commercial Code as amended in 1992.\n. The 1992 amendments to the Commercial Code define good faith specifically for use in Division Three as \"[h]onesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3103(a) (1992). The added requirement of \"the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing\u201d to the definition of good faith appears to impose a stricter test on prospective holders in due course than did the previous definition. We offer no opinion, however, about whether Giunta's conduct satisfies this new good faith standard.",

        "text": "CASTILLE, Justice,\ndissents.\nThe majority concludes that appellee Robert J. Triffin (\u201cappellee\u201d) is entitled to recover the value of the money orders at issue because the money orders were negotiable instruments and because appellee was a holder in due course of those negotiable instruments. However, since the money orders at issue contained express conditional language which precluded negotiability under the relevant statute, I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion.\nThe requirements for negotiability are set forth at 13 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3104, which provides:\n(a) Requisites to negotiability. \u2014 Any writing to be a negotiable instrument within this division must:\n(1) be signed by the maker or drawer;\n(2) contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money and no other promise, order, obligation, or power given by the maker or drawer except as authorized by this division;\n(3) be payable on demand or at a definite time; and\n(4) be payable to order or to bearer.\n13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104 (emphasis added).\nAt issue here is the second of the four statutory prerequisites to negotiability, the requirement of an \u201cunconditional\u201d promise or order. Regarding this prerequisite, section 3105 provides:\n(a) Unconditional promise or order. \u2014 A promise or order otherwise unconditional is not made conditional by the fact that the instrument:\n(1) is subject to implied or constructive conditions;\nThe comment to section 3105 states:\n1---- Nothing in [paragraph (a) subsection (1) ] is intended to imply that language may not be fairly construed to mean what it says, but implications, whether of law or fact, are not to be considered in determining negotiability.\nThus, the statute clearly distinguishes between language which creates an implied condition and language which creates an express condition. The latter renders a promise or order non-negotiable while the former does not. This conclusion derives further support from the revised \u00a7 3106(a), which provides that\"... a promise or order is unconditional unless it states (1) an express condition to payment ... \u201d.\nHere, the operative language in the money orders at issue clearly created an \u201cexpress\u201d condition and thereby rendered the money orders non-negotiable. The language at issue states:\nIMPORTANT\nDO NOT CASH FOR STRANGERS\nTHIS MONEY ORDER WILL NOT BE PAID IF IT HAS BEEN ALTERED OR STOLEN OR IF AN ENDORSEMENT IS MISSING OR FORGED. BE SURE YOU HAVE EFFECTIVE RECOURSE AGAINST YOUR CUSTOMER.\nPAYEE\u2019S ENDORSEMENT\nThis language explicitly conditions payments on the money orders\u2019 not being altered or stolen and the endorsements\u2019 not being missing or forged. The use of the word \u201cif\u2019 renders the condition an express one, since \u201cif\u2019 by definition means \u201con condition that; in case that; supposing that.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Diet., 2d College ed. (emphasis added).\nFurthermore, the official comment to revised section 3106 explains what the code intends by drawing the distinction between implied and express conditions:\nIf the promise or order states an express condition to payment, the promise or order is not an instrument. For example, a promise states, \u201cI promise to pay $100,000 to the order of John Doe if he conveys title to Blackacre to me.\u201d The promise is not an instrument because there is an express condition to payment. However, suppose a promise states, \u201cIn consideration of John Doe\u2019s promise to convey title of Blackacre I promise to pay $100,000 to the order of John Doe.\u201d That promise can be an instrument if [section 3104] is otherwise satisfied.\n13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3106 (1992 amended version)(emphasis added). Accordingly, the use of the word \u201cif\u2019 creates an express condition which otherwise might be lacking, and thereby precludes a money order from being a negotiable instrument under the statute. The language at issue in this case created the same type of express condition which is embodied in the Comment; consequently, the language precludes the money orders from being negotiable instruments.\nThe reasons proffered by the majority to justify its departure from this seemingly inescapable statutory logic are strained. First, the majority cites a case, decided by the Louisiana Court of Appeal in 1974, in which a condition incorporating the word \u201cif\u2019 was construed not to bar negotiability. In that case, the Louisiana Court did not evaluate the significance of the word \u201cif\u2019 or the significance of the condition which that word introduced. Moreover, in 1974, Louisiana had not yet adopted Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d). Hence, it appears that the Louisiana decision was decided against the backdrop of the Code of Napoleon. See 9 to 5 Fashions, Inc. v. Petr L. Spumey, 538 So.2d 228, 233 (La.l989)(discussing roots of Louisiana\u2019s civil code in the Napoleonic code). Pennsylvania, on' the other hand, has adopted Article III of the UCC, which speaks directly to the issue presented in this case, as explained supra. A decision by an intermediate Louisiana appellate court interpreting French legal principles should not override the explicit statutory guidance furnished by the Pennsylvania legislature on an issue of Pennsylvania law.\nThe majority also seizes on Comment 4 to 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104, which states that \u201cany writing which meets the requirements of subsection [ (a) ] and is not excluded under Section [3103] is a negotiable instrument, and all sections of this [Division] apply to it, even though it may contain additional language beyond that contemplated by this section\u201d (emphasis added by majority). Since, as explained supra, the money orders contained language which precluded them from satisfying subsection (a), the quoted language from Comment 4 does not further the majority\u2019s argument.\nFinally, the majority attempts to support its conclusion by referring to the principle that \u201cpurported conditions on an otherwise negotiable instrument, that merely reflect other provisions of the law, do not vitiate negotiability.\u201d Op. at 609 (citations omitted). The majority contends that the language at issue amounts merely to a restatement of appellant\u2019s statutory defenses against payment where there has been alteration (13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3407), theft (\u00a7 3306(4)), absence of signature (\u00a7 3401) and forgery (\u00a7 3404). The majority overlooks the fact that all of these statutory defenses are, by their own terms, ineffective against holders in due course. On the other hand, the language at issue here - which categorically states that the money order will not be paid if it was stolen \u2014 is operative even against holders who have taken in due course. As noted in the Comment to section 3105(a)(1), conditional language may be fairly construed to mean what it says. By its plain terms, the language at issue here sweeps beyond the scope of appellant\u2019s statutory defenses, and therefore does more than simply \u201creflect other provisions of the law.\u201d\nIn sum, the statute at issue in this case is devoid of ambiguity, and the application of that statute to these facts compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by the majority. Consequently, I respectfully dissent.\nCAPPY, J., joins this dissenting opinion.\n. In 1992, subsequent to the transactions at issue in this case, section 3104 was clarified by amendment.\n. In 1992, subsequent to the transactions at issue in this case, section 3105 was clarified and replaced by 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3106.\n. Although section 3106 was not revised until 1992, it is axiomatic that where new legislation is merely declaratory of existing law or clarifies existing law, it may be given retroactive effect. Banic v. WCAB, 550 Pa. 276, 705 A.2d 432, 437 (1997); Simmonds v. State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, 548 Pa. 219, 226, 696 A.2d 801, 804 (1997); Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 22.34 (5th ed.1993). The official comment to the revised section points out that the section is not changing the law. Therefore, the revised section may be given retroactive effect insofar as it provides further evidence that express conditions to payment serve as a bar to negotiability.\n. Additionally, I note that if there was any doubt about this conclusion, the doubt would be resolved against negotiability. See United States v. Gonzalez, 797 F.2d 1109, 1113 (1st Cir.l986)(\"when a writing is ambiguous with respect to negotiability, the conclusion to be reached is that it is not negotiable\u201d)(emphasis added)(other citations omitted).\n. Specifically, the condition provided: \"CASH ONLY IF RECOURSE FROM ENDORSER IS AVAILABLE. IF THE MONEY ORDER HAS NOT BEEN VALIDLY ISSUED OR HAS BEEN FRAUDULENTLY NEGOTIATED, IT WILL BE RETURNED. KNOW YOUR ENDORSER (sic) CASH ONLY IF RECOURSE IS AVAILABLE.\u201d Hong Kong Importers, Inc., v. American Express Co., 301 So.2d 707, 708 (La.App. 1974).",
