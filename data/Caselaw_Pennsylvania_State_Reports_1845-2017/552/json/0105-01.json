        "text": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nCASTILLE, Justice.\nThe issue in this appeal is whether the Right to Know Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 66.2, which provides that \u201c[e]very public record of an agency shall, at reasonable times, be open for examination and inspection by any citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\u201d gives a labor union the right of access to a private contractor\u2019s payroll records which are in the possession of a public agency for work performed pursuant to a contract with the public agency. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County denied the request of appellant Sapp Roofing Company, Inc. (\u201cSapp Roofing\u201d) for an injunction enjoining appellee Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association, Local Union, No. 12 (\u201cunion\u201d) from accessing Sapp Roofing\u2019s payroll records from a project for appellee North Hills School District (\u201cschool district\u201d). The Commonwealth Court affirmed. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\nOn July 8, 1993, the union sent a written request to the school district seeking copies of certified payroll records in the custody of the school district for contractual roofing work performed on three school district buildings by Sapp Roofing, a non-union roofing company. The three roofing jobs were public projects for which the school district received state funding. Sapp Roofing submitted the payroll records in question to the school district under the Prevailing Wage Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 165-1, et seq.\nSection 165-6 of the Prevailing Wage Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-6, - requires that:\nEvery contractor and subcontractor shall keep an accurate record showing the name, craft and the actual hourly wage paid to each workman employed by him in connection with public work, and such record shall be preserved for two years from date of payment. The record shall be open at all reasonable hours for inspection of the public body awarding the contract and to the secretary.\nThe Prevailing Wage Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-10, requires the agency to obtain certain records from the contractor prior to disbursing final payment on a contract:\nBefore final payment is made by, or on behalf of any public body of any sum or sums due on public work, it shall be the duty of the treasurer of the public body or other officer or person charged with the custody and disbursement of the funds of the public body to require the contractor to file statements, in writing, in form satisfactory to the secretary, certifying to the amounts then due and owing from such contractor and subcontractor, filing such statement to any and all workmen for wages due on account of public work, setting forth therein the names of the persons whose wages are unpaid and the amount due to each respectively....\nThe records requested by the union in this case contain the names and addresses of Sapp Roofing\u2019s employees on the three roofing projects, their social security numbers, job positions, rates of pay and hours worked on the jobs. The union sought the records for the stated purpose of ensuring that Sapp Roofing complied with the Prevailing Wage Act, claiming that the records are public records under the Right to Know Act. The Right to Know Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 66.1, defines a public record as:\nAny account, voucher or contract dealing with the receipt or disbursement of funds by an agency or its acquisition, use or disposal of services or of supplies, materials, equipment or other property and any minute, order or decision by an agency fixing the personal or property rights, privileges, immunities, duties or obligations of any person or group of persons: Provided, that the term \u201cpublic records\u201d shall not mean any report, communication or other paper, the publication of which would disclose the institution, progress or result of an investigation undertaken by an agency in the performance of its official duties, except those reports filed by agencies pertaining to safety and health in industrial plants; it shall not include any record, document, material, exhibit, pleading, report, memorandum or other paper, access to or the publication of which is prohibited, restricted or forbidden by statute law or order or decree of court, or which would operate to the prejudice or impairment of the person\u2019s reputation or personal security, or which would result in the loss by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions or commissions or State or municipal authorities of Federal funds, excepting therefrom however any record of any conviction for any criminal act.\nIn Community College of Philadelphia v. Broum, 544 Pa. 31, 33, 674 A.2d 670, 671 (1996), this Court stated:\nGenerally, the Right to Know Act opens public records to examination and inspection by any citizen, excepting papers the publication of which would disclose the institution, progress or result of an official investigation. The intent of the act was to clarify the right of examination and inspection of public records by all citizens. Wiley v. Woods, 393 Pa. 341, 350, 141 A.2d 844, [849] (1958).\nThe Right to Know Act applies to \u201cpublic records\u201d of \u201cpublic agencies.\u201d\nSee also McMullan v. Wohlgemuth, 453 Pa. 147, 158, 308 A.2d 888, 894 (1973) (\u201cThe \u2018Right-To-Know Act\u2019 gives \u2018any member of the Commonwealth\u2019 a statutory right of access to every \u2018public record\u2019 of a state agency.\u201d).\nPursuant to the Right to Know Act, to be available for inspection, the records must be both public records and records of a state agency. The union contends and the trial court and Commonwealth Court properly held that the requested records fit within the statutory definition of a public record because they are an account dealing with the disbursement of funds by an agency, and further that they are the school district\u2019s records under the Prevailing Wage Act. We agree that the payroll records are public records because they are records evidencing a disbursement by the school district.\nIn order to be records of an agency, the records must \u201cconstitute an essential component of an agency decision.\u201d Tribune-Review Publishing Co. v. Allegheny Cty. Housing Authority, 662 A.2d 677, 682 (Pa.Commw.1995), alloc, denied, 546 Pa. 688, 686 A.2d 1315 (1996) (citing Consumer Education & Protective Ass\u2019n v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit. Authority, 125 Pa. Commw. 143, 557 A.2d 1123 (1989)). The regulations implementing the Prevailing Wage Act require the officer of the public body charged with custody of the public funds to ensure that all wages due to workmen by the contractor are paid, and if not, the officer must withhold the amount of unpaid wages from disbursements to the contractor. 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 9.110(b). Thus, the records submitted by Sapp Roofing are, indeed, an essential component of the school district\u2019s decision regarding whether and what amount to pay to Sapp Roofing. Therefore, the records in question are the school district\u2019s records for purposes of the Prevailing Wage Act.\nThe purpose of the Right to Know Act is to allow any individual or entity, be it a person or a union, access to public records to discover information about the workings of our government. However, the right of access to public records is tempered by the definition of a public record contained in the Act:\n[I]t shall not include any record, document, material, exhibit, pleading, report, memorandum or other paper, access to or the publication of which is prohibited, restricted or forbidden by statute, law or order or decree of court, or which would operate to the prejudice or impairment of the person\u2019s reputation or personal security ... (emphasis added).\n65 P.S. \u00a7 66.1. Thus, a record that otherwise may be public in nature is not a public record if its disclosure would impair a person\u2019s personal security.\nWe must now decide whether the records requested by the union here would potentially impair the personal security of Sapp Roofing\u2019s employees and whether that potential impairment outweighs the public interest in the dissemination of the records. The union argues that the payroll records at issue are vital to its efforts to ensure that the school district complied with the Prevailing Wage Act, and that there is a strong public interest in monitoring compliance with that act. Sapp Roofing, on the other hand, contends that the employees\u2019 privacy rights will be infringed by the dissemination of the documents containing employees\u2019 names, home addresses and other personal information. Pennsylvania recognizes the right to privacy in Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and this Court often invokes this right to privacy to give greater protection to our citizens than that found in the United States Constitution.\nWe believe that the union overestimates the public interest to be served by disclosure of these records. The disclosure of personal information (names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers) reveals little, if anything, about the government\u2019s (in this case the school district\u2019s) compliance with the Prevailing Wage Act. Indeed, the union here does not explain how the disclosure of this personal information for the purpose of monitoring Prevailing Wage Act compliance overcomes the individual employees\u2019 strong privacy interests. Even if we agree with the union that the public has an interest in enforcing the prevailing wage laws through \u201cmonitoring,\u201d the requested information would not enhance enforcement of the Prevailing Wage Act by the government.\nTherefore, after balancing this weak public interest in disclosure of the information and the unproven ability of the release of the requested information to assist in the enforcement of the prevailing wage laws against the individual\u2019s right to privacy and personal security, the Court concludes that the personal information is not releasable. Consequently, the only information that the union can access from the school district records is the wage information of Sapp Roofing\u2019s employees. Our decision here is in accord with recent interpretations of similar federal legislation reviewed by our federal courts. See Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n. Local Union No. 19 v. United States Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, 135 F.3d 891 (3d Cir.1998) (Department of Veteran Affairs could redact names, social security numbers and addresses of employees whose payroll records were sought in an effort to monitor compliance with federal prevailing wage laws); Hopkins v. United States Dep\u2019t of Housing and Urban Dev., 929 F.2d 81, 87 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201cindividual private employees have a significant interest in avoiding disclosure of their names and addresses, particularly where, as here, the names and addresses would be coupled with personal financial information.\u201d); Painting Industry of Hawaii Market Recovery Fund v. United States Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 26 F.3d 1479 (1994)(the release of personal employee information implicates significant privacy interests).\nAccordingly, the decision of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring opinion.\nNIGRO, J., concurs in the result.\nCAPPY, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n.

I write separately to note that nothing in the language of either the Prevailing Wage Act, Act of August 15, 1961, P.L. 987, \u00a7 1 et seq., as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-1 et seq., or the regulations implementing that Act, 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 9.101 et seq., appears to require that a contractor submit its payroll records to the public body.\nUnder the Act, contractors and subcontractors are required \u201cto keep an accurate record showing the name, craft and the actual hourly wage paid to each workman employed by him in connection with public work.... The record shall be open at all reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body awarding the contract and to the [Secretary [of Labor and Industry].\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-6.

        "text": "CAPPY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nBecause I do not agree that the records at issue in this matter are \u201cpublic records\u201d as defined in The Right to Know Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 66.1,1 respectfully dissent.\nThe Right to Know Act, in pertinent part, defines \u201cpublic record\u201d as: \u201c[a]ny account, voucher or contract dealing with the receipt or disbursement of funds by an agency ...\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 66.1. The records in question here are payroll records of a private contractor. Those records contain the names and addresses of Appellant\u2019s workers who performed work on three roofing projects for the Northern Hills School District, their social security numbers, job position, rates of pay and the hours worked on the projects. As noted by the Majority, such payroll records are required to be kept by the contractor under the Prevailing Wage Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-6. The Prevailing Wage Act at 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-10 further provides that before final payment may be made by or on behalf of a public body for work performed under a contract with that public body, the public body is to obtain statements from the contractor certifying to any unpaid wages due and owing from that contractor to its workers and naming the persons whose wages are unpaid together with the specific amounts due each such person. This particular section deals not with any actual disbursements of monies by the public agency or even a request for the public agency to disburse funds, but rather deals with the record keeping or compliance responsibilities of the public body and the contractor.\nThere is nothing in this section which would indicate that the required certifications equate to an \u201caccount, voucher or contract\u201d evidencing a disbursement of funds by the public agency or that the filing of such certifications propels a disbursement by the public agency for such amounts so as to render the payroll records \u201cpublic\u201d and thus, obtainable under the Right to Know Act. Indeed, it more clearly addresses monies owed by the contractor and/or subcontractor to their workers and not amounts owed by the public agency. These payroll records constitute neither a record of any business dealings or transactions between Appellant and the School District; accordingly, they are neither a \u201cvoucher\u201d nor an \u201caccount.\u201d And, they certainly do not evidence any \u201ccontract\u201d between the School District and Appellant.\nIn short, I do not believe that the payroll records in question evidence any disbursements or agreements to disburse monies by the School District and that, therefore, it was error for the lower courts to permit the Union access to those records under the guise of The Right to Know Act.",
