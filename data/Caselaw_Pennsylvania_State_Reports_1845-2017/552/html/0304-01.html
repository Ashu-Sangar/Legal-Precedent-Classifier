As part of its operation of the leachate system, appellant made the necessary repairs to the liners of the three treatment lagoons, eliminated erosion gullies, performed revegetation work in the area and tested water samples from the five wells previously installed by ASC.

Conversely, DEP contended that the relevant statutory provisions allowed it to require either the owners or the occupiers of the contaminated land to remedy the condition caused by pollution regardless of fault or knowledge. DEP then filed a motion for summary judgment. For purposes of that motion, the parties stipulated that the contamination of the residential water supply resulted from volatile organic contaminants emanating from the 78-acre parcel of the land which ASC had utilized to dispose of waste prior to the time appellant assumed operation of the site. On April 5, 1994, the EHB granted partial summary judgment in favor of DEP.

The record herein fails to establish that Adams Sanitation Company was in any way at fault with respect to the contamination which existed on the land leased, not owned, by Adams. Nevertheless, it was ordered to treat the refuse so that the runoff contained no noxious chemicals. In my judgment, such an order under section 316 of the Clean Streams Law constitutes an impermissible exercise of the <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>police power. I would therefore reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
