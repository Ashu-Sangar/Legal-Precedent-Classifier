The Alaska Supreme Court ruled that an intentional misrepresentation by an attorney is a violation of Alaska’s DR 1-102(A)(4), whereas a misrepresentation made as the result of gross negligence is not a violation of that rule. The <em>Simpson </em>court, finding the respondent attorney therein was grossly negligent in making untrue statements in an interrogatory response, concluded the attorney committed no violation of Alaska’s DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>

The respondent attorney in <em>Ramey </em>was an experienced prosecutor. During the trial of a criminal case, he was confronted with a chain-of-custody problem and stated to the court that he had personally examined a serialized list of monies and could guarantee that they matched up. The respondent’s statement turned out to be untrue. The <em>Ramey </em>court found the respondent attorney’s conduct in that case fell somewhere between “deliberately misleading” and “made in reckless disregard of the true facts”. The Iowa Supreme Court found a violation of its DR 1-102(A)(4) where it was shown that the respondent attorney’s misrepresentation was made with, at the least, a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity, emphasizing that the respondent -had “personally guaranteed” the veracity of his statement.</p>

    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[137,596,1154,829]]]'>We find the standard expressed by the Supreme Court of Colorado in <em>Rader </em>to be most appropriate in interpreting our Rule 8.4(c). Thus, we hold that a culpable mental state greater than negligence is necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>violation of Rule 8.4(c). This requirement is met where the misrepresentation is knowingly made, or where it is made with reckless ignorance of the truth or falsity thereof. We agree with the <em>Rader </em>court that no actual knowledge or intent to deceive on the part of the Respondent is necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>violation; the element of scienter is made out if Respondent’s conduct was reckless, to the extent that he can be deemed to have knowingly made the misrepresentation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Thus, for the purpose of establishing a prima facia case, recklessness may be described as the deliberate closing of one’s eyes to facts that one had a duty to see or stating as fact, things of which one was ignorant.</p>
