On the same day, Miller filed an application with the Township for a curative amendment to the zoning ordinance. Miller contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it failed to make provisions for quarrying, bituminous asphalt plants and ready-mix concrete plants. The Board of Supervisors of Plumstead Township denied the application and Miller appealed to the Bucks County Common Pleas Court.</p>

Specifically, Miller sought damages for the interest paid on its mortgage, loss of profits due to its inability to quarry and the costs it incurred in the curative amendment proceedings. The Township filed preliminary objections to the petition contending that Miller’s claim of a <em>de facto </em>taking was not ripe because there was no final determination that the ordinance unconstitutionally excluded quarrying, and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for a temporary <em>defacto </em>taking.</p>

It rejected the Township’s claim that other permissive uses of the property existed. The court held that to establish a <em>defacto </em>taking, the landowner must only establish that there were “exceptional circumstances” which substantially deprived the property owner of the beneficial use and enjoyment of his property.

Otherwise, all zoning regula<a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>tions could be categorized as “takings” in the sense that the owner is not completely free to use his property as he chooses.

      <em>First English </em>does not require a contrary result. There, the County of Los Angeles adopted an interim ordinance prohibiting the construction or reconstruction of any building or structure in a flood protection area. The appellant, a church that had purchased property in the protected area prior to the adoption of the ordinance, sought damages for the loss of use of the property. The United States Supreme Court held that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution require that the landowner be compensated for the period of time before it was finally determined that the regulation constituted a taking.

Unlike the instant case, the ordinance in <em>McClimans </em>precluded the single use the property possessed. The Commonwealth Court’s reliance on <em>McClimans </em>was therefore erroneous.</p>
