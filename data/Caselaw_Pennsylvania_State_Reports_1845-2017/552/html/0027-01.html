Appellant had petitioned for the return of one hundred sixty-one handguns, a small quantity of ammunition, and a caliber conversion kit for a .45 caliber pistol, all of which had been seized following his arrest for various firearms violations.</p>

      <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>In 1994 the state police conducted an investigation of illegal sales of firearms at flea markets. During this investigation, appellant sold numerous guns to an undercover state police officer. He was subsequently arrested and pled guilty to twenty-eight counts of violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111 (failure to wait the necessary forty-eight hours between application to purchase and delivery of the firearm). With regard to the sale of additional guns, he also pled guilty to eight additional counts of the violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111. Finally, appellant pled guilty to 18 Pa.C.S. § 908, Prohibited Offensive Weapons, 18 Pa.C.S. § 6106, Firearms not to be carried without a license, and 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111, Sale of Firearms, in connection with his sale to the undercover officer of three machine guns and nine pistols. Appellant was sentenced to multiple concurrent sentences of six to twenty-three months imprisonment, a collective fine of $45,000, and ten years probation. Post-trial motions to modify the sentences were filed and denied and the Superior Court affirmed the trial court on the sentencing issues. The convictions and sentences are not at issue in this appeal. This appeal concerns only the propriety of the denial of the petition for the return of property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

He is not requesting that the guns be returned to his possession, since possession of firearms would be a violation of his sentence. Instead, he requests that the firearms be delivered to an authorized dealer who would liquidate them and pay him the proceeds. On April 10, 1996, the trial court denied his petition. On April 16, 1997, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s denial of the petition for return of property, and on September 30, 1997 we granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the lower courts.</p>
    <p id="b151-4" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[158,455,1153,692]]]'>Appellant contends that the firearms stored at his residence and at his daughter-in-law’s residence were merely part of his private collection, unavailable for sale and hence unrelated to his underlying criminal activity, and that the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of proving otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence. However, the trial court properly determined that at appellant’s guilty plea and sentencing hearing, appellant adopted the contents of the presentence investigation report (“PSI”) and the affidavit of probable cause attached thereto. After reviewing the PSI, appellant stated that only one mistake relating to his educational level existed on the PSI. In the affidavit of probable cause which led to appellant’s arrest, Trooper Diskin stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.6",151,[200,1169,1109,311]]]'>“By [appellant’s] own admission, he indicates that he has guns stored at his place and a much larger amount at his daughter-in-laws [sic] residence. He has asked me on more then [sic] one occasion what type I was interested in and indicated that he had what I was looking for along with other types that I might be interested in” (PSI at 40).</blockquote>
    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.7",151,[157,1511,1154,528]]]'>This undisputed statement alone is sufficient to support the finding of the lower courts that the Commonwealth established a nexus between appellant’s underlying criminal activity and the firearms which appellant now seeks to shield under the guise that the firearms constituted his private collection. Since appellant plainly admits in this statement that he could obtain whatever type of firearm Trooper Diskin was interested in from the guns that he had stored at his residence and at his daughter-in-law’s residence, appellant’s transparent attempt to cast what is truly his “inventory” as a “private collection” fails.</p>
    <p id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.8",151,[155,2069,1153,312]],["BL_152.1",152,[217,336,1157,468]]]'>The conclusion that the firearms stowed at the two locations were actually part of appellant’s sales inventory is further buttressed by the fact that appellant <em>admitted </em>that each of the forty-eight firearms that he sold to Trooper Diskin and which served as the predicate for the three convictions against him came from this same inventory. By presenting evidence that <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>appellant had violated the sanctity of his “private” collection forty-eight times for a pure profit motive, and had further advertised his willingness to sell from that collection any other firearms which Officer Diskin desired, the Commonwealth established by a preponderance of the evidence that there was actually nothing “private” about this collection. Instead, as the Superior Court correctly held, the firearms from this collection were intended by appellant to be used in illegal sales of firearms and thus were derivative contraband.</p>
    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[216,840,1159,638]]]'>The majority attempts to derive support for its conclusion that the firearms at issue were not derivative contraband by asserting the “tenuous” nature of the connection between the unsold guns in the “collection” and appellant’s criminal activity. Specifically, the majority points to the fact that these guns were neither sold, displayed, nor specifically described. However, the majority overlooks the significance of the fact that appellant had already told Trooper Diskin that he could get him <em>any </em>gun that Diskin was looking for from this collection, and thus that appellant obviously did not feel it necessary to further describe any particular gun with specificity-</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.6",152,[217,1506,1159,421]]]'>I agree with the majority’s statement that the Court must be vigilant in guarding against the temptation to create a “gun exception” to the general rule that a nexus must be proven between the seized item and the criminal conduct. However, this case does not threaten to create such an exception — here the evidence establishes the requisite nexus beyond peradventure. Consequently, I would deny the petition for return of property and affirm the Order of the Superior Court.</p>

    <p class="judges" id="b152-7" data-blocks='[["BL_152.8",152,[260,2126,740,41]]]'>CAPPY, J., joins this dissenting opinion.</p>
