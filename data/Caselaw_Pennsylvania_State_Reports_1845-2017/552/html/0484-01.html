Officer Roofner, knowing that the accident was outside of his jurisdiction, decided to go to the accident scene to see if he could render first-aid or other assistance.</p>

Officer Roofner did not attempt to restrain Appellee from trying to start his vehicle or otherwise restrict Appellee’s movements in any other way. The Officer also saw Appellee fall twice.

The second, an “investigative detention” must be supported by reasonable suspicion; it subjects a suspect to a stop and a period of detention, but does not involve such coercive conditions as to constitute the functional equivalent of an arrest.

The Commonwealth submits that the Officer did not ask for Appellee’s driver’s license, registration, or conduct any formal investigation. Rather, they aver the record indicates that the pair merely discussed Appellee’s home state of Alaska until the State Police arrived.

Thus, in this unique context, Officer Roofner’s notifying Appellee of his affirmative duties following the accident does not, in and of itself, turn the encounter into an investigative detention. To hold otherwise would require this Court to examine only the words of the exchange, while ignoring the context in which they were spoken. This, we cannot do. Rather, this Court must scrutinize the totality of the circumstances surrounding the encounter.

In <em>Price, </em>an FBI agent stopped the defendant's vehicle after witnessing a motor vehicle violation. The agent told the defendant not to move and to remain seated in his vehicle. <em><a href="/pa/543/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="672 A.2d 280" data-case-ids="461627,7348165" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0403-01,/a2d/672/0280-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/543/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="672 A.2d 280" data-case-ids="461627,7348165" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0403-01,/a2d/672/0280-01">at 405</a>, 672 A.2d at 281. This Court found the agent’s stop of the defendant was illegal because the agent was outside of his lawful jurisdiction. Thus, the subsequent arrest by the local police was tainted, warranting suppression of all evidence obtained as a result of the illegal stop. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 672 A.2d at 285. As indicated in the body of this Opinion, Officer Roofner did not initially stop Appellee, nor did he in any way attempt to restrain Appellee. Therefore, <em>Price </em>is factually distinguishable. Moreover, the Statewide Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953 applies to municipal police officers. <em>Price </em>involved an FBI agent. Therefore, <em>Price </em>is legally inapposite and does not implicate 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953.</p>
