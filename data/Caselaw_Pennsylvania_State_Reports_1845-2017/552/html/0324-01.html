For example, if evidence discloses that an individual is seeking to change his or her name in order to receive preference as a candidate on a <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>university or employment application, the Statute would clearly compel the courts to deny that individual’s name change petition.</p>
    <p id="b447-4" data-blocks='[["BL_447.5",447,[154,491,1150,312]]]'>However, under the circumstances of this case, I agree with the Majority that the record does not reflect that Appellant is seeking to change his name in order to perpetrate any type of fraud, financial or otherwise. Accordingly, I agree with the Majority’s conclusion that Appellant’s name change petition should be granted.</p>
