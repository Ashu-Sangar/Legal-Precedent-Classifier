The Honorable Juanita Kidd Stout was the presiding judge of a jury trial, which lasted from October 17 through 26, 1994. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict and the trial court declared a mistrial. A second jury trial commenced on February 15, 1995, and the <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>jury returned a verdict of guilty to charges of first degree murder and possessing an instrument of crime on February 27, 1995. The jury returned a sentence of death at the conclusion of the penalty phase. After denying Appellant’s post-trial motions, the trial court formally imposed a death sentence for first degree murder and a suspended sentence for the charge of possessing an instrument of crime.</p>
    <p id="b745-5" data-blocks='[["BL_745.5",745,[152,751,1153,648]]]'>The evidence at trial established that on December 21,1993, the Victim was delivering a package in the area of 3058 North 9th Street in Philadelphia. Two area residents, Willie Green (Green) and Charles Rowe (Rowe), were standing by a store on the corner of Ninth and Clearfield Streets close to the Federal Express truck. Green and Rowe, who had both known Appellant for several years, heard a loud bang and then saw Appellant run from behind the Federal Express truck and down an alley. They also saw Appellant tuck something under his jacket. When the two men walked over to the truck, they observed the Victim lying in the street, mortally wounded, his legs still moving.</p>
    <p id="b745-6" data-blocks='[["BL_745.6",745,[151,1440,1154,583]]]'>Green and Rowe left the area because they did not want to get involved. Police arriving on the scene discovered the Victim’s body lying face up with a large bullet hole to the left cheek. Based on the presence of gunpowder abrasions around the wound, the medical examiner, Adrienne Sekula-Perlman, M.D., determined that the killer fired the gun at close range, approximately twelve to eighteen inches away from the Victim’s face. The gun was fired in an upward direction and the bullet went through the cheek into the base of the skull and entered the brain. Dr. Sekula-Perlman removed a large caliber bullet from the Victim’s brain.</p>
    <p id="b745-7" data-blocks='[["BL_745.7",745,[154,2071,1153,315]]]'>Police began looking for Green and Rowe because they had received information that the two men frequented the corner of Ninth and Clearfield Streets. After locating and interviewing them, the police obtained an arrest warrant for Appellant on December 23, 1993. Appellant surrendered himself to the police in the late evening hours of December 24,1993.</p>

Howser explained that on four or five occasions, he left his truck to make deliveries and returned to the truck to find Appellant sitting inside or on the truck’s bumper.</p>
    <p id="b746-5" data-blocks='[["BL_746.5",746,[227,737,1159,527]]]'>Appellant testified at his trial and presented two alibi ■witnesses.

He stated that he went to the home of Carl Fooks (Fooks) and Odell Reid (Reid) and began drinking, and that the three men continued drinking from an hour before the shooting until approximately four hours after the murder. Fooks and Reid also testified that after Appellant arrived at Fooks’ apartment, he did not leave until well after the killing.</p>

Appellant introduced testimony from family members and a psychiatrist who testified that he had a drinking problem.</p>
    <p id="b746-7" data-blocks='[["BL_746.7",746,[223,1649,1160,311]]]'>The jury found that the Commonwealth proved two aggravating factors: Appellant had a prior conviction for voluntary manslaughter, which is an aggravating factor pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(12); and he had a significant history of violent felony convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9).

At the conclusion of the trial, defense counsel requested the trial court to charge the jury regarding “heat of passion” voluntary manslaughter. Although the Commonwealth agreed that the trial court should give such an instruction, the trial court refused because there was no evidence to support a theory that the killing was committed in the heat of passion. After a jury convicted him of third degree murder, Browdie asked this Court to grant him a new trial because the trial court did not instruct the jury that it could find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
