As Berg conceded that his petition did not contain valid signatures of 100 Democratic electors from each of ten counties, further analysis was unnecessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In <em>Moore, </em>independent candidates for the office of President of <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>the United States challenged an Illinois law that required candidates to obtain 25,000 signatures, at least 200 from each of 50 of the state’s 102 counties, before their names were placed on the general election ballot. The population disparity-in Illinois was such that 93.4% of the population resided in the 49 most populous counties, with 6.6% of the population residing in the remaining 53 counties. Under the challenged statute, the 6.6% minority could effectively block a candidate from appearing on the ballot against the desires of the majority even though it could not have defeated the candidate in the general election. Accordingly, the Court ruled that the new law unconstitutionally diluted the vote of the more populous counties in the state and therefore lacked the equality to which the exercise of political rights is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

      <em>Moore </em>is distinguishable, however, in two respects. First, the ten most populous counties in Pennsylvania comprise only 59% of the Democratic electors in the Commonwealth, with the remaining 41% distributed among the other 57 counties in the state. Thus, unlike <em>Moore, </em>the instant case does not present a situation where a scant minority of voters in rural areas could “veto” the wishes of the majority. Second, both the number and percentage of counties from which signatures were required was far greater in <em>Moore </em>than that imposed by section 912.1(3). In <em>Moore, </em>the statute required 200 signatures from each of 50 of the state’s 102 counties, or 49% of the counties in the state. Here, a candidate is only required to obtain 2,000 signatures, at least 100 from each of 10 of the state’s 67 counties, or 14.9% of the counties in the state.</p>
