Citing the existence of “comprehensive banking legislation”, the Court held that the tax could not be so applied. Four justices agreed that applying the tax to banks would “impinge” or “encroach” on a legislatively preempted area, rejecting Mr. Justice Nix’s dissenting view that a pervasive scheme of <em>regulatory </em>legislation does not evidence a legislative intent to disallow local <em>taxation.</em>

These Articles refer to the Bank Shares Tax, the Title Insurance and Trust Companies Shares Tax, the Insurance Premiums Tax, and the Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax respectively. Thus banks, as a regulated industry, are subject to different tax treatment than “non-regulated” businesses.
