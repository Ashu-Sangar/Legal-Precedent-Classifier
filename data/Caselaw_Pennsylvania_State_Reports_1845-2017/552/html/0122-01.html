    <p class="author" id="b239-11" data-blocks='[["BL_239.11",239,[192,1210,299,38]]]'>CAPPY, Justice:</p>
    <p id="b239-12" data-blocks='[["BL_239.12",239,[145,1283,1156,260]]]'>The sole issue presented is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Appellant, George Gruyiska, a <em>de novo </em>hearing in a child custody matter. For the reasons which follow, we find that Appellant was entitled to a <em>de novo </em>hearing and thus, reverse the orders of the lower courts.</p>

Patricia Van Dine (Appellee) and George Gyuriska (Appellant) have been involved in a custody dispute since their divorce in 1986. In August 1994, Appellee petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County for primary physical custody of the parties’ three children. A master was appointed to hear this matter. The hearing was held December 23,1994. Appellant refused to participate in the master’s hearing because he considered the hearing “illegal.” The master filed his report and recommendation on March 28, 1995. Appellant filed exceptions to the master’s report, alleging 27 errors, including that the hearing violated Pennsylvania law, which provided custody matters could not be heard by a master. Appellant also demanded a jury trial. The trial court heard oral arguments on the exceptions in July 1995. Following the hearing, <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>the trial court issued an order affirming the master’s report, and denying Appellant’s request for a jury trial.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[241,452,1160,413]]]'>The Superior Court affirmed. Although the court recognized that Appellant set forth “the appropriate statement of the law” with regard to his right to demand a trial before a judge, the court determined that the master considered the appropriate legal standards in making his final custody determination. Therefore, “in the interest of justice and judicial economy,” the Superior Court held that the master’s report would stand. There was one dissent.</p>

Similarly, 23 Pa.C.S. Section 3321, relating to “Hearing by Master,” provides that “[t]he court may appoint a master to hear testimony on all or some issues, except issues of custody and paternity.” Both Rule 1920.51 and Section 3321 were in effect at the time that the master was appointed to hear the instant custody matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Rules of Civil Procedure were recently modified to suspend Section 3321 as it relates to partial custody and visitation matters. Pa.R.C.P.1920.91(3). The partial suspension of Section 3321 could have encompassed primary physical custody. The fact that the suspension only pertains to partial custody and visitation makes it clear that a trial judge and not a master or hearing officer may make determinations related to primary physical custody matters.</p>

The case <em>sub judice </em>involved a primary physical custody matter and not a partial custody or visitation matter. Appellant requested that the custody matter be heard by a trial judge, which was denied. The Superior Court acknowledged that Appellant was entitled to a hearing before a trial judge as a statutory right, but declined to give him this <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>right “in the interests of justice and judicial economy.” We reject this reasoning.</p>
