PNI determined that its present headquarters was no longer adequate. In an effort to keep PNI from moving to a suburban location, the City and the HRA entered into a Development Agreement with PNI, dated January 24,1994, to facilitate preparation of a building site for the eventual construction of a new headquarters on Market and North Second Street. Aspects of the <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>building project included site acquisition, asbestos removal, demolition, and other site preparation, as well as the subsequent construction of an office tower and a parking garage.</p>

Additionally, as part of the site preparation, the Development Agreement provided for the City to ready the site for construction by contracting to have asbestos removed from existing structures,. On September 24, 1994, the City entered into a $109,000 asbestos removal contract with CMC Environmental Hazard Abatement, Inc. (“CMC”). The asbestos agreement lists the City and the HRA as fee simple owners of the site properties and provides for payment by the City to CMC for performance of the asbestos removal, although ultimately, pursuant to the Development Agreement, the asbestos removal will be at the expense of PNI. Finally, the City entered into an agreement with a demolition contractor to perform site preparation work other than the asbestos removal.</p>

Subsequently, PNI, the City and the HRA intervened in the grievance proceedings in support of the Division’s position. Although the parties could not agree on stipulated facts, an evidentiary hearing was not held; only documentary evidence was presented for the Board’s consideration.

Likewise, Section 2.2 of the Act requires that of the seven member Appeals Board, one must be a member of an historically established union representing labor in the building construction industry and one must be a member of an historically established union representing labor in the heavy and highway construction industry. Section 7 of the Act requires the Secretary to determine prevailing wage rates by locality. Regulations relating thereto note that the Secretary specifically encourages input from labor organizations in establishing general prevailing wage rates. 34 Pa.Code § 9.105(c)(3).

Department of Labor and Industry and Bristol Township School District, </em>68 Pa.Cmwlth. 642, <a href="/citations/?q=450%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="450 A.2d 259">450 A.2d 259</a> (1982). We believe, as did the Board, that in order to protect workmen “it is essential that some workers and unions who are not working under the protections of the Act, must have standing to challenge a determination in which the Division finds that the Act does not apply.” (Board Final Decision at p. 6) This is so because issues such as the one before us would be likely to escape appellate review because those more directly and immediately affected by the complained of conduct are beneficially affected as opposed to adversely affected. <em>Accord In re Application of Biester, </em><a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">487 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">409 A.2d 848</a> (1979). As the Board cogently noted, appellate review of the Division’s finding that the Act is not applicable would be foreclosed because no viable entity could or would contest the Division’s position. A public body, seeking to save funds, would not be likely to complain. Nor would the contractor, or those individuals hired to work, even if at lower than prevailing rates, be likely to object. Additionally, the policy advanced by the Act makes standing appropriate because “unemployed workers, who would be ‘workmen’ on the Project if it were covered, would have no vehicle for challenging such a decision or for protecting the lawful right <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>to perform prevailing wage work. Neither individuals nor their collective bargaining representatives would have recourse to a remedy.” (Board Final Decision at p. 6). Thus, the public policy advanced by the Act points to allowing unions to file grievances regarding determinations of applicability of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[157,671,1155,1008]]]'>In reaching a conclusion regarding the intent of the General Assembly we are guided by that fact that section 2.2(e) of the Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, place no limitation on standing to file a grievance. Likewise, notably absent from section 2.2(e) or from the Code’s definition of “grievant” is any limitation similar to that found in section 8 of the Act which requires that a union grievant must represent an individual on the public work. Additionally, the Act, when read as a whole, specifically recognizes unions as active participants in the administration and enforcement of the Act. Finally, we agree with the Board that the public policies advanced by the Act will be better served by interpreting the Act to allow unions standing. Therefore, we believe that the General Assembly intended union grievants, other than those whose members include persons directly involved on public work, to have standing to file grievances regarding application of the Act to a particular project.

Initially, we note, as did the Board, that the fact pattern before us is unique. The circumscribed role of the City in the building project was to prepare and deliver vacant land. Once the City completed its contracts for asbestos removal and demolition, and conveyed the property to PNI, its limited involvement in the development of the property ceased altogether. The City will evidently not be a party to any post-conveyance construction contract. Other than possible state financing addressed in issue three below, no post-conveyance construction contracts will be paid for in whole or in part with public funds.

The matter <em>sub judice </em>is a grievance regarding applicability of the Act filed pursu<a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>ant to section 2.2(e). Moreover, even if § 165-8 were applicable, that section, unlike section 2.2(e), limits who may bring rate challenges to, <em>inter alia, </em>representatives of "workmen.” The Act defines "workmen” as certain specific classes of workers "engaged in the performance of services directly upon the public work project....” 43 P.S. § 165— 2(7). Since the Unions represent no persons employed on the PNI building project, they would appear to have no standing to file a petition regarding rates pursuant to § 165-8.

We believe that reliance upon <em>Steve Black </em>is simply misplaced. In <em>Steve Black, </em>Steve Black, Inc., a contractor was found to have intentionally violated the Act by failing to pay its employees the prevailing minimum wage. On appeal before the Commonwealth Court, Steve Black argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that as the Act did not apply to contracts on public works where the contract price was less than $25,000, and Steve Black’s contract price was $22,731, the Act was inapplicable. The Commonwealth Court properly rejected this argument, noting that the terms of the Act indicate that it applies to all contracts involved in a public works project where the estimated total cost of the entire project exceeded $25,000. Thus, as the total cost of the public school project was $450,000, Steve Black’s contract was within the purview of the Act.</p>
