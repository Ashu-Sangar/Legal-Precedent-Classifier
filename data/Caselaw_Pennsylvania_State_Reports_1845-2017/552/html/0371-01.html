These batteries consist of a series of coke ovens, which are stationary, and various operating equipment, including several No. 6 door machines (door machine), which can be moved from battery to battery along a rail system. The door machines’ function is to remove and replace coke oven doors, each of which weighs approximately five tons. The door machines themselves are each twenty to thirty feet long, fifteen to sixteen feet high, and seven to eight feet wide.</p>

Judge Del Sole notes that the “must be commenced” language is identical to the language of numerous statutes of limitations, while the "shall be forever barred” language appears only in statutes of repose.
