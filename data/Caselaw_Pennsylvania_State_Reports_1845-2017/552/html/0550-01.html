(last name indecipherable) of 436 E. Allegheny Avenue as the sender. On February 25, 1991, Robert Lynn (Lynn) presented one American Express money order at Chuckie’s in the amount of $200.00, which listed himself as payee and Michael C. Pepe as the sender. In each instance, Charles Giunta (Giunta), the owner of Chuckie’s, recognized Dillabough and Lynn from their previous visits to Chuckie’s.

Because American Express had noted on its “fraud log” that the money orders were stolen, they were returned to Chuckie’s bearing the stamp “REPORTED LOST OR STOLEN — DO NOT REDEPOSIT.” American Express refused to pay Chuckie’s the face amounts of the money orders.

The trial court consolidated the two actions. Triffin obtained default judgments against Dillabough and Lynn and proceeded to a non-jury trial with American Express. The trial court found that the money orders were not negotiable instruments and entered a verdict in favor of American Express. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the trial court and held that the money orders were negotiable instruments and Triffin had the status of a holder in due course, entitling him to recover the face amount of the money orders from American Express.

Based on Giunta’s actions, we cannot say that the trial court erred in concluding that Chuckie’s acted in good faith. Therefore, section 3302(a)(2) is satisfied. Regarding section 3302(a)(3), there was no evidence presented that Chuckie’s had any notice that the Dillabough and Lynn money orders were stolen when he cashed them.

Pursuant to 13 Pa.C.S § 3413(a), American Express claims that it is only obligated to pay an instrument “according to its tenor.” The 1979 Commercial Code does not define “tenor.” The 1992 amendments to section 3413(a), however, substitute the word “terms” for the word “tenor.” 13 Pa.C.S. § 3413(a) (1992). The Comments accompanying the 1992 amendments to section 3413 indicate that new subsection (a) is consistent with its predecessor. Therefore, it appears that no substantive change was intended by the substitution of the word “terms” for the word “tenor” and we will treat these words synonymously. Thus, American Express is essentially arguing that each money order should be enforced according to its terms, which state that the money order “WILL NOT BE PAID IF IT HAS BEEN ALTERED OR STOLEN OR IF AN ENDORSEMENT IS MISSING OR FORGED.”</p>

For example, a promise states, “I promise to pay $100,000 to the order of John Doe <em>if </em>he conveys title to Blackacre to me.” The promise is not an instrument because there is an express condition to payment. However, suppose a promise states, “In consideration of John Doe’s promise to convey title of Blackacre I promise to pay $100,000 to the order of John Doe.” That promise can be an instrument if [section 3104] is otherwise satisfied.</blockquote>

Accordingly, the use of the word “if’ creates an express condition which otherwise might be lacking, and thereby precludes a money order from being a negotiable instrument under the statute. The language at issue in this case created the same type of express condition which is embodied in the <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>Comment; consequently, the language precludes the money orders from being negotiable instruments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

    <p id="b684-5" data-blocks='[["BL_684.5",684,[236,442,1162,1068]]]'>The reasons proffered by the majority to justify its departure from this seemingly inescapable statutory logic are strained. First, the majority cites a case, decided by the Louisiana Court of Appeal in 1974, in which a condition incorporating the word “if’ was construed not to bar negotiability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> In that case, the Louisiana Court did not evaluate the significance of the word “if’ or the significance of the condition which that word introduced. Moreover, in 1974, Louisiana had not yet adopted Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”). Hence, it appears that the Louisiana decision was decided against the backdrop of the Code of Napoleon. <em>See 9 to 5 Fashions, Inc. v. Petr L. Spumey, </em><a href="/so2d/538/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="538 So. 2d 228" data-case-ids="7544476" data-case-paths="/so2d/538/0228-01">538 So.2d 228</a>, 233 (La.l989)(discussing roots of Louisiana’s civil code in the Napoleonic code). Pennsylvania, on' the other hand, has adopted Article III of the UCC, which speaks directly to the issue presented in this case, as explained <em>supra. </em>A decision by an intermediate Louisiana appellate court interpreting French legal principles should not override the explicit statutory guidance furnished by the Pennsylvania legislature on an issue of Pennsylvania law.</p>
    <p id="b684-6" data-blocks='[["BL_684.6",684,[234,1536,1160,312]],["BL_685.1",685,[139,333,1152,204]]]'>The majority also seizes on Comment 4 to 13 Pa.C.S. § 3104, which states that “any writing which meets the requirements of subsection [ (a) ] and is not excluded under Section [3103] is a negotiable instrument, and all sections of this [Division] apply to it, even though it may contain additional language beyond that contemplated by this sec<a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>tion” (emphasis added by majority). Since, as explained <em>supra, </em>the money orders contained language which precluded them from satisfying subsection (a), the quoted language from Comment 4 does not further the majority’s argument.</p>
    <p id="b685-5" data-blocks='[["BL_685.5",685,[139,579,1155,1019]]]'>Finally, the majority attempts to support its conclusion by referring to the principle that “purported conditions on an otherwise negotiable instrument, that merely reflect other provisions of the law, do not vitiate negotiability.” Op. at 609 (citations omitted). The majority contends that the language at issue amounts merely to a restatement of appellant’s statutory defenses against payment where there has been alteration (13 Pa.C.S. § 3407), theft (§ 3306(4)), absence of signature (§ 3401) and forgery (§ 3404). The majority overlooks the fact that all of these statutory defenses are, by their own terms, ineffective against holders in due course. On the other hand, the language at issue here - which categorically states that the money order will not be paid if it was stolen — is operative even against holders who have taken in due course. As noted in the Comment to section 3105(a)(1), conditional language may be fairly construed to mean what it says. By its plain terms, the language at issue here sweeps beyond the scope of appellant’s statutory defenses, and therefore does more than simply “reflect other provisions of the law.”</p>
