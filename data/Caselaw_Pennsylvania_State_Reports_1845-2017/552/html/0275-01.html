The first issue is whether the collectibility of damages in an underlying action is relevant to and, therefore, admissible in a legal malpractice action. The second issue is, if collectibility of damages should be considered, which party bears the burden of proving collectibility. Because we find that collectibility of damages in the underlying action should be considered in a legal malpractice action and that the defendant/attorney bears the burden of proof, we affirm the order of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Kituskie is a Pennsylvania resident who is a practicing periodontist. On September 3,1989, Kituskie was injured in a two-car automobile accident during his vacation in San Jose, California. The traffic collision report for the accident stated that a vehicle being driven by Evan Mark Trapp crossed a highway on-ramp into the path of Kituskie’s automobile after it struck a curb and a cyclone fence. The traffic collision report also indicated that Trapp was driving while intoxicated <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>and that his vehicle was being operated at the time of the accident at a high rate of speed. After the accident, Kituskie returned to the Philadelphia area in order to begin treatment for his injuries. As a result of this automobile accident, Kituskie avers that he suffers from a degenerative and arthritic back condition which makes it difficult for him to work full-time as a periodontist.</p>

Corbman, Esquire, to pursue his claim against Trapp for the personal injuries he sustained in the accident. Corbman is an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a principal/shareholder in the law firm of Garfinkle, Corbman, Greenberg and Jurikson, P.C.

After reviewing the medical reports, Corbman made a claim on Kituskie’s behalf against Trapp’s insurance carrier, California State Automobile Association (“CSAA”). During settlement negotiations with CSAA, Corbman learned that Trapp’s insurance policy had a limit of $25,000.</p>
    <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.7",395,[150,1436,1155,787]]]'>On September 17, 1990, more than one year after the accident, Corbman discovered that the California statute of limitations for injuries such as those suffered by Kituskie was only one year as opposed to the two-year statute of limitations in Pennsylvania. CSAA ultimately informed Corbman that it would not make a settlement offer to Kituskie because the one-year statute of limitations had passed without Corbman instituting a formal legal action. As soon as Corbman learned this information, Corbman met with Kituskie and informed him that his claim had been terminated because no suit was filed or settlement reached within the one-year statute of limitations period. During this meeting, Corbman advised Kituskie to seek the services of another attorney in order to assert a legal malpractice claim against Corbman and the Garfinkle firm.</p>

The Superior Court, in a published opinion, vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings because it held that the collectibility of damages in an underlying case should be considered in a legal malpractice action.

We do so because we recognize that a legal malpractice action is distinctly different from any other type of lawsuit brought in the Commonwealth. A legal malpractice action is different because, as described above, a plaintiff must prove a case within a case since he must initially establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have recovered a judgment in the underlying action (here, the underlying action would have involved Kituskie’s lawsuit against Trapp). It is only after the plaintiff proves he would have recovered a judgment in the underlying action that the plaintiff can then proceed with proof that the attorney he engaged to prosecute or defend the underlying action was negligent in the handling of the underlying action and that negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs loss since it prevented the plaintiff from being properly compensated for his loss.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> However, this Court has held that the plaintiff in a legal action should only be compensated for his actual losses. <em>See Rizzo v.

Actual losses in a legal malpractice action are measured by the judgment the plaintiff lost in the underlying action and the attorney who negligently handled the underlying action is the party held responsible for the lost judgment. However, as noted by the Superior Court, <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>“it would be inequitable for the plaintiff to be able to obtain a judgment against the attorney which is greater than the judgment that the plaintiff could have collected from the third party; the plaintiff would be receiving a windfall at the attorney’s expense.” <em>Kituskie v.

Kituskie argues that if this Court determines that collectibility is an issue in a legal malpractice action, then this Court should apply the rule of law purely prospectively (new rule of law only applied to cases commenced thereafter and not the parties to the case) rather than retroactively (applied to parties to the case and all other cases pending on direct review in which the issue was raised). While retroactive application of a new rule of law is a matter of judicial discretion usually exercised on a case-by-case basis, the general rule is that a decision announcing a new rule of law is applied retroactively so that a party whose case is pending on direct appeal is entitled to the benefit of changes in the law. <em>McHugh v. Litvin, Blumberg, Matusow &amp; Young, </em><a href="/pa/525/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="525 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1823742" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0001-01">525 Pa. 1</a>, 8, <a href="/pa/525/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="525 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1823742" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0001-01">574 A.2d 1040</a>, 1043 (1990). Courts will deviate from the general rule of retroactivity and apply a new rule of law purely prospectively where: (1) the decision to be applied non-retroactively established a new principle of law; (2) a retrospective application will retard application of the old rule of law; and (3) retroactive application will lead to an inequitable result which imposes an injustice or hardship. <em>Blackwell v. State Ethics Commission, </em><a href="/pa/527/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="527 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1827711" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0172-01">527 Pa. 172</a>, 184, <a href="/pa/527/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="527 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1827711" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0172-01">589 A.2d 1094</a>, 1100 (1991). Here, there is no doubt that the Court’s decision injecting collectibility into legal malpractice actions announces a new rule of law. However, retroactive application of this new rule to the present case will not retard an old rule of law since there was no old rule concerning collectibility. Moreover, besides focusing on the burden of conducting additional discovery on the issue of collectibility, Kituskie is unable to articulate, and this Court cannot conceive, how an inequitable result will occur if collectibility is applied to this case on remand. This is especially true since Kituskie admits that he already has prepared an expert to discuss the possibility of collecting a full judgment because of an insurer’s bad faith in anticipation that collectibility would be an issue at trial. Thus, the Court declines to apply the new rule of collectibility in a purely prospective manner. Instead, the new rule of collectibility in legal malpractice actions should comport with the general rule retroactive application so that it is at issue on remand in ihe case <em>sub judice.</em>

Here, Corbman and the Garfinkle firm sought to inject collectibility into this legal malpractice action before, during and after trial. Despite these attempts, the trial court consistently held that uncollectibility was not an issue. Thus, it would have been futile for Corbman and the Garfinkle firm to have sought leave to amend their pleadings. Since this Court has now held that collectibility is an issue in a legal malpractice claim, and since the parties have not supplied this Court with sufficient information to judge if an amendment to the pleadings should be allowed, the trial court on remand should determine if Corbman and the Garfinkle firm should be allowed to amend their New Matter in order to include the affirmative defense of collectibility.</p>
