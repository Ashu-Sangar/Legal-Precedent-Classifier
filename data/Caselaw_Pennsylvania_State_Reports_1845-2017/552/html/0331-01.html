The men blocked the girls’ path and Appellant demanded that the Victim give him her earrings. The girls turned and ran. Appellant followed the Victim and grabbed her in the street. He ripped the earrings from the Victim’s ears, drew a .32 caliber handgun, and shot her in the neck, killing her.</p>

Defense counsel raised three mitigating factors: that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); Appellant’s age at the time of the crime (twenty-one), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); and the general mitigating factor of Appellant’s character and record, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).

This argument is patently without merit. According to the eyewitnesses, prior to shooting the Victim, the killer ripped the earrings from her ears, thereby pulling her head and neck down.
