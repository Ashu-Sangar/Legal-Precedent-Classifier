He asserts that he was either entitled to a continuance during his trial to have the DNA samples tested <a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>by his own expert or, alternatively, that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to obtain the DNA samples sufficiently in advance of trial to have them tested. This Court previously addressed and rejected Crews’ contention regarding the refusal of a mid-trial continuance. <em>See Crews, </em><a href="/pa/536/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="536 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="1843148" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0508-01">536 Pa. at 524</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="640 A.2d 395" data-case-ids="1843148,7862008" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0508-01,/a2d/640/0395-01">640 A.2d at 403</a>. As to Crews’ ineffective assistance allegation, this claim is, effectively, an attempt to relitigate the continuance issue under a different theory. <em>See Christy, </em><a href="/pa/540/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="540 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="472219" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0192-01">540 Pa. at 202</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="656 A.2d 877" data-case-ids="472219,7880936" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0192-01,/a2d/656/0877-01">656 A.2d at 881</a>. In any event, the underlying claim is without merit, as Crews’ own expert did evaluate the DNA samples, and the partial results from that evaluation corroborated the Commonwealth’s results. <em>See Crews, </em><a href="/pa/536/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="536 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="1843148" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0508-01">536 Pa. at 524-25</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="640 A.2d 395" data-case-ids="1843148,7862008" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0508-01,/a2d/640/0395-01">640 A.2d at 405</a>.</p>
