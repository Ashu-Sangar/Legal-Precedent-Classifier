The victim of the crime was eight-year-old Lacy Johnson, daughter of the woman with whom Karenbauer lived. At the penalty phase of the trial, the jury returned a sentence of death. Following the filing and denial of Karenbauer’s post-sentence motions <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>this direct appeal ensued. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b544-9" data-blocks='[["BL_544.10",544,[244,1213,1157,368]]]'>The record reveals that on July 16, 1995, Karenbauer, accompanied by Lacy, drove Nita Johnson, Lacy’s mother, to her place of employment and then returned home. When Karenbauer arrived to pick up Nita at the end of her shift, he told her that Lacy was staying with her maternal grandparents and that he would take her (Nita) out for the evening. Karenbauer and Nita spent the night in a motel.</p>

Nita’s son, Michael Johnson, arrived around noon and told his mother that her parents, with whom he often stayed, were outside in their van. At that point Karenbauer told Nita that in fact Lacy was not with her grandparents but rather that he had allowed her to leave with her father, Nita’s husband. Fearing that her husband had kidnapped Lacy, Nita went outside to talk with her parents. When she returned to the house, Karenbauer was no longer there. Nita and her son went upstairs. As Nita was looking out a bedroom window, trying to spot Karenbauer, Michael said that there were blankets under the bed. The “blankets” turned out to be Lacy’s body, wrapped in a blanket and dressed in wet, blood-soaked cloth<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>ing. A knife handle was found on top of the bed, and the knife blade, which had apparently been snapped off, was later found between the mattress and box springs in the master bedroom. In addition, there were bloodstains on the floor and walls of the room in which Lacy’s body was found, as well as in the bathtub.</p>

New Castle Police Chief Charles Abraham testified that as he and Lieutenant Gagliardo were driving through the neighborhood, they spotted a man who fit Karenbauer’s description, and Chief Abraham asked, “[A]re you Mike?” Karenbauer answered, “[Y]es, I know, I murdered somebody.” Karenbauer then got into the patrol car and was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. When asked whether he wanted to tell what had happened, Karenbauer replied that Lacy “got mouthy” and that he stabbed her “a lot” of times and then held her under water.</p>

They should just shoot me.” She described Karenbauer as crying and upset.</p>

The cause of death, in Dr. Smith’s opinion, was the combination of hemorrhage from the multiple knife wounds, partial asphyxia caused by the collapse of the right lung as the result of a stab wound, and asphyxia caused by drowning. Forensic testimony established that the blood on the knife blade found in the master bedroom carried a genetic marker that was consistent with Lacy’s blood.</p>

In her opinion, Karenbauer’s mental retardation was mild rather than moderate, his diagnosis was that of borderline personality disorder, and, at the time in question, he was able to form a specific intent to kill.</p>

At the penalty hearing, the Commonwealth offered two aggravating circumstances: 1) the crime had been committed by means of torture; and 2) the victim of the crime was under the age of 12. As possible mitigating circumstances, Karenbauer offered the following: 1) the substantial impairment of his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law; 2) his age at the time of the crime (25); and 3) other evidence regarding his character and record, including his learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, mental illness, and remorse, as well as his broken family, his stepfather’s drug and alcohol problems, and the physical and mental abuse that he had sustained at the hands of his stepfather.</p>

Instead, he elected to cause eighteen separate wounds scattered over the victim’s arms, chest, back, head and neck. All of these wounds were of the type discussed by Dr. Smith; not deep enough to cause fatal injury, but certainly deep enough to cause pain to the victim, who remained conscious throughout her ordeal. Defendant even went so far as to draw the knife across the victim’s throat, but he did not cut the victim deeply enough to fatally wound her. We find this particularly significant; Defendant clearly was in a position to wound the victim fatally at the time he inflicted this wound. He elected not to do so. He did, however, at some point subsequent to inflicting stab and incision wounds upon the victim until the knife broke, elect to drown the victim. Again, we find it significant that the victim remained conscious at this point.
