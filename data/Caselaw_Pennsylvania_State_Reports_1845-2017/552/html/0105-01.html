Thus, the records submitted by Sapp Roofing are, indeed, an essential component of the school district’s decision regarding whether and what amount to pay to Sapp Roofing.

The union argues that the payroll records at issue are vital to its efforts to ensure that the school district complied with the Prevailing Wage Act, and that there is a strong public interest in monitoring compliance with that act. Sapp Roofing, on the other hand, contends that the employees’ privacy rights will be infringed by the dissemination of the documents containing employees’ names, home addresses and other personal information. Pennsylvania recognizes the right to privacy in Article I, § 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and this Court often invokes this right to privacy to give greater protection to our citizens than that found in the United States Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b227-4" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[141,1006,1156,683]]]'>We believe that the union overestimates the public interest to be served by disclosure of these records. The disclosure of personal information (names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers) reveals little, if anything, about the government’s (in this case the school district’s) compliance with the Prevailing Wage Act. Indeed, the union here does not explain how the disclosure of this personal information for the purpose of monitoring Prevailing Wage Act compliance overcomes the individual employees’ strong privacy interests. Even if we agree with the union that the public has an interest in enforcing the prevailing wage laws through “monitoring,” the requested information would not enhance enforcement of the Prevailing Wage Act by the government.</p>

Consequently, the only information that the union can access from the school district records is the wage information of Sapp Roofing’s employees.

The Prevailing Wage Act at 43 P.S. § 165-10 further provides that before final payment may be made by or on behalf of a public body for work performed under a contract with that public body, the public body is to obtain statements from the contractor certifying to any unpaid wages due and owing from that contractor to its workers and naming the persons whose wages are unpaid together with the specific amounts due each such person. This particular section deals not with any actual disbursements of monies by the public agency or even a request for the public agency to disburse funds, but rather deals with the record keeping or compliance responsibilities of the public body and the contractor.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[257,1323,1160,744]]]'>There is nothing in this section which would indicate that the required certifications equate to an “account, voucher or contract” evidencing a disbursement of funds by the public agency or that the filing of such certifications propels a disbursement by the public agency for such amounts so as to render the payroll records “public” and thus, obtainable under the Right to Know Act. Indeed, it more clearly addresses monies owed by the contractor and/or subcontractor to their workers and not amounts owed by the public agency. These payroll records constitute neither a record of any business dealings or transactions between Appellant and the School District; accordingly, they are neither a “voucher” nor an “account.” And, they certainly do not evidence any “contract” between the School District and Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[257,2109,1157,259]]]'>In short, I do not believe that the payroll records in question evidence any disbursements or agreements to disburse monies by the School District and that, therefore, it was error for the lower courts to permit the Union access to those records under the guise of The Right to Know Act.</p>
