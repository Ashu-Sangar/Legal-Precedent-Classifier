The first issue is whether a proposed use in a land development application to operate a “Turf Club” which would offer food and beverage service as well as wagering on simulcasted horse races constitutes a permitted restaurant use under the Concord Township Zoning Ordinance. If the proposed Turf Club constitutes a permitted restaurant use, the second issue is whether the wagering component of the proposed Turf Club constitutes a permitted accessory use by right under the Concord Township Zoning Ordinance. Because we find that the proposed Turf Club constitutes a permitted restaurant use and the wagering com<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>ponent constitutes a permitted accessory use under the Concord Township Zoning Ordinance, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b185-5" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[167,491,1153,795]]]'>The underlying history giving rise to the instant dispute is that on July 26, 1993, Route 1 Associates, in association with Greenwood Racing, Inc. and Brandywine Turf Club, Inc. (collectively, “Applicants”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> filed a land development application with Concord Township. Applicants sought to convert a twenty-thousand square foot motion picture facility on a 7.9 acre parcel of land located at the intersection of U.S. Route 1 and Brinton Lake Road in Concord Township, Delaware County into what they designated as a “Turf Club.” The proposed Turf Club facility would devote 75% of its building space to a restaurant/bar and 25% of its building space to offtrack wagering of simulcasted horse racing. The property subject to the application is zoned as a C-3 Commercial Services District (“C-3 District”) by the Concord Township Zoning Ordinance (“Zoning Ordinance”).</p>

The Zoning Ordinance neither expressly allows nor expressly prohibits off-track wagering facilities in a C-3 District.

On November 2, 1993, the Board held a public hearing on Applicants’ preliminary plan. At the hearing, the Board received oral testimony and/or written reports from Concord Town<a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>ship’s legal counsel, an engineer, an architect, a sewage enforcement officer, the sewer authority and the fire marshal.

Subsequent to the filing of these appeals, but prior to the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas’ ruling, Applicants submitted a final land development plan for the proposed Turf Club. On April 5, 1994, the Board approved the final plan by a 3-to-l vote. Southco and Contact II also filed a joint appeal to the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas upon the Board’s approval of the final plan.</p>

The court also found that the off-track wagering portion of the proposed Turf Club was an accessory use to the restaurant because the wagering aspect was a form of entertainment activity similar to other forms of entertainment which are “customarily incidental” to that offered by other restaurants in Concord Township.</p>

Section 2302.A.3 of the Zoning Ordinance provides that a building in a C-3 <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>District can be used by right as a restaurant. Section 104 of the Zoning Ordinance defines a restaurant as <em>“a </em>business devoted to the sale and consumption of food and beverages and consumed only inside the building while patrons are seated at counters or tables.” The Zoning Ordinance contains no further definitional refinements of what constitutes a restaurant. Moreover, the Zoning Ordinance does not expressly limit a restaurant to a business which is exclusively dedicated to serving food and beverages. Instead, the Zoning Ordinance only requires that the business be “devoted” to the sale and consumption' of food and beverages. The word “devote,” as ordinarily defined in Webster’s Second New World Dictionary 387 (1986), is as follows: “to give up (oneself or one’s time, energy, etc.) to some purpose, activity or person.” Since the plain meaning of the word “devote” generally does not connote exclusivity, Applicants’ proposed Turf Club would qualify as a permitted restaurant use by right if it will devote a significant amount of time, money and energy towards the sale and consumption of food and beverages.</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[220,1353,1160,1013]],["BL_189.1",189,[162,313,1155,359]]]'>Here, the evidence demonstrated that Applicants’ proposed Turf Club would utilize 75% of the building solely for the sale and consumption of food and beverage. Included within this 75% exclusive utilization were plans for a cafeteria-style food court with seating, a full-service eating establishment with a seating capacity for one hundred persons and a food preparation area with commercial-size cold storage equipment, ovens and stoves. Also, Applicants’ plan showed that the proposed Turf Club was capable of providing food and beverage service facilities for private parties and banquets. Moreover, Applicants’ plan called for a majority of the proposed employees to be utilized exclusively for the sale of food and beverages. Included within the proposed employees was a trained executive chef to oversee all the food preparation as well as thirty to forty other support personnel (such as waiters, cooks, hostesses and bartenders), whose only jobs would be in the food and beverage portion of the proposed Turf Club. Applicants’ assertion that the majority of employees would be involved in the food and beverage aspect was supported by evidence <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>showing that the majority of employees at two other Turf Clubs operated by Greenwood Racing were exclusively involved in the sale and consumption of food and beverages. Based on these facts, it appears that Applicants’ proposed Turf Club would devote a significant amount of space, manpower and money towards the sale and consumption of food and beverages.</p>
    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[162,706,1154,1099]]]'>Despite the above, Southco and Contact II argue that Applicants’ proposed Turf Club cannot constitute a permitted restaurant use because the majority of its revenue will be generated from the Turf Club’s wagering component. However, for purposes of zoning, the manner in which an establishment derives its income is not determinative of the establishment’s principal use. <em>Philm Corp. v.

Therefore, even though the wagering component will generate significant revenue, the totality of the evidence demonstrates that Applicants’ proposed Turf Club will devote a large amount of building space, manpower and energy towards the restaurant component of the Turf Club. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court correctly held that the Board did not err as a matter of law in concluding that Applicants’ proposed Turf Club constituted a permitted restaurant use by right under the Zoning Ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.6",189,[160,1839,1154,255]],["BL_190.1",190,[226,306,1159,954]]]'>Since the Board did not err as a matter of law in determining that the proposed Turf Club constituted a permitted restaurant use, we must now examine whether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the Board’s conclusion that the wagering component of the proposed Turf Club constitut<a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>ed a permitted accessory use by right pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance. Section 2302.A.15 of the Zoning Ordinance provides that a building in a C-3 District may have an accessory use by right. Section 104 of the Zoning Ordinance defines an accessory use as “a use conducted on the same lot as, and subordinate to, a principal use to which it is related (which use is clearly incidental to and customarily found) in connection with a particular principal use.” Thus, in order to establish that the wagering component of the Turf Club constitutes an accessory use by right, Applicants must prove: (1) that the wagering component is secondary to the use of the property as a restaurant; and (2) that the wagering component is customarily incidental to properties used as restaurants. Moreover, as previously noted, the interpretation of whether the proposed Turf Club’s wagering component constitutes an accessory use is a question of law and the Zoning Ordinance must be interpreted broadly in order to allow Applicants the broadest possible use of their land.</p>

Also, the majority of the employees will be dedicated to the restaurant portion of the proposed Turf Club rather than the wagering component. Moreover, the fact that the wagering component of a Turf Club is secondary to, or dependent upon a restaurant is supported by legislation found at the Race Horse Industry Reform Act (the “Act”), 4 P.S. § 325.101, <em>et seq. </em>The Act allows only simulcasting and wagering at facilities other than a racetrack where that facility will offer “high class restaurants.” 4 P.S. § 325.218(g)(5)(h). Also, the Act is designed not only to create jobs in the wagering industry, but also to create jobs such as “parking attendants, waiters and waitresses, security guards, custodial workers and food service personnel.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=658%20A.2d%20798" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="658 A.2d 798">Id.</a> </em>Further, the regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act will not allow approval of a Turf Club facility unless the facility contains a restaurant providing table service and menu items including appetizers, <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>entrees and desserts. 58 Pa.Code. § 171.25(c)(2). Thus, the Act itself demonstrates that the wagering aspect of the Turf Club is dependant on, and subordinate to, the restaurant, since the Act clearly does not envision or permit a facility allowing wagering to exist without a restaurant such as that proposed by Applicants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Accordingly, the evidence produced by Applicants shows that the wagering component of the proposed Turf Club is secondary to the restaurant component.</p>

Moreover, as noted above, state regulations envision the wagering component of a Turf Club like that proposed by Applicants as being customarily incidental to a restaurant since the regulations will not allow approval of such a facility without a restaurant. Thus, Applicants produced sufficient evidence to support the “customarily incidental” prong of the accessory use test. Therefore, since this Court is required to broadly interpret a permitted use by right in a Zoning Ordinance so as to allow a landowner the broadest possible use of the land, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court correctly held that the Board did not err in finding that the wagering component of Applicants’ proposed Turf Club constituted a permissible accessory use by right to the restaurant component.</p>
