For instance, (1) children under age 14, with limited exceptions, may not be employed; (2) minors between age 14 and 16 are employable, as long as such employment does not interfere with school; children in this age group are prohibited from working in manufacturing or mechanical occupations; and (3) minors between 16 and 18 are barred from certain occupations, but can work during the entire year. See 43 P.S. §§ 41-71.</p>

It should be noted that the minor in <em>Rudy, </em>unlike the Claimant in this case, misrepresented to his employer that he was over eighteen years of age, so as to obtain employment. While the <em>Rudy </em>court held that such misrepresentation did not bear on the question before it, the court noted that to permit double recovery under these circumstances would allow "claimant’s wards [to] benefit to the extent of over $10,000 as the fruits of decedent's deceit and fraud.” <em>Rudy, </em><a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20250" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="35 A.2d 250">35 A.2d at 252</a>.</p>

Significantly, the court in <em>Rudy </em>recognized a recent legislative amendment reducing the amount of additional compensation to be paid pursuant to Section 320(a) from double compensation to 10%. See Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 520. Rather than conclude that any such amendment would violate the constitutional provisions at issue before it, the court merely stated that the amendment did not apply to the facts in <em>Rudy </em>because it constituted a change impacting substantive rights and could not, therefore, be applied retroactively.</p>
