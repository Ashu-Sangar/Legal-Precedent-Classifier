The <em>Ellis </em>court stated that all damages recoverable under a wrongful death action in Alabama are punitive and survive the death of the tortfeasor. The court further determined that the legislature intended to allow the recovery of punitive damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate in order to deter others in similar situations. Therefore, the court concluded that punitive damages also survive the death of the tortfeasor and may be recovered from his estate in actions other than wrongful death actions.</p>

In <em>Schwab, </em>the trial court granted punitive damages against the estate of a decedent who injured the plaintiff when he was driving while intoxicated. The Schwab court first noted that our courts have long recognized that the estate of a deceased plaintiff may recover punitive damages from a defendant. When determining whether the converse was true, the court weighed the possible harm that may be suffered by the family of the deceased defendant against the harm that could be prevented if driving while intoxicated is deterred. Finding that the interest in deterring drunk driving prevailed, the court concluded that the award of punitive damages was proper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> We are persuaded by this approach.</p>

By distributing photographs of G.J.D. performing sexual acts, Thebes unquestionably violated GJ.D.’s right to privacy, which is one of the most highly regarded rights in this Commonwealth. His distribution of these photographs, along with G.J.D.’s name, telephone number, and language indicating that she was a prostitute, is nothing short of outrageous. The dissemination of the materials followed a pattern of behavior whereby Thebes, while residing with G. J.D., physical<a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>ly and psychologically abused her and her children. Thebes’s acts of domestic violence are no less egregious than drunk driving. To the extent that it may reasonably be done, the law should be applied so as to have a deterrent effect on such conduct.</p>

The question of whether punitive damages are appropriate in a particular case should be resolved by the trier of fact considering the nature of the acts committed.</p>
    <p id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[253,1033,1158,677]]]'>We base our decision on several reasons. First, the death of the tortfeasor does not completely thwart the purposes underlying the award of punitive damages. As noted, punitive damages are awarded to punish a defendant for certain outrageous acts and to deter him <em>or others </em>from engaging in similar conduct. <em>Kirkbride v. Lisbon Contractors Inc., </em><a href="/pa/521/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="521 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1817480" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0097-01">521 Pa. 97</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="521 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1817480" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0097-01">555 A.2d 800</a> (1989).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Although the decedent, Darwin Thebes, will not be punished or deterred from committing further perverse and egregious acts, the imposition of punitive damages upon his estate may serve to deter others from engaging in like conduct. The deterrent effect on the conduct of others is no more speculative in the instant case than in cases where the tortfeasor is alive.</p>
    <p id="b292-7" data-blocks='[["BL_292.7",292,[252,1743,1157,417]],["BL_293.1",293,[145,313,1153,578]]]'>Second, we are not persuaded by the proposition that imposing punitive damages will punish only the innocent beneficiaries of the estate. The heirs of the decedent tortfeasor are in essentially the same financial position as if the tortfeasor were living at the time damages were awarded. When punitive damages are awarded against a living tortfeasor, the award reduces the amount of the tortfeasor’s assets, thus reducing the amount of funds available to the tortfeasor’s <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>family and ultimately reducing the amount of his estate. When a tortfeasor is deceased at the time punitive damages are awarded, the award directly reduces the amount of the estate. The actual difference between the effect of the punitive damages award on the deceased tortfeasor’s heirs and a living tortfeasor’s family is minimal. To allow a tortfeasor’s estate to escape payment of punitive damages would be comparable to the injustice of allowing a defendant to transfer his wealth to his prospective heirs and beneficiaries prior to the trial of a case in which punitive damages are sought against him.</p>

The jury can be instructed, as was done in the instant case, that the award of punitive damages is being imposed against the estate. Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instruction (Civ.) § 14.01 provides for the availability of punitive damages against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor.

Yet in the face of conclusions by the overwhelming majority of jurists and legal scholars who have considered this matter, the majority, in my view, incorrectly concludes that punitive damages are recoverable from a deceased tortfeasor’s estate. This conclusion rests primarily on the unsupported assertions that even though dead tortfeasors <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>can be neither punished nor deterred, imposing punitive damages on their estates <em>may </em>serve to deter others and that this deterrent effect is no more speculative than when the tortfeasor is still alive. The very fact that such damages may (or may not) deter others renders this hoped for general deterrent effect purely speculative.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[260,674,1158,480]]]'>Citing established Pennsylvania case law, Mr. Justice Zappala has observed that punitive damages are “purely penal in nature.” This penal nature of punitive damages results in the availability of a quasi-criminal sanction in civil proceedings. That is, unlike civil compensatory damage awards which serve to compensate those who have been wronged for injuries sustained, punitive, or exemplary, damages impose punishment and make an example of the offender, a function normally reserved for criminal law.</p>
    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[257,1197,1161,699]]]'>The specific and general deterrent effects of punitive damages are inextricably linked to this quasi-criminal penal nature. The tortfeasor is specifically deterred because of the punishment of some penal sanction imposed directly upon him, and other potential tortfeasors may be generally deterred because they are made aware of a risk of such sanctions being imposed directly upon them through observation of the punishment of others. There is little question that one who has been sufficiently punished for wrongdoing will be deterred from undertaking similar acts in the future. However, the effectiveness of general deterrence upon potential future wrongdoers is highly questionable and dependant upon numerous, sometimes intangible, variables.</p>
    <p id="b294-7" data-blocks='[["BL_294.7",294,[257,1939,1157,414]]]'>The most obvious factor upon which general deterrence depends is that in order for a potential wrongdoer to be effectively deterred by some penal sanction he must be aware that the sanction exists.

Most wrongdoers, I suggest, do not give such consideration to their actions. For those who do, the risk of punishment is outweighed by the perceived benefit of their actions up to the point where the probability of punishment increases the risk factor to an unacceptable level; they believe they will get away with it. To illustrate, most drivers are aware that exceeding the speed limit is punishable by fines in proportion to the excess in speed. To use an example, many drivers, in order to save some time, are willing to take a chance and exceed the posted limit up to the point that the probability that they will be caught and fined exceeds any perceived benefit of time saved. They are unwilling to go any faster, not because of the severity of the penalty, but because <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>they are more certain that they will be caught and a penalty will be imposed.</p>

Other than individuals who have had some exposure to legal matters, most people are simply unfamiliar with the concepts and processes of civil law. While they may have a vague idea that certain conduct might subject them to a civil suit, they do not truly understand the consequences of their potentially tortious actions other than the chance that they may be sued and “fined” in the form of damages; it is highly unlikely that the average individual distinguishes between compensatory and punitive damage awards. It is even less likely that such a person, even if aware of the difference between compensatory and punitive damages, would possess any reasonable level of certainty that his conduct will subject him, or his estate should he die, to punitive sanctions. Any deterrent effect he may experience is more likely to derive simply from the risk of having to defend himself in a lawsuit (along with the associated cost) and the potential of having to pay damages, without regard to whether they are compensatory or punitive.</p>

While it is true in a case like this that there is no difference between the amount of funds available to the future estate of a living tortfeasor and those available to the estate of the same tortfeasor who predeceases the award of punitive damages, the majority fails to grasp an important distinction.</p>

Particularly, since he is not deceased they have no vested interest in his future estate; <em>nemo est haeres viventis </em>(a living person has no heirs) — they are not yet ascertained. Most importantly, the primary goals of punitive damages have been achieved. The tortfeasor has been punished and, presumably, deterred; he now serves as an example to others in the hope that they too may be deterred.</p>

To inflict a quasi-criminal punishment upon these innocent parties on the basis of something as hypothetical and nebulous as general deterrence is illogical and manifestly unjust. The only difference between imposing criminal penalties on the survivors of deceased convicts and the imposition of punitive damages on a deceased tortfeasor’s estate is that the tortfeasor’s survivors cannot avail themselves of the constitutional protec<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>tions afforded a convict’s survivors.
