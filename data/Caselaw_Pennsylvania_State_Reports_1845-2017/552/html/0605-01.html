The Borough refused to acknowledge the FOP as Alcaraz’s representative and indicated that it had no duty to bargain collectively with the representative of a one-person bargaining unit. On September 10, 1992, the FOP declared an impasse and named its arbitrator and requested the Borough to do the same in order to proceed to binding interest arbitration in accordance with Section 4 of Act 111, 43 P.S. § 217.4. The Borough again refused, contending that it did not recognize the FOP as Alcaraz’s representative and claiming it did not have a duty to proceed to interest arbitration. The Borough offered, however, to negotiate with Alcaraz directly.</p>

Alcaraz initiated a mandamus action on January 7, 1993 in the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County (Court of Common Pleas) to compel the Borough to engage in interest arbitration.</p>

The discharge, according to the Mayor, was based on conduct alleged against Alcaraz in a Protection From Abuse petition (PFA) filed in October of 1991. The Borough conducted a hearing on April 7, 1993 at Alcaraz’s request, in order for him to address the charges. At the hearing, Alcaraz explained that in October of 1991 his former fiancee had instituted <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>proceedings against him to obtain a PFA, but that the proceedings ended with an agreement by both parties to refrain from further contact with one another, without either party admitting any acts of misconduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Council nevertheless sustained the charges against Alcaraz and terminated his employment.</p>

The court amended its Order to permit the Borough to file an immediate appeal. The Borough appealed to the Commonwealth Court. In a Memorandum Opinion, the Commonwealth Court vacated the Order of the Court of Common Pleas, holding that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter, and transferring the case to the PLRB. Alcaraz filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal with this Court, which we granted.

The hearing examiner ordered the Borough to cease and desist from discriminating with respect to hire and tenure, and to offer Alcaraz unconditional reinstatement to his former position without prejudice to any rights or privileges. He further ordered the Borough to make Alcaraz whole for any losses and wages, seniority or other benefits, together with back pay and interest.

The PLRB also argues that because Section 1 of Act 111 requires fifty percent of the bargaining unit to designate the bargaining representative, 43 P.S. § 217.1, this necessarily excludes a bargaining unit of one person.

The fifty percent requirement for selection of a bargaining representative does not prohibit unanimous selection, nor does it indicate that at least two people are required to choose the representative.
