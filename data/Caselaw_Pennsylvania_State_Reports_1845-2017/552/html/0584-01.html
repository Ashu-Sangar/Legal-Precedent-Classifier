Because we find that the validity of the judgments was previously litigated before the trial courts and before this Court, we hold that the Superior Court exceeded its scope of review and reverse the Superior Court’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b701-8" data-blocks='[["BL_701.10",701,[171,1234,1153,474]]]'>This matter has a long and tortured history in the courts of this Commonwealth and in the federal bankruptcy courts over the last sixteen years. On May 20, 1982, a jury verdict in the amount of $1,436,489 was rendered in favor of appellant and against the parents of appellees. In 1983, appellant sought to garnish property of the parents in appellees’ possession.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellees failed to answer garnishment interrogatories; therefore, on August 26, 1983, default judgments were entered against each of the appellees in the amount of $1,436,489.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>On September 7, 1983, appellees filed petitions to open default judgments requesting that the judgments be stricken or opened. Appellees claimed that the prothonotary had no authority to enter judgment against them and that they had been denied due process because the trial court failed to conduct an assessment of damages hearing in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. 3146.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On September 28, 1983, the trial court denied appellees’ petitions to • strike and ordered them to proceed by deposition on their petitions to open in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. 209(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellees neither appealed the denial of their petitions to strike nor took further action on their petitions to open.</p>

On July 1, 1988, appellees filed preliminary objections which the trial court dismissed on November 22, 1988, finding that appellees were attacking the validity of the judgments which can only properly be accomplished either through motions to strike or petitions to open. In response to the dismissal of the preliminary objections, on January 5, 1989, appellees filed a petition to open default judgment and/or strike judgment liens, once again claiming that the prothonotary had no authority to enter judgment against them and that they had been denied due process because the trial court failed to conduct an assessment of damages hearing in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. 3146. The trial court dismissed the petition holding that, because appellees alleged the same grounds for relief as those raised in their 1983 petitions and because they failed to proceed with <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>those petitions, they were precluded from attacking the validity of the judgments.</p>

Appellees then filed a petition for allowance of appeal which this Court denied on April 1, 1991.</p>

On November 14, 1991, the trial court, on motion of appellant, struck the petitions on the grounds of laches and res judicata finding the validity of the original and revival judgments had been fully litigated and affirmed on appeal. Appellees did not appeal the November 14, 1991 order striking their petitions.</p>

The Superior Court agreed with the trial court that the petition should be denied based on res judicata, but nevertheless reviewed the <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>merits of the Rule 3146 argument and vacated the trial court’s order on equitable grounds.</p>

Their petitions to strike were denied, and the trial court ordered appellees to take discovery on their petitions to open. Appellees did not pursue any appellate remedies regarding the petitions to strike and abandoned their petitions to open. At that point, the order of the trial court denying the petitions to strike became a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction on their petitions to strike and, therefore, on the Rule 3146 issue.</p>

In 1983, a final and valid judgment was entered against appellees, and the doctrine of res judicata applies to appellees’ subsequent filings seeking to relitigate the identical issue. The interests of justice do not require that appellees be permitted yet another opportunity to present their challenge to the court; rather, the interests of justice mandate that this litigation be ended and that appellant finally obtain the relief it was granted sixteen years ago. To rule otherwise would strip the doctrine of res judicata of any meaning.</p>
