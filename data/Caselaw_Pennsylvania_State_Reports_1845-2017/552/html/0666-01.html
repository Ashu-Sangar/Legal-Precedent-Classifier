As we find that the confidential informant’s tip, alone, did not establish probable cause, we must further address whether there was sufficient corroboration of the tip by the police to establish probable cause.

On June 5, 1994, Lieutenant Goshert received a telephone call from a confidential informant who had previously provided information leading to approximately fifty arrests. On this particular date, the informant reported that two individuals were selling drugs from an abandoned garage. The informant stated that he had viewed O.A. (hereafter Appellant) with drugs for sale in his possession. He described Appellant as being a tall, dark-skinned male in his late teens, and noted that Appellant was wearing a long black windbreaker and shorts. According to <a id="p671" href="#p671" data-label="671" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*671</a>the informant, Appellant was accompanied by an Hispanic male, who held the money for Appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The officers did not observe any drug activity before they entered the garage. Upon entering the garage they saw eight men, the majority of whom were Hispanic. Officer Holland approached Appellant because he matched the description given by the informant as the person who possessed the drugs. He ordered Appellant to stand against the wall and to raise his hands. Officer Holland then reached into Appellant’s pocket, seizing packets of what turned out to be marijuana.</p>

The trial court found that the charges of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30), and criminal conspiracy, 18 Pa.C.S. § 903, were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

Therefore, corroboration of the informant’s tip was not required in this case. In reaching this decision, the Superior Court panel relied primarily upon this court’s plurality decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

Specifically, Appellant challenges the legality of his search and seizure pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Appellant argues that the Superior Court’s decision in the case <em>sub judice </em>effectively erodes the “totality of the circumstances test” by condoning a finding of probable cause based solely upon the bare assertion of a confidential informant. Appellant contends that given the lack of independent corroboration by the arresting officers, the information provided by this confidential informant was insufficient to establish the requisite probable cause. More specifically, the information provided to the police was limited to a description of a person matching Appellant and a location. The confidential informant provided no information as to when the informant saw drugs on Appellant or if he observed any drug transactions. According to Appellant, this is insufficient under both the Fourth Amendment and Article 1, Section 8.</p>

According to the Commonwealth, the reliability of the confidential informant was established by the assertion of the police officer that this informant had led to fifty arrests on prior occasions. Moreover, the Commonwealth asserts that the tip was detailed and specific as to the identity of both the location of the purported criminal activity and the description of Appellant. Therefore, according to the Commonwealth, the tip provided sufficient indicia of reliability to furnish the arresting officers with information at the time of the arrest to satisfy the totality of the circumstances test.

Nonetheless, any analysis of the relevant circumstances must consider that “the detached scrutiny of a neutral magistrate, is a more reliable safeguard against improper searches than the hurried judgment of a law enforcement officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.” <em>United States v. Leon, </em><a href="/us/468/0897-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="468 U.S. 897" data-case-ids="11340969" data-case-paths="/us/468/0897-01">468 U.S. 897</a>, 913-4, <a href="/us/468/0897-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="468 U.S. 897" data-case-ids="11340969" data-case-paths="/us/468/0897-01">104 S.Ct. 3405</a>, 3415-3416 <a href="/us/468/0897-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="468 U.S. 897" data-case-ids="11340969" data-case-paths="/us/468/0897-01">82 L.Ed.2d 677</a>, 692-693 (1984). Thus, the usual deference given by a court to an issuing magistrate’s probable cause determination is lacking in the instant case. See <em>Commonwealth v.

The majority states that a police officer’s "bare assertion” that an informant has "provided reliable information in the past” cannot support a finding of reliability. The majority apparently believes that the testimony of a police officer is not to be trusted until supporting documents have breathed credibility into that testimony. This seems to me to flatly ignore the United States Supreme Court’s admonition regarding probable cause determinations that "the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.” <em>Gates, <a href="/us/462/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="462 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="6187462" data-case-paths="/us/462/0213-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/us/462/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="462 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="6187462" data-case-paths="/us/462/0213-01">462 U.S. at 235</a>, <a href="/us/462/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="462 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="6187462" data-case-paths="/us/462/0213-01">103 S.Ct. 2317</a>. Unlike the majority, I am willing to give the police officer in this case, who was well versed in the field of law enforcement, the benefit of his experience in dealing with this informant and credit his own evaluation of the information which led to the fifty prior arrests. I am even willing to make the apparently bold assumption that had the information leading to the fifty prior arrests proved suspect, the officer would have had the good sense not to deem similar information reliable here. The majority asserts that it is not questioning the reliability of police officers, but simply requiring "objective” facts by which a reviewing court can conclude that the information provided by officers was reliable. In other words, a police officer who testified that an informant’s prior tips had led to hundreds of convictions would still require independent corroboration if the tip was to support a finding of probable cause. I fail to see how the majority’s conclusion in this regard does not amount to a categorical indictment of the trustworthiness of police officers.</p>

The majority discounts the informant’s first-hand observation by seizing on the fact that the informant did not state <em>how </em>he had made the observation - whether it was, for example, by looking out of a window or by viewing the drugs in close proximity. I fail to see the relevance of the manner in which the informant made the observation given the police officer’s testimony that he had dealt with the informant repeatedly and always found his asserted observations to be reliable.</p>

The majority neglects to heed its own admonition that "the totality of the circumstances test is the same whether used for determining the existence of probable cause for the magistrate’s issuance of a search warrant or a police officer’s determination that a warrantless arrest is justified.” Maj. Opin. at 496. In any event, like the magistrate in <em>Jones, </em>the suppression court in this case heard the testimony of the relevant witnesses and properly determined that the police officer's testimony could be credited, and thus that probable cause to arrest existed as it did in <em>Jones.</em>

It is difficult to ascertain how the presence of additional men other than those described by the informant undermines the informant’s veracity. The informant presumably believed that the police were only interested in a description of those people whom he saw engaged in criminal activity. The location and attire of innocent persons is generally not 51 matter of great concern to police officers.</p>

Although my dissent in this matter is based primarily on the majority’s misinterpretation of <em>Gates, <a href="/us/462/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="462 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="6187462" data-case-paths="/us/462/0213-01">supra,</a> </em>I would be remiss if I did not comment on the majority’s remarkable belief that the conclusion reached by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/542/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="542 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="458760" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0418-01">542 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/pa/542/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="668 A.2d 114" data-case-ids="458760,7860616" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0418-01,/a2d/668/0114-01">668 A.2d 114</a> (1995), lacks precedential weight simply because the lead opinion in <em>Jones </em>was a plurality opinion (Zappala, J., concurred in result). Contrary to the majority’s belief, in cases which produce a majority of Justices in support of one result but only a plurality in support of the lead opinion, courts traditionally attach precedential value to the nar<a id="p692" href="#p692" data-label="692" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*692</a>rawest holding on which the majority necessarily agreed in order to reach the end result. <em>See </em>Mark Alan Thurmon, Note, <em>When the Court Divides: Reconsidering the Precedential Value of Supreme Court Plurality Decisions, </em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20Duke%20L.J.%20419" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="42 Duke L.J. 419">42 Duke L.J. 419</a>, 449 (1992) (citations omitted). Applying that reasoning here, it is clear that, in <em>Jones, </em>a majority of the Justices of this Court necessarily agreed that an informant’s tip supplies probable cause for an arrest when the informant states that he has personally observed illegal narcotics sales and a police officer swears under oath that the informant has been reliable in the past. <em>See Jones, supra, </em><a href="/pa/542/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="542 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="458760" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0418-01">542 Pa. at 424-25</a>, <a href="/pa/542/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="668 A.2d 114" data-case-ids="458760,7860616" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0418-01,/a2d/668/0114-01">668 A.2d at 117-18</a>. Thus, under <em>Jones, </em>it is clear that the officers in this matter had probable cause at the time of the arrest. The majority’s discomfort with its own attempt to characterize <em>Jones </em>as non-precedential is evidenced by its concomitant attempt to distinguish <em>Jones </em>on the merits. However, as explained <em>supra, </em>n. 4, this attempt fails.</p>
