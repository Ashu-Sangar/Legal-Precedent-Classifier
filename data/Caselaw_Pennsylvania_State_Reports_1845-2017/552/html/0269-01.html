The Court allowed this appeal to consider what evidence a plaintiff must have to survive summary judgment under Pennsylvania’s Dram Shop Act, 47 P.S. § 4-497, which imposes liability upon bars for <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>harm resulting from service of alcohol to visibly intoxicated patrons.

While I agree that there was no direct evidence of such intoxication, as seen in the above cases, other circumstantial evidence is probative of the patron’s appearance at the bar. Here, there is evidence that Harry Smith drank five screwdrivers at the bar, drove on the highway in the opposite direction that he needed to go, lost control of his vehicle, and was visibly intoxicated at the accident scene. Appellants also have obtained an expert report analyzing Smith’s blood alcohol content.

However, the Superior Court’s requirement in this case that an injured third party, who was not at the bar, produce evidence of the patron’s appearance there, essentially extinguishes the cause of action created by the legislature. In addition, in cases where a bartender serves a lone patron in an otherwise empty bar, it would be impossible to establish that the patron was served while visibly intoxicated without circumstantial evidence.
