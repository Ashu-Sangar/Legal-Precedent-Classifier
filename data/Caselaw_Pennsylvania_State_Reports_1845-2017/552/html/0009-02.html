    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[146,469,1150,205]]]'>This is an appeal from a memorandum decision of Superior Court which affirmed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County denying a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 et seq.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.7",127,[145,712,1152,473]]]'>In 1983, the appellant, Guy Thomas Grazier, was convicted of kidnapping. The conviction arose from an incident in which eyewitnesses saw appellant and his co-defendant, Bruce Thomas, carry a body out of Thomas’ apartment, place it in the trunk of Thomas’ car, and drive away. Several hours later the body of Thomas’ girlfriend, Teresa Forlastro, was found in a lake. She had been shot through the head. Appellant was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to ten to twenty years imprisonment for his participation in this crime.</p>
    <p id="b127-6" data-blocks='[["BL_127.8",127,[144,1223,1151,312]]]'>In 1986, Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. Appellant subsequently filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for relief pursuant to the PCHA. Counsel was appointed and an amended petition was filed. Counsel was then granted leave to withdraw and another counsel was appointed. Ultimately, in 1995, the PCHA court dismissed the petition.</p>
    <p id="b127-7" data-blocks='[["BL_127.9",127,[142,1572,1157,529]],["BL_128.1",128,[238,323,1156,97]]]'>Appellant filed a timely <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal to Superior Court. Soon thereafter he filed a <em>pro se </em>brief, but the brief was returned to him with a notice that the date for filing briefs had not yet been scheduled by the court. Appellant filed several petitions to remove counsel and proceed <em>pro se. </em>The court denied the first of these and referred it to counsel. A second petition to remove counsel and proceed <em>pro se </em>was filed. Counsel then filed a brief on appellant’s behalf. The latter petition was referred to counsel. A third petition, seeking to file a <em>pro se </em>brief and proceed without counsel, was <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>subsequently filed. It, too, was referred to counsel. On January 10, 1997, the order of the PCHA court was affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[236,443,1157,204]]]'>The present appeal commenced when appellant filed a timely <em>pro se </em>petition for allowance of appeal and a petition to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Counsel filed a petition for leave to withdraw. We granted all of these petitions.</p>
    <p id="b128-6" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[235,678,1159,957]]]'>At issue is whether Superior Court erred in its disposition of appellant’s petitions to remove counsel and proceed <em>pro se. </em>When the court denied the first such petition and referred it and the subsequent petitions to counsel, the stated basis for its action was <em>Commonwealth v.
