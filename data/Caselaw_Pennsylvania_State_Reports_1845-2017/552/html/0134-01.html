Energy Production then began to explore alternative markets. It entered into discussions with potential customers within a twenty mile radius of its leasehold, including Bethlehem Steel Corporation. As a result of these discussions, Energy Production and Bethlehem Steel entered into an agreement for the sale of gas, which was to be delivered by truck. Although Peoples Natural Gas Co. had supplied natural gas to Bethlehem Steel since 1945, Bethlehem Steel was interested in the possibility of purchasing some of its natural gas from Energy Production because of its ongoing program to reduce its natural gas costs. No gas was delivered under the contract, however, because Energy Production could not resolve economic difficulties with the transport company.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Commonwealth Court agreed with the commission that Energy Production was ready to serve all members of the public to the extent of its capacity, and that Energy Production, in making solicitations for business from customers other than Bethlehem both before and after the completion of the pipeline, was acting on behalf of itself and the Bessie 8 joint venture. In essence, the Commonwealth Court determined that the Bessie 8 joint venturers were holding themselves out as ready and willing to build other pipelines and find other sources of natural gas to service other individual industries.

Apart from Bethlehem Steel, no one accepted the proposals, nor were the proposals in a form that they could have been accepted. They were mere business discussions, negotiations. Had another entity apart from Bethlehem Steel accepted a proposal from Energy Production or had Energy Production taken definite steps to engage in the utility business — as distinct from explorations as to whether it might want to engage in the public utility business — we might reach a different result. But where the main activity which occurs is negotiation concerning the <em>possibility </em>of public utility activity, there has been no public utility activity.

The PUC in its brief contends that it is not in the public interest to allow Bessie 8 to place its pipeline in public rights of way outside the regulatory purview of the PUC. These concerns are misplaced. It is for the legislature, not the PUC or this court to determine what business activity comes within the purview of the PUC. Because the legislature has determined that businesses which do not provide service to or for the public are not public utilities, and the businesses at issue in this case do not provide service to or for the public, we are constrained to determine that they are not subject to regulation by the PUC.

Although the Commonwealth Court agreed that the Bessie 8 joint venture was a public utility, it rejected the commission's determination that Bessie 8 could market natural gas to other customers pursuant to the Bethlehem contract if it secured Bethlehem’s approval. Contrary to the commission’s finding, the Commonwealth Court determined that there is no provision in the contract concerning Bethlehem’s approval of other customers. Rather, the contract provides that the pipeline is to be used solely for the transportation of natural gas to be purchased by Bethlehem.</p>
