The Workers’ Compensation Judge granted the claim petition in a decision dated May 16, 1995. Employer, HMT Construction Services, appealed to the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“Board”) arguing that the testimony of Appellee’s medical witness was equivocal. Employer’s appeal was received by the Board on June 7, 1995. However, the envelope containing the appeal reflects a private postage meter stamp which bears no date as it was not time-stamped by the official postmark of the United States Postal Service.</p>
