The citation carried a forty-five dollar ($45.00) fine, and the City of Moundsville notified Appellee by mail on November 13, 1995 that if he failed to appear in court or pay the fine within ten days, the City would take action to have his driver’s license suspended. Whitlatch did not respond to the notice, and, pursuant to Article III of the Nonresident Violator Compact of 1977 (1977 Compact), West Virginia authorities reported his noncompliance to Penn-DOT.</p>

With respect to the 1977 Compact, Section 6146 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. § 6146, meets these standards. Section 6141 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. § 6141, evinces the Legislature’s “basic policy choice” to participate in interstate agreements regarding the regulation of <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>drivers,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and Section 6146 adequately limits PennDOT’s exercise of discretion by specifically enumerating the types of agreements that the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) is authorized to enter into, e.g., “agreements to notify any state of violations incurred by residents of that state.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 6146(1).</p>
    <p id="b419-4" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[141,653,1154,692]]]'>Thus, the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that 75 Pa.C.S. § 6146 constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of lawmaking authority. Indeed, in <em>Sullivan, </em>we characterized Section 6146 “merely as a delegation of authority to implement the mechanics of the [1961] Compact in the Commonwealth.” <em>Sullivan, </em><a href="/pa/550/0639-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="550 Pa. 639" data-case-ids="281204" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0639-01">550 Pa. at 648</a>, <a href="/a2d/708/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="708 A.2d 481" data-case-ids="11812962,281204" data-case-paths="/a2d/708/0481-01,/pa/550/0639-01">708 A.2d at 485</a>. While the terms of the 1961 Compact preclude entry into that agreement by any means other than enactment of a statute, the 1977 Compact specifically provides for adoption by “resolution” of “authorized officials.” Accordingly, unlike the 1961 Compact, the 1977 Compact became effective as to the Commonwealth upon the Secretary’s proper publication thereof. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pa.%20Bull.%203416" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Pa.
