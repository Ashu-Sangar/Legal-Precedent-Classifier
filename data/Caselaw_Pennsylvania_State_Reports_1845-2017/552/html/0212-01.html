(Longwood) from real estate tax. The appellant, Unionville-Chadds Ford School District, challenges Longwood’s exemption from tax. At issue is whether Longwood can claim exemption as a purely public charity.</p>
    <p id="b331-9" data-blocks='[["BL_331.10",331,[152,1362,1154,637]]]'>Longwood is a very large and world-renowned public garden located in Chester County, just outside of the Philadelphia area. It comprises 1,050 acres, approximately 422 of which are within the appellant school district. Pierre du Pont acquired Longwood in the early 1900s and developed its then-existing arboretum into extensive park-like gardens. The gardens have been open to the public since the 1920s and have been under the control of a non-profit operating foundation since 1970. More than 800,000 visitors per year make use of the gardens. The property was originally part of lands owned by William Penn and is listed in the U.S. Department of the Interior’s National Register of Historic Places.</p>

Included in the latter are an auditorium, classrooms, a library, exhibit areas, and scientific facilities.

    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[234,558,1160,832]]]'>Longwood serves as a site for hundreds of cultural events every year. For example, in 1994 alone, more than 450 performing arts events were held there. Longwood also maintains and funds highly regarded educational and research programs related to horticulture. These include a university-affiliated graduate program and various internships, as well as workshops, lectures, and advisory services. In addition, Longwood makes contributions of money, property, and services to the surrounding community. These have included a picnic area for the public, more than $2 million for local road improvements, substantial cash donations to schools and the local fire department and rescue squad, and making Long-wood’s facilities available to other charitable organizations at cost. Longwood is operated in heavy reliance on endowment funds, inasmuch as its operating expenses far exceed its revenues.</p>

This exemption was enacted pursuant to a provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution which gives the legislature power to exempt from taxation real property used by “[ijnstitutions of <em>purely public charity </em>....” Pa. Const, art. VIII, § 2(a)(v) (emphasis added). At issue in this appeal is whether Longwood meets the constitutional prerequisite of being a “purely public charity” so that it can claim the statutory exemption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The test requires that the entity (1) advance a charitable purpose; (2) donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its services; (3) benefit a substantial and indefinite class of persons who are legitimate subjects of charity; (4) relieve the government of some of its burden; and (5) operate entirely free from private profit motive. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, <a href="/citations/?q=487%20A.2d%201806" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="487 A.2d 1806">487 A.2d at 1317</a>.

    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.7",333,[175,1458,1154,640]],["BL_334.1",334,[235,335,1162,983]]]'>As to the first element, the school district stipulated at trial that Longwood advances a charitable purpose,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and this was construed by the trial court as including public use of the park-like grounds as well as educational and research activities. The second element, requiring that a substantial portion of services be rendered gratuitously, is satisfied in that Longwood absorbs a major portion of the cost of providing the public with the use of its grounds, facilities, and programs. Admission fees and other user charges cover only about 56% of operating costs. Hence, payment of the remaining 44% of costs is provided gratuitously by Longwood. Were it not for Longwood’s willingness to absorb these costs, the price of <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>admission would have to be raised to $22 per person. Long-wood instead charges only $10 for adults, except on certain days when admission is free to all, and at all other times offers deeply discounted or free admission to many groups, including children, nursing home residents, and the disadvantaged. Further, as heretofore described, Longwood makes substantial donations to the surrounding community. The final element of the <em>HUP </em>test, requiring that there be no profit motivation, is also satisfied. Longwood has operated at a substantial loss for many years and its existence rests on subsidies from its endowment funds. For example, in 1994 alone Longwood sustained a loss of nearly $8 million which was later recovered from its endowment, and the historic and anticipated future losses provide no evidence of profit-seeking design.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Admission fees charged to the public are intentionally maintained at a level below what would be required to cover costs, much less make a profit, and operations are run by a non-profit foundation governed by an uncompensated board of trustees.</p>

The third prong of the test requires that Longwood benefit a substantial and indefinite class of persons who are legitimate subjects of charity. Appellant contends that legitimate subjects of charity consist only of the poor, the infirm, and the needy. It is asserted that the general public cannot be a subject of charity because such a class of beneficiaries would not be limited to those who are incapacitated or financially distressed.

This decision opens the door for all private corporations that offer something of aesthetic or cultural value to the public — including museums of art, history and science, as well as musical and theatrical endeavors — to claim a real estate tax exemption. As expressed in my dissent in <em>City of Washington v. Bd. of Assessment Appeals, </em><a href="/a2d/704/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="704 A.2d 120" data-case-ids="11868459,281080" data-case-paths="/a2d/704/0120-01,/pa/550/0175-01">704 A.2d 120</a> (Pa.1997), the <em>HUP </em>test should instead be applied to reinforce the traditional characteristics of charities rather than expand their scope to the point that the term charity is meaningless.</p>

The test for whether an entity relieves the government of some of its burden “is whether the institution bears a substantial burden that would otherwise fall to the government.” <em>St. Margaret Seneca Place v. Bd. of Property Assessment, </em><a href="/pa/536/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="536 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="1843225" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0478-01">536 Pa. 478</a>, 487, <a href="/pa/536/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="640 A.2d 380" data-case-ids="1843225,7861807" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0478-01,/a2d/640/0380-01">640 A.2d 380</a>, 385 (1994).

The Commonwealth’s duty to conserve public natural resources under the Constitution and the related legislation upon which the majority relies, do not establish that an extensive, private horticultural facility like Longwood Gardens relieves the government of a burden. Simply because the Commonwealth protects its own resources and provides certain services to the public, does not mean it has assumed an unlimited obligation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

For these reasons, I dissent.</p>

The government, however, chooses the cultural endeavors it will pursue and its burden ends there. Thus, private corporations that decide to operate their own cultural enterprises are not relieving the government of a burden that would otherwise fall upon it.</p>
