Stated as such, the product rule is not the type of novel scientific evidence to which Pennsylvania courts apply the <em>Frye </em>test.

Frequency calculation is also complicated by the fact that two alleles, maternal and paternal, are located at any particular DNA locus. Prior to the general application of the product rule, a calculation is performed to determine the frequency for the pair of alleles (maternal and paternal) located at each locus. The calculation is different, depending upon whether the two alleles match (or are homozygous), or do not match and are thus said to be heterozygous. <em>See generally Lindsey, </em><a href="/p2d/892/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="892 P.2d 281" data-case-ids="10346601" data-case-paths="/p2d/892/0281-01">892 P.2d at 287</a>; Smith &amp; Gordon, <em>Admission of DNA Evidence, supra </em>note 2, at 2466-67; Kaye, <em>DNA Evidence, supra </em>note 2, at 124.</p>

The NRC illustrated this independence principle by referring to the example of individuals in the Nordic population with alleles for blonde hair, blue eyes and fair skin. If each trait carried a one-in-ten probability of occurrence, application of the product rule would result in a one-in-one-thousand probability that an individual would have all three traits. The combination, however, occurs commonly in the Nordic population, raising concerns about the validity of the application of the product rule to allele frequency calculations. <em>See </em>1992 NRC Report, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 76-77.</p>

Population substructures occur when a certain subsection of the population, for example, a racial or ethnic group, selectively mates within that same subsection, resulting in the interrelation of certain genetic traits. Several theories developed which suggested that truly random mating across racial and ethnic lines was necessary to independence in the distribution of individual alleles in a population. The terms “linkage equilibrium,” "gametic phase balance,” and “Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium” identify versions of such theories. <em>See generally </em>Moriarty, Scientific Evidence in Criminal Trials, <em>supra </em>note 2, § F11.2628, at 11-18-20; Smith &amp; Gordon, <em>Admission of DNA Evidence, supra </em>note 2, at 2476-77 (citations omitted); <em>see also Armstead, </em><a href="/md/342/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="342 Md. 38" data-case-ids="1999239" data-case-paths="/md/342/0038-01">673 A.2d at </a>237 &amp; n. 23 (citing Lewontin &amp; Hard, <em>Population Genetics, supra, </em>at 1746-47).

The ceiling principle assumes the existence of some degree of population substructuring and generates more conservative population probability statistics than the product rule by using the maximum frequency of allele occurrences from random samples from racial and ethnic subgroups. <em>Marcus, </em><a href="/nj-super/294/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="294 N.J.

The largest of these frequencies, or ten percent, whichever is greater, is then used to compute the probability of a random match (the 1992 NRC report recommended using the ten percent figure as an interim measure, to be replaced by a figure of five percent once preliminary data was collected). According to the NRC, the ceiling rates were considerably higher than the likely maximum allele frequency for any subgroup. <em>See </em>1992 NRC Report, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 93. The resulting probabilities for each allele occurrence are then multiplied as in product rule computations. <em>Id.</em>
