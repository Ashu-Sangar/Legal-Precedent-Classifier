After a suppression hearing before the Honorable James Fitzgerald of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas (trial court) on March 31, 1992, the court denied the motion to suppress. Williams waived his right to a jury trial and immediately proceeded to a <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>nonjury trial before Judge Fitzgerald, who convicted him of both offenses.</p>

The request to produce, certify and file the transcript did not include any mention of the notes of testimony from the suppression hearing and trial on March 31, 1992.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Superior Court sent the parties notification that the trial court record was due to be transmitted to the Superior Court on January 24, 1994.

After that, the Commonwealth petitioned the Superior Court to suspend its briefing deadline because the Commonwealth did not have a copy of the notes of testimony from the suppression hearing and trial and those transcripts were not in the Superior Court file because the certified record was not yet transmitted. When defense counsel received the Commonwealth’s Petition, he forwarded a copy of the notes of testimony to the Commonwealth, and informed the Superior Court that he had done so.</p>

In addition to responding to the merits of Williams’ suppression claim, the Commonwealth argued that Williams had forfeited his right to appellate review on the merits because he did not fulfill his obligation to ensure that the required record was transmitted to the Superior Court. Defense counsel filed a reply brief in the Superior Court in which he argued that he was not responsible for completing the record, and instead he claimed that the prosecution had the burden of taking necessary steps to complete the certified record.</p>

The Superior Court sent an Order dated July 6, 1995 that again directed the Court of Common Pleas to transmit the record. After waiting nearly five more months, the Superior Court issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion that affirmed the judgment of sentence and held that Williams’ failure to provide the court <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>with a complete record precluded the Court from analyzing the merits of the appeal. Judge Cercone filed a dissenting statement in which he noted that there was no explanation in the record as to why the certified record was never transmitted to the Superior Court. He presumed that there must have been an “extraordinary breakdown in the judicial process” and concluded that Williams should not be prejudiced by those events.</p>

Therefore, we must conclude that this issue has been waived for the purpose of appellate review. <em>Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, the Superior Court addressed this issue and based its decision on the trial court’s description of the photographs. In the third issue, the appellant argued that the trial judge should have granted a change of venue or venire due to pretrial publicity, but there was no transcript of voir dire to determine whether the jury pool was tainted by pretrial publicity. We agree with the Superior Court’s analysis in <em>Osellanie </em>in which the court explained the appellant’s responsibility to order the necessary transcripts and ascertain their presence in the record before it is certified for appeal.</p>

The record before us does not contain this information and does not disclose why the clerk of quarter sessions did not transmit the record to the Superior Court after that Court ordered it to do so on December 20,1994 and July 6, 1995. Thus, the critical factual question, which remains unresolved, is the following: Did the Clerk of Quarter Sessions fail to transmit the completed record to the Superior Court, or did defense counsel fail to complete the record?</p>

The majority believed that the defense was at fault and that it decision in <em>Osellanie </em>was dispositive. It therefore affirmed the judgment of sentence because Williams’ failure to provide the Superior Court with a copy of the transcript precluded it from analyzing the trial court’s decision. Judge Cercone’s Dissenting Statement, on the other hand, assumes that the trial court that was responsible because it neglected or refused to transmit the record. Based on that factual scenario, Judge Cercone opined that <em>Osellanie </em>is therefore distinguishable and not controlling.</p>

The briefs of the parties before this Court further obscure and darken the murky waters of fault. In her brief to this Court, Williams’ attorney suggests that the original record in this <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>case was lost, because the file eventually transmitted to the Superior Court was marked “dummy file,” it was missing documents, and there are no original documents, only photocopies, in the file. Defense counsel also states that prior appellate counsel was unaware that the record had not been transmitted by the time of oral argument, and that he was “surprised” to find out that the record had not been transmitted to the Superior Court.</p>

Brief for Appellee, p. 5. In support of its position, the Commonwealth points to defense counsel’s reply brief in the Superior Court in which he argued that defense counsel had no obligation to correct the omission of the notes of testimony from the record.</p>

We also agree with the Superior Court dissent where it states that Williams should not be denied appellate review if the failure to transmit the record was caused by an “extraordinary breakdown in the judicial process.” However, the majority and the dissent reach opposite conclusions because the reasons why the record was not transmitted are not in the record.

The adversarial process that is the cornerstone of the criminal justice system should never interfere with the appellate process. Instead of arguing and litigating the question of who was responsible for completing the record, both parties and the Court of Common Pleas should have done everything in their power to assist the Superior Court to dispose of this appeal as expeditiously as possible. Because of the lack of cooperation, an indigent defendant has been denied meaningful appellate review in the Superior Court.</p>

We are perplexed about why the assistant defender who represented Williams before the Superior Court took the time and effort to file a reply brief denying responsibility for completing the record instead of simply walking to the courthouse with his file and making sure that everything was in order for his client’s appeal. It is obvious to us that the time spent by the Defender Association of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office on this appeal to our Court could have been better spent doing other things.

Since the transcript of the suppression notes was ordered here, I therefore agree with Appellant that he complied with his obligations under Pa. R.A.P. 1911. That is not to say, however, that Appellant’s counsel fulfilled his obligations as an officer of the court. It seems clear that, as a courtesy to the court, Appellant’s counsel should have provided the Superior Court with a copy of the suppression notes from his file.

As explained by the Majority, personnel in the Quarter Sessions office failed to respond, for whatever reason, to multiple orders from the Superior Court to transmit the record “forthwith.” Although the Superior Court sent such directives on December 20, 1994 and July 6, 1995, the Quarter Sessions office failed to send the record until January 18, 1996, nearly two months <em>after </em>the Superior Court quashed Appellant’s appeal for lack of a certified record. As stated in Judge Cercone’s dissent, “the difficulty in this case is not that the appellant has failed to act, but that the trial court has failed to comply with the directives of the Superior Court to transmit the quarter sessions file and the existing transcripts.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Nonetheless, a remand for an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the genesis of the office of the Quarter Sessions’ failure to timely transmit the record is collateral to this appeal once it is concluded that Appellant complied with the Appellate Rules.

As the majority notes, it is unclear whether the stenographer also sent a copy of the notes of testimony to the Clerk of Quarter Sessions for the record after they were transcribed on May 29, 1992. Appellant maintains that, upon counsel’s request for transcription, it is standard operating procedure for the stenographer to send the original copy to the Clerk for inclusion in the Quarter Sessions file. This practice not only would seem to be the most efficient and sensible, but more significantly, one that is in accord with the Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>See </em>Pa.
