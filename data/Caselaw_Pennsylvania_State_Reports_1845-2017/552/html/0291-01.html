In that capacity it serves as an <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>issuing agent for temporary registration plates and cards. In August of 1994, DOT conducted a hearing to review charges that Morabito was not properly handling various documents and fees for which issuing agents are responsible. DOT issued an order imposing a penalty of $2,700.00, in total, for twenty-seven violations of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1374(a)(5), which requires that properly assigned certificates of title be delivered in a timely fashion. By separate order, and based on the same twenty-seven occurrences, DOT suspended Morabito’s authority to issue temporary registration plates and cards for a period of one month. The suspension was imposed for violations of 67 Pa.Code 43.11(a)I(4), which requires that documents and fees be delivered in a timely manner.</p>
    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[163,1019,1152,148]]]'>Appeals from both orders were taken to the court of common pleas. A <em>de novo </em>hearing on both appeals was held on March 22, 1995. On April 12, 1996, the orders were affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b409-5" data-blocks='[["BL_409.6",409,[163,1192,1152,573]]]'>Determination of the exact dates when documents were received by DOT was of critical importance in this case because all of the violations with which Morabito was charged involved failures to timely submit documents and fees. Morabito contends that the court of common pleas erred in admitting certain evidence that DOT utilized to establish such dates. At the hearing, DOT submitted certified photocopies of its records pertaining to the twenty-seven violations. The photocopies depicted twenty-seven untimely title and registration application forms submitted by Morabito. Morabito objected to admission of the records, but the objections were overruled.</p>
    <p id="b409-6" data-blocks='[["BL_409.7",409,[163,1791,1153,573]],["BL_410.1",410,[240,310,1157,141]]]'>Morabito’s objection was that the records did not meet the statutory requirement that photocopies of business and public records admitted into evidence be legible. Specifically, in 42 Pa.C.S. § 6109(b), it is provided that “[a]ny such reproduction . .. must accurately reproduce all lines and markings which appear on the original.” Morabito argues that the photocopies are illegible, and, in particular, that many of the “work identification numbers” cannot be read. These numbers, which are stamped on the original of each document, contain information as to the date when each document was received by DOT. The court initially agreed with Morabito, noting that “[ajfter <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>careful inspection of the documents, this court concedes that the work identification numbers are illegible on many of the documents.”</p>

An application, or copy thereof certified by the department, which displays the stamped work identification document number shall be accepted by any issuing authority or court in any proceeding as prima facie evidence of the date that the application was received by the department. <em>If the displayed stamp is not legible, a certification by the department of the date that the application was received shall be accepted by the issuing authority or court as prima facie evidence of that date.</em>

This provision, rather than 42 Pa.C.S. § 6109(b), was deemed controlling because it pertains specifically to the admission of applications relating to vehicles purchased from dealers, whereas section 6109(b) is more general in its scope. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1933 (statutory provision that is more specific overrides one that is more general); <em>Olshansky v.

Further, inasmuch as 75 Pa.C.S. § 1103.1(d.l) is the more recently enacted of the provisions, it was regarded as controlling on that basis as well. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1936 (where two statutes are irreconcilable, the one latest in date of enactment shall prevail).</p>

The provision was enacted on December 7, 1994 and became effective sixty days later, i.e., on February 5, 1995. All of the alleged violations occurred between April and November of 1993. Hence, although the statute was in effect at the time if the hearing, to wit, on March 22, 1995, it was not in effect when the violations allegedly occurred. In addition, the statute had not yet been enacted when, on September 12, 1994, the manager of DOT’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles provided the certification as to the dates when the documents were received.</p>

Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it is procedural, it is nevertheless inapplicable. The courts below have taken out of context the excerpt from subsection (d.l) on which they relied to allow admission of the documents. A statutory provision must be interpreted as a whole rather than considered in fragments that, if read alone and out of context, could be construed to ignore the intent of the overall provision. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a) (effect should be given to all of a statute’s provisions when ascertaining legislative intent); <em>Elizabeth Toumship Sanitary Authority Case, </em><a href="/pa/413/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="413 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1888641" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0502-01">413 Pa. 502</a>, 507, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20304" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="198 A.2d 304">198 A.2d 304</a>, 306 (1964) (individual sentences that together constitute a statutory section must be read in context with the section in its entirety).</p>

See 75 Pa.C.S. § 1103.1(d.l), supra. The “displayed stamp” is not just any stamp that DOT may have placed on the document. Rather, it is the stamp referred to in the first sentence of subsection (d.l), supra, which provides that within one business day of receiving an application from a dealer, DOT “shall stamp the application with a work identification number, which shall include the year and day that the application was received. ...” Hence, subsection (d.l) creates a duty for DOT to promptly stamp the documents that it receives and prescribes procedures for admission of such documents, and copies thereof, based on a <em>presumption </em>that the statutory duty of DOT will be faithfully executed. Subsection (d.l) is in fact entitled, “Presumption of receipt.... ” It is evident that subsection (d.l) pertains to documents bearing work identification numbers that have been stamped pursuant to the statutory duty therein imposed. To apply the procedures that were prescribed for admission of such documents in cases where the documents have not in fact been stamped pursuant to any such duty would extend the scope of subsection (d.l) beyond that intended by the legislature.</p>

If DOT had some basis for knowing the dates when documents were received it should have produced testimony to establish those dates. Obviously, this is of particular importance where documents bearing illegible work identification numbers are concerned. If DOT had been required to place a witness on the stand to authenticate the documents and to testify regarding procedures that were followed in placing work identification numbers on the documents, the witness would have been subject to cross-examination, and, as a result, DOT might have <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>been unable to establish that the dates stamped on the documents were the dates on which they were actually received.
