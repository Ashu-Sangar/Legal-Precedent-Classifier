We note that both UIFSA, RURESA’s successor statute, and legislation recently enacted by the United States Congress, <em>see </em>Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Order Act ("FFCCSOA”), Pub.L. No. 103-383, § 3(a), October 22, 1994, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%204064" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="108 Stat. 4064">108 Stat. 4064</a> (revised version at 28 U.S.C. § 1738B), would compel the same result. Both of these statutes require reciprocal enforcement of child support orders and provide that the controlling period of limitation is the <em>longer </em>of applicable domestic and foreign statutes of limitations. 28 U.S.C. § 1738B(h)(3); 23 Pa. C.S. § 7604. Apparently, Texas law is generous to the enforcement of domestic and foreign support orders and would not bar Mrs. Morrissey’s claims. <em>See, e.g., In re Kuykendall, </em><a href="/sw2d/957/0907-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="957 S.W.2d 907" data-case-ids="11886145" data-case-paths="/sw2d/957/0907-01">957 S.W.2d 907</a>, 910-11 (Tex.App.1997) (finding obligee liable for arrearages under foreign support order accrued over an eighteen-year period). Therefore, under either UIFSA or FFCCSOA, the Texas statute would control over any shorter Pennsylvania limitation.</p>
      <p id="b207-8" data-blocks='[["BL_207.8",207,[193,1929,1122,392]]]'>Several jurisdictions have concluded that UIFSA and FFCCSOA should be retroactively applied. <em>See, e.g., Welsher v. Rager, </em><a href="/nc-app/127/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="127 N.C. App. 521" data-case-ids="11798444" data-case-paths="/nc-app/127/0521-01">127 N.C.App. 521</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=491%20S.E.2d%20661" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="491 S.E.2d 661">491 S.E.2d 661</a>, 664-65 (1997) (concluding that UIFSA should be applied retroactively); <em>Child Support Enforcement Div. of Alaska v. Brenckle, </em><a href="/mass/424/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="424 Mass. 214" data-case-ids="117702" data-case-paths="/mass/424/0214-01">424 Mass. 214</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%20390" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="675 N.E.2d 390">675 N.E.2d 390</a>, 393 (1997) (same); <em>DCSE v.

Because neither party to this appeal has advanced such an argument, and the result reached by the Lebanon County court is consistent with UIFSA and FFCCSOA, it is unnecessary to address issues of retroactive application in this case.</p>
