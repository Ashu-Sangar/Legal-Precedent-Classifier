The September 29, 1995 order was a denial of Appellant’s “Emergency Motion for Relief,” filed that same day. Appellant’s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal should have been construed as an appeal from the order denying the “Emergency Motion for Relief,” in which case it was timely filed and should not have been quashed as untimely by the Superior Court.</p>
