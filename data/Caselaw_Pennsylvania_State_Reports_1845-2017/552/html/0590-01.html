Shick filed a civil action against his former employer, Donald L. Shirey, t/d/b/a Donald L. Shirey Lumber, alleging that Shirey had wrongfully discharged him from his employment in retaliation for his exercise of his rights under the Workers’ Compensation Act. Shick’s complaint asserted that he was hired as Shirey’s employee in October 1991. On September 13, 1993, Shick sustained an injury to his left knee while pushing a cart. He underwent surgery for the knee injury on December 13, 1993. A notice of compensation payable, which described the injury as a partial tear of the left medial meniscus, was issued pursuant to the Workers’ Compensation Act on November 30, <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>1993. The weekly compensation rate payable was $162.92, based on an average weekly wage of $181.02. Shick received benefits until March 1, 1994, when he was released to return to work by his physician. He notified Shirey on the day of his release that he was available for work.</p>
    <p id="b709-5" data-blocks='[["BL_709.5",709,[132,607,1156,530]]]'>Shick’s complaint alleged that Shirey informed him that he no longer had a job due to his pursuit of his workers’ compensation claim. It further alleged that Shirey’s intent in discharging him from his employment was to retaliate for Shick’s exercise of his rights under the Workers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 1 et seq., and that the discharge was in violation of the public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Shick asserted that he had been unable to find gainful employment and requested damages to compensate him for lost wages, lost insurance benefits and emotional distress.</p>

He asserts that the alle<a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>gations set forth in his complaint were sufficient to state a cause of action for wrongful discharge because exceptions to that doctrine have been established when the discharge violates public policy. Shick argues that a clear mandate of public policy evinced by the Workers’ Compensation Act is violated when an employee is discharged in a retaliatory manner for exercising his legal rights thereunder. Shick further contends that the Superior Court’s refusal to recognize a cause of action for wrongful discharge under such circumstances places an employee who sustains a work-related injury in the untenable position of choosing between exercising his legal rights and seeking compensation for his injury under the Act, or foregoing his legal rights in an effort to maintain his livelihood.</p>

Shirey further contends that this Court is without the authority to recognize a common law cause of action for wrongful discharge because the scope and remedies afforded by the act are the province of the legislature.</p>

Geary was dismissed after voicing his concerns over the inadequacy of the testing for one of the company’s new products and the potential for serious danger to users of the product. In his complaint, Geary alleged that he continued to voice his misgivings to his superiors even after he was ordered to follow directions and that, as a result, the product was reevaluated and withdrawn from the market. Geary further asserted that he was wrongfully dismissed from his employment because of those events. The complaint was dismissed after the trial court sustained the employer’s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The Superior Court affirmed.</p>

Geary’s conduct, while praiseworthy, demonstrated that he had failed to follow the company’s standard operational procedures in bypassing his immediate superiors with his complaints. We found no basis for inferring that Geary’s discharge was a retaliatory gesture designed to punish him for drawing attention to the product’s defects, especially in view of the fact that the product was withdrawn from the market.</p>

The notion that substantive due process elevates an employer’s privilege of hiring and discharging his employees to an absolute constitutional right has long since been discredited. But this case does not require us to define in comprehensive fashion the perimeters of this privilege, and we decline to do so. We hold only that where the complaint itself discloses a plausible and legitimate reason for terminating an at-will employment relationship and no clear mandate of public is violated thereby, an employee at will has no right of action against his employer for wrongful discharge.</blockquote>

      <em>Hall v. Arnica Mutual Insurance Company </em>involved the denial of an insured’s claim for uninsured motorist benefits. The insured was injured while operating a motor vehicle in Barbados when he was forced off the road by another vehicle and struck a tree. The insurer denied his claim on the basis that the insurance policy’s provision limited the territory of coverage, which did not include Barbados. The limitation was declared invalid by an arbitration panel. The Superior Court affirmed, concluding that the limitation was contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable.</p>

No sound analysis can be drawn from legislative silence. An equally compelling argument may be made that the legislature has not perceived that retaliatory discharge for filing of workers’ compensation claims has become such a pervasive problem that it requires the experience of an administrative agency.
