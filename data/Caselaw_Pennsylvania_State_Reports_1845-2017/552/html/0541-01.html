We are aware that Appellees did not address the propriety of the Commonwealth Court’s determination that the Board erred in granting Appellants a special exception. Appellants, however, raised the propriety of this determination and, accordingly, it is properly before us for review. While argument from Appellees in this regard would have been helpful, given that Appellees are not necessarily required to file an appellate brief, we do not view argument from Appellee as being necessary. See Pa.R.A.P. 2188 (providing for the limited consequence of being precluded from participating in oral argument except by permission of the court where an appellee does not file a brief).</p>

Zoning Board of Adjustment of Philadelphia County, </em><a href="/pa/536/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="536 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1843197" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0322-01">536 Pa. 322</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="639 A.2d 446" data-case-ids="1843197,7861241" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0322-01,/a2d/639/0446-01">639 A.2d 446</a> (1994), dictates a contrary result. In <em>East Torresdale, </em>we reversed a Commonwealth Court decision where the zoning hearing board granted a property owner’s use variance to conduct his dentistry business in his residential dwelling. Noting that the local ordinance permitted the practice of dentistry in the district, provided that the office was situated in the dwelling of the practitioner and was incidental to the main purpose of the residence, we held that the board neither abused its discretion nor erred as a matter of law in granting the requested variance.</p>

        <em>East Torresdale, </em>however, is not applicable to the matter before us. Although the court mentioned the fact that the local zoning ordinance permitted the practice of dentistry "where incidental to the main purpose of the residence,” <em>id. </em>at 323, <a href="/pa/536/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="639 A.2d 446" data-case-ids="1843197,7861241" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0322-01,/a2d/639/0446-01">639 A.2d at 447</a>, this factor was not considered by the court as the issue before the board was whether the property owner was entitled to a use variance based upon the owner’s demonstration of undue hardship.</p>

Rather, as noted previously, they sought a special exception to conduct the business as a home occupation and they sought a variance to permit them to hire employees. Accordingly, the issue of whether Appellants may have been entitled to a use variance from the Board in order to conduct their engineering business was never part of this case. Therefore, <em>East </em>
