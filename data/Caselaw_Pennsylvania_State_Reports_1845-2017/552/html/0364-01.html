Sueca spent the next day with Priovolos at his mother’s house, and later that evening Priovolos drove her to a secluded area in another attempt to engage in intercourse with her. When Sueca refused Priovolos’ advances, an argument ensued, and Priovolos grabbed Succa’s purse to retrieve the money he had spent on the hotel room the previous evening. Priovolos slapped Sueca during the struggle and she began crying. She ran from Priovolos’ car and onto a bridge, but Priovolos caught up with her, repeatedly striking her, and finally knocking her from the bridge.
