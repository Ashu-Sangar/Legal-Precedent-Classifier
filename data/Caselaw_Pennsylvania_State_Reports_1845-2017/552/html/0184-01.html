    <p id="b302-14" data-blocks='[["BL_302.15",302,[234,1900,1157,364]]]'>In July of 1995, the Delaware County Prison Employees Independent Union was notified by Delaware County Council that, effective September 30, 1995, all of the correctional officers employed at the county’s prison would be laid off. The layoff was due to the fact that the county had entered a contract with Wackenhut Corrections Corporation to have Wackenhut’s employees serve as corrections officers.</p>

On September 29, 1995, the commonwealth court granted an injunction pending appeal. Subsequently, it reversed the lower court’s denial of a preliminary injunction and remanded for further proceedings. On March 19, 1996, the court of common pleas granted a preliminary injunction with a proviso that the injunction would expire on March <em>31, </em>1996, the date when the collective bargaining agreement was to lapse. On March 28, 1996, arbitration proceedings under the collective bargaining agreement culminated in a decision by an arbitrator that the county’s prison privatization efforts violated the bargaining agreement. Nevertheless, on April 1, 1996, Wackenhut assumed control over operation and management of the prison and laid off all of the correctional officers. Wackenhut then rehired nearly all of the officers to serve as its own employees and to perform the same work at the prison.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

There is no language in any other portion of the agreement that contradicts the powers conferred by this section. Further, Article 28, Section 1 of the agreement sets forth an integration clause which provides that “[t]he parties mutually agree that the terms and conditions expressly set forth in this Agreement represent the full and complete understanding, Agreement and commitment between the parties thereto.” Thus, Article 2, Section 1 constitutes the entire agreement of the parties as to the subject matter under dispute.</p>

He determined, therefore, that the county’s right to subcontract was limited in scope, to wit, that it did not permit such extensive subcontracting as would amount to privatization of the entire prison operation. He viewed the unfettered power to subcontract as being highly unfavorable to the interests of union employees and concluded that if the parties had really intended that such extensive subcontracting could occur then there should have been language in the agreement specifying that a complete privatization was permitted. Absent such language, the power to subcontract was deemed to have been intended as limited in scope.</p>

This message will spawn needless litigation as employers and unions alike, when dissatisfied with an arbitrator’s award, will now be encouraged to petition to vacate the award in hopes that a court will reverse the arbitrator’s determination.

To support his conclusion that replacing the entire bargaining unit with a private contractor violated the parties’ collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator first found that the subcontracting clause was unclear and ambiguous based upon differing constructions by the parties, the impact on other provisions of the agreement, including, the recognition clause and the duration clause, and the County’s heavy reliance upon parol evidence. The arbitrator viewed the differing interpretations of the subcontracting clause and reviewed the extensive bargaining history which illuminated that language. The arbitrator found that the competing testimony regarding the bargaining history of the clause demonstrated that there was no meeting of the minds regarding whether the provision permitted the County to substitute a private contractor for the entire bargaining unit, and noted that the parties had used the term “privatization” in negotiations in 1984-85, but that this language did not find its way into the final collective bargaining agreement.
