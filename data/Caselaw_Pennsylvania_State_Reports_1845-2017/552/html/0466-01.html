Gala (Appellant) underwent surgery for removal of a schwannoma, a benign tumor on a nerve in his neck. His wife, who is a pathologist, first noticed the lump on her husband’s neck in December 1987. Ralph Hamilton, M.D., a plastic surgeon, and Michael O’Connor, M.D. a neurosurgeon, (Appellees), performed the operation. Prior to the surgery, Appellees did not know which nerve was involved in the schwannoma because the area of the neck level <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>with the larynx and close to the base of the skull contains many nerves. They suspected that the vagus nerve, which controls the vocal chords, the larynx, and certain aspects of the esophagus, the heart and the intestines, might be involved. However, it was also possible that a branch of the spinal accessory nerve was involved. The surgical plan was to operate under local anesthesia so that Appellees could obtain a stimulus response from the patient during surgery when they palpated areas in the surgical field. Through such a response, the surgeons expected they would be able to identify the nerve around which the schwannoma had grown.</p>
    <p id="b584-5" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[232,909,1161,684]]]'>Once the procedure began, Appellees saw that the schwannoma had grown completely around what they thought to be a branch of the spinal accessory nerve, and they realized that to remove the tumor they would have to cut the nerve. They determined that repairing the damage would not be feasible because of the potential damage to other nerves if they attempted to perform a graft in the crowded area at the base of the skull where the carotid artery, the jugular vein and a number of nerves are located. Following surgery, Appellant was unable to speak, and Appellees determined that the schwannoma had grown around the vagus nerve, and not a branch of the spinal accessory nerve as they had previously believed. Appellant eventually regained his voice.</p>

At trial, Appellant’s expert testified that performing the operation under local anesthesia was negligent because it restricted the operative field and the ability of the surgeon to observe the operative field adequately. He testified that the use of local anesthesia increased the risk and was the cause of the injury to the vagus nerve. Each Appellee presented expert testimony supporting the decision to remove the tumor under local anesthesia. Eugene Meyers, M.D., a board-certified otolaryngologist with a sub-specialty in head and neck sur<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>gery, testified for Appellee Hamilton. He testified that local anesthesia was used by a considerable number of reputable, respected physicians throughout the world in 1988 to remove tumors in the area of the neck where Appellant’s tumor was located. He further testified that he has excised masses in that area of the neck under local anesthesia many times. Dr. Meyers cited the example of a doctor trained in otolaryngology who traveled to India where she would remove hundreds of thyroid tumors under local anesthesia. He noted that one potential complication of thyroid surgery is damage to the vagus nerve. In addition, he testified that the choice of anesthesia, whether general or local, does not make a difference in the outcome of the operation, and that excellent exposure of the surgical field is possible with either approach. Dr. Meyers also testified that the literature discussing removal of tumors from the neck does not indicate the type of anesthesia to be used.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.5",585,[162,1255,1153,675]]]'>Appellee O’Connor presented the testimony of a board-certified otolaryngologist, William M. Keane, M.D., who also has a sub-specialty in head and neck tumor surgery. He testified that performing surgery under local anesthesia allows for monitoring of nerve function, and that use of local anesthesia in surgery deep in the neck is a recognized technique. Furthermore, he noted that surgeons often use local anesthesia when operating on the carotid artery, which is located next to the vagus nerve. He testified that the literature regarding surgical excision of schwannomas does not indicate that general, rather than local anesthesia should be used. He also stated the choice of anesthesia does not affect the ability to determine the nerve involved with the schwannoma.</p>

      <em>Jones, </em><a href="/pa/531/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="531 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1834443" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0031-01">531 Pa. at 40-41</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="531 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1834443" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0031-01">610 A.2d at 964</a>. Initially, we note that <em>Jones </em>uses the general terms “competent medical authority,” “the proper use of expert witnesses” and “factual reasons to support [the expert’s] claim.” <em>Jones </em>does not hold that the defendant’s expert witness may only establish through medical literature that the defendant followed a course of treatment approved by a considerable number of recognized and respected professionals. However, Appellant asserts that such a requirement is implicit in <em>Jones, </em>and suggests that “the type of literature recognizing a school of thought should at a minimum be a current recognized medical text, a current respected peer review journal or the current recommendations of a national association.” Appellant’s brief at 11. Essentially, Appellant asks this Court to define “sufficient evidence to warrant an instruction” as a specific type of written evidence. However, Appellees assert that when this Court in <em>Jones </em>referred to “evidence,” it did so recognizing the broad meaning of the term, which is defined as, “Any species of proof or probative matter, legally presented at the trial of an issue, by the act of the parties and though the medium of witnesses, records, documents, exhibits, concrete objects, etc. for the purpose of inducing belief in the minds of the court or jury as to their contention.” Black’s Law Dictionary 555 (6th ed.1990). Appellees suggest that by not placing restrictions on the comprehensive term “evidence,” the <em>Jones </em>Court elected to allow medical experts to use any form of admissible proof to establish the existence of a school of thought.</p>

In further support of maintaining a broad <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>definition of “evidence,” Appellees note the following statement by this Court in <em>Jones: </em>“The burden of proving that there are two schools of thought falls to the defendant. The burden, however, should not prove burdensome.” <em><a href="/pa/531/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="531 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1834443" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0031-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/531/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="531 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1834443" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0031-01">at 40</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="531 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1834443" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0031-01">610 A.2d at 969</a>. Limiting evidence to medical literature would have the effect of preventing expert witnesses from testifying to the existence of a school of thought based on their experience as practitioners and on information they obtained during their medical training and while attending lectures and other educational programs sponsored by institutions and professional societies. Furthermore, in cases where medical literature is silent with regard to certain techniques or treatments, the lack of written materials would necessarily be fatal to the defendant’s claim. Such a rule is inimical to the flexible standard established in <em>Jones.</em>

Perrige, </em><a href="/pa-super/437/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="437 Pa. Super. 620" data-case-ids="706856" data-case-paths="/pa-super/437/0620-01">437 Pa.Super. 620</a>, <a href="/a2d/650/1079-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="650 A.2d 1079" data-case-ids="11338389,706856" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/1079-01,/pa-super/437/0620-01">650 A.2d 1079</a> (1994). In <em>Tesauro, </em>a patient developed a dry socket after an oral surgeon removed a damaged molar in 1984. Following the extraction, the doctor administered an injection of alcohol near the area. Mrs. Tesauro was later diagnosed with muscle spasms caused by a damaged trigeminal nerve. She filed a dental malpractice action alleging that Dr. Perrige was negligent in administering the alcohol injection so close to the trigeminal nerve. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mrs. Tesauro, and the oral surgeon appealed to the Superior Court. He asserted, inter alia, that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the two schools of thought defense. At trial, Dr. Perrige testified that he was following a procedure discussed in a text published in 1975 by Dr. Archer, the former chief of oral surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. As his first expert witness he presented Dr. Totian, who testified that he had never given an alcohol injection to treat dry sockets and did not teach the procedure to students. Furthermore, he never testified that alcohol injections were proper and widely used in the treatment of dry sockets. Dr. Perrige then presented a second expert, Dr. Guernsey, who <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>supported the use of alcohol to treat dry sockets by citing the 1975 text referred to by Dr. Perrige and a reference manual written by a Dr. Shira during Dr. Guernsey’s residency from 1959 to 1961. He testified that he never gave an alcohol injection to treat a dry socket and did not teach residents to follow this procedure.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[170,675,1151,475]]]'>The Superior Court noted that the manual by Dr. Shira was out of date, and that Dr. Archer’s 1975 text arguably was also. Furthermore, the writings of one doctor are an insufficient basis to establish that a considerable number of practitioners agree with a course of treatment. In light of the fact that none of the defense experts testified that they had used alcohol injections to treat dry sockets, the Superior Court held that Dr. Perrige had failed to meet the burden of establishing two schools of thought.</p>
    <p id="b589-6" data-blocks='[["BL_589.6",589,[168,1180,1157,739]]]'>Based on <em>Tesauro, </em>the Appellant asserts there must be competent medical literature to support a minority school of thought before a two schools instruction may be given to the jury. However, a careful reading of <em>Tesauro </em>indicates that it was not the lack of current medical literature, but the fact that none of the experts who testified at trial ever used alcohol injections to treat dry sockets, which led the court to reject the proffered defense. Had the expert witnesses testified to their personal use of the technique in question instead of relying on outdated materials, the result might have been different. Accordingly, <em>Tesauro </em>stands for the position that while factual support is required for a two schools instruction, it need not be in the form of medical literature, but may be testimonial.</p>

That determination can not be a casual exercise and must be based, at a minimum, on a proof that tenets and standards of the school have been “taught,” (i.e., communicated) to its members before a jury is permitted to consider the defense. Thus, I believe professional literature descriptive of and in support of the defendant’s course of treatment must be admitted into evidence in order for the trial court to determine as a matter of law that “competent medical authority is divided.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> If the trial court so finds, a second school jury instruction must be given.

It thus goes without saying that neither had ever attempted such surgery under local anesthetic. Dr. Hamilton’s expert witness was Eugene Myers, M.D., a board certified otolaryngologist with a subspecialty in head and neck surgery. Myers testified that in 1988 when Appellant’s tumor was excised, a considerable number of reputable, respected physicians throughout the United States and the world used local anesthetic for the removal of tumors in the neck. However, the only examples he could offer were the practices of one colleague, a medical missionary physician-surgeon who operated in India where hospital facilities were scarce. He further testified that he himself used local anesthetic in such procedures. Dr. O’Con-nor’s expert witness, William M. Keane, M.D., a board certified otolaryngologist with a subspecialty in head and neck tumor surgery, similarly testified that, while he never performed such surgery under local anesthetic himself, it was his opinion that the use of local anesthetic for procedures that deeply invade the neck is “appropriate.” The Majority Opinion quotes this portion of his testimony, overlooking that he specifically declined to testify that it was an “accepted practice” to use local anesthetic under the circumstances. Thus, neither expert presented evidence that such was the practice of a “considerable number” of surgeons in this or any other first world country. Neither expert was aware of nor cited to any medical literature advocating the use of local anesthetic in this type of operation.</p>

The concurring opinion asserts that, in medicine, a "significant amount of valid information is passed along orally, such as on rounds or in conferences.” However, in teaching hospitals, while "rounds” may be led by "reputable and respected” doctors, the information is primarily communicated to interns or residents who have not yet achieved the status of "reputable and respected medical professionals” themselves. Thus, as held in <em>Tesauro, </em>the unadopted teachings of one doctor, though he/she him/herself may be highly regarded, does not constitute a "school” for legal purposes simply because he/she shares his/her views with his/her students. Furthermore, the protocol at medical conferences or symposia is that a "reputable and respected medical professional” is invited to deliver his/her <em>paper </em>to the convening group. Unless and until other reputable and respected colleagues adopt the advocated approach, it is only a theory and not a "school.” Nonetheless, should it become a school, its basis is always the <em>paper </em>prepared by the speaker through which his/her teachings are communicated. Thus, as in the law, a theory is merely a theory or an argument for a point of view until it is adopted, memorialized and disseminated for others to follow.</p>
