It concluded that where a claimant’s third party recovery is large enough to satisfy all or part of the employer’s future compensation lien, attendant with this benefit is the employer’s obligation to pay its share of legal expenses attributable thereto.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Regarding the treatment of future medical expenses incurred by a claimant during the grace period, the court noted that the preferred method is for the employer to pay the expenses outright as they are incurred.

We concluded that the legal expenses attributable to future credits must be prorated as the employer becomes entitled to the future credit received.

Claimants offer three principal reasons why Darr is not entitled to subrogation of the loss of consortium settlements. They first contend that the right to loss of consortium recovery is a separate property light personal to their spouses. Second, Claimants argue that there is no statutory provision granting Darr an interest in the loss of consortium settlements. Finally, they contend that recognizing a subrogation interest in the employer would require their spouses to forfeit their recoveries merely because they decided to settle their claims rather than go to trial.</p>

A claimant would have the opportunity to shield his recovery from the employer’s subrogation interest by fraudulently attributing an unwarranted amount of the damages to the spouse’s claim for loss of consortium. Fear of abuse, however, is an impermissible basis upon which to require the forfeiture of a spouse’s valid recovery. In the event the settlement is unreasonably apportioned, an employer may always seek recourse in the court of common pleas. Our Court can not create a mechanism whereby workers’ compensation officials could reexamine third party settlements for purposes of determining the employer’s subrogation interest. Such action can only be taken by the General Assembly.</p>

The calculation using the figures in footnote three is slightly different apparently due to the parties’ stipulation of round numbered amounts. Darr’s grace period was determined by dividing the future compensation payable by Walker’s weekly compensation rate of $188.50, which equaled 291.10 weeks. The future compensation payable is treated as advance compensation benefits to Walker which, at the rate of $188.50 per week, <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>would require the suspension of benefits for 291.10 weeks.

      <p id="b521-12" data-blocks='[["BL_521.11",521,[189,1992,1119,386]]]'>Thus, following the example regarding Claimant Richard Walker, the grace period pursuant to the gross method would be equal to Walker’s total recovery of .$172,500 minus the accrued compensation lien of S58,611, divided by the weekly compensation rate of $188.50. This results in a 604.18 week grace period as opposed to the 291.10 week grace period arising from utilization of the net method. This example illustrates that the difference between the two methods of calculation results in a shorter grace period under the net method, but correspondingly, the employer has no obligation to repay legal expenses during that time.</p>
