For the following reasons, we affirm the order of the Superior Court and hold that the legality of the canine sniff conducted in California must be evaluated under California law.</p>
    <p id="b689-6" data-blocks='[["BL_689.7",689,[164,898,1153,638]]]'>The relevant facts are as follows: On August 26, 1993, an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) was on assigned duty at a Federal Express location in Bakersfield, California investigating drug trafficking from the facility when he observed a man and woman pay $77 in cash in order to ship a package to Pennsylvania. The agent noted the license plate on the couple’s automobile as they departed. The agent then inspected the package in question, which weighed thirty-seven pounds, and observed that it was addressed to Sr. Angel Sanchez at a specific address in Shilling-ton, Pennsylvania. The return address was listed as Ceramics, Inc., with a local address and telephone number.</p>
    <p id="b689-7" data-blocks='[["BL_689.8",689,[165,1561,1153,581]]]'>The ATF agent called directory assistance and learned that there was no listing for Ceramics, Inc. in the Bakersfield area. He further referenced several telephone directories and determined that the address given for Ceramics, Inc. did not exist. The agent then called the telephone number listed on the return slip. When what seemed to be a young Hispanic female answered the phone, the agent heard young children crying in the background, and hung up without speaking. The agent then ran a check of the license plate with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The car was registered to one Maria Ramirez of Bakersfield, California.</p>
    <p id="b689-8" data-blocks='[["BL_689.9",689,[165,2169,1152,204]],["BL_690.1",690,[204,325,1158,681]]]'>Subsequently, the ATF agent called the Kern County Sheriffs Department and requested that an officer bring a drug detecting canine to the Federal Express office. The officer arrived shortly thereafter with his trained canine, which posi<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>tively indicated the presence of narcotics in the package. The agent then allowed the package to be shipped to its intended destination in Pennsylvania and telephoned Detective Joe Mekosh in Berks County, Pennsylvania to relay information concerning the package. The detective used the information supplied by the ATF agent to secure a search warrant for the package upon its arrival in Pennsylvania. A search of the package revealed that the shipment contained fifteen smaller packets of marijuana. The detective then arranged for a controlled delivery of the package to the address listed and obtained a search warrant for the premises in question. The search resulted in the seizure of large amounts of cash, marijuana, and other evidence of drug trafficking.</p>
    <p id="b690-4" data-blocks='[["BL_690.5",690,[201,1030,1160,631]]]'>Appellant Briceno-Rodriguez accepted delivery of the package and signed for its receipt. Appellant Sanchez was the owner of the premises and the person to whom the package was addressed. Police found substantial evidence, including telephone bills, connecting appellant Rivera to the residence. Appellants were each charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and conspiracy to possess a controlled substance. Appellants Sanchez and Ramirez were also charged with conspiracy to possess with the intent to deliver a controlled substance and conspiracy to possess drug paraphernalia.</p>

After a hearing on the motions, the trial court determined that the legality of the canine sniff conducted in California should be evaluated under Pennsylvania law as opposed to California law. The court reasoned that the law of evidence is procedural in nature and that therefore, the law of the forum state should apply. The trial court further concluded that under Pennsylvania law, the facts known to the ATF agent did not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion to justify the canine search. Therefore, the trial court suppressed all of the evidence obtained subse<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>quent to the canine sniff, and granted appellants’ requests for habeas corpus relief.</p>

The Superior Court, in a published opinion and order, reversed the trial court and remanded the matter for trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Superior Court found that the question of the propriety of the canine sniff was a question of substantive law that should be analyzed under California law, and concluded that the sniff of appellants’ package was legally conducted pursuant to California law. Petitioners filed a timely petition for allowance of appeal to this Court and allocatur was granted limited to the issue of whether Pennsylvania law or California law should apply to evaluate the propriety of the canine sniff.</p>

The result of a canine sniff constitutes admissible evidence in both California and Pennsylvania, and can be used to support a search warrant in Pennsylvania so long as the sniff was conducted legally. Thus, the issue that this Court must address is whether Pennsylvania or California law should be used to determine whether the canine sniff in the instant case was conducted through valid and legal means.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

This approach gives the state having the most interest in the question paramount control over the legal issues arising from a particular factual context, thereby allowing the forum to apply the policy of the jurisdiction most intimately concerned with the outcome. <em><a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20796" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="203 A.2d 796">Id.</a> </em>We believe that a similar approach should be taken in the criminal context where the substantive laws of this Commonwealth conflict with those of a sister state.</p>

We disagree. A substantive right is defined as “a right to equal enjoyment of fundamental rights, privileges and immunities; distinguished from a procedural right.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1429 (6th ed.1990). By contrast, procedural law is “that which prescribes the methods of enforcing rights or obtaining redress for their invasion; as distinguished from the substantive law which gives or defines the right.” <em>Id. </em>at 1203. The issue before this Court is a strict constitutional law question involving the fundamental right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Therefore, the issue is one that must be addressed under the principles of conflicts between substantive laws, which require this Court to evaluate which state has the most interest in the outcome.</p>

No Pennsylvania state interest would be advanced by analyzing the propriety of the canine sniff under Pennsylvania law because the canine sniff did not occur in Pennsylvania and no Pennsylvania state officer was involved in the canine sniff. The courts of California have determined that a canine sniff is not a search requiring probable cause or a warrant. We will not question that decision under the conflicting decisions of Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania has no interest in a canine sniff search conducted within California’s borders, even if the results are later used in the Pennsylvania Courts.</p>

As noted by the Majority, while a canine sniff does not constitute a search under California law, this Court has found that a canine sniff is a search under the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>Commonwealth v. Johnston, </em><a href="/pa/515/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="515 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1806041" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0454-01">515 Pa. 454</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="515 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1806041" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0454-01">530 A.2d 74</a> (1987). In <em>Johnston, </em>this Court held that under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, a canine sniff may only be conducted when the police are able to articulate reasonable grounds for believing that drugs may be present in the place they seek to search. <em><a href="/pa/515/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="515 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1806041" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0454-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/515/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="515 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1806041" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0454-01">at 466</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="515 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1806041" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0454-01">530 A.2d at 79</a>. If this standard is not met, evidence derived from the canine sniff, like any other evidence obtained in violation of a defendant’s constitutional rights, is subject to suppression.

Under the Majority’s reasoning, as long as an activity is legal under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, Pennsylvania, despite its status as the forum state, retains no interest in that activity or the information obtained as a result since our courts have "no power to control the activities of a sister state or to punish conduct occurring within that sister state.” I am deeply concerned with the implications of this reasoning. Take, for example, a situation where the police, in a sister state with laws which do not quantify the amount of time a confession must be obtained from a suspect after arrest and before arraignment, obtain a confession from a particular suspect 10 hours after the initiation of interrogation. In the confession, the suspect implicates himself in crimes committed in Pennsylvania. In a prosecution later brought in Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth seeks to introduce the confession. Under Pennsylvania law, of course, the admission of the confession would violate the 6 hour rule of <em>Commonwealth v. Davenport, </em><a href="/pa/471/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="471 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1725190" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0278-01">471 Pa. 278</a>, <a href="/pa/471/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="471 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1725190" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0278-01">370 A.2d 301</a> (1977), and <em>Commonwealth v.

However, under the precedent created by the Majority today, it seems clear that the trial court in Pennsylvania would be forced to apply the sister state's law and allow the confession to be admitted into trial without any reference to the protections afforded by Pennsylvania law or our exclusionary rule.
