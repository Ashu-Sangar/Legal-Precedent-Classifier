Titus brought trespass against the Bradford, Bordell &amp; Kinzua Railroad Company, to recover damages for the death of the plaintiff’s minor son. Her statement of claim averred that her said son, James Titus, on June 7, 1888, was in the employ of the defendant as a brakeman, and engaged in the performance of his duty as such on a freight train; that in making up said train, the defendant negligently placed therein one or more broad-gauge cars, set on narrow-gauge trucks, and so heavily loaded as to be top-heavy, and negligently used on said car or cars “ an unsafe, and not the best appliance, to wit, the flat centre plate,” and by reason thereof the car overturned, and, falling upon the said James Titus, crushed him so that he died, etc. The defendant pleaded not guilty.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.6",639,[172,1190,1163,606]]]'>The defendant was operating a narrow-gauge railroad between Bradford and Smethport, with branch lines to Kane and Eldred. At all the points named, the defendant’s road connected with standard-gauge railroads, and a customary part of the defendant’s business was the transportation over its road of loaded and unloaded freight cars belonging to such connecting roads. The means of effecting this was to transfer the car bodies, by a mechanical appliance known as a “ hoist,” from the standard-gauge trucks belonging to them to narrow-gauge trucks of the defendant. The testimony tended to show that it was usual on other narrow-gauge railroads to make such transfers of car bodies in the same way.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b639-6" data-blocks='[["BL_639.7",639,[172,1805,1165,546]]]'>Among the roads, whose cars the defendant was in the habit of receiving and transporting, was the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad, known as the “ Nypano. ” The construction of those cars differed somewhat from most of the standard-gauge cars handled by the defendant. The centre plates of the bolsters on the bottom of the Nypano ears were partially oval, shaped somewhat like the bottom of a common saucer, and fitted into correspondingly shaped centre plates on the bolsters of the trucks. The car bolsters were of iron, so shaped as to be eight or ten inches higher at their ends than in the middle.</p>

The defendant used what were called Hays trucks, fitted for carrying standard-gauge cars on narrow-gauge roads. The bolsters of these trucks, however, were straight from end to end, and had flat centre plates, and when a Nypano car body was placed on one of those trucks, the side bearings of the car and of the truck, respectively, would be about three inches apart. The result of this would be to permit the car to rock unduly when rounding a curve, and to guard against this, blocks of hard wood were fastened on the truck bolsters, sometimes being bolted on and sometimes secured by wrapping telegraph wire around them and the bolsters.</p>

In the spring of 1888 he went upon the defendant’s road as a brakeman. On June 7th, of that year, he was on duty as one of the brakeman of a freight train passing over the defendant’s road from Ormsby junction to Bradford. A Nypano car, No. 41,036, was taken into this train at Ormsby junction. Before this was done, the car was inspected by the conductor of the train and found to be in good order, so far as he could see. The truck bolsters had blocks on them secured by telegraph wire. The car was loaded with ground bark, put up in bags. This same car had been hauled over the road to Ormsby junction, about ten days before, in a train upon which Titus was serving as a brakeman. While on its way to Bradford, on the day given, the train was passing around a curve, at the rate of seven to ten miles an hour, when car 41,036 was observed to sway from side to side and after-wards to bounce as if off the rails. Titus had been sitting on the brake wheel on the top of the car, at its rear end. When it commenced to rock he started to run along the top of it, to get to the car in front, but before he could get that far, the car tipped over. He then jumped to one side and, falling on the track, was run over by the rear truck of the car and killed. After the accident, an examination of the trucks that had been <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>under car 41,036, disclosed the fact that the wire fastening of one of the blocks had become loose, and the block had moved around so as to be partly out of place.</p>

The burden was upon the plaintiff to show against the defendant a case of negligence clear of any contributory negligence on the part of the deceased, and as she did not do this, the court should have directed a verdict for the defendant: Lehigh Coal Co. v. Hayes, <a href="/pa/128/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="128 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="567015" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0294-01">128 Pa. 294</a>; Phila. etc. R. Co. v.

The negligence declared upon is the placing of a broad-gauge car upon a narrow-gauge truck, and the use of “ an unsafe, and not the best appliance, to wit, the flat centre plate; ” or, as expressed by the learned judge in his charge, in using on the narrow-gauge road the standard ear bodies, and particularly the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio car body described by the witnesses. But the whole evidence, of plaintiff’s witnesses as well as of defendant’s, shows that the shifting of broad-gauge or standard oar bodies on to narrow-gauge trucks for transportation, is a regular part of the business of narrow-gauge railroads, and the plaintiff’s evidence makes no attempt to show that the why in which it was done here was either dangerous or unusual. Haleman says the majority of the bearings fit, and those that do not, have hard-wood blocks put under them, and the blocks are fastened with telegraph wire, and he was not positive but that some were bolted on. The particular car complained of was blocked and wired. Cazely and Richmond say it was the custom to haul these broad-gauge cars on the narrow-gauge trucks, though most of the broad-gauge were Erie cars, of a somewhat different construction; and Morris says the car in <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>question was put on a Hays truck, fitted for carrying standard-gauge cars on a narrow-gauge road, and that this particular kind of “ Nypano ” car was so hauled quite often. These are plaintiff’s own witnesses, and none of them say the practice was dangerous. The nearest approach to such testimony is by Morris, who says be “ had his doubts.”</p>
    <p id="b646-6" data-blocks='[["BL_646.5",646,[264,667,1167,1522]]]'>But, even if the practice had been shown to be dangerous, that would not show it to be negligent. Some employments are essentially hazardous, as said by our Brother Green, in North. C. Ry. Co. v. Husson, <a href="/pa/101/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="101 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="500920" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0001-01">101 Pa. 1</a>, of coupling railway cars; and it by no means follows that an employer is liable “ because a particular accident might have been prevented by some special device or precaution not in common use.” All the cases agree that the master is not bound to use the newest and best appliances. He performs his duty when he furnishes those of ordinary character and reasonable safety, and the former is the test of the latter; for, in regard to the style of implement or nature of the mode of performance of any work, “ reasonably safe ” means safe according to the usages, habits, and ordinary risks of the business. Absolute safety is unattainable, and employers are not insurers. They are liable for the consequences, not of danger but of negligence; and the unbending test of negligence in methods, machinery, and appliances is the ordinary usage of the business. No man is held by law to a higher degree of skill than the fair average of his profession or trade, and the standard of due care is the conduct of the average prudent man. The test of negligence in employers is the same, and however strongly they may be convinced that there is a better or less dangerous way, no jury can be permitted to say that the usual and ordinary way, commonly adopted by those in the same business, is a negligent way for which liability shall be imposed. Juries must necessarily determine the responsibility of individual conduct, but they cannot be allowed to set up a standard which shall, in effect, dictate the customs or control the business of the community.</p>

The test is, general <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>use. Tried by this test, the saw of the defendant was such a one as the company had a right to use, because it is such as is commonly used by mill owners, and it was error to leave to the jury any question of negligence based on the failure to provide a spreader.” See, also, Payne v.

    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[146,715,1167,603]]]'>As already seen, the testimony of plaintiff’s own witnesses showed the custom of the appellant company to perform this part of its work in, the way complained of. The defendant’s witnesses showed the custom of at least two other narrow-gauge roads to use the same way. There was no countervailing evidence on part of plaintiff, though, as was said in the closely analogous case of North C. Ry. Co. v. Husson, <a href="/pa/101/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="101 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="500920" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0001-01">101 Pa. 1</a>, “ it was certainly a part of the duty of the plaintiff to affirmatively establish that the loading of cars in the manner complained of was an unusual occurrence.” In the absence of such evidence, the defendant’s last point should have been affirmed, and a verdict directed for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b647-6" data-blocks='[["BL_647.6",647,[145,1328,1167,610]]]'>It is also entirely clear that defendant’s third point should have been affirmed. The deceased had been a brakeman on this train for five or six months, during which this mode of carrying broad-gauge cars had been used; cars similar to the one on which the accident occurred had been frequently carried, and that very car at least once, about ten days before. He not only thus had ample opportunity to know the risks of such trains, but he had his attention specially called to the alleged source of the accident, by having worked, just before becoming a brakeman, on the hoist by which the car bodies were transferred to the trucks. It was a perfectly plain case of acceptance of an employment, with full knowledge of the risks.</p>
