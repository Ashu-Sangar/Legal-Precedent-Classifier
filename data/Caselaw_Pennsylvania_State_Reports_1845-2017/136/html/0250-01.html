It is generally said to extend to making regulations promotive of domestic order, morals, health and safety.” It would require no little ingenuity to bring this act within any of these categories. Its obvious purpose was to keep home products for the home market. “ But, whatever may be the nature and reach of the police power of a state, it cannot be exercised over a subject confided exclusively to congress by the federal constitution : ” Railroad Co. v.

But the principle involved in prohibiting, except under certain burdens and penalties, the removal of the products of Berks county to a market outside of the state, would be equally involved in an attempt of the legislature to exact payment from any of the great manufacturing interests in the state, for the privilege of carrying their products into inter-state or foreign commerce.</p>

But if this feature can be severed from it, it is the duty of the court to uphold that which is lawful, the question of partial or entire unconstitutionality depending upon a consideration of the law, and in what manner and to what extent the unconstitutional portion affects the remainder: Cooley <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>on Const.

The main object of the law, in this instance, obviously was to prevent, except under certain restrictions, impositions and penalties, the removal of certain products of the counties named to markets without their limits, irrespectively as to their destination beyond the county lines, or beyond the borders of the state, or out of the country; and the secondary object was, to discriminate between resident and non-resident hucksters. There is no other object manifest in the act. It must be remembered that the act of April 9, 1856, P. L. 278, has established general regulations as to hucksters in Berks county and forbidden any person under a penalty of $50 to buy, or exchange, or barter, any kind of goods or groceries whatever for marketable produce, with intention of selling the same, without first obtaining a license. And the supplement to this act, passed April 18, 1856, P. L. 413, directed that hucksters were to be classified and rated, and to pay license fees, as wholesale dealers and retailers. The general subject of buying, etc., with the intent of re-selling, was thus already provided for by enactments which made no discrimination between residents and non-residents, nor between an intent to re-sell in the county and an intent to re-sell out of the county. The single purpose of the act of 1861 must consequently have been to provide for these particular matters.</p>

To give this effect to the present act would be to make a new law. And this same consideration forbids the court to construe the phrase “any other market” as limited to any other market in the state, by an application to the language of the act under discussion of the principle, that, where the terms of a statute permit of two constructions, the one making it unconstitutional and the other bringing it within the constitutional limitations, the latter is to be adopted: Commonwealth v.

The articles mentioned in the act are “ butter, eggs, dried fruit, veal, or other article of produce.” As the commodities particularly intended are specified, any “ other article of produce ” would be restricted to articles ejusdem generis. It is scarcely reasonable to suppose that purchases for exportation from the country were in the mind of the legislature. But the power to regulate commerce among the several states is granted to congress in terms as absolute as is the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and that power is exclusive whenever the matter is national, or admits of a uniform system or plan of regulation. No state has power to make any law which will affect the free and unrestricted intercourse and trade between the states: Brown v.

S. 275</a>, it was held that a license tax required for the sale of goods is, in effect, a tax upon the goods themselves. “ If such a tax,” says the court in that case, “ be within the power of the state to levy, it matters not whether it be raised directly from the goods, or indirectly from them, through the license to the dealer; but, if such tax conflicts with any power vested in congress by the constitution of the United States, it will not be any the less invalid because enforced through the form of a personal license.” In Brown v. Maryland, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wheat.%20425" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="12 Wheat. 425">12 Wheat. 425</a>, 444, it was sought to impose a license tax upon an importer of foreign goods, and it was held that the exaction of a license tax from the importer was simply the imposition of a tax on the goods imported, and that a state tax, to this effect, was in conflict with the commerce clauses of the constitution. A tax on the occupation of an importer, as it must add to the price of the article to be paid by the consumer, or by the importer himself, in like manner as a direct duty, was held to be the same as a tax on importation. Upon the reasoning of these and other cases, the appellee’s contention is that the exaction of a license fee, under the act of 1861, may in the same sense be regarded as a tax upon the property purchased by the huckster, and, as respects goods transported into other states, as an impost on the goods exported. We cannot see how this contention can be sustained. The license fee, at <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>the best, could only be treated as a tax on the goods at the time of the purchase, and they were then part of the general mass of property within the state liable to taxation, and so remained until the goods began to move as an article of trade from one state to another, at which time commerce in that commodity may be said to commence: The Daniel Ball, <a href="/us/77/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="10 Wall. 557" data-case-ids="3436246" data-case-paths="/us/77/0557-01">10 Wall. 557</a>. A commodity cannot be said to move as an article of ■trade from one state to another, until the business of transportation is actually commenced. It does not cease to be part of the general mass of property of the state, subject, as such, to its jurisdiction and to taxation in the usual way, until it has been shipped or entered with a common carrier for transportation to another state, or has been started upon such transportation on a continuous route or journey. Hence logs cut and hauled to the place where they were to be floated to another state, but kept in that place until it was convenient to float them away, were not yet commodities of inter-state commerce, but were taxable: Coe v. Errol, <a href="/us/116/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="116 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="3516975" data-case-paths="/us/116/0517-01">116 U. S. 517</a>. Even articles of import, as soon as the importer has so acted upon them that they become mixed in the general mass of property, are in like manner liable to taxation. If the commerce clauses of the constitution cover such a case as this, under the act of 1861, then it would seem that any statute, imposing a license or other tax upon any mercantile, manufacturing, or other business pursuit, would be without authority of law and void, for the persons thus taxed may carry these pursuits into interstate commerce.</p>

Article IV., § 2 of the federal constitution, provides that citizens of each state are entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states : citizens of other states, therefore, must be accorded the same rights, under our laws, as the citizens of Pennsylvania. But the discrimination contained in the act of 1861 is not against citizens of other states more than citizens of our own state, nor against foreign markets more than domestic markets; it is directed, not against citizens of other states, but against non-residents of the county of Berks, and against markets outside of that county.

The defendant’s employment, as we have said, was one pursued exclusively within the state, and it is conceded that the state has power to pass laws imposing taxes upon avocations in no way connected with inter-state or foreign commerce. As respects persons pursuing this employment wholly within the state, however it may be in other cases, it was certainly a valid and proper exercise of legislative power. A statute may be void only so far as its provisions are repugnant to the constitution: one provision may be void, and this will not affect other provisions of the statute. If the part which is unconstitutional in its operation, is independent of, and readily separable from that which is constitutional, so that the latter may stand by itself, as the reasonable and proper expression of the legislative will, it may be sustained as such; but, if the part which is void is vital to the whole, or the other provisions are so dependent upon it, and so connected with it, that it may be presumed the legislature would not have passed one without the other, the whole statute is void: Gibbons v.

That particular feature of the act, which, in its operation, is alleged to be unconstitutional, is easily and readily separable from that which is valid: the act can stand as well without as with it. The operation and effect of the statute may be restricted to the proper constitutional limits, and the object of the statute attained within these restrictions: at all events, it will not be presumed that the legislature would not have passed the statute to operate within the limitations imposed by the constitution. The real purpose of the act, doubtless, was to keep this kind of products for the home market, but, in view of the proximity of the great city of Philadelphia, and of other markets in eastern Pennsylvania, it is exceedingly probable that the legislature intended that the statute would accomplish its purpose within the bounds of the state.</p>
