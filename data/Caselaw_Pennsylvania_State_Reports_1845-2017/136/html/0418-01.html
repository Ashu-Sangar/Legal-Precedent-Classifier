The injuries which are alleged to have been done are, as I understand it, threefold. It is claimed, in the first place, that upon these buildings, which are stone in front and frame in the rear, the defendant broke into the stone wall for the sake of inserting his joists in the erection of a new building; and that, as to the rear, which was frame, he took down the partition wall; and, thirdly, that in' the course of this work, if it was- legally done, the work was not done in a workmanlike way, and that there were injuries to the plaintiff’s premises which were unnecessary.</p>

There has been a good deal of testimony and considerable discussion in this case about the standard of measurement, but it seems to me that that matter will not affect you seriously in coming to a conclusion. It appears that a good many years ago these lots were laid out by a man named King, and that the standard of measurement which he used was the United States standard. Now, it appears that the predecessors in title to both of these lots got their lots according to that measurement; and a change in the standard since, of course, could not in any way affect the location of the lots. It would be an absurd thing to say that because a standard had since been adopted which shortened the distance a foot,—and the test! <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>mony is that the difference between the city standard and the United States standard is three eighths of an inch in thirty feet,—that therefore the lots and ownership of the ground in this city are to be affected.</p>

Both of these houses were erected, at that time, and, even if there had been a difference as to the measurements, then, the fact of these properties having been owned and occupied adversely for that length of time would give a title to them in their present shape and condition under the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b440-7" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[280,1002,1166,803]]]'>I shall confine myself, in the first instance, to the question whether this front wall, or stone wall, between the two properties in front, was a party wall. Upon that subject, Mr. Lightfoot says that the northeast face of the wall, that is, the wall of the property belonging to the plaintiff, was on Goodman’s property. Goodman was the grantor of the plaintiff. Stallman says that the wall of McVey’s house is on his northeast line; and Mr. McVey himself testified that according to the report which was made to him by the lady from whom he bought, his wall was eight inches over on bis property; and he further testified that there were no joists from the other side in this wall. [So that, if you believe that testimony, the wall was not used as a party wall. • If you should find that this wall was all on Mr. McVey’s property, and that it had not been used by the other side for the insertion of joists or otherwise, then it was not a party wall.] 8</p>

Now, if these houses were built with the wall partly on the line of the adjoining property and extending beyond it, the presumption would be that it was for the purpose of mu <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>tual support, and it would be a fact from which you might infer that it was intended that this wall should be a party wall.</p>

That, however, would not conclude McVey, for the reason that to make it conclusive upon McVey there should have been previous notice given him. The law has wisely directed that these questions of boundaries shall be determined by a body competent to do so, which is the bureau of surveys.

    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.7",444,[260,522,1162,1264]]]'>It appears that, in 1847, Robert H. Thomas, owner of lot fronting sixty feet on Centre street, erected thereon two adjoining houses, numbered 255 and 257. In May, 1848, he conveyed the house and lot No. 255, thirty feet front on Centre street by one hundred and fifteen feet in depth, to William Selzer, and in June, 1848, he conveyed the other house and lot, No. 257, also thirty feet front by one hundred and fifteen feet in depth, to Sarah Strouse. By sundry mesne conveyances, title to the former became vested in the plaintiff, and, by like assurances, the title to the latter became vested in the defendant. Both houses were stone front, with wall of same material between them, and back building divided by a frame partition. In July, 1888, the defendant, being about to improve his lot by erecting thereon two brick buildings, in lieu of the old stone and frame building, was notified by the building inspectors that they had condemned the wooden partition or division between the old back buildings as insufficient for the building defendant was about to erect, and ordered the same to be taken down. Pursuant to that notice, he removed the frame partition or division wall and erected' in place thereof a nine-inch brick wall, which was afterwards approved by the building inspectors. He also utilized the old stone partition or division wall as a party wall. The trespass complained of is alleged to consist in using the old stone wall, taking down the wooden partition, and the careless manner in which the latter work was prosecuted.</p>

In view of that long-continued occupancy and possession' by the owners of the respective lots, it matters little whether the stone wall and wooden partition separating the two houses were exactly on the dividing line between the two lots or not. The uncontroverted evidence is that the owners of the houses and lots were each in the exclusive possession of their respective lots and houses long enough to give each, as against the <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>other, an undisputed title by possession, and thus constitute the stone wall and wooden partition a party wall.

The main fact of which the point was predicated was not seriously disputed, and the jury could not have found otherwise than that defendant’s house was built more than twenty-one years prior to the commission of the alleged trespass. The error was fundamental, and may have had a controlling effect in shaping the verdict.</p>
