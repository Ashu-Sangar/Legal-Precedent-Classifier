It seems, however, to be the settled law both in this country and in England that in general a recovery may be had in a suit at law in all cases where the legal right of the plaintiff has been invaded by the defendant, even though no actual damage result therefrom. The law will import damage. But when an individual asks an equitable remedy, when he seeks by injunction to restrain another from erecting or maintaining that which is styled a nuisance, something more than the mere invasion of a legal right must be shown. He must of course first show that a legal, or, as it is sometimes called, a substantial right has been invaded, else no matter how great the damage he may suffer from the act or-omission of the defendant, he would not have any standing to complain. He must then go beyond this and show that the injury done him is not of a trifling character, but tangible, considerable, and seriously interfering with the enjoyment of his property. Some of the cases even go further, and put it perhaps too strongly by saying that the injury must be irreparable.</p>

The mere fact that the object complained of amounts to a public nuisance, does not render it improper for a private individual to seek relief by injunction, if his legal rights have been infringed, and if, in addition to the damage suffered by the public generally, he shows a damage done him of a special and peculiar kind. It is no defence to a wrongdoer to allege that the act complained of inflicts a like injury on a number of persons. The rule is that one erecting or maintaining a common nuisance is not liable to an action at the suit of one who has sustained no damage therefrom, except such as is suffered by the public generally. He is liable at the suit of one who has sustained damage peculiar to himself. No matter how numerous the persons may be who have sustained this peculiar damage, each is entitled to relief therefor. The public nuisance becomes a private one to every person on whom it inflicts such peculiar damage.</p>

The further questions will also be considered, viz.: Whether the borough of Carlisle has power to pass an ordinance or bylaw permitting such projections; whether in this instance it has exercised that power and has granted the requisite license, and if so, whether such by-law is reasonable. The law is not that boroughs can license nuisances, but it must be remembered that all obstructions on the streets are not necessarily nuisances. There are certain reasonable obstructions which boroughs can license, and when so licensed neither the public nor an individual has a right to complain. The private right grows out of the public right, and when the public in a proper manner relinquishes that right the private right goes with it.</p>

Access to his building is not cut off, nor is the distance to be traversed in reaching the Livingston building from any given point increased. His right of passage is in no way interfered with. From the very nature of the projections, it is evident that the diminution of light and air occasioned thereby to Mr. Livingston, is inconsiderable, while the view is far less interrupted than it is by trees along the side of the street. It cannot be possible that the cutting off of a prospect by a bay-window, when it is necessary to raise the sash before that window can be seen at all, is the sort of an injury that is either tangible or considerable.

Clearly, the borough ordinance, b3r imposing a penalty on bulk or jut windows that project into the street beyond twent3r-eight inches in streets that are sixty feet wide and upwards,—Hanover is one of these, by implication at least,-—allows those that project to that distance. The general term “ jut window ” is broad enough to include structures like those bay-windows erected by Mr. Wolf : Commonwealth v. Harris, 10 W. N. 13. These do not encroach upon the highway beyond the said twenty-eight inches, and are therefore permitted by the ordinance. The ordinance in the same manner permits porches that do not extend into the street more than four feet three inches. The word porch, and the general spirit of the ordinance, cover such a projection as this veranda. This veranda does not project to so great a distance as allowed by the ordinance and is consequently thereby permitted. The ordinance is certainly not unreasonable, and the custom of the borough both before and since the passage of the same, in permitting not only such but even greater encroachments upon its streets, is abundant evidence of this.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[189,1465,1163,909]],["BL_548.1",548,[259,351,1162,1012]]]'>It remains, then, to determine whether the ordinance is legal, for if illegal it would of course afford no protection to Mr. Wolf. The control of public streets is in Pennsylvania an incident at common law of municipal corporations; and it does not seem to me that it would be a very great stretch of that common-law power for the borough to pass the ordinance in question. It is a general ordinance intended for the benefit of all the citizens and for the better enjoyment of their buildings and homes. It does not authorize that which is per se a nuisance, nor anything that realty materially interferes with public travel or public convenience, and it is certainty not unreasonable in its character. This principle is recognized in several Pennsylvania cases. In Wartman v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20Pa.%20209" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="33 Pa. 209">33 Pa. 209</a>, it is held that a municipal corporation has at common law a right to fix the time and place of holding markets. The language of the court is as follows : “ It is therefore the common law in Pennsylvania that every municipal corporation,-which has power to make by-laws and establish ordinances to promote the general welfare and preserve the <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>peace of a town or city, may fix the time and place of holding public markets for the sale of food, and make such other regulations concerning them as may conduce to the public interest. We take this to be the true rule, because it is necessary and proper, in harmony with the sentiments of the people, universally practiced by the towns, and universally submitted to by the residents of the country.” In Denehey v. Harrisburg, 2 Pears. 332, it is held that the control of the public streets is an incident to nearly all boroughs at common law, provided that control be exercised for the public good, of which the corporate authorities are for the most part the judge. This appears by the judicial decisions of most states, our own among the rest, and it is only in a very gross case that the power of a borough, so exercised, can be controlled or overruled by the courts. This, more especially in a court of equity, so long as the corporate authorities are acting within the scope of their creation and for the apparent benefit of the citizens they represent. The case, Fisher v. Harrisburg, <a href="/grant/2/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="2 Grant 291" data-case-ids="227678" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0291-01">2 Gr. 291</a>, recognizes the authority of a municipal corporation to make sewers without special authority given for that purpose.</p>

Carlisle was incorporated by an act passed April 13, 1782, 2 Carey &amp; B. L. 333. Section 39 of the act of incorporation reads as follows :</p>

The thirty-third section of the act provides that any borough heretofore incorporated may, upon application to the Court of Quarter Sessions, become subject to the restrictions and possess the powers and privileges conferred by this act, “provided, that upon such application being confirmed by the said court the provisions of the former charter shall be annulled by the decree of the court so far as they are in conflict with the provisions of this act.” Carlisle was incorporated before the passage of this act. On the 14th day of April, 1852, application having been previously made to the Court of Quarter Sessions to have the provisions of the act of April 3, 1851, extended to Carlisle, it was so decreed, and that all the provisions of the former charter “ of said borough, so far as they conflict-with the provisions of the said act, be annulled.” The act of 1851 gives boroughs the power to regulate their streets and all needful jurisdiction over the same. This does not directly give the boroughs authority to permit projections in the street, but it gives them certain discretionary power over the streets, which power when reasonably exercised will not readily be interfered with by the court. The original charter is annulled only in so far as it is inconsistent with the act of 1851. The charter by clear implication allows jut windows that do not obstruct or incommode the passage of any street, lane or alley, and porches that do not extend into the streets fifty feet wide and upward beyond four feet three inches. The master has already given his opinion on the interpretation that ought to be put on the words “ jut window ” and “ porch,” and thinks that they include respectively projections such as this bay-window and veranda. There is nothing in the act of 1851 annulling these provisions of the charter, and they are therefore applicable to the borough to-day: Harlisburg v. Sheck, <a href="/pa/104/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="104 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="452174" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0053-01">104 Pa. 53</a>.

Every purchaser of a lot, therefore, bought the right to an open street eighty feet wide, with all the conveniences, pleasures, luxuries, if you choose, which that right implies, and took subject to the same right in every purchaser.

To this end cities and boroughs have their legislative as well as their administrative officers, and the municipal legislature may make laws in regard to all subjects of a municipal character, and enforce them by appropriate penalties. The local government must keep within the limits that bound its jurisdiction as they are defined by the constitution and laws of the state; but, subject to these restrictions, it may determine what is best calculated to promote the security, the comfort, and the convenience of the inhabitants. Among the subjects of municipal control is that of the opening, vacating, and management of streets and alleys. The city or borough may decide when and where it will open streets, what shall be their width, and how much of that width shall be devoted to a carriage way, and how much to footwalks. It may say where trees shall be planted within the street limits, where and how hitching posts shall be set, telegraph poles erected, or passenger railways built. Its decision in such matters may subject a few persons to some inconvenience, or possibl}r to some substantial loss, but it has the power to decide on such subjects. The foot Avays no less than the carriage ways are under municipal control, and the authorities may determine the extent to which the walks and pavements may be obstructed by cellar doors, door-steps, awnings, projecting Avindows, cornices, and the like. This power must be exercised by regulations that are general and uniform, that are reasonable and certain, and that are in conformity with the constitution and laws. When so exercised, it is binding on all the inhabitants of the municipality. These general propositions are supported by many cases, among which are Paul v. Carver, <a href="/pa/26/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="26 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="977306" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0223-01">26 Pa. 223</a>; Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b553-5" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[249,2376,1123,45]],["BL_554.1",554,[254,372,1170,505]]]'>In this case, the obstruction complained of is a window pro<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>jecting from the second story of defendant’s dwelling into the street. The plaintiff alleges that the obstruction is unlawful, and asks that it may be prevented by an injunction. The defendant sets up a borough ordinance as his authority for building the window, and denies that it inflicts any substantial injury upon the plaintiff. The controlling question, therefore, is whether the borough of Carlisle has authorized the construction of the window. If it has, the decree appealed from was rightly made. If it has not, then the extent of the plaintiff’s injury, and the other questions raised, must be considered.</p>
    <p id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[258,883,1173,1262]]]'>It is not denied that an ordinance was duly passed by the borough council on the 20th May, 1852, relating to this subject. It provided, among other things, that all porches, cellar doors, and door-steps should be so built as not to extend into any street, having a breadth of sixty feet, beyond four feet three inches, or a proportional distance in narrower streets. It also prohibited the construction of “ any bulk or jut window ” projecting into the street more than twenty-eight inches. In 1869 this ordinance was amended so as to reduce the distance that a cellar door might extend into the street to three feet and nine inches, and that for door-steps to three feet and six inches; but the provision for “ bulk or jut windows ” remained at twenty-eight inches. The master finds that the defendant’s window extends but twenty-seven and one half inches over the street line. It is therefore within the limit fixed by the ordinance, and, as to the public, within its protection. It is true the ordinance does not expressly declare that lot owners may occupy three feet and nine inches of the street with their cellar-ways, or project their jut or bay-windows to a distance of twenty-eight inches over the street; but, -by forbidding the extension of such structures beyond a fixed limit, it does, by clear and necessary implication, permit their erection within that limit. The window is therefore not an unlawful obstruction of the street, but a projection authorized by the ordinance of 1852.</p>
    <p id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.6",554,[268,2160,1165,247]],["BL_555.1",555,[179,363,1164,147]]]'>In Reimer’s Appeal, supra, an injunction was granted restraining the erection of a projecting window, but it was because no valid municipal authority was shown for building it. An individual permit had been granted, but it was held that the use of the streets for such purposes must be regulated by rules of <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>general and uniform application. The power to make such rules was not denied, but was clearly recognized. The principles that control this case may be stated thus:</p>
    <p id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[180,517,1164,237]]]'>1. Cities and boroughs have the power to permit, under regulations that are reasonable in character, and general in their application, the use of a portion of the highways for approaches to and for ornamental work upon buildings standing on the street line.</p>
    <p id="b555-6" data-blocks='[["BL_555.6",555,[182,772,1162,147]]]'>2. The borough of Carlisle has exercised this power by the ordinance of 1852, which is reasonable in its provisions, and general in its application.</p>
    <p id="b555-7" data-blocks='[["BL_555.7",555,[182,926,1164,146]]]'>3. The window complained of is within the limit of projection fixed by the ordinance, and it is consequently within its implied permission.</p>
    <p id="b555-8" data-blocks='[["BL_555.8",555,[184,1080,1163,248]]]'>It follows that the projecting window is not an unlawful obstruction, but a lawful structure. If this conclusion could be regarded as doubtful, the decree ought nevertheless to be affirmed upon the finding of the master that the window caused no appreciable injury to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b555-9" data-blocks='[["BL_555.9",555,[446,1335,900,95]]]'>The decree is affirmed; the costs to be paid by the appellant.</p>
