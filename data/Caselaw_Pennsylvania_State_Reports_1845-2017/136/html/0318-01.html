The will also gave three fortieths of the residuary estate to the respondent Agnes D. Lippincott, sixteen fortieths to her son James D. Lippincott, and twelve fortieths to her daughter, Anna M. D.

He had no employment, had not been brought up to any kind of business, and was not familiar with book-keeping. He was residing on a farm near Washington, D. C., belonging to his three sisters and himself, and inherited from their parents. He was married September 21, 1865, and during the following winter he and his wife spent some time in Philadelphia. During bis stay there, he consulted counsel as to the propriety of contesting the will of the testator, upon the ground of undue influence upon the testator, exercised by Mrs. Lippincott and her husband, <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>but that idea was finally abandoned. In company with his counsel, Mr. Joseph T.

In interviews which he had with the executors, the petitioner made inquiries as to the probable value of his interest in the estate, but was informed that they were unable, as yet, to tell him what he would receive.</p>

Shortly before this he had applied to the executors for a loan of §1,500 on the credit of his interest in the estate, but the executors declined to make it. At the time of this first distribution, however, Mrs. Agnes D. Lippincott lent him the §1,500, taking a pledge of his interest in the estate as security for its re-payment. On July 6, 1866, the executors made a second distribution, in which the petitioner’s share was §4,932.27, and, after the deduction of the amount due to Mrs. Lippincott on account of the loan made to him, he received the remainder of his share in cash.</p>

Lippincott, in regard to such a sale, offering to accept from him whatever he might consider a fair valuation. Mr. Lippincott, on August 8,1866, replied to the letter of July 19th that absence from home prevented him from receiving it until that date, and saying: “ In regard to purchasing your interest in your uncle’s estate, as an executor I cannot do so. The thirty-one fortieths however, if they could purchase the entire five fortieths owned by yourself and sisters, I should approve.

As the result of some further correspondence, the petitioner came to Philadelphia in October, 1866, and had an interview with Joshua Lippincott, who informed him that Mrs. Lippincott would take his share at its appraised value, and he agreed orally to sell it then at that value. A calculation, theretofore prepared by Mr. Lippincott and Mr. Smethurst, was then exhibited to him, showing an estimated valuation of the estate as of October 6, 1866, and resulting in his one thirty-second share being valued at $13,802.57, and, deducting the $4,932.27 which he had received in July, 1866, there was left $8,870.30. ■ This calculation contained estimates made upon three different bases, and the valuation of'$13,802.57 was arrived at by taking the average of the three results.

It did not appear that the books were shown to him at any other time, or .that he had any other opportunity to examine them. «The ledger was not shown to him, nor the record or title-book of the real estate, in which all sales of property were entered. The actual receipts from sales of real and personal estate, all but one of which had been made prior to July 6, 1866, were not stated to petitioner, nor did the increase thereon, if any, •enter into the calculations, although included in the first account of the executors afterwards filed. Petitioner made no inquiry from any one, except from Mr. Smethurst and Joshua Lippincott, as to the value of the estate or the particular items composing it. “ The explanations and information given by Mr. Lippincott to the petitioner, seem to have been of a very general character, without referring in detail to the items. . . . So far as his testimony shows any reference to details, in his interviews with the petitioner, it was as to expenses and outlays, particularly the heavy expenses of the coal lands in •Schuylkill county and the great cost of the mausoleum.” “ The petitioner, so far as the testimony shows, did not get any <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>fuller or more detailed explanation or information from Mr. Smethurst.” Mr. Smethurst was secretary of the trustees of the Pratt estate, and was thoroughly conversant with all the details of it. The testator’s undivided one fourth interest in that estate was “ valued exclusively by him,” but the petitioner was afforded no information or explanation beyond that valuation. “Petitioner was not informed that in fact some, if not all, the stocks and securities in the inventory were then selling at higher prices.” “ No intimation even was given of any possible increase over the appraised values; but the expenses and necessary disbursements, and the unproductiveness of the properties were, according to Joshua Lippincott’s own testimony, largely dwelt upon and emphasized both by himself and Mr. Smethurst in the information and explanation which was given to petitioner.” “ As regards the.....claims against the estate,..... the probable large amount of these, with some mention of detail, was specially pressed on the attention of the petitioner. There was not the same anxiety to make known to him either the actual increase on the items specified, or the possibility of any advance in the valuations of the items not actually disposed of.”</p>

Searches were ordered against petitioner, and the matter was in preparation. No time was fixed for the payment of the purchase money.

The seller, in the present case, certainly did object at least as earfy as December, 1868, about two years after the transaction, and he objected also subsequently more than once. His objection was known to the purchaser certainly with sufficient distinctness to prevent any dealing with the property transferred in a manner inconsistent with any trust or confidence. There is no evidence, indeed, of any dealing by the purchaser with this undivided interest, in any way particularly or specifically prior to the filing of the petition. She had received no part of the property upon the distribution under the auditor’s report on the first account, for the dividend to petitioner’s share was not quite equal to what he had already received. The relative position of the parties had not been changed in the interval of time before the petition was filed.

Manifestly the same facts will bear one interpretation where easy credulity is at the mercy of acute and practiced cunning, and another and different interpretation where each side is pitted against its antagonist and relies upon its own shrewdness to secure the advantage. Counsel did not overlook this consideration. With a vividness of coloring which did credit to the eloquence of the advocate, but was not so flattering either to the intellect or morals of the client, the petitioner was pictured as a wholly illiterate youth, who united to the shiftlessness of a spendthrift the profligacy of a debauchee, and who was so impoverished by his excesses that he was eager to sell his inheritance at any sacrifice. He was described, somewhat incongruously, as a country bumpkin, a Mulberry Sellers, and a Prodigal Son. Happily for his future, the hero of these titles failed to exhibit in his <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>private life the character which had been assigned to him in fiction. He was rather remarkable for his industry and acumen. He drove an express wagon at one time, and was then promoted to a clerkship; and after marrying an estimable woman, he purchased a home for her with the first moneys he received from the estate. He had even a surplus for charity; and he piously declared that the seed which he had scattered in that field had yielded a hundredfold. These deeds of beneficence and this providence of resources, rather than his poverty, were the arguments he plied with those whom he solicited as purchasers. His overtures for the sale of his interest were made, too, only after he had sought the advice of counsel here and elsewhere, all of whom attempted to dissuade him from his purpose, and after an unsuccessful effort to annul the will of the testator; and his receipt, when the sale was consummated and the money paid over, was accompanied with the declaration that he had acted in the transaction with a full knowledge of his interest in the estate, and without any persuasion or influence of any kind whatever.

Nor do we forget that his inspection of those accounts was a matter of the merest form. But it was an inspection of his own devising; he could have employed experts and he could have consulted counsel. Neither of these aids could have been furnished by the respondents, for the obvious reason that both expert and counsel would have been their agents, and, theoretically, at least, hostile to the petitioner. What took place before the sale is as significant as anything which followed it. The petitioner was in the market; he had importuned his relatives and strangers to buy; in the language of more than one witness, he had hawked his wares about town. The respondents, so far from bidding for his interest, repulsed his proposals. To adopt the words of the Mas<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>ter of the Rolls, in Moth v. Atwood, 5 Yes. 845, the petitioner “ was determined to sell this reversion, and if the law will not prevent a man from selling, it would be too much for a court of equity to say any bargain upon the subject will be bad..... It is clearly admitted it was offered over and over, to all the town, to twenty persons. That circumstance is decisive, and would alone be sufficient to dismiss a bill brought at the distance of twelve years from the transaction. This man (respondent) was not going about, or lying by, to avail himself of an opportunity to get a good bargain.” It is important to notice, also, that the petitioner was not exposing for sale an expectant interest, as was erroneously stated at the argument; his interest was vested, and therefore not within the rule which annuls a contract with an heir for mere inadequacy of price: Davidson v. Little, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20252" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="22 Pa. 252">22 Pa. 252</a>. The respondents have this moral advantage, that in all their verbal declarations to the petitioner they never under-estimated his prospects in the estate. He was told by the husband of the purchaser that he would be amply provided for through his legacy; and his wife was told by the purchaser that his interest would amount to $50,000. If, in the face of these statements, he deliberately waived all inquiry, and accepted $15,000 as the price of his portion, he can offer no plea for relief which will avail him, except fraud, or mistake which was tantamount in its effects to fraud.</p>

The trustee in that case bought from himself, under a special confidence which he abused, and before the completion of his contract, resold at a large profit. Lord Eldon, in indorsing the judgment which was rendered, and declaring that a purchase by a trustee, even for an adequate price, will be set aside, excepts the case in which all knowledge of the value of the property acquired by the trustee, has been communicated to the cestui que trust. He says : “ The rule I take to be this: not that a trustee cannot buy from his cestui que trust, but that he shall not buy from himself. If a trustee will so deal with his cestui que trust that the amount of the transaction shall shake off the obligation that attaches upon him as trustee, then he may buy:” Ex parte Lacey, 6 Yes. 625.

We shall go into no labored detail; to do so would require us to transpose bodily into the opinion the elaborate calculations which cover many pages of the master’s report. We have indeed a grave doubt as to their pertinency to this issue, and a grave doubt, therefore, whether we should discuss them at all. For the fact that calculations, minute even to abstruseness, were needed to make out the prima facies of the petitioner’s claim, is some proof that his claim is of very uncertain tenure. He had agreed to sell, and the co-respondent to purchase, at a price to be fixed by an appraisement. Both parties, therefore, threw themselves upon the judgment of the valuers of the estate; and, as that judgment, in common with all things human, was fallible, they agreed to accept it with its fallibili<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>ties. The judgment of those appraisers might differ, and it almost certainly would differ, in a matter so intricate, from the judgment of any other set of appraisers, however appointed; it might even differ, as it seems to have differed, from that of the master; but it was, nevertheless, the controlling judgment, because it was rendered by the umpire whom the parties in interest had selected.</p>

Suppose it was unwise and unreasonable in the cestuis que trust to name the trustees as their umpire ? They had, nevertheless, a right to select those gentlemen, and by the very act of selection, they canceled, as to this transaction, all fiduciary relations. This, at least, is precisely the reasoning of Lord Eldon, in Ex parte Lacey, supra. He says: “The rule'is this: A trustee who is entrusted to sell and manage for others, undertakes, in the same moment in which he becomes a trustee, not to manage for the benefit and advantage of himself. It does not preclude a new contract with those who have entrusted him.' It does not preclude him from bargaining that he will no longer act as a trustee. The cestuis que trust may, by a new contract, dismiss him from that character.” Apply this rule here. The trustees by the voluntary choice of the cestuis que trust became the agents of the latter to carry out the sale. Can it be possible that any mistake, short of fraud, of those agents, can, after the sale has been perfected, and the consideration has been paid, work a dissolution of the bargain ? Or, reverse the places of the contending parties : suppose the appraisers had over-valued the estate; could the purchaser ask for a rescission of the contract because she had paid too much ?</p>

It was alleged that the petitioner knew nothing of any of these sales, and we accept, for the purposes of the argument, although against every doctrine of probabilities, that the statement was true. But his proposal was to sell at the appraisement; and a new element is now sought to be injected into the proposal, bjr adding subsequent profits to existing valuations. This proposition, however, contradicts the definition of an appraisement, that it is a mean between prospective profits and prospective losses. Tested by the alternative of a sale resulting in a loss, its fallacy is at once apparent. Certainly, if a loss had occurred, the price under the contract would have remained unchanged, because that price had been fixed by the inventory, and because the risk, both of loss and gain, had been assumed by the buyer. If, then, the seller could not be affected by a loss, why should he claim to be benefited by a profit?</p>

He also finds that the gross and not the net amount of the taxes was deducted from the total inventoried value of the estate, thereby making an under-estimate of $2,217.03. He names other errors which are not patent, and would require great space to particularize. If we assume that the differences which have been pointed out, and the profits upon the sales, which last were fixed at $63,476.74, should have appeared in the estimate furnished by the trustees, the petitioner would have been entitled to $1,630.30 in excess of what was actually paid him as the value of his legacy. It is a material circumstance in this connection, that the appraisement upon which the trustees proceeded was the original inventory of the estate, and that the items in abatement which were intended to reach the present worth of the property, were not fixed solely by the husband of the purchaser. He was assisted throughout the work' by his co-executor, a gentleman of acknowledged eminence as a conveyancer, who was also the secretary of the trustees of the Pratt .estate, and who had no interest in the transactions with the .petitioner. Attached to the appraisement were two exhibits, <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>prepared by the trustees, showing the average income of the estate for one year and for five years respectively, and the estimated principal which would be required to produce that income. These schedules were apparently designed to verify the accuracy of the appraisement. They were made the subject of extended comment and laborious ciphering by the master ; but as the settlement, under the agreement between the parties, was based upon the appraisement, it is to that paper alone that the limits of this opinion will permit a reference. The masses of figures which the master has drawn from the accounts filed by the executors at dates succeeding the sale in question will also be passed over, for the reason that they are applicable only in case the petitioner shall be reinstated as legatee, and were mainly introduced to show the value of his interest as such legatee at the date of the last account, July 5, 1875.</p>

The sale was completed November 7, 1866, and the first intimation that the petitioner intended to take steps to set it aside was given in December, 1868. Tn April of the following year, the purchaser notified the petitioner in writing, as she had in the interval verbally notified his counsel, that on re-payment of the purchase-money she would cancel and return his conveyance. Through no fault of either party, the petitioner failed to receive the communication until after the time for re-payment had passed. But he made no effort to secure a longer time; he simply did nothing. It is our belief that the day of grace closed at that moment, and closed by his own choice. We may safely discard the reasons we have heretofore urged, and standing upon this one circumstance, affirm that, whatever other remedy may be within his reach, the remedy proposed by the master, through a rescission of the contract, is not open to the petitioner.

This agreement could not have been void, because he has expressly found that it was free from fraud. If we admit that the petitioner was not bound by it, we must also admit that he was not bound to reject it, and that when he refused to reject it, he confirmed it. He may sue for damages- for the fraud, if there is any, but his suit is a confirmation of the contract: Pearsoll v.

Upon the only other question which can be raised we are equally clear. The petitioner is not entitled to recover for the diminution in the price of his interest, which may have been worked by any errors In the appraisement from which that price was made up. If the reasons which we have endeavored to set out are inadequate to this conclusion, that in an estate of such intricacy no appraisements could be demonstrably correct, and that no two appraisements could be alike, and that in adopting this standard of values the contracting parties waived all errors which were untainted by fraud, a final reason presents itself in the doctrine of'laches.</p>

It is intended as a check to litigation, and as a test of the good faith of a litigant. The presumption <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>against the party who sleeps upon his claim, is not only that the claim never existed, but that the claimant never believed in its existence. The case of the petitioner may be fairly judged by this criterion. With his instinct for litigation fully alive, he delayed the formal assertion of his rights until nearly five years after the bargain which he repented of had been executed. The inducement to this tardy controversy was that his sisters received for their shares a larger consideration than his own share had yielded him. No sane mind would accept the conclusion that an increase of price in the second sale was, in itself, proof that fraud had been perpetrated in the first sale. The evidence was positive, however, that, in the interval, market prices had risen, and a profitable sale had been effected under exceptional circumstances ; and that, in addition to these incidents, a desire to end a vexatious contest had induced the purchasers to advance upon their bids. In the hope of securing a part of the profits which neither he nor any one else had anticipated, he embarked upon what may be emphatically called a cruise of discovery; at his call, week after week, books and papers were transported by cart loads to the office of the master ; and years of patient effort on the part of that officer and of counsel have unearthed errors, untouched, as the master reports, by the suggestion of fraud, whose aggregate falls far short of the expense of this inquiry. In the light of these events, the letter of the petitioner, in which he first announced to the respondents his purpose to sell, seems to have been prophetic. It concluded thus: “ I hope my dear sir, you will make me a proposition similar to the heirs in West Virginia, as you have signified your intention to buy their shares. As regards not allowing me enough, and my saying in after time I did not receive its proper value, all I can say is, that I have too much confidence in you as a high-toned gentleman, and am willing to accept whatever' you consider a fair value.” When we recall the fact, that just before the date of that letter, its author had secretly striven to destroy the legacy given to the person whom he addressed by these courtly epithets, and that, some years after its date, he evinced his gratitude and his confidence by charging that person with fraud, we do not fully appreciate the pathos with which counsel for the petitioner insisted that the wrong of which he complains <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>was invited on his part by the artless innocence which suspects no evil.</p>

The court erred in finding that the parties to the sale stood at arm’s length and were in law equally matched. This is the case of a sale of an undivided interest in an estate by a cestui que trust, a young man without means, without employment, without any knowledge of business, and ignorant of values, to the wife of the trustee, at a valuation previously made by her husband and his co-trustees, as to which the vendor had no independent advice or counsel, the executors failing to communicate to him information which they had, and the valuation made by them proving to be incorrect and greatly below the actual value, even on the basis upon which it was made. The actual dealing was between the cestui que trust and his trustee, and prima facie, such a purchase by a trustee cannot stand: Spencer’s App., <a href="/pa/80/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="80 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1042296" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0317-01">80 Pa. 317</a>.

While it is not con<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>tended that an executor or his wife may not buy, it is necessary that there be affirmative proof of the fairness of the transaction: Gibson v.

That the appellant, instead of employing experts to examine the accounts and calculations, and consulting counsel, chose to place confidence in the representations of the executor, is no answer to his complaint that such confidence was abused: Redgrave v.

In this case, moreover, the appellant could sell only to a person whom the executors would favor; no outside party could get the information on which to bid. But the rule is applicable to sales of vested estates in remainder and reversion, and also to estates in possession: 1 Story’s Eq. J., §§ 335, 337; Aylesford v. Morris, L. R. 8 Ch.

The court erred, also, in disregarding the finding of the auditor that the value of his interest was incorrectly represented to the appellant. The auditor’s conclusion that there was a relation of confidence in this case, which bound the executors to exhibit the truth as it existed, was correct: 1 Perry on Trusts, §179; Babcock v.

Fraud does not necessarily mean deceit and circumvention; it includes all acts, omissions and concealments which involve a breach of a legal or equitable duty, or of a trust or confidence justly reposed: 1 Story’s Eq. J., §§171, 187; Aylesford v. Morris, L. R. 8 Ch. App. 484 ; Moxon v. Payne, L. R. 8 Ch. App. 881; Evans v. Llewellyn, 1 Cox Ch. 332; Tyson v.

In this case, the principal elements of fraud are made to appear, and the inference of fraud necessarily follows.

Borie, <a href="/pa/81/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="81 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1044137" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0278-01">81 Pa. 278</a>; Ashhurst’s App., <em><a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%20315" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="60 Pa. 315">60 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%20315" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="60 Pa. 315">Pa. 315</a>; Clegg v. Edmundson, 3 Jur., N. S., 299. After an offer to cancel the sale, a further delay of two years is altogether inadmissible, especially when there has been a subsequent accidental rise in the value of the estate. The rise and fall of values cannot thus be speculated upon.</p>

Dundas, one of whom is appellant. He thus became entitled to one fourth of five fortieths, or one thirty-second of said residuary estate. On September 9, 1865, an inventory and appraisement of the estate was duly made and filed in the register’s office. In January, 1866, appellant, then about twenty-four years of age, <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>received from Mrs. Lippincott, another of the residuary legatees, $1,500, in anticipation of distribution. Out of the first distribution of income, made about six months after testator’s decease, he received his share, $533.82, and out of the next distribution made six months later, he received nearly $5,000.</p>
    <p id="b364-5" data-blocks='[["BL_364.5",364,[263,621,1169,1625]]]'>Appellant’s first thought, almost immediately after testator’s death, appears to have been to attack and set aside the will, on the ground of undue influence exercised by one of the appellees and her husband. Eminent counsel were consulted as to the propriety of that course, but it does not appear to have been encouraged. Having abandoned the idea of contesting the will, he then consulted several others in regard to the propriety of selling his interest in the residuary estate, and in that connection he and one of his legal advisers, in 1865, examined the inventory and appraisement. At that time, his attorney informed him that the assets of the estate were appraised at the lowest figure to save collateral inheritance tax. On several occasions he was advised not to sell, but notwithstanding that advice, and the reasons suggested in support of it, he persisted in endeavoring to find a purchaser. Shortly after he received his share of the second distribution, in July, 1866, he wrote to Mr. Joshua Lippincott, one of the executors, proposing a sale to him. In that letter, referring to a suggestion that liad been made by his sister, he said: “ As regards not allowing me enough, and saying in aftertime that I did not receive its proper value, all I can say is, that I have too much confidence in you as a high-toned gentleman, and am willing to accept whatever you consider a fair valuation.” In his reply, Mr. Lippincott emphatically declined to entertain the proposition to purchase, giving as a reason therefor, that being an executor he could not do so. He suggested, however, that appellant might sell his interest to others who were entitled to participate in the estate. As the result of that correspondence, one or two visits to Philadelphia, and conferences with the executors, etc., appellant arranged to sell his remaining interest to Mrs. Lippincott, wife of one of the executors, and also a residuary legatee.</p>
    <p id="b364-6" data-blocks='[["BL_364.6",364,[263,2253,1165,145]],["BL_365.1",365,[183,356,1167,1222]]]'>Under the will she was entitled to three fortieths, and her two children together to twenty-eight fortieths, thus making the holding of the family more than three fourths of the resid<a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>uary estate. A number of interviews and conferences had previously taken place between appellant and Mr. Smethhurst and Mr. Lippincott, two of the executors, in regard to the value of the estate, which finally culminated in a calculation prepared by the executors upon three different bases. This was submitted to appellant and was finally agreed to by him. The sale was consummated early in November, 1866, and the consideration, $10,000, paid by Mrs. Lippincott out of her private estate.' At that time, appellant expressed himself as fully satisfied with the transaction. This is evidenced by his written declaration delivered to the purchaser with his deed. In that he says: “ I have examined and considered the condition of the estate of the late James Dundas, and certain statements showing the present value thereof furnished to me by the executors, all information relating to the subject having been freely given me by the executors of James Dundas, and I am satisfied that a fair valuation of the whole residuary estate in which I am interested, including the principal of the annuities hereafter to fall in, is the sum of $441,682.40, and upon this basis I have requested Mrs. Agnes Dundas Lippincott to purchase of me my one fourth of five fortieths of said residuary estate, which she has agreed to do, and I am acting in this sale of my residuary estate with a full knowledge of my interest in said estate, and without any persuasion or influence of any kind.”</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[185,1585,1165,759]]]'>The first intimation of any dissatisfaction with the sale of his interest to Mrs. Lippincott, was given to her counsel in December, 1868, when appellant and his counsel appeared at the audit of the first account of the executors and notified the auditor that they intended to make an application to set aside the conveyance made more than two years before. Early in 1869, both of the learned counsel who appeared for appellant before the auditor were informed by Mrs. Lippincott’s attorneys that she would re-convey the interest she had purchased from appellant upon re-payment of the purchase money with interest. No notice was taken of this offer, and in April, 1869, it was renewed in writing, with a limitation as to the time within which it might be accepted. It was not accepted, nor was there any application made for a modification of the offer, or an extension of the time within which it might be accepted.</p>
    <p id="b365-6" data-blocks='[["BL_365.6",365,[231,2352,1116,43]],["BL_366.1",366,[269,366,1161,600]]]'>In April, 1871, appellant’s petition, in which his grievances <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>are fully set forth, was presented to the Orphans’ Court, praying that the conveyance of his interest in the residuary estate to Mrs. Lippincott be set aside, and that he be permitted to participate in the distribution of said estate as though said deed had never been made. Thereupon Mrs. Lippincott and her husband, and the surviving executors of the will, appeared and answered the petition, denying all the allegations of fraudulent valuation, misrepresentation, etc., upon which the court was asked to set aside the conveyance. The issues of fact raised by the petition and answers were referred to an auditor, whose very able and exhaustive report, and the action of the court thereon, are now before us.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[268,978,1160,146]]]'>On the main questions of fraudulent valuation and misrepresentation charged in the petition, the learned auditor’s conclusions, as stated by himself, are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[266,1133,1164,1061]]]'>“ The representation of the value of the estate, and the interest therein proposed to be sold, the auditor finds was incorrect in the premises upon which the estimate of value was founded, and in the methods through which the resultant estimate was reached.....The auditor, however, after a most thorough and careful and repeated examination and consideration of the actual and absolute or naked facts of the case, which covered a very wide range, cannot find that there was in this incorrect representation and valuation, fraud upon the part of the executors who had thus placed themselves in such a relation of confidence to the seller. The auditor finds as a fact that this representation of the condition of the estate, and of the value thereof, and of the seller’s interest therein, was incorrect, but that it was not fraudulent. It was a mistake, and such a mistake as would not unnaturally arise from the peculiar character of the assets of the estate and its complicated nature, and the complex relations of the parties concerned. The auditor is of opinion, and so finds, that, however mistaken the executors were, yet they honestly believed that the representations they made to the seller, the petitioner, were correct and fair for the purposes in view.”</p>
    <p id="b366-8" data-blocks='[["BL_366.7",366,[264,2202,1159,197]],["BL_367.1",367,[175,358,1166,147]]]'>These conclusions of fact, we think are quite as favorable to the appellant as the evidence warranted. The facts and circumstances from which they are drawn by the auditor are so fully and clearly set forth in his report, and in the opinion of <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>the court, that we have deemed it-unnecessary to do more than outline them sufficiently to indicate the relation of the parties to each other and the principles involved in the contention.</p>
    <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[174,511,1171,554]]]'>' While the record is somewhat voluminous, and the specifications of error very numerous, the controlling questions are very few. An examination of the record, and full consideration of the exhaustive arguments of counsel, have led us to the conclusion that the cardinal question in the case is, as tersely stated by the learned counsel for appellees: “ Can a residuary legatee, being the wife of an executor of an estate, purchase the share of another residuary legatee, through the medium of her husband, in the absence of fraud; or, does the rule which forbids a trustee from buying at his own sale, apply to such a case, and render the sale voidable at the will of the vendor?”</p>
    <p id="b367-6" data-blocks='[["BL_367.6",367,[176,1078,1169,1116]]]'>There is no doubt as to the facts of which the first branch of this question is predicated. The relation of the parties to each other is strictly correct. As the learned auditor has correctly found, no fraud was practiced or even meditated; nor was there any mistake, on the part of the executors, or either of them, that can, under the circumstances, be regarded as tantamount to fraud. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that there was a mistake in their mode of estimating the value of the residuary estate, it was, as the learned auditor says, “ such a mistake as would not unnaturally arise from the peculiar assets of the estate,” etc.; and, “ however mistaken the executors were, they honestly believed that the representations they made.....were correct and fair.” The facts being so, there is neither reason nor authority for the position that, under such circumstances, and in the absence of fraud, actual or constructive, one legatee may not purchase the interest of another legatee. It is a mistake to contend that the rule which forbids a trustee from buying at his own sale, applies to such a case, and in any manner renders the sale either void or voidable, at the will of the vendor. Without questioning the soundness of the authorities relied on by appellant, it is sufficient to say, that they are inapplicable to the controlling facts of this case.</p>
    <p id="b367-9" data-blocks='[["BL_367.7",367,[176,2203,1169,198]],["BL_368.1",368,[262,350,1170,851]]]'>In connection with his review of the facts and circumstances leading up to the sale, the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court, after fully considering the relation of the parties to the transaction, and other questions involved, came to the conclusion <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>“ that the parties to the sale stood at arm’s length, and were, in law, equally matched; ” that there was nothing in their relation to each other, or in the action of the executors, that ought to have the effect of rendering the sale either void or voidable; that it was not void, because it was not tainted with fraud, nor was it voidable at the election of appellant on the ground of unintentional mistakes “ in the premises upon which the estimate of value was founded, because appellant agreed to sell and Mrs. Lippincott agreed to buy at the price ascertained by the statement and estimate furnished and submitted by the executors, and that, in the absence of fraud, or such mistake as is tantamount thereto, both parties were bound by their agreement to accept, as correct, the statement and estimate which was honestly prepared and submitted by the parties whom they voluntarily selected for that purpose, especially after approval of the estimate and execution of the contract of sale based thereon.”</p>
    <p id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[257,1220,1170,960]]]'>These conclusions were warranted by the facts found by the auditor and the authorities cited by the learned judge in his able and exhaustive opinion. It is unnecessary to make further reference to the facts of the case, or to review the authorities cited and relied on as applicable thereto. Enough has been said to show that the opinion of the Orphans’ Court is an ample vindication of the correctness of its decree. The sale in question was clearly not void, because the fact that it was not tainted with fraud has been conclusively established. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that it was voidable at the election of appellant because of unintentional errors in the estimate by which the value of his interest in the residuary estate was ascertained, it was his duty to act with reasonable promptness. That was not done. His delay was inexcusable, especially in view of the offer of Mrs. Lippincott to re-eonvey on payment of the amount he received from her with interest. For reasons given in the opinion above referred to, we think the court below was also right in holding that appellant was estopped by his laches from assailing the validity of his conveyance.</p>
    <p id="b368-7" data-blocks='[["BL_368.6",368,[516,2187,904,93]]]'>Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the coste of appellant.</p>
