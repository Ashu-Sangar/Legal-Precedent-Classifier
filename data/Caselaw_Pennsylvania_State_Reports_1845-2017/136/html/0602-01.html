It sets forth the title in the plaintiff to the land in dispute, and his right to the possession thereof, and shows what is in fact an adverse occupancy of the same by the defendants. What does it signify that the plaintiff calls it trespassing, when he shows the act complained of to be an actual, open, continuous, indivisible,adverse and hostile possession and occupancy? In his own language, “they have entered upon said land and premises, and have located two wells, and erected derricks, and other buildings and structures thereon, and are drilling wells for the purpose of mining or producing oil therefrom..... That said defendants have persisted and still continue to persist in their trespassing on said premises, and have a well near completion.” Clearly, so far, the plaintiff shows a wrong which <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>can be remedied by an action of ejectment, and for which that action is the only remedy.</p>

With the exception of the allegation of waste, the consequences of putting down these wells would be incident to any well drilled by the owner upon land adjoining plaintiff’s lease, and close to any of his wells. I have never heard of any remedy at law being invoked for any injury sustained because of a well drilled close to the line upon the land of an adjoining owner. It is possible some injury might arise from the negligence or careless use or mismanagement of such a well to the owner of adjoining oil territory, for which the law might furnish a redress, but when can a court of equity intervene to prevent apprehended injury from carelessness of owners or employees in the management of oil wells upon adjoining lands, while prosecuting the business of producing oil in the usual and ordinary manner? Nothing else is made to appear upon this branch of the case, except that the land, upon which these operations are carried on, is in dispute between the plaintiff and defendants under what the plaintiff calls a “pretended” claim of right. The diminution in the production of oil to one person from the well of another, close to the boundary line, furnishes no ground for either a legal or equitable remedy.</p>

Whatever oil may be taken by the defendants from the disputed premises is so much taken from the corpus of the estate. But is the taking of it, in the manner charged, such waste as to give jurisdiction to a court of equity ? In Grubb’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=90%20Pa.%20234" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="90 Pa. 234">90 Pa. 234</a>, it is said that “waste is spoil or destruction done or allowed to be done to houses, woods, lands or other corporeal hereditaments by the tenants thereof, to the prejudice of the heir, or of those in reversion or remainder.” See also Denny v. Brunson, <a href="/pa/29/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="29 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="982758" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0382-01">29 Pa. 382</a>. The injuries complained of do not seem to come within that technical meaning of waste, which courts of equity have jurisdiction to restrain the commission of. But it was well argued before the master, that, from the nature of oil and the character of oil lands, courts of equity are called upon to exercise their efficient powers to protect the owners of that kind of <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>property from injuries to their estate in the nature of waste. These considerations have moved the legislature to apply more effective remedies for this kind of property. Those remedies, however, do not affect our question of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court have said, when appealed to upon these considerar tions, “We can draw no distinction between a farm and an oil well.”.....“It may be that the peculiarity of the property in an oil well is such that an injunction to stay waste, or a writ of estrepement, will not be an adequate remedy for an owner out of possession. But that will not authorize a court of equity to assume jurisdiction to try the title upon what is merely an ejectment bill, and thus, in effect, deprive the parties of their constitutional right of trial by jury: ” Enterprise Transit Co.’s App., 9 W.

At the first blush, it appears to go the full length of sustaining all that the plaintiff asks for. Upon a closer examination, I think it is distinguishable from this case. In that case, the plaintiff had a lease for oil purposes of three acres and one hundred and twenty-three perches of land. The lease contained the following stipulation: “ And it is further agreed between said parties that there are ten rods of protection on the east side of said lease, also protection on the north side eight rods to orchard fence.” At the point at the comer of this lease where the lines of this protection met, a subsequent other lessee of this lessor bored an oil well. The bill filed was for an injunction restraining the further operation of this well and for an account of the oil produced, both of which were sustained by the Supreme Court. It is apparent that while Evans and Allison had a right to the “ protection ” provided by their lease along the sides of their leasehold, and that no other person should operate thereon for oil, they had no right to the possession of it. Without a right of possession they could not maintain ejectment, which is founded upon the right of possession. The “trespass” mentioned by Justice Williams, at page 227, would seem to be the tort arising from the violation of the terms of the lease by the lessor or parties under him. This being so, equity was the only adequate remedy for Evans and Allison. If I am correct in this analysis of that case, then Allison’s Appeal is not an authority to govern this case.</p>

    <p id="b632-9" data-blocks='[["BL_632.8",632,[246,805,1163,953]]]'>1. The real and only question raised upon this record is that of jurisdiction. The dismissal of the bill was recommended by the master, and ordered by the court, solely upon the ground that it was an ejectment bill. The plaintiff was then driven to an action of ejectment, which this court decided in Duffield v. Hue, <a href="/pa/129/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="129 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="568084" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0094-01">129 Pa. 94</a>, could not be maintained, intimating that the plaintiff had a remedy in another form. To obtain that remedy, this appeal is taken. The plaintiff’s lease, in plain terms, granted the exclusive right to the oil under the whole lot of which the Robert Thompson line was the southern boundary, although it gave no right to the possession of any of the surface, except the parts necessary for the drilling of the seven wells through which the oil was to be taken out. The fact that the defendants have adverse possession of the surface of the two acres, does not interfere with the jurisdiction of equity to restrain the drilling of wells thereon, which would create waste upon the plaintiff’s oil right, and produce damages to him incapable of measurement: Allison’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="77 Pa. 221" data-case-ids="436340" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0221-01">77 Pa. 221</a>; Westmoreland N.

There is an additional reason for invoking the aid of <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>equity. There is an express covenant in the lease held by the plaintiff, that any additional wells drilled upon the leased Dremises should be drilled by the lessees, and this covenant was clearly intended to protect their wells against the drilling of any wells by the lessors, or others claiming through them, upon the land of which the defendants are in possession. The covenant was binding upon Rosenzweig and the defendants, as well as upon the Browns; and equity has full jurisdiction to restrain the violation of such a restrictive covenant: Brightly’s Eq., §§ 294, 295; Stewart’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=56%20Pa.%20422" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="56 Pa. 422">56 Pa. 422</a>; Scott v.

The question of forfeiture does not properly arise on this record, but the ruling of the master upon it was clearly erroneous. He disregarded competent testimony which should have led him to a different conclusion, and he erred in treating the forfeiture clause in the lease as self-acting: Wills v. Gas Co., <a href="/pa/130/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="130 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="568992" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0222-01">130 Pa. 222</a>; Hoch v.

Moreover, even if the plaintiff’s right to drill the seventh well was forfeited, he was entitled by the terms of the lease to protection for the wells already drilled.</p>

But such is not the case. The defendants allege a failure of the plaintiff to comply with the strict terms of the lease, and set up a forfeiture resulting therefrom to themselves. Our offer to show waivers of strict compliance by Rosenzweig, and by the Browns when they were the owners of the property, was not in any sense adverse to Henry Brown’s interest, and in no way affected his estate or any one but the defendants. They were claiming that the ground in controversy was not included in the contract between Pratt and the Browns, and had no standing to object. Pratt was a competent witness under the act of April 15, 1869, P. L. 30: Warren v.

The plaintiff attempts to bring this case within the two last mentioned, by setting up some kind of easement in the two-acre lot, under the clause in the lease giving the lessee the privilege of drilling any additional wells which the lessors might determine upon.
