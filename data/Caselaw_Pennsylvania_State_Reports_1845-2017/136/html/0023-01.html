Frederick, 2 P. Wins. 357, though as the reporter says “ without much debate,” that if a mother, being a widow, advances a child, and dies intestate, leaving many children, the child advanced shall not bring what he has received from his mother into hotchpot; and on the strength of this case, the law is so stated in Williams on Executors, 1607. This, however, does not seem to have been the understanding in Pennsylvania: See Murphy v. Nathans, <a href="/pa/46/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="46 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="420681" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0508-01">46 Pa. 508</a>, though the auditing judge is not aware of any case in the state where the question has been directly raised. Our statute [act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 315], unlike the Custom of London referred to by Lord King, is general, and provides for the division and enjoyment of the “ real and personal estate of a decedent, whether male or female; ” and, though the sixteenth section relating to advancements uses the masculine pronoun, this is evidently in a generic sense; just as in the thirteenth section, which provides that “ descendants and relatives of an intestate begotten before <em>his </em>death and born thereafter shall in all cases inherit and take in like manner as if they had been born in the lifetime of such intestate; ” and § 2, clause III., where it is declared that “ if such intestate shall leave descendants in any other degree of consanguinity, however remote from <em>him </em>and all in the same degree of consanguinity to him, the estate shall descend to and be distributed among such descendants ; ” and clause IV.: “ If such intestate shall leave descendants in different degrees of consanguinity to him, the more remote of them being the issue of a deceased child, grandchild, or other descendant, the estate shall descend to and be distributed among them as follows,” etc. No one will contend that these sections do not relate to the descent of the estates of females as well as of males.</p>

In such cases, it is manifest that the <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>parent did not intend at the outset to deal with the child in any other relation than that of debtor and creditor; and the relation thus established cannot subsequently be changed without the consent of both parties .to the contract.

The contract having been void ab initio, there never was a debt at all, and the principle that what was once a debt cannot be treated as an advancement, has no application. It is a familiar doctrine that one who avoids a contract by setting up his or her inability to enter into it, must return the consideration: Badger v.

This was resisted, upon the ground that it was not an advancement, because a mother cannot make an advancement, and, also, because it was a debt; and it was not a debt, because the daughter was at the time a married woman, and, therefore, incapable of contracting any debt.

The fact that interest was to be paid does not necessarily show that it was intended as a loan : Wright’s App., <a href="/pa/89/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="89 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1063275" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0067-01">89 Pa. 67</a>. The coverture of Mrs. Starr, and the form of the receipt, lead to the conclusion that a loan, which could not be enforced, was not intended.</p>
    <p id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[265,866,1161,861]]]'>2. The readiness of the courts to presume an intention to make an advancement, in order to do equity, is shown by Dutch’s App., <a href="/pa/57/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="57 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1010452" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0461-01">57 Pa. 461</a>; Storey’s App., <a href="/pa/83/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="83 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1050805" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0089-01">83 Pa. 89</a>; Kirby’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="109 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="542326" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0041-01">109 Pa. 41</a>.

Moreover, the plea of coverture is a practical disaffirmance of the transaction as a loan. There being no assertion that it was a gift, the court took the only other alternative; namely, to treat it as a bailment. But even if the transaction was originally a loan, Mrs. Starr cannot now disaffirm it and yet keep the money: Fulton v.

The' Orphans’ Court is practically a court of equity; and, when it appeared that appellant, who was there claiming a full distributive share of her mother’s estate, had virtually in her possession money which should have formed a <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>part of the fmicl for distribution, the court might well act on the maxim of equity that what ought to have been done has been done, and proceed to distribute the fund accordingly.

Her protection is for the prevention of fraud. She should not thereby be enabled, with impunity, to defraud others.” The course of procedure adopted by the court below was well calculated to prevent any such result in this case, and we think it is sustainable on reason as well as authority.</p>

It has been so fully and ably discussed by the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court that, for reasons given in his opinion and the authorities cited in support of them, we are satisfied there is no error in the decree, or in the proceedings leading thereto.</p>
