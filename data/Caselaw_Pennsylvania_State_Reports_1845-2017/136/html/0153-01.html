It is conceded by appellant that the attaching creditor is entitled to one fourth of the income which accrued prior to the death of Joshua Comly, less the amount of the note, viz., $606.58, but they deny that she is entitled to any part of the income which accrued after his decease. As to that, their contention is that it belongs to them as beneficiaries of the trust, according to its terms.

It cannot be doubted that he created an active and valid continuing trust for the management of his residuary estate, the payment of the income thereof to the <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>four primary objects of his bounty during the terms of their respective lives, and the preservation of the corpus for distribution upon the death of the last survivor of them. It does not appear to have been his intention to give either of the four beneficiaries for life any interest in, or control over, either the corpus of the trust, or the income arising therefrom, except so much of the latter as accrues during his or her lifetime. The income is expressly limited to each of them, respectively, for life, and was doubtless intended as a purely personal benefit, terminating at his or her decease. Hence it was necessary to designate the person or persons to whom the trustees should pay the income accruing after the death of each of said beneficiaries, except the last survivor, and the testator undertook to do so by directing that it should be paid to the deceased beneficiary’s “ heirs, assigns, or legal representatives, as the case may be.” The phrase thus employed is evidently intended to designate, not by name, but by description, the person or persons to whom, in each contingency, the one fourth of the income should be thereafter paid, thus making a quasi substitutionary gift of the income to them. The leading word, expressive of the testator’s thought, is “ heirs; ” a technical word, not applicable to a gift of personalty, but popularly understood, when so applied, in the sense of the next of kin according to our statute of distributions; and that is the sense in which the phrase would be generally understood by laymen. While there is some room for difference of opinion on the subject, the weight of authority is that the word “ heirs,” when used in a limitation of personal property to the heirs of the first taker, either substitutionally or by way of succession, is understood as meaning those entitled under the statutes of distribution in case of intestacy: Eby’s App., <a href="/pa/84/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="84 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1053580" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0241-01">84 Pa. 241</a>; Morton v.

In con<a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>struing the will before us, the fact that the testator was not a lawyer must not be overlooked. It may be fairly assumed that in writing the will he employed popular, rather than technical language. Doubtless, the first reading of the will would convey to nearly every layman the impression that the testator not only intended his brother’s interest should terminate with his life, but also that, upon his death, his share of the income, and ultimately the corpus from which it accrued, should pass, immediately and by virtue of the will, to those whom the intestate law would desiginate as his brother’s distributees. Such an idea as the continuance of his brother’s interest, after death, until the termination of the trust, would never occur to his mind, because it is essentially technical. The death of his brother and the use of the word “ heirs ” simply marked the time of change in the beneficial ownership. The testator’s intention, we think, was to give his brother a purely personal benefit. The gift is expressly for his life, and the language following imports an absolute gift to his “heirs,” as such. There is nothing on the face of the will to indicate any intended benefit to his creditors. On the contrary, the fact of the creation of the trust, and the use of the word “ heirs,” in the sense in which it must have been employed, show rather an exclusion of them. After his brother’s death, his “ heirs,” used in the sense of next of kin under the intestate law, and not his brother’s “ assigns or legal representatives,” appear to have been testator’s first thought. The transmission of beneficial ownership, upon his brother’s death, was immediate and direct to the “heirs ” or next of kin of the latter, their “assigns or legal representatives, as the case may be.”</p>
