They also put in evidence the record of a proceeding by the plaintiff for a divorce from her husband, Theodore Reibenstein, for the purpose of proving that at the time when .Clemons made the expenditures mentioned, the plaintiff was not under any disability by reason of coverture; the record showing that on October 8, 1881, she filed her libel in divorce, charging that by cruel and barbarous treatment her said husband had rendered her condition intolerable, etc., and compelled her to leave his home in Octo<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>ber, 1879, and that since that time he had entirely neglected to provide for her support and maintenance; and that upon this libel a decree of divorce was pronounced in her favor on July 31, 1882.

In her petition for a divorce, she states under oath, that her husband, by cruel and barbarous treatment, had rendered her condition intolerable and life burdensome, so that she was compelled to leave the home and habitation of respondent since October, 1879. If the facts so stated in her petition were true, then the plaintiff was no longer under disability, and her acts and conduct between the date of October, 1879, and her marriage to John Logan, on the 28th of November, 1882, are the acts and conduct of an unmarried person.....</p>

It appears that Mr. Kirberger became the assignee of a part of his interest in the lease. That soon after obtaining the lease, operations were commenced and money expended to the amount of from $3,000 to $3,500; that a building was erected for the occupancy of some person in the <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>employ of the lessee, in the spring of 1881; he states that there were no improvements when he went into possession, but' that the premises had been in pasture.

If the deed had been produced, it would have been necessary to show that it contained all the requisites for the conveyance of plaintiff’s title; and a party claiming under a lost deed must be held to proof of the same requisites: Krise v. <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>Neason, <a href="/pa/66/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="66 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="432422" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0253-01">66 Pa. 253</a>.

But, when it is said in that case, that she could not ratify a deed after coming of age, except by a re-acknowledgment in the mode prescribed by the statute, this must be understood as limited to ratification during coverture.

In the present case, the plaintiff, in 1879, being then of full age, left her husband on account of his treatment, for which she subsequently obtained a divorce. The judge charged the jury, and we must assume rightly, upon the evidence, as that point is not now before us, that from 1879 to 1882 plaintiff was under no legal disability, and her acts and conduct, with regard to their effect upon her title, were those of an unmarried person, and of course of a person of full age. But, in answering the defendant’s points, the jury were told that, before they could find an estoppel, they must be satisfied that the plaintiff, with knowledge of her rights, and of the improvements and expenditures being made on the premises, acquiesced in and <em>encouraged </em>such improvements. This presents the only substantial question in the case.</p>

The cases are very numerous, but it is not necessary to refer to more than a few of them. In Woods v.

These decisions rest on the ground that the circumstances were such as to raise a duty to speak, and that failure to do so is either a fraud, or would work such an injury as would be equivalent to a fraud, if the party should not be es-topped. On the other hand, it was held as early as Buchanan v. Moore, 13 S. &amp; R. 304, and Robinson v.

The distinction, therefore, between the cases where acts or declarations of encouragement are necessary to create an estoppel, and those where mere silence or acquiescence will be sufficient, is one of principle, and each case as it arises must be assigned to one or the other class, according to its circumstances, the chief of which is knowledge or ignorance of the party’s own rights and the other’s action. Encouragement is necessary where the party is ignorant; but knowledge creates the duty to speak, and, where that exists, silence is enough to estop.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[183,1068,1165,961]]]'>The present case belongs in the class of Woods v. Wilson, where silence, with knowledge of expenditures being made by the part3r in-possession, may be sufficient to create an estoppel. The learned judge put it into the other class, by charging the jury that there would be no estoppel unless the plaintiff encouraged the improvements. Into this he was no doubt led by plaintiff’s sixth point, that a married woman cannot be estopped by improvements made by the vendee, even with her knowledge and encouragement. This was properly affirmed as to knowledge and encouragement during coverture; but the same phrase, thus unfortunately suggested, was no doubt inadvertently carried into the answers to points relating to estoppel by conduct after the disabilities of coverture had ceased. This tended to mislead the jury into supposing that something more than mere silence, something active or positive on the part of plaintiff, was necessary to estop her, and, in so doing, it put a heavier requirement on defendants than the case justified. For this slip, in an otherwise clear and accurate charge, we are obliged to reverse the judgment.</p>
