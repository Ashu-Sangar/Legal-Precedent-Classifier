The trust is not alone for the sole and separate use, but is also expressly to continue during all the term of the natural life of the daughter, with remainder to those who would he entitled to take if she survived her mother and husband, and died intestate, seised and possessed of the said premises. This presents the question, who would take the estate if the daughter died seised thereof and intestate, having survived her mother and husband? If she leaves issue, they will take; and if she leaves no issue, then her surviving brothers and sisters, and the issue of any deceased will be entitled to take.</p>

If the remainder had been to those who would take had she died intestate, then it would be to her heirs generally, and by operation of the Rule in Shelley’s Case, she would have taken an estate in fee. Such, however, is not the language in this will, and if either her mother or husband had survived her, they, upon her death, would have taken as her heirs under the intestate law; but as she survived them, a different class of persons will be entitled to the estate at her death. And they will take as purchasers under the will of the donor or testator, not derivatively from the cestui que trust under the intestate law.

The trust is active during the continuance of the life-estate, and therefore that estate is an equitable one, incapable of coalescing with the legal estate in remainder.

But this case is distinguished from Ogden’s Appeal by two circumstances: (a) The express direction to invest and to perform active duties in the selection of securities for investment, in which respect the case resembles Lightner’s App., 11 W. N. <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>181; and (5) the fact that the limitation to the first taker is expressly for life only: see opinion of Mr. Justiee Agnew in Ogden’s Appeal.</p>
    <p id="b169-5" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[207,529,1168,1164]]]'>2. The limitation over does not bring the gift within the Rule in Shelley’s Case, even if the particular estate be considered a legal estate. The limitation is not to executors and administrators, which, so far as personalty is concerned, is the equivalent of the word heirs, in connection with realty: Anderson v. Dawson, 15 Ves. 537; Ralston v. Wain, <a href="/pa/44/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="44 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="484222" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0279-01">44 Pa. 279</a>; nor is it even to those who would take under the intestate laws. It is to some of these only. Plainly, therefore, the rule of succession is changed. It is no answer to say that the husband and mother, who are excluded, are now dead. Suppose Mrs. ■Kuntzleman marries again. Whether any future husband would be entitled to take would depend upon whether the provisions of the will are carried out. But to look at the condition of things now, is to take too narrow a view. The death of the husband and mother in Mrs. Kuntzleman’s lifetime is a mere accident which cannot alter the interpretation to be given to the will. Whether the limitation over is to take effect by way of purchase or not, is to be determined by the words used in the will and the circumstances as they existed at the death of the testator. This is the answer to Yarnall’s App., <a href="/pa/70/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="70 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1028227" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0335-01">70 Pa. 335</a>, in which there was no exclusion of the mother.

    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[239,1148,1166,800]]]'>The appellant’s contention is, that the whole purpose of the trust, created by this clause of the will, was a trust for coverture, or for the separate use of the testator’s daughter, which fell for lack of a marriage, or a contemplated marriage, to support it; that as her mother and her husband are both dead, the parties to take, at the daughter’s death, are her right heirs, and that by the Pule in Shelley’s Case she has an absolute estate in the fund for distribution. The appellees, on the other hand, contend, first, that the trust is active during the continuance of the life-estate of Mrs. Kuntzleman; that her estate therefore is an equitable estate, whilst the estate to the heirs in remainder is legal, and that for that reason the former cannot coalesce with the latter; and, second, that, even if the particular estate be held to be a legal estate, the estate in remainder is limited in language which does not bring the gift within the rule.</p>

McCall, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20Pa.%20208" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="64 Pa. 208">64 Pa. 208</a>; Ogden’s App., <a href="/pa/70/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="70 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1028239" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0501-01">70 Pa. 501</a>. Nor, apart from the purpose of the testator with respect to the remainder, can we discover any other object to be attained by the trust, than a separate use for his daughter. In the case of each of his sons, the income was to be “ free from their debts,” etc.; and, although the use of these words, per<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>haps, was not essential to create a spendthrift trust, their omission in the clause quoted is significant in the ascertainment of his purpose with respect to his daughter. There is nothing in this will to indicate the testator’s intention to create a spendthrift trust; on the contrary, it is plain that his purpose was to create a trust for coverture.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[215,665,1166,558]]]'>Where an active trust is created to give effect to a well defined, lawful purpose of a testator, in relation to his family, the trust will be sustained, whether the cestui que trust be sui juris or not. This was established in Barnett’s App., <a href="/pa/46/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="46 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="420627" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0392-01">46 Pa. 392</a>, overruling, in terms, Kuhn v.

In these cases, however, the bequests and devises of income were to children for life, irrespective of coverture, and a clear purpose appeared to protect the corpus of the estate for the ultimate devisees.</p>
    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[216,1231,1167,750]]]'>But the cases cited, and many more in the same line and to the same effect, are clearly distinguishable from those in which the purpose of the testator is to create a trust for coverture. A trust for coverture is one of the well-settled instances, in the doctrine of special trusts, where the trust falls if there is no marriage, in fact or in contemplation, to support it, or where upon the husband’s death coverture ceases. And it is immaterial that the trust imposes active duties upon the trustee. These duties are only subsidiary to the main purpose: they are mere incidents or adjuncts to the trust; and, if the trust itself falls, these active duties are dispensed with; they will not uphold the trust, they fall with it: Megargee v.

The bequest of the interest and income is expressly for life and not during coverture, and is of the income only, not of the corpus of the estate. Those entitled in remainder are “ such person or persons as would be entitled to the same by the laws of the com<a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>monwealth of Pennsylvania,” if the daughter “had survived her mother and husband,” and died intestate. The expression “ such person or persons as would be entitled to the same by the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” may perhaps be taken to signify “ heirs ”: Dodson v. Ball, <a href="/pa/60/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="60 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1014505" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0492-01">60 Pa. 492</a>; Williams’s App., <a href="/pa/83/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="83 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1050837" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0377-01">83 Pa. 377</a>; and it may be assumed that the persons entitled under the words of the entire clause are such persons as, at the daughter’s death, are her heirs-at-law, exclusive of her mother and her husband.</p>
    <p id="b172-6" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[259,822,1167,709]]]'>But, to bring the devise within the Rule in Shelley’s Case, the limitation in remainder must be to the heirs in fee, or in tail, as a nomen collectivum for the whole line of inheritable blood. When the testator annexes words of explanation to heirs, or heirs of the body, as to heirs now living, etc., using the terms as mere descriptio personarum, or for the specific designation of individuals, a new inheritance is thereby grafted upon the heirs to whom the estate is given: 4 Kent Com., 221; and they will be assumed to take as purchasers. The Rule in Shelley’s Case, when applied to real property, enlarges the life-estate into an inheritance. The heirs, in such case, therefore, take qua heirs, and it is not in the power of the testator to prescribe a different qualification to heirs, from what the law prescribes when they take in the character of heirs.</p>
    <p id="b172-7" data-blocks='[["BL_172.6",172,[258,1539,1166,656]]]'>For these reasons, we are of opinion that the limitation over, in this case, does not bring the gift within the rule, even if the particular estate should be considered legal. The limitation is to some only of those who would take under the intestate law. The husband and the mother are expressly excluded. It is true they are both now deceased, but that circumstance can have no effect: the testator’s intent must be ascertained from and his will construed according to the words of the will; and these are to be read in the light of the circumstances under which the will was written. The merely accidental fact that the husband and mother are both now dead, does not bear upon the testator’s intent at the execution of the will, or determine its meaning when it took effect.</p>

But, clearly, this does not change the intent of the testatrix in this will, for it must be remembered that there were no husbands in existence, and that this so-called exclusion is an expression corresponding with the intent of the testatrix, which was to give the daughters separate estates, the effect of which would be to exclude the husbands.” Whilst this reasoning is not entirely clear, it is plain that it does not extend to the exclusion of the mother.</p>
