    <p class="summary" id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[198,1224,1166,1208]]]'>The company issued two kinds of assessment policies, known respectively as “ regular assessment ” and as “ interest ” policies. In the case of the former, premium notes were taken usually for a sum equal to the whole amount of the insurance. In the case of the latter, the principal of the premium notes was fixed at eleven times the “premium note,” which varieel with the character of the risk, and such note would bear interest, payable annually. In order to make an equitable apportionment of the assessments between the different kinds of policies, the amount of the assessment levied on each particular policy was fixed, not by a percentage of the face of the premium note, but upon the basis of the premium rate for the risk. What was known as the “ assessment basis ” was calculated for each policy by multiplying the premium rate by twenty, and the assessments were then made by percentages of the assessment basis, so ascertained. Thus, the premium rate upon the defendant’s policy was 3 per cent, and the amount of his insurance was $2,500 ; 3 per cent of $2,500 is $75, and that .sum, multiplied by twenty, gives, as the assessment basis for that policy, $1,500. Assessment No. 4, above mentioned, was laid at the rate of 6-^ per cent. The defendant’s proportion of it was therefore 6¿ per cent of $1,500, making the amount payable by him $97.50.

In any case where the interest was paid up, it would be a credit on the assessment in favor of the policy holder.

Under such circumstances, the remedies existing at the time of the contract, or such as the law may provide for enforcing the payment, are all that can be resorted to.” It was no more difficult for the company to levy the assessment in the method pointed out by the third clause of by-law, 1876, § 30, and sue the assured, than it was to levy the assessment in the manner admitted by the testimony of Mr. Huntzinger. Their attempt <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>to change the mode would in effect change the entire form of contract, and cannot be permitted.</p>

The policy provides: “ And it is moreover agreed and declared, That this policy is made and accepted in reference to the by-laws of this company; also the application and the conditions hereto annexed, which are made a part of this policy,” etc. On the back of the policy are found indorsed these words: “ Conditions of insurance,” and under the fifth paragraph or clause are found these words: “ No insurance shall be considered as binding until the actual cash payment of the premium; and should the annual interest, or any assessment that may be levied on the premium note given for this insurance, be in arrears and unpaid for the space of thirty days after notice and demand, then, and in every such case, this policy shall cease.” The interest on the premium note is made payable annually. It does not say in advance, and therefore we infer the first annual interest fell due on September 21,1877; and if the company made demand then, it <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>became due under this condition on November 21, 1877, and nothing being paid under this condition of the contract, which the assured had before him, and the only one he had, the policy ceased.</p>

He knew, therefore, that if be did not pay his interest or assessments, be forfeited his policy and the contract ceased. The company was absolved from all liability and he lost his advance premium. But we are met with the contention that the by-law must also be taken into consideration. This cannot and ought not to be so held. The company puts one condition before the assured, and says to him: “ This is our contract; if you do not pay, the policy ceases,” and withholds from him the other. Good faith, good morals, and good law, all require that the whole of the by-law should be put into the conditions on the policy and not a part only.</p>

That clause excepts such notes only to the extent of “ the interest paid and to be paid within six months,” and as no interest was ever paid by the defendant, and the first assessment here claimed was laid two years after the date of the policy, the company was justified in treating this as if it were an ordinary assessment policy. This is no longer an open question. It was expressly decided in Crawford v. Insurance Co., 11 Cent. R. 653 (3 Pa. S. C.

The assessments are void because they are not based upon the amount of the defendant’s premium note, but upon a new basis of almost double that amount, fixed by a by-law which was adopted after the date of his contract and without his knowledge or consent; and they are largely in excess of the extent of his liability under the contract. The language of the by-laws of 1876 is plain, and admits of but one meaning on this point. Under them, the premium notes are to be the basis of assessment, and the defendant’s liability would be measured by the proportion Avhich the amount of his note bore to the aggregate of the notes held by the company. If there were any doubt as to this, the language of the amendment of 1877 clearly indicates that such had been the rule. That amendment and the by-laws of 1879 could not, without the defendant’s consent, alter his rights as a party insured: Insurance Co. v.

The assessments are void because all the premium notes in force at the time the assessments were laid, were not included therein, some of them being intentionally omitted. The by-laws exempt no class of notes, but require that all shall be assessed. The intentional omission of any will invalidate an assessment: Marblehead Ins. Co. v.

But § 30 of the bylaws of 1876 changes this rule, and, whilst it imposes on the assured the burden of contributing to liabilities previously incurred, it benefits him by requiring all who become insured after him to contribute proportionately with him to the losses occurring during the term of his insurance. It is competent for the parties to make such a contract, and the directors have no right to make assessments on another basis: Susquehanna Ins. Co. v.

The construction of these by-laws which the defendant contends for, is a most favorable one for him, it is true; but they were made by the company for its own benefit, and if the meaning is doubtful, this is the company’s fault.

The reason given for assessing the defendant’s interest policy and omitting other interest policies, was that he had never paid any interest. His note does not contain one word about interest, but the $49.50 paid at the time of the application was exactly one year’s interest on the amount of the note, and if this was not paid for the first year’s interest, what was it paid for? By reason of that payment no interest would be due until September 21, 1878. Two assessments were made before that, and if this interest policy was properly assessable, all other like policies should have been assessed also. No authority has been shown for the omission from the assessments of notes o'f members supposed to be insolvent.</p>

Moreover, the express provision of the twenty-fifth by-law of the company is that, notwithstanding the failure of the insured to pay the interest and assessments, “ the directors shall retain such premium note or notes and collect thereon all such sums as may be due or become due thereon, during the term for which it has originally been given.” It is of no consequence that this by-law of the company was not indorsed upon the policy. The policy was made .and accepted, “ with reference to the by-laws of this company; and also the appli<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>cation and conditions annexed, which are made part of the policy;” and these are “to be used and resorted to, in order to explain the rights and obligations of the parties.” The company was a mutual company, and the defendant was a member of it. He is therefore presumed to have known of the existence of this by-law from the date of his membership: Susquehanna Ins. Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="105 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="454306" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0615-01">105 Pa. 615</a>; Susquehanna Ins. Co. v. Toy Co., <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%20431" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="97 Pa. 431">97 Pa. 431</a>. The company had a right, therefore, to retain this note, and “ to collect thereon all such sum or sums as may be due or become due thereon, during the time for which it had originally been given;” and this clearly includes the annual interest which might accrue and the assessments made upon it. We are of opinion, therefore, in view of the evidence, that the court was wrong in declaring the policy to be void fo; non-payment of interests and assessments.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[168,1126,1168,249]]]'>But it is contended that even if the policy and note were not void from forfeiture, the mode of assessment adopted by the company was not in conformity with the contract. The bylaws of June 6, 1876, in the first and second clauses of § 30, provide:</p>
    <p id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[168,1383,1166,149]]]'>“ Sec. 30. If at any time hereafter an assessment shall be made, the amount to be levied on premium notes shall be rated according to the following classification, to wit:</p>

The same method of assessment, with but little modification, is provided for; both series of by-laws are susceptible of tbe same general construction in this respect. These by-laws of 1379 came before this court for construction in Susquehanna Ins. Co. v. Gackenbach, <a href="/pa/115/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="115 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="551802" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0492-01">115 Pa. 492</a>; but in that case the record was inaccurate, some words of the by-lawhavingbeen omitted, and other words inserted, which wholly changed its meaning. Whilst the decision in that case was right, according to the record, it has no application here, for the by-law, as it appears in this record, is different, and calls for an entirely different construction. The proper construction was afterwards given in Susquehanna Ins. Co. v. Stauffer, <a href="/pa/125/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="125 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="563985" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0416-01">125 Pa. 416</a>. “ The wording of this bylaw,” said Mr. Justice Mitchell, who delivered the opinion of the court, “is confused and obscure, but the general scheme intended is reasonably clear. It is, that all policies which were in force at the time of the assessment, or at the time of the loss, both or either, (as the ease may be,) shall be liable for the loss, but the assessment shall be laid, in the first instance, upon the policies in force at the time of the loss, whether since expired or not; and the policies, issued subsequent to tbe loss and remaining in force at the time of the assessment, are to be assessed only for the balance if the first branch of the assessment should be insufficient. In pursuance of this general intent, the first clause directs, not that all members whose policies are in force at the time the assessment is declared shall be assessed, but that they shall be liable to assessment, and qualifies this liability by making it subject to a specified abatement. The second clause then proceeds to define the abatement, which is that policies now expired, but which were in force when the liability accrued, shall be assessed pro rata with all the policies then in force, i. e., at the time of the loss or liability incurred, and this first branch of the assessment shall be deducted from the total of liabilities, and the balance only be then assessed upon the other policies ‘then in force,’ i. e., those which were in force at the time of the loss, and which have not yet expired.” To the same effect, also, is Thropp v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/125/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="125 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="563995" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0427-01">125 Pa. 427</a>, where the same construction given to the by-laws of 1879 was given to the by-laws of 1876. We understand, from what the witness Huntzinger testifies, that the assessments were made upon the premium <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>notes in conformity with this construction of the by-laws, and according to the classification therein recognized.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[155,460,1164,184]]]'>But the note in suit, as we have said, was an annual-interest note; and, in reference to such notes, it is, in the third clause of the thirtieth section of the by-laws of 1876, provided as follows :</p>
    <p id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[152,663,1165,401]]]'>“Third. Notes subject to the payment of annual interest, and deposit notes upon which the interests have been paid in advance, shall not be assessed until all other notes held by the company, liable to assessment, shall have first paid in assessments an amount equal to the interest paid and to be paid within six months next succeeding the date of such assessment; any deficiency then existing may be equitably assessed on all the notes held by the company.”</p>
    <p id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.7",537,[149,1071,1166,860]]]'>No interest had been paid on this premium note: all that had- been paid was the cash premium; and, although in this particular instance, that was just 6 per cent upon the premium note, it was not paid as interest, nor was it so regarded. The interest upon the note was wholly unpaid; and, as the note by its terms was liable to assessment for losses, and was not embraced in the excepted class defined in this third clause, we can see no reason why it should have been omitted in the assessment. “Annual interest and deposit notes, upon which the interests ” had been paid, were not liable to assessments “ until the other notes had paid in on assessments an amount equal to the interest thus paid and to be paid within six months,” etc.; but Leavy had paid no interest, and his liability was not affected. Those only who had paid the annual interest were entitled to abatement; any deficiency then existing to be equitably assessed on all the notes held by the company, according to the classification already referred to.</p>
    <p id="b537-7" data-blocks='[["BL_537.8",537,[146,1939,1166,447]],["BL_538.1",538,[276,366,1167,604]]]'>In whatever form the policy is issued, however, it appears that what is termed the “ schedule premium ” forms the uniform basis of assessment. The schedule premium is the result of the rate applied to the amount of the insurance. Property is rated for insurance according to the supposed risk; it may be rated at 1, 2, 3, or more per cent upon the amount, according to the risk. Thus, in the case in hand, the property was rated at 3 per cent, which rate applied to the #2,500, the amount of insurance, gives the schedule premium, #75. The schedule <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>premium multiplied by 11 determines the amount of the premium note, which is the basis upon which the annual interest is to be paid; and multiplied by 20, determines the practical basis of the assessment. This basis of assessment is uniform, and applies to all premium notes, whether taken upon the annual interest or general assessment plan; for it would seem that all premium notes subject to the provision of § 30 of the by-laws are liable to assessment. As to the liability to assessment of persons insured under the deposit note plau, the testimony is not very clear. According to that portion of § 30, quoted above, it might appear that they are, in a certain contingency.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[280,978,1173,1414]],["BL_539.1",539,[181,361,1159,97]]]'>Under the general assessment plan, the premium notes were taken in a sum much larger than under the annual interest plan, in which latter case the amount was fixed with reference to the annual interest payment. It would therefore be grossly inequitable and unjust to assess these different classes of notes according to the same rate. The by-law provides that in a certain contingency “ all the notes held by the company shall be equitably assessed ” to make up the deficiency. As the different classes of notes were drawn in sums entirely disproportionate to the risks incurred, it was but equitable and just that some scheme should be adopted to establish a uniform and just basis of assessment. To accomplish this purpose, assessments were in all cases made upon the true and proper basis of the rate of the risk, applied to the amount insured. This gives, in each case, the schedule premium, which is, in fact, the true basis of the assessment; the multiplication of this by 20 'was simply for convenience, and, as this was done in all cases, the results were uniform. The assessments were upon the note, but they were for a sum, or according to a uniform rate, ascertained in the manner specified. This method was just and equitable, we think, and did not need the amendment of 1877,. or the by-laws of January 21, 1879, to sustain it. It is difficult to see how all the notes held by the company could have been equitably assessed in any other way. It may be conceded that the defendant was not liable for assessments beyond the amount of the note, but, as the note carried interest from its date, that limit was not reached. This particular form and method of assessment was approved in Crawford v. Insurance Co., reported <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>in 11 Cent. R. 653, and we can see no reason why we should not adhere to the rulings in that case.</p>
