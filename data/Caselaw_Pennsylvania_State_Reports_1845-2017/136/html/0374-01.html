Did the gift include the income which accrued during the year commencing at the death of the testatrix ? We think that it did, for the reason that it was a distinct gift of a yearly sum to the legatee, which is the definition of an annuity; and annuities, where the testator has not declared to the contrary, have always been exempted from the rule which postpones interest upon legacies until the end of a year from the death. The donee of a sum in gross receives all that the donor intended, when he is paid that sum at a time fixed for distribution; the donee of a yearly sum for life or a less term receives less, if one year is cut out from that period. In the one case, interest is a mere adjunct to the legacy, and may be withheld without impairing the substance of the gift; in the other, interest is 'itself the legacy, and must be paid in full, or the legacy will be diminished. Another point of difference is, that, as a rule, arrears of annuity will not carry interest. See cases in Theobald, 57.</p>

The distinction is so far from being subtle, that it is entirely reasonable, and it has the additional merit of being easily applied. It relieves also against <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>the search for an obscure intention on the part of a testator. The Supreme Court has recognized it in cases where an objection was present which does not appear in this instance. In Penna.

    <p id="b397-9" data-blocks='[["BL_397.8",397,[176,1597,1161,860]]]'>1. The court was in error in supposing that income was received by the executors upon the amount of the trust legacies during the year following Mrs. Flickwir’s death. This was not claimed at the audit, and is not true in point of fact. The account shows that within four months after her death the executors commenced to dispose of securities and convert the entire estate into cash. Undoubtedly something was realized by way of income during the year, but no income accrued on these trust legacies specifically. This is a material point, as in Townsend’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="106 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="455740" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0268-01">106 Pa. 268</a>, the fact that the specific securities appropriated to the trusts had borne interest during the year, was given considerable weight.

There is a difference between a bequest of money for the life of the legatee, and a bequest of a sum to be paid annually for life: Eyre v. Golding, <a href="/binn/5/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Binn. 472" data-case-ids="1793619" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0472-01">5 Binn. 472</a>. The real question in the case is, whether, in the absence of a parental or quasi parental relationship between the testator and the beneficiary, and in the presence of a sufficient reason for creating a trust, entirely distinct from any purpose to secure to the beneficiary interest from the testator’s death, appearing upon the face of the will, a legacy such as those involved in the present case, will be treated as an annuity during the year intervening between the death of the testator and the payment of the principal to the trustees, without the expression or implication of such an intention on the part of the testator.</p>
    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[273,1133,1160,907]]]'>8. Legacies are payable at the expiration of one year: § 51, act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 83; Woerner on Administration, § 454; and interest upon them is payable from that time, unless a different time is fixed by the will: Woerner on Administration, § 458. The exceptions to this general rule are: specific legacies; annuities; legacies of income of residuary estate for life; legacies to one toward whom the testator stood in loco parentis; legacies in lieu of dower; cases in which a different intention is expressed by the testator; and legacies for maintenance. Obviously the two last heads are the only ones with which we are concerned in this case. There could be no question that the law is as stated by Mr. Chief Justice Tilghman in Eyre v. Golding, <a href="/binn/5/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Binn. 472" data-case-ids="1793619" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0472-01">supra,</a> were it not for the later cases of Hilyard’s Est., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 30" data-case-ids="478866" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0030-01">5 W. &amp; S. 30</a>, and Penna.

The old rule, under which the testator’s intention is of controlling effect, does not seem to have been weakened by Hilyard’s Estate and Penna.

N. 104. It is the omission of that word here, and of any indication of an intention to employ it, that we rest upon. The courts will not treat a legacy as an annuity unless an intention express or implied, specially to favor the legatee, is present. The court below expressly conceded, as a fact in this case, that there were no indications warranting the inference of such an intention on the part of the testatrix. Sufficient reasons for the creation of the trusts appear, part of them being separate use trusts, and the others being necessary to preserve remainders.</p>

It is therefore conceded that interest was earned, or should have been, and the question of the production of income does not arise in the case.

L. 83, provides, that “ legacies, if no time be limited for the payment thereof, shall in all eases be deemed to be due and payable at the expiration of one year from the death of the testator.” As interest only <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>accrues by contract, or as damages for default of payment of money which is due, it followed that the deferring of the period of payment, also postponed the accrual of interest until a year from testator’s death. This is therefore the general rule, and it was the well-settled rule of the common law, long prior to the date of the statute. It is, however, purely a rule of administrative convenience. It has no other merit. Certainly, to take an example from the case in hand, there is no inherent equity in mulcting the primary legatees of a solvent estate in a year’s income, for the benefit of the residuaries, presumably the lowest in the scale of the testator’s intended bounty. Being a rule of convenience only, it gives way at all times to the intent of the testator, whether express, as provided for in the statute itself, or implied from the general scheme of the will, or from particular expressions, or from the situation of the legatee, especially with reference to the testator. Certain exceptions, therefore, arising primarily from the testator’s intent, have become as firmly established as the rule itself. The one with which we are specially concerned is the ease of an annuity, or its practical equivalent, the interest of a sum of money. It is settled that an annuity, given as such, commences from the testator’s death: Roper on Legacies, *877. In Gibson v. Bott, 7 Ves. Jr. 96, Lord Eldon said that that was certainly the rule, but he remembered when it was not clear. In the same case, he states that if a legacy is given for life, with remainder over, no interest is payable until the second year, and intimates that that is also the rule where a sum is given to be placed out to produce an annuity. On this authority, Roper lays down the rule that interest on a gross sum, given as an annuity, does not commence till a year after death. Roper, however, says there is no express decision to this effect, and Toller says the point is doubtful: Toller on Executors, 324.</p>

In Eyre v. Golding, <a href="/binn/5/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="5 Binn. 472" data-case-ids="1793619" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0472-01">5 Binn. 472</a>, the gift was to R. of “ the interest of ¿6400, to be paid her annually during her natural life.” Chief Justice Tilghman held that interest ivas payable from the date of testator’s death, saying : “ The devise is not of a gross sum, but in the nature of an annuity.....The first payment of the annuity must be made <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>at the end of the first year, or the intention of the testator is not complied with. You must count the time immediately from his death, or the legatee will not receive the annuity <em>annually </em>during her life.” Tilghman laid much stress on the word “ annually.” But in Hilyard’s Est., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 30" data-case-ids="478866" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0030-01">5 W. &amp; S. 30</a>, the bequest was “ in trust to place the same out at interest and pay the interest and income thereof, when and as the same shall be got in and received, unto my sister K., for and during all the term of her natural life.” The word annually did not occur at all, and yet Sergeant, J., says: “Between Eyre v. Golding and the case before us I perceive no difference. Interest is in its nature an annual profit; and a direction to pay interest makes it payable annually without anything further.” After stating the general rule, he proceeds: “ Where, however, it was not a bequest of the corpus, but of an income or annuity, there a contrary rule prevails, and the legatee of interest for life has been allowed it from the death of the testator.” It will be observed that in this connection income and annuity are treated as synonymous by Justice Sergeant, and by his reporters in their syllabus, just as interest payable annually, and annuity, had been treated by Chief Justice Tilghman and by Mr. Binney, in reporting Eyre v.

It was followed in Spangler’s Est., <a href="/watts-serg/9/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 135" data-case-ids="12169163" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0135-01">9 W. &amp; S. 135</a>, where Gibson, C. J., says: “ Where the corpus of the legacy is interest accruing on a residue after payment of debts, and not the residue itself, it is well settled that unless a contrary intent is collectible from the tenor of the will, the legatee is entitled to all that is made from the death of the testator.” And in Pennsylvania Co.’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=41%20Leg.%20Int.%2026" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="41 Leg. Int. 26">41 Leg. Int. 26</a>, the auditor held that there was no difference between income and annuity, and this court affirmed the decision in a per curiam opinion, although in this case, as in Hilyard’s Estate, there were expressions in the will which might afford ground for argument that the testator’s actual intent was to postpone the commencement of the interést for a period after his death.</p>

But even if they were less so, they should be followed as consonant to sound reason. There is no substantial difference in <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>legal aspect between tbe gift of an annuity for life, and of tbe interest or income of a fund for life; nor between tbe gift simply of interest, and of interest payable annually. Interest accrues de die in diem, but it is calculated at a rate per annum. In tbe popular understanding, it is chargeable annually and payable tbe same way, unless custom, or contract, or specific direction makes it payable at shorter intervals. Tbe idea is so clearly implied, that tbe actual use or omission of the word annual in the will does not seriously affect tbe intent and purpose of the testator. To make distinctions, which depend, not on his intention, but on the skill of his draughtsman, is contrary to reason and sound law, and is not to be encouraged.</p>
