They paid their fares to the driver of this car, there being no conductor, and rode with him to the defendant’s station at Forty-third street, where they were told to get upon the two-horse car of the same company, to continue towards their homes at Thirty-seventh and Wallace streets. The driver of the one-horse car was asked for transfers, but did not give them. They boarded the defendant’s two-horse ear, but whether they got upon it at the rear platform or at the front platform, the testimony, at least as to young Sand-ford, was conflicting. There was testimony upon the part of the defendant that the plaintiff got upon the rear platform and went inside the car. Witnesses called on the part of the plaintiff testified that the boys got on at the front platform. The plaintiff himself, however, testified that he entered by way of the rear platform, and was ordered by the conductor to go up front; that the car was crowded and, going to the front, he went out upon the front platform. After the ear had started from the station, the conductor went through the ear collecting fares and found the plaintiff and McCoy on the front platform. In the presence and hearing of the plaintiff the conductor asked a fare from McCoy, who said they had paid their fares on the other car. The conductor said that that was an “ old guy; he was trying to steal a ride,” and must pay or get off. The plaintiff, as was claimed, was frightened, and passed upon the steps of the platform, as though to get off backward, holding by the railing. The driver pulled or pushed him back upon the platform. The plaintiff a second time attempted to get off when he either fell off or jumped, and was thrown under the car and injured.</p>

It has been held that, in such cases, in some instances of extreme youth, the conductor or person in charge of the car, in order to absolve himself or to acquit the company which he represents of negligence, is bound to use proper force, if necessarjq to put the child inside the car, or else to stop the car and put the child off.] 8 It is for you to say, that is one of the questions you must consider here, whether or not this boy, at the time of the accident, was so young, so inexperienced and so incapable of taking care of himself, that it was obviously the duty of the conductor or the driver, but primarily of the conductor of the car upon which the boy was riding after having paid his fare, or to a certain extent by permission, either to put the boy inside the car by the exercise of proper force or authority, or, if he would not obey, to stop the car and put the boy off, for his own protection.</p>

It is for you to say whether his duty was discharged after that, in case, I say, you should be of the opinion that the boys were at first placed inside. Of course, it was not the duty of the conductor, where he had done what the conductor has said he did, viz., put the boys ^inside the car, to then stand by and watch them. That was not his duty; and, if the case here is one in which a boy who, after having been properly put by a conductor within the car, of his own motion went out on the front platform and jumped off or fell off, there could be in that case no propriety in holding the railroad company responsible for the result of his injury. That would be one of those heedless, reckless things for which the boy would have to answer himself, and for which nobody could be held responsible.</p>

This would be equally true as to this boy, if he was of an age beyond the infantile period of which I have spoken, able to take care of himself and possessed of ordinary discretion. [If what was said by the conductor, in its language, character and effect, was such as indicated to that boy, young as he was, that he was to get off; and if, under an impulse such as was natural for a boy of his age, he stepped off or got off the car, in obedience to the direction thus given him, no opportunity being afforded him by the stoppage of .the car to get off in safety, then it would be for you to say, if you shall believe that he jumped off the car, whether or not the boy was doing that which, in view of the circumstances, his age and his inexperience, constituted on his part contributory negligence.] 4 If, in that, he was doing only that which was natural for him to do, and that which would be expected from a boy of his age, that which he did would not relieve the company from responsibility for the results of the act of the conductor.....</p>

I am speaking now upon the assumption that you shall be of the opinion that the boy was able to take care of himself. If he was able to take care of himself, that showing would go very far in warranting the opinion that the boy was guilty of contributory negligence, and therefore was in a position in which he could not recover.</p>

If, on the other hand, you think it has appeared satisfactorily to you that there was negligence on the part of some person in charge of the car, that is, that there was a failure to do something which ought to have been done in regard to this boy, or that something was done which ought not to have been done toward him, and that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff, in view of all the circumstances of the case, then you would be obliged to render a verdict for the plaintiff, and in that event another question would arise, as to which I will say a few words, and that is: What should be the damages that should be awarded ?.....</p>

The carrier, however, is bound to higher' care and vigilance when the platform is crowded, in proportion as that place is more dangerous than a seat inside the car; and, in the event of an injury, this fact will be considered, in connection with all the circumstances of the case, in determining the responsibility of the carrier: Crissey v.

In Pittsb. etc. Ry. Co. v. Caldwell, <a href="/pa/74/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="74 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1034722" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0421-01">74 Pa. 421</a>, a little girl of five years of age, in company with another of eleven, was permitted to ride on the front platform of a street car : when she came near to her home she attempted to get off, and was injured. Mr. Justice Williams, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ It was gross negligence to allow children of that age to get on the platform and to ride there. If they got on without his (the conductor’s) permission, instead of consenting that they might ride on the platform it was the duty of the company to compel them to go inside, or to stop and put them off.” It must be conceded, of course, that he is not held to the exercise of critical skill or judgment; for the performance of his ordinary duties, in a crowded car, may give him little opportunity to observe closely the capacity or intelligence of a particular person in his charge. He is, in this respect, held only to the exercise of that degree of discrimination which a reasonably prudent and observing man would be expected to exercise under the circumstances. His duties require him to give his attention not only to those who may wish to board the car, but to those who wish to leave it, as well as to <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>such as remain. It is his duty to collect the fares, regulate the movements of the car, and generally to conduct the affairs of the company in his charge. He may, therefore, when the car is crowded and passengers are passing in and aut, have little chance to test with accuracy the intelligence or capacity of the individual passengers. But he is bound to give his undivided attention to his business, and if any person boards his car who is obviously incompetent to choose a place of safety, or whom he knows, or as an observing and prudent man ought to know, to be thus incompetent, it is his duty to exercise the highest care and vigilance consistent with the performance of his ordinary duties, for his safety: Phila. etc. Ry.

Railway Co., <a href="/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%2086" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="75 Pa. 86">75 Pa. 86</a>. On the day of the occurrence, he had been visiting the St. John’s Orphan Asylum on Lancaster Avenue and Forty-eighth street. Returning home, he took the one-horse Heston-ville car, coming in from Fairmount, at Forty-eighth street, and rode to the depot at Forty-third street, where passengers are transferred to the defendant’s two-horse cars to be carried into the city. The plaintiff states that he had paid his fare on the Hestonville car, and that upon leaving that one, he had demanded a transfer ticket; that the conductor gave him none, but told him to get on the other car, and that he did as he was directed. He says the two-horse car was crowded, and there were probably eight or ten transfers; that the back platform was full, and that he with the other transfer passengers was directed “ to go up on the front.” He says, however, that he “ got upon the back platform first,” and “ went up in the front; ” that he “ went inside ” and “ went up in the middle—up in the car ”— “ went all the way up—up to the front of the car.” In this the plaintiff’s testimony differs from that of all his own witnesses, who say- that he boarded the car at the front platform, and remained there until the time of the injury. Even the conductor says he “ thinks he entered the car by the front platform,” but he states positively that he was within the car before the car started. It is highly probable that the little boy’s statement <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>is the correct one, as he could not well be mistaken as to a fact so likely to be remembered, and which he states so positively and circumstantially. Under the circumstances, he might well be supposed to know exactly what he did better than any of the passeng-ers or the conductor, who at this particular moment had no interest or concern in him or his movements. He was a small boy, and in the confusion caused by the entry of eight or ten passengers, might readily have worked his way through the crowded car without being observed.</p>

The jury found that the conductor had not put the plaintiff into the car at the front door, and this is probably true, but if by any means he had, in fact, entered the car, the conductor’s duty in this respect was done. The car had only proceeded a little more than a square from the depot, when the conductor, having collected the fares on the rear platform and in the body of the car, came forward, opened the wicket iir the front door, and demanded the fares of those on the front platform, among whom were these two boys. What then occurred is stated by the plaintiff’s witnesses substantially as follows: The conductor asked McCoy, the larger boy, for his fare; McCoy replied that he had paid his fare on the other car. The conductor said that was “ an old guy,” that he was “trying to steal a ride; ” that he must either pajj- his fare, or he would have to get off. This conversation was addressed to McCoy, but was within the hearing of the plaintiff. The conductor opened the door, and, as he did so, the plaintiff stepped with one foot down on the step of the car, and, holding to the iron support at the side of the car, attempted to get off backward. The driver caught him, and placed him back on the platform, saying, “ Don’t you get off, you will fall,” but almost immediately thereafter he repeated the act; and, although the driver again attempted to push him back, he was either thrown off, or jumped off, backward, receiving the injury complained <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>of. There is no evidence of a permission to ride on the front platform, except such as might be inferred from what occurred after the conductor came to the front door, and we think sufficient time did not elapse after that, nor was anything said or done to justify any fair or reasonable inference of the conductor’s permission to that effect. The whole occurrence appears to have been the affair of a few moments; almost at the instant when the door opened the injury occurred. Mrs. Doris says the time was not perceptible. If there was any evidence of negligence on the part of the conductor, it was certainly a mere scintilla.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[200,916,1168,902]]]'>In his charge to the jury the learned judge entirely overlooked the plaintiff’s own statement as to how he came upon the front platform. The case was submitted to the jury exclusively upon the testimony of the other witnesses. The plaintiff was examined as to his competency, at the instance of his own counsel, and was found to be qualified. His testimony was taken in his own interest, and it seems reasonable that his statement and admissions under oath, at the trial, against his own interest, ought not to have been wholly ignored, or withdrawn from the jury. It may be that a party, when he takes the stand as a witness in his own behalf, is not absolutely concluded by his own testimony, but when he testifies in a circumstantial and detailed manner as to a fact peculiarly within his knowledge, and which if believed would prevent his recovery, his testimony is certainly not to be entirely disregarded upon the mere assumption that he may have been <em>mistaken; </em>especially is this true, when he is not recalled to-explain or retract the statement.</p>
