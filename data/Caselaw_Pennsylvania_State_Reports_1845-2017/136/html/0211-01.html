Upon an examination of Yorks’ Appeal, we find that it deals exclusively with cases where the relation of debtor and creditor existed, and that it does not apply to cases pertaining to the distribution of decedent’s estates among legatees, or next of kin, nor where the parties are in relation to each other as executors and legatees. Justice Paxson, in his opinion on page 80, says: “ I throw out of view the question of the character of the trust between the executor and next of kin and legatees. That question is not before us and will not be considered further than to remark that in those instances there is a trust pure and simple. No relation of debt- or and creditor exists, or can exist in such cases. ” By this remark it would seem that those cases, where the relation of executor and next of kin or legatee existed, were not intended <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>to be affected by the ruling in Yorks’ Appeal, and therefore the ruling in Thompson’s Appeal stands unchanged and unaffected.</p>

Were the notes given to the testator by his sons, which were not barred at the time of his death, subject to the bar of the statute of limitations at the time of the distribution? In the cases cited by the court below, either the statute had fully run before the death of the decedent, or else the controversies arose upon suits in the Common Pleas. None of them were like this case. It is now the law of Pennsylvania that when a debt due from a legatee to the testator matured more than six years before his death, it is barred, and the statute can be taken advantage of in the Orphans’ Court; but, when the debt was not barred at the testator’s death, a different rule prevails, and the debt can be applied to the payment of the legacy in part or in whole: Yorks’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=110%20Pa.%2080" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="110 Pa. 80">110 Pa. 80</a>.

This is governed by the same principles as the question already discussed. It is true the right of action accrued only after the testator’s death, but the debt was created and existed before. The legacy vested on the testator’s death, and equity will apply the money so paid, as having been paid on account of the legacy, and will deduct it <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>therefrom. Moreover, as to the claims against Levi, the bar of the statute, if it applied thereto, was tolled by the distribution made in his assigned estate. That distribution was an adjudication of those claims: Reber’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="125 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="563958" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0020-01">125 Pa. 20</a>.

The statute could have been pleaded in a common-law suit on these notes, and by reserving them for use as a set-off, the administrator cannot deprive the debtor of his right to plead it; for, when the jurisdiction is concurrent, the rule must be the same in either forum : Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>; Keyser’s App., <a href="/pa/124/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="124 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="563113" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0080-01">124 Pa. 80</a>; Gilmore v.

As to the notes upon which the decedent was surety, certain additional considerations apply. The administrator was guilty of a devastavit in applying funds of the estate to the payment of those notes, which were barred as against the estate when he paid them. He could neither re-assume the barred liability for the estate: Reber’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="125 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="563958" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0020-01">125 Pa. 20</a>; nor could he bind the estate by recognizing them as subsisting claims: Hoch’s App., <a href="/pa/21/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="21 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="411518" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0280-01">21 Pa. 280</a>. Had suit been brought against the estate, the appellees could have pleaded the statute, although the administrator did not: See cases cited in Yorks’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%20287" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="2 R. 287">supra.</a> When brought into this distribution, they are open to <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>the same objections from us, as this is the first opportunity we have had to plead the statute.

By his last will and testament, he directed that after the death of his widow all Ins real and personal property should be sold, and that the proceeds thereof, with the money on hand, should be equally divided amongst his children. After the widow’s death, this provision of his will was complied with, and the account of the administrator, d. b. n., c. t. a., shows a balance in his hands of $8,485.15, and this is the fund for distribution. By his will, the decedent provided as follows : “ And what I have given to any of my children in my lifetime, and charged the same in my book, shall be deducted from their several and respective shares in the distribution of my estate.”</p>
    <p id="b238-9" data-blocks='[["BL_238.9",238,[259,1732,1160,650]],["BL_239.1",239,[201,353,1159,194]]]'>The testator held three notes against his oldest son, Levi Light: one dated August 8, 1867, payable one day after date, for $83.61; one dated April 15, 1868, payable one day after date, for $200; and one dated April 1, 1870, payable one year after date, for $110. The testator was bail for Levi on two other promissory notes: one to Moses Light, dated December 3,1870, payable three months after date, for $300; the other to Catherine Hunsicker, dated April 12, 1871, payable in one year, for $250. The interest on these two notes was paid by Levi up to the year 1876. In that year, Levi Light became insolvent, and the assignee for creditors, in the course of the settlement of his trust, sold and transferred the interest of Levi in his father’s estate to George Hoffman et al., the appellees. The <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>estate of David Ligdit, the testator, having been obliged to pay the notes upon which David Light was bail, the whole five notes were presented in the distribution of the assigned estate in 1881, and were allowed a dividend.</p>

The appellees resisted t&amp;is, upon the ground that there was no evidence whatever that the sum specified in any of the notes was ever intended or treated as an advancement, and that, as a set-off, the notes were all barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

Thompson’s App., supra, was, without doubt, rightly decided on other grounds. The testator, in that case, by his last will declared his intention to advance to each of his daughters a sum on her marriage, to be deducted from her share, and did so charge each daughter on his family book with the sums advanced, as also his son with the amount of the note in question, paid for him, charging it just as he had charged his daughters with what they had received, respectively. The note, under the facts of that case, was therefore properly considered an advancement, and no question upon the statute of limitations could arise. The reasoning of Thompson’s Appeal, as respects the statute of limitations, is, at best, obiter dictum, and is based upon McClintock’s App., <a href="/pa/29/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="29 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="982770" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0360-01">29 Pa. 360</a>, which is referred to by the learned judge, delivering the opinion, <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>to establish the proposition that the date of the death of the testator fixed the relations of the parties; and also upon the English case of Courtenay v. Williams, 3 Hare 539. But McClintock’s Appeal was expressly overruled in Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, and Courtenay v. Williams, as stated in Reed v. Marshall, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20Pa.%20349" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="90 Pa. 349">90 Pa. 349</a>, is not in accord with the current of decisions under our statute of limitations. In Milne’s App., <a href="/pa/99/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="99 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="446181" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0483-01">99 Pa. 483</a>, it was held, in direct denial of the doctrine of Courtenay v. Williams, that, in the distribution of a decedent’s estate in the Orphans’ Court, the indebtedness of a distributee to the decedent, against which the statute of limitations had run at the time of the decedent’s death, could not be set off against his share. See also Drysdale’s App., <a href="/pa/14/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="14 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="405924" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0531-01">14 Pa. 531</a>. The effect of McClintock’s Appeal was to extend the rule applicable in cases of pure trusts, and enforceable in equity only, to distributions in the Orphans’ Court. The doctrine of that case, however, had no application in personal actions at law against executors: Mitcheltree v. Veach, <a href="/pa/31/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="31 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="985061" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0455-01">31 Pa. 455</a>; nor to a set-off in an action in the Common Pleas for a legacy: Reed v. Marshall, supra. Since the decision in Yorks’ Appeal, however, these distinctions do not exist; the plea of the statute is as available in a distribution in the Orphans’ Court as in actions at law in the Common Pleas.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[239,1519,1161,857]],["BL_241.1",241,[237,355,1166,1626]]]'>“ The relation which subsists between a creditor and the estate of his deceased debtor,” said Mr. Justice Paxson, in Yorks’ App., supra, “ is that of debtor and creditor, with a trust superadded, by means of which, and the machinery of the Orphans’ Court, he can demand his proportion of the trust fund after his claim has been established. When so established, it may be said to be seated on the trust, and there is some room for the application of the principle of MeClintock’s Appeal. But in attempting to establish it, the creditor is pursuing the estate of the decedent as his debtor; no other relation exists but that of debtor and creditor, and the statute of limitations may be set up in any forum which has jurisdiction of the case.....The fact that the creditor could sue at law and that the statute could be pleaded in such proceeding, is an answer to the assertion that there is a trust exclusively cognizable in equity. The right to plead it in one court and not in the other is, as before observed, an anomaly. I know of nothing <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>to sustain it, and there is an overwhelming weight of authority against it.” The same reasoning applies in this case. There was no evidence whatever that the notes represented sums received by way of advancement: the parties to these notes occupied the relation of debtor and creditor, and the ordinary and appropriate remedy upon the notes was in the Common Pleas; and, if the appellant’s contention is sustained, we have again the anomaly of the right of a party, upon the same debt to plead the statute of limitations in one court, and not in the other. The general and well-settled rule, as stated by the learned judge below, is that, when the statute begins to run, it will not stop because of the death of either party: Mitcheltree v. Veach, <a href="/pa/31/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="31 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="985061" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0455-01">supra;</a> Marsteller v. Marsteller, <a href="/pa/93/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="93 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="442090" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0350-01">93 Pa. 350</a>; Amole’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="115 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="551675" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0356-01">115 Pa. 356</a>; Updegrove v. Blum, <a href="/pa/117/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="117 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="555825" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0259-01">117 Pa. 259</a>; and, since the decision of Yorks’ App., supra, this is a rule of general application. If the statute can be pleaded with effect when the decedent’s estate is a debtor, we can see no good reason why it may not be pleaded also with like effect when the estate is a creditor: if the running of the statute should be stopped by the death in one case, why not in the other ? There is no necessity arising out of the administration of the law, or the practice in equity, which calls for any such distinction; the legatees were as much entitled to the protection of the statute as any other creditor. Admitting the right of an executor, or of the heirs, in the distribution of a decedent’s estate, to set off the debts of the legatees against their legacies, the debts, to constitute a valid set-off, should be valid, subsisting debts, not barred by the statute. If suits had been brought upon these notes before the bar of the statute, the validity of the debts evidenced thereby might have been established and their obligation continued; and, when so established, the executor’s right to a set-off is inherent to the trust, and cannot be denied.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[239,1988,1164,397]],["BL_242.1",242,[240,344,1161,653]]]'>Nor do we think the allowance of a dividend out of the assigned estate of Levi Light, and payment thereof by the assignee, tolled the statute, either as an implied promise to pay or as an adjudication of the debt. The allowance and payment of the dividend was not the act of Levi Light, or of his agent, duly authorized. The assignee was not under the personal direction or control of the assignor: his duties were defined by law, and he could do nothing to bind the assignor, outside of <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>the scope of his duty. No new promise of the assignor could be implied from the act of the assignee, who acted for himself, only, in the discharge of official duty. But the further discussion of this question seems useless, as the dividend was paid in April, 1881, eight years and more before the hearing by the auditor. Upon similar ground, the adjudication by the auditor cannot be accepted as an adjudication of the claim excepting as to the assigned estate. In a distribution in the Orphans’ Court, as in Reber’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="125 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="563958" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0020-01">125 Pa. 20</a>, the adjudication is against the administrator or executor as the legal representative of the decedent; whilst, in the case of a distribution of an assigned estate, the adjudication is against a particular fund only.</p>
