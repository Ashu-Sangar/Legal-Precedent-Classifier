It is claimed, however, that the act of June 4, 1879, bars their right. This act has received judicial construction, the results of which are, that as to the condition of the donees the will speaks as of the date; as to the subjects of the testamentary disposition, the will is construed as of the death; as to the objects, that is, the persons who are to take under it, and their condition, the will speaks as of its date; as to the testator’s condition, it is to be considered as of its date. The act is restricted in its effect to the real and personal property passing under it. It would appear from these decisions that the claim of the plaintiffs is well founded, unless they are barred by the power of sale given to the executrix in the will. It is contended that she had an absolute title under the will, and that the power of sale was therefore nugatory; and that she conveyed in her own “right, and not under the power given to her by the will.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[260,661,1164,349]]]'>It is well known that English conveyancers and judges were persistent in their effort to relieve real estate from the restrictions which were thrown around its transmission. From this resulted uses, and trusts, and powers, and appointments. Mr. Sugden, in his work on powers, has given the line of decision with proper comments, in which we may find a few principles for our guidance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b58-7" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[260,1018,1164,399]]]'>It should be recollected that uses and powers qualified the estates upon which they rested. The courts gave relief from these restrictions, when it could be done without injury to the rights of others; as, when the grantor had the fee with the power of limitation, and conveyed without exercising the power, the purchaser took the land without limitation. If, however, the limitation was in another, the purchaser took a qualified fee.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b58-8" data-blocks='[["BL_58.6",58,[258,1426,1168,1003]]]'>There were cases in which the intention of the grantors, grantees, or the testators became essential elements in their determination. This intention was not the intention to exercise the power, but the intent of the parties as to the estate which was conveyed. “ The principle attempted to be established, viz., that there must not only be an intention to dispose of the property, but also to dispose of it under the power, was strongly observed upon in argument at the bar of the House of Lords, and the author, who had to sustain the decision, felt himself unable to support the doctrine advanced in the judgment. If the intention to pass the property can be collected, it will pass under the power, although the donee supposed that it would work by force of his interest. There is no conflict; he intends the property to pass, and thinks he has all the interest in it, whereas he has only a power. The intention governs, and the power will support the disposition. It is intention, then, that in these cases, governs : ” Sugden on P., 440. The estate which was intended to be conveyed passed without regard to the form of conveyancing, provided the interests of other parties were not affected.</p>

      <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>The learned president of the Co.mmon Pleas correctly held that their right is not affected by the act of June 4, 1879, but he came to the conclusion that the deed of April 16, 1887, from the widow to the defendants, was a good execution of the power of sale given her by the will, and hence the plaintiffs were barred of their right of possession, and must look to the fund realized by the sale. In that we think he was mistaken. The power of sale, contained in the third clause of her husband’s will, is given to Mrs. Robeno in connection with the devise of all his real estate to her, “ her heirs and assigns absolutely forever.” In her deed to two of the defendants, she conveys in fee, not by virtue of the power of sale, but as sole devisee of her husband. The lot is described as being the premises which Thomas Hare and wife, by deed dated November 13, 1873, conveyed in fee to Andrew Robeno, Jr., who, dying seised thereof, devised the same in fee to his wife Helen A. Robeno. There is nothing whatever, either in the deed itself or dehors that instrument, to indicate that she conveyed or intended to convey by virtue of the power of sale specified in the will, or for the purpose of paying debts ; nor does it appear that there were any unpaid debts of the testator. It is not pretended that the sale was made in the due course of administration. So far as appears by the special verdict, it was made in the vendor’s own right and for her own benefit.</p>

Hughes, <a href="/binn/3/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="3 Binn. 498" data-case-ids="1791076" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0498-01">3 Binn. 498</a>. The appointment of a testamentary guardian, and a power of sale for the payment of debts, have been upheld against such children, because they are not in conflict with either the letter or spirit of the act of 1833, above quoted. The appointment of a testamentary guardian relates only to the custody of the minor’s person and management of his estate. It cannot affect his interest as distributee under the intestate law. A power of sale for the payment of debts, like the appointment of an executor, relates to the administration of the estate, payment of debts, etc. The claims of creditors are of course superior to the rights of heirs or .distributees. The latter take nothing until the decedent’s debts are paid. Hence, a power of sale for the payment of debts, and the execution thereof, <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>cannot injuriously affect the right of afterborn children “to such purparts, shares, and dividends of the estate real and personal,” of their deceased parent, “ as if he had actually died without any will.”</p>
    <p id="b63-5" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[202,553,1161,602]]]'>The language of the act is clear and explicit; and as heretofore construed by this court it undoubtedly applies to the facts of this case and sustains the contention of the plaintiffs: Walker v. Hall, <a href="/pa/34/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="34 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="417963" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0483-01">34 Pa. 483</a> ; Edwards’s App., <a href="/pa/47/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="47 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="485572" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0144-01">47 Pa. 144</a>; Willard’s Est., <a href="/pa/68/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="68 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1024578" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0327-01">68 Pa. 327</a>; Grosvenor v. Fogg, 2 W. N. 709; Hollingsworth’s App., <a href="/pa/51/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="51 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="999778" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0518-01">51 Pa. 518</a>. To require the plaintiffs to look only to the proceeds of the sale made by their mother would be denying them that interest in their father’s estate which the act declares they are entitled to, namely, “ such purparts, shares, and dividends of the estate, real and personal, of the deceased, as if he had actually died without any will.” The specifications of error are sustained.</p>
    <p id="b63-6" data-blocks='[["BL_63.5",63,[463,1165,900,289]]]'>Judgment reversed; and judgment is now entered on the special verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the premises described in the writ, subject to the life estate of Helen A. Robeno in five ninths thereof, which is vested in the defendants.</p>
