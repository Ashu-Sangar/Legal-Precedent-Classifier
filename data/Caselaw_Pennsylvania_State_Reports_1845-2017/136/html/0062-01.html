The effect of the president’s agreement was simply a waiver of a written protest, putting the stockholder in the same position he would have occupied if he had written out his protest in a formal manner; it was not an engagement that the stockholder might recover back the bonus paid by him if any one else should obtain such a recovery.</p>

Their stock consisted at the time, as I understand, of two hundred thousand shares, rated at ten dollars per share, making the nominal or par value of the shares $2,000,000. By the resolution the stock was to be increased one half. That is to say, for every two shares one was to be issued. Those shares were to be issued as being of the par value of the stock of ten dollars per share; that amount to be paid by the persons who subscribed for it; the effect of which would be to add to the capital stock of the company $1,000,000, with a view, I suppose, to the transaction of a profitable business. It seems, however, a majority of the stockholders, perhaps the large majority, were of the opinion that a still further increase of the assets of the company was advisable. They therefore desired that the right to subscribe for an additional one hundred thousand shares at ten dollars per share should be on condition that, in exercising it, whoever subscribed ten dollars for one of the new shares of the stock should also pay ten dollars for the privilege of being admitted to the new subscription.</p>

If, however, he did not comply with all these conditions, including the condition which required him to pay ten dollars for the privilege, he would forfeit his right to the new stock, and, moreover, that stock would be sold to the highest bidder and acquired by third persons, which would introduce a new element into the company.</p>

If he did not comply with the illegal condition, the stock would be sold and new holders brought into the company. How much disadvantage that would cause I do not know. In some instances it might be very considerable. On the other hand, if he paid without protest he certainly could not get the money back, and it would be so much lost to him except that, going into the treasuiy of the company, he would be entitled to participate in it as a stockholder. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff paid the ten dollars which were necessary to buy the stock and the ten dollars which were necessary to entitle him to the privilege of buying, declaring that lie did it under protest. These words are used customarily to convey the idea that the party is giving something that he does not owe, to some one who is not entitled to receive it, and that he does so against his will and under coercion. Such was the course that the plaintiff desired to pursue, but it is questionable Avhether he took the proper means to carry his purpose into effect.</p>

That is, he paid the entire price of the stock which was not all yet due, and also all that he was to pay for the privilege of becoming a purchaser, none of which had become due; and he did so without saying anything or making any protest, simply handing the money over to the company as in full.</p>

It determined, not only that the stockholders were entitled to a pro rata allotment of the new stock clear of bonus, but also that any of the plaintiffs in that suit who had paid the bonus under protest, were entitled to have it refunded with interest. Our claim for a return of the bonus paid by us under protest, is resisted upon the <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>ground that the payment was voluntary.

The payment of bonus by the plaintiff was of such a nature and made in such circumstances as to entitle him to a return thereof, independent of the matters we shall refer to subsequently. This point is ruled by Cunningham’s Appeal, supra. There is nothing in the report of that case indicating that the decree was based upon circumstances peculiar to it and not existing in the present case. Nor did the modified injunction in that case give to the protest of the plaintiffs therein any peculiar potency or effectiveness, or bring the case under the doctrine of Shaw v.

The decision in Cunningham’s Appeal, respecting the right to a return of the bonus, was not based upon any equity peculiar to the plaintiffs in that particular case, but upon a common-law right, pertaining alike to all who had paid under protest. The conclusion there reached is in harmony with the other Pennsylvania authorities: Motz v.

However, neither Cunningham’s Appeal nor the present case depends upon the doctrine of duress ; they are entirely outside of that doctrine. We are stockholders dealing with our agents, the managers of our company. The company stands toward us in a fiduciary relation. How can the defence that the money was voluntarily paid, possibly avail a trustee, as against his cestui que trust, in a chancery <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>proceeding? And this action for money had and received is, in substance, a bill in equity. The effect given to the protest in Cunningham’s Appeal was not referable to compulsion, but was expressly put upon the ground of non-acquiescence in the scheme under which the payments were demanded.</p>
    <p id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[162,612,1166,1170]]]'>3. Not only was the payment of the bonus by the plaintiff made under protest, but the protest as made was accepted as a sufficient reservation of his rights, and as securing to him a return of the money if the demand for it was unwarranted. Having, through its president, given the plaintiff reason to rely upon his protest as effectual, and having claimed the benefit of the president’s act in receiving the money paid on the strength of this reliance, the defendant is estopped from disputing the plaintiff’s right to have his money returned: 2 Herman on Estoppel, §§ 733, 735; Ackla v.

Again; the express agreement, under which the plaintiff paid the bonus, was that if he would abstain from making a written protest, he should be accorded any benefit which any other stockholder might obtain by suit. Hence, as the plaintiffs in the Cunningham suit thereby obtained a return of the bonus paid by them, this plaintiff is entitled to a-similar,, benefit. His light to subscribe for shares was not based upon contract, but upon a statute, and his repudiation of a condition, wrongfully attempted to be coupled with the exercise of the statutory power, gave him the right to receive the shares at par.</p>

We do not dispute, upon this record, that the president made the uncompleted protest perfect for the purpose of the case. He doubtless had power to waive a written protest and agree that a verbal one should be its equivalent; but he had no inherent power to do more than that, and his words cannot be tortured into anything more than an agreement that De la Cuesta should receive, under his verbal protest, the same benefit which any one else might recover by virtue of a written protest. The Cunninghams did not recover on their bill by virtue of their <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>protest; their recovery depended upon facts and rights existing at the date of filing their bill, and the protest by them after bill filed, neither enlarged nor diminished their rights. Cunningham’s Appeal does not decide the right of the plaintiff to recover in this case. In making the final decree therein, the effect of the conduct of the parties pendente lite was in the mind of the court, and the decree was necessarily confined to the rights of the litigants. Moreover, it seems to have escaped attention that no question as to paying under protest arose in that case.</p>
    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[269,867,1162,956]]]'>2. The real question, here, is whether a payment made under protest can be recovered back, and the only point raised by the case is this: Was the remedy which the plaintiff elected to pursue the proper one ? The plaintiff’s right, under the company’s charter, to have certain shares alio ted to him at par, differed in no respect from a right to have so many shares delivered to him under a contract to sell. Pie had two remedies open to him. One would be to buy shares in the market, after a refusal of the company to deliver him shares at par, and then sue for what he would have to pay in the market beyond the par value. The other would be to tender par, and sue for the refusal to deliver the shares. The remedies exclude all others in the case of a claim to stock that can be purchased on the market: Fry on Spec. Performance, 11; Angell &amp; Ames on Corp., § 381. The exceptional remedy of paying under protest and then suing to recover back the money paid, is allowed only when the payment has been coerced by duress. Injustice, even though it amount to actual fraud, does not warrant it: Moses v. Macferlan, 2 Burr. 1009.</p>

By the bill, in that ease, Cunningham put the company to an election either to abandon its scheme, or, if it wTent on, to issue shares to him at par. De la Cuesta did not put the company to such an election. He entered into a contract for shares, and he could obtain them only on the terms of that contract. Even in cases of fraud, the purchaser of property cannot get it for less than he agreed to pay: Great Luxemburg v. Magney, 25 Beav. 586; Evans v. Borie, 1 W. N. 127; Adywell Mining Co. v. Brookes, 35 Ch. Div. 400; Driscoll v. Bromley, 1 Jur. 238. There Yvas no other pressure that induced the plaintiff to make the payment than the dilemma which arose from uncertainty as to the law of the case. A prospect or a threat of a lawsuit does not render a payment involuntary: Hospital v.

There was no threat to sell the plaintiff’s right to any shares if he did not pay, and the company could not have done so.

The defendant company does not deny the facts as stated by plaintiff, nor seek to avoid the legal effect thereof. There was nothing in the transaction but a waiver of protest; that is to say, the protest was to be as effectual as if it had been written out in the most formal manner. It furnishes no evidence of a contract between the plaintiff and the corporation that, as a consideration for the plaintiff not putting his protest in writing, he should be entitled to recover, if any one, in any suit, past, present, or to come, should be capable of recovering. On the contrary, he was to have the advantage only of what any other person should receive in any suit by virtue of a written protest. There was no consideration for anything else. The company did not receive the bonus because of the waiver. The plaintiff went to the office for the purpose of paying the money, and would have paid it under a written protest had not Mr. Platt, as an act of courtesy, merely, accepted the verbal waiver. In this connection, I am unable to see what Cunningham’s App., <a href="/pa/108/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="108 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="539263" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0546-01">108 Pa. 546</a>, has to do with the case. There was no question of the effect of a protest in that case; it was <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>not alleged that the decree was obtained on any snch ground. The bill was filed to restrain the scheme proposed by the company, or to limit the new stock to ten dollars per share, its par value; to compel the company to issue the stock to complainants upon the payment of ten dollars per share, and to restrain it from selling the allotments to which the plaintiffs were entitled. This left the company an option. They could advance or recede. As they had gone on to a large extent, upon terms offered and accepted by nearly all the stockholders, this bill did not interfere with the scheme further than was necessary to sustain the right of the particular claimants therein to have their shares of the new stock issued to them at par, if the company concluded to issue the shares. The present plaintiff gives the company no option, but is seeking the same advantage as though he had put 'the company to an election ; that is to saj^, by protesting under the contract, or against being required to contract, he can obtain the right under the contract without being bound to comply with its terms.</p>
    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[190,1284,1163,641]]]'>Undue importance has been attached to the following language in the decree in Cunningham’s Appeal: “ And if they or any of them have, under protest, paid such bonus or charges for the said stock shares, that the same be refunded to them, with interest.” This must be understood to apply only to the litigants in that case. This court did not intend to decide the rights of parties not before it, who were not and could not have been heard. It has never, since its foundation, attempted to exercise such an arbitrary power. Moreover, there was neither protest nor payment in that case; there was nothing, therefore, to which the language referred to could apply, and the expression was doubtless used inadvertently. The decree is broader than the case.</p>

The plaintiff was entitled, under Cunningham’s Appeal, supra, to subscribe for the new stock at par. The company required him to agree to pay an additional sum at a future time for the privilege of subscribing. This bonus, as it was called, was to be added to the surplus fund. This, however, is not material. He signed the contract to pay the additional sum,under protest, and paid under protest. This suit was brought to recover back the money thus demanded. This is the whole case.</p>

      <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>It will be observed there was nothing to interfere with the plaintiff’s right to stock which he already held. It was a contract for the delivery, not of his proportion of the new stock, but of the certificates or evidence of his ownership of such stock. The stock was already his, and no action of the company could deprive him of it. He could have tendered the par of the stock and demanded a certificate. If the company had refused to issue it, he could have brought suit and recovered its market value. If he wanted the shares, he could have bought them in the market and recovered from the company what he paid in excess of par. One share of the stock of a business or trading-corporation is the precise equivalent of every other share; hence it is that equity does not concern itself about particular shares, and a bill will not lie to compel specific performance for the sale of specific shares: Foll’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20484" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="91 Pa. 484">91 Pa. 484</a>.</p>

It is unnecessary, in referring to a settled rule of law, always to state the reasons of the rule in a judicial opinion. It is sufficient to say here that I know of no legal principle which is sustained by better reasons of public policy. If, in every instance, in which a man is in doubt as to which is the safe course to pursue, he can pay under protest, and then sue to recover it back, it is difficult to see where litigation is to end. The law, therefore, wisely holds that a voluntary payment cannot be recovered back. In the recent case of Harvey v. Girard N. Bank, <a href="/pa/119/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="119 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="558105" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0212-01">119 Pa. 212</a>, the law is thus stated: “A voluntary payment of money under a claim of right cannot in general be recovered back. There must be compulsion, actual, present, and potential, in indiicing the payment by force of process available for instant seizure of person or property, when the party so paying must give notice of the illegality of the demand, and of his involuntary payment. The element of coercion being essential, a mere protest or notice will not change the character of the payment, or confer of itself a right of recovery; ” citing Peebles v. Pittsburgh, 101 Pa.304. In Harvey v. the Bank there was a loss of credit, a very serious matter to a business man, by permitting a draft to go to protest. The party paid to protect his commercial honor, but we said it was not duress. In Neely’s App., <a href="/pa/124/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="124 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="563093" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0406-01">124 Pa. 406</a>, there was an attempt to set aside an ante-<a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>nuptial contract on the ground of duress. After the marriage day had been fixed, the guests invited, and the caterer engaged, the husband produced an ante-nuptial contract which he required his intended wife to sign. She protested by her tears; his reply was, “No contract, no wedding.” We held there was no duress. Many other cases of a like nature could be cited were it necessary. Those above mentioned are referred to as showing that mere embarrassment, or loss of credit, as in the bank case, or mortification, as in the Neely case, do not amount to the kind of duress which the law recognizes as justifying a payment under protest. And just here it is proper to remark that the only effect of a protest, in a case in which it may be legitimately applied, is to show that the payment was not voluntarily made, and that the party protesting intends to claim it back.</p>

Reynolds, 2 Str. 916; <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pick.%2013" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="12 Pick. 13">12 Pick. 13</a>. But the threat of a distress for rent is not such duress, because the party may replevy the goods distrained, and try the question of liability at law: Knibbs v. Hall, 1 Esp. Rep. 84. The threat of legal process is not such duress, for the party may plead and make proof, and show that he is not liable. Brown v. McKinally, 1 Esp. Rep. 279. But the warrant to a collector under a statute for the collection of taxes, is in the nature of an execution running against the person and property of the party, upon which he has no day in court, no opportunity to pleaid and offer proof and have a judicial decision of the question of his liability. Where, therefore, a party not liable to taxation is called on peremptorily to pay upon such a warrant, and he can save himself and his property in no other way than by paying the illegal demand, he may give notice that he so pays it by duress, and not voluntarily, and maintain an action to recover it back; ” citing <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Mass.%20461" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="17 Mass. 461">17 Mass. 461</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pick.%2013" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="12 Pick. 13">12 Pick. 13</a>. We <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>have here, succinctly stated, the principle upon which the doctrine rests in its application to a warrant for the collection of taxes. If the demand is illegal, and the party can save himself and his property in no other way, he may pay under protest and recover it back. But if other means are open to him by which he may prevent the sale of his property; if a day in court is accorded to him, he must resort to such means. Thus, the seizure of' a man’s goods under a landlord’s warrant for rent that is not due, or for more than is due, would seem to be duress as much as the seizure of property for taxes; yet, if the unlawful demand for rent be paid under protest, it cannot be recovered back for the reason above stated, that the tenant can replevy the goods, and try the issue of no rent in arrear before a jury.</p>

The destruction of the deed, in such case, might be the loss of title, and a suit brought to recover it might not avail as it would not necessarily prevent its destruction. This case came fairly within the doctrine of White v. Heylman, <a href="/pa/34/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="34 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="417977" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0142-01">34 Pa. 142</a>, where a promissory note Avas given by a principal to his fraudulent agent to secure certain rights to which he Avas entitled, and out of which he had been defrauded by the agent, and it Avas held that in a suit by the equitable transferee of the note, the equities between the original parties could have been in quired into.

It was said by Mr. Justice Mercur : “No immediate and urgent necessity existed for the payment of the taxes to protect the property of the plaintiffs. Its goods were not about to be seized.” In Peebles v. Pittsburgh, there was a street assessment against plaintiffs’ real estate, under an act of assembly which this court subsequently held to be unconstitutional. The plaintiff paid his assessment under protest after notice that a scire facias would be issued to collect it; held, (a) that his payments, having been voluntary, could not be recovered back, and (6) that his notice and protest at the time of his payments gave him no higher right.</p>

It, was said by Mr. Justice Sterrett, in delivering the opinion of the coui't: “ Plaintiff’s property having been levied on and advertised by the sheriff, he appealed to the equity side of the-court for relief, but it was denied, and he was thus compelled either to submit to a sale of his property, by which his title thereto might be imperiled, or pay the taxes and costs. On the eve of the sale, lie chose the latter alternative, and paid the city’s unjust demand under protest. In a legal sense was this a voluntary payment? We think not. In Union Ins. Co. v. Allegheny, <a href="/pa/101/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="101 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="500858" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0250-01">101 Pa. 250</a>, it was said of the insurance company, which was similarly circumstanced, except that it did not apply to the court for redress, that ‘ by application to the equitable powers of the court, or by bill in equity, execution might have been stayed, and the claim removed from the record.’ That is just what plaintiff in this case endeavored to do, but without success; and therein is the distinction between that case and this. Relief in the form suggested in that case was asked, but it was refused, as we think erroneously; • and plaintiff was compelled to choose one of the two alternatives above mem tioned. If there is anything against which equity should relieve, it is an act of injustice and oppression, such as the city was proceeding to commit by exposing plaintiff’s property to <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>sale on liens which had been previously divested by sheriff’s sale.”</p>

It is a duress either of person or goods that constitutes the coercion. It is not pretended there was a duress of person, nor was there anything to show duress of goods. There was nothing but the denial of a right, and a declared intention not to recognize a right is not duress. It is true, the denial of the right placed the plaintiff in a “ dilemma,” to use the expression of Judge Hare in Dawson’s case. But if we adopt the principle that whenever a man is placed in a position in which the law is doubtful, and he is compelled to choose between two paths, in other words, to decide between conflicting views of the law, he is to be considered as under duress, we shall certainly multiply litigation, even if no other end is accomplished.</p>

Suppose the plaintiff had tendered the company the par of the new shares to which he claims he was entitled; that the company had declined to accept it, and had sold the right to subscribe for a corresponding number of shares. How would this have affected the rights of the plaintiff ? The company could no more have sold his stock than they could have sold his house. If he had a right to certain shares by paying ten dollars each therefor, that right could not have been divested by a sale of them by the company, nor bjr any other action on its part. His rights as a stockholder were fixed by the law: a certificate would have added nothing to them; it would have been evidence, nothing more, that he owned stock, but that already appeared upon the books of the company. The duress, if any, was not of a thing, of goods or chattels, but of an incorporeal right. Had the stock been sold he would have had no contest with the purchaser, as he would have necessarily had if a corporeal thing, or the title to a corporeal thing, had been sold <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>accompanied by delivery of possession. He had to do only with the company; and, after tender of the par, could have brought his suit and recovered, as before stated, the market value of the stock, and if he wanted shares, with the money thus recovered could have bought a corresponding amount of other shares.</p>
    <p id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[171,672,1165,1317]]]'>It was urged, however, that this case is upon all fours with Motz v. Mitchell, supra, where there was duress of an unrecorded deed, while in the ease in hand there was duress of stock. This argument involves the assumption that a certificate had been issued for the new shares, which certificate the company unlawfully withheld from the plaintiff. In point of fact, the plaintiff never had a certificate for the new shares, for none had been issued. The plaintiff had a right to demand a certificate for them upon payment of tlie par, and to sue them for a refusal, as before stated. That there could not be duress of this right is too plain for argument. There was not duress of person or goods : there was simply the denial of a right; a refusal to issue shares of stock to which the plaintiff was entitled, and for which refusal lie had a full, complete, and convenient remedy at law. We may concede that the action of the company placed him in a “ dilemma; ” he had to choose between two roads, neither of which he may have regarded as safe. In other words, he was uncertain as to his legal rights under the scheme proposed by the company. The “ dilemma ” was the uncertainty of the law. There was no other pressure or duress that caused the payment. However great the uncertainty of the law may be in particular cases, it has never been supposed to amount to duress of either person or goods. It was nothing more than is experienced by every lawyer in the course of his practice. He is often called upon to advise, where the law is uncertain; and, in all such cases, the client must take the risk.</p>
