Defendant has appealed and complains because the trial court refused to enter judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict; also because the court below refused to grant a new trial.\nWe have read the printed record and are not convinced of error. No useful purpose would be served by a statement of the facts or by a review of the evidence; it is sufficient to say the issues involved were for the jury, and no abuse of discretion appears in refusing a new trial.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
