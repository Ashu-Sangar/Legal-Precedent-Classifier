Plaintiff filed motions in each case for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial. The court below refused the motions for judgment n. o. v., and plaintiff has taken appeals from the orders to that effect; it granted the motions for a new trial, and each defendant has appealed from these orders. All of the appeals will be disposed of together.\nIn its opinion in support of the orders appealed from, the court below, after reviewing the facts attending the execution of the notes in suit and the defense thereto, states that \u201cthe interests of right and justice require that the cases shall be retried.\u201d Under such circumstances, we do not interfere on appeal. These cases, as to both sets of appeals, fall within the rules stated by us in March v. Philadelphia & West Chester Traction Co., 285 Pa. 413; Pringle v. Smith, 286 Pa. 152, 154; Baranowski v. Lackawanna & W. V. R. R. Co., 288 Pa. 461, 462; Jones v. Penna. R. R. Co., 289 Pa. 424, 425-426; Regan v. Davis, 290 Pa. 167, 169, 170.\nThe orders under review are affirmed.",
