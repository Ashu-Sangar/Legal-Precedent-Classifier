On application of the executors of the last mentioned defendant, (who died after executing the guaranty and assignment indorsed on the note), the court below struck off the judginent as to him, saying, inter alia, \u201cWe are of the opini\u00f3n that the [holder] of the note cannot enter a joint judgment against the maker and the endorser on the two separate confessions, because the promises of the maker and the guarantor are separate and distinct and do not constitute them jointly liable for the same debt.\u201d\nThe above conclusion is sustained by Union Bank of Nanty-Glo v.
