The admission of this testimony is the only error assigned. Defendants later acknowledged in the court below, and again here, that the recorded conveyance was the one referred to by the witness. Hence what we are now asked to do is to sustain the impossible contention, legally speaking, that defendants were injured by the admission of evidence which in reality corroborated their story. This we decline to do.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed.",
