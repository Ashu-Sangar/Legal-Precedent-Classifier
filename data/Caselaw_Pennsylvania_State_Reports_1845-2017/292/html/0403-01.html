    <p id="b443-4" data-blocks='[["BL_443.7",443,[132,640,1157,1359]]]'>The plaintiff corporation furnished the defendant with certain personal property to be used in her store under a contract of conditional sale. It was agreed that the purchase price should be paid by installments of fixed amounts. Title was reserved in the vendor, but it was agreed that, when the full sum stipulated for had been satisfied, a bill of sale would be given the vendee. The designated articles were delivered, and the payments made until August 29, 1926, when the purchaser became in default. In December following, a writ of replevin was issued to recover the goods in possession of the defendant, and security as required in such cases given. A counterbond was filed, and the goods retained by defendant pending the result of the litigation. An affidavit of defense was submitted, in which it was averred that the sale had been effected by reason of false representations, and, further, that the property was not of the quality warranted. It was admitted that further payments were refused, but defendant claimed that the losses sustained exceeded the balance unpaid under the contract by a considerable amount, for which excess an award against plaintiff was asked. The court below ruled the affidavit to be insufficient, and entered judgment for plaintiff, directing that the property be returned to it, and defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.8",443,[130,2012,1153,426]],["BL_444.1",444,[284,354,1148,370]]]'>In case of default in carrying out the contract referred to, — the basis of the present action, — the right to enter the premises and take repossession of the property was given the seller. Paragraph 6 provided that “this agreement constitutes the entire contract between the parties hereto, and no waiver or modification thereof shall be valid unless written upon or attached to this contract, and buyer hereby accepts the goods in their <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>present condition, with no warranties on the part of seller, except such as may be endorsed hereon in writing prior to execution,” and none was added. The statement set forth the delivery of the property, admitted the payment of the installments until August of 1926, when default occurred, and averred the refusal of defendant to further comply with the conditions of sale.</p>

As this was an action of replevin, the question involved is one of title only. In such a proceeding, the defendant cannot assert a set-off (General Motors Tr. Co. v.
