This denial to city residents must be based on some natural differences, or an expediency of government, such as was stated in Com. v. Del. Div.

Phillippi, supra); nor will different methods of collection, nor the manner of the collection of the same tax, provided the difference does not impose an unnecessary burden on those affected. Thus, distress is an incident to the collection of taxes from individuals, but not as to corporations: see Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 514, section 41. An individual may be placed in jail for nonpayment, while partnerships and corporations cannot. But when there is no reasonable basis for a classification adopted by the legislature, the act will be declared unconstitutional. In Schoyer v. Comet Oil &amp; Ref. Co., supra, we held that an act permitting liens of corporation creditors to be discriminated against in favor of liens of individual creditors in the collection of public accounts was an illegal classification. The same principle controlled in Van Loon v. Engle, <a href="/pa/171/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="171 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="985550" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0157-01">171 Pa. 157</a>.</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[301,1274,1150,1072]]]'>The act permitting the retention of five per cent by the taxpayer is for the welfare of the government. In conducting the affairs of a county when taxes are assessed, the county commissioners find its financial resources at a low ebb, continuing to get lower as spring and summer months approach. It becomes necessary to secure money immediately to conduct the business of the county. The outlays to be made by the county include court and jail expenses, care of the poor, payment for the keeping of the insane, and many other disbursements that do not admit of delay in payment. The legislature adopted an inducement for prompt payment in districts where ordinarily collections are not rapid and are difficult; it enables counties to replace the deficit at least partially. Again, the deduction may be treated as a collection fee in districts not compactly built. In such districts, the expenses of collection are greater than in the more compact or built up sections. The fee has the effect of producing an immediate revenue for county purposes.</p>

      <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>But it is urged the classification is unfair because there are some boroughs as compactly built up as cities. This may be quite true, but, in general, the opposite is the case. In classifying municipal divisions for governmental purposes, the legislature cannot be held to exact lines of demarcation either as to intensity of population or scope of territory. A division based on reasonable grounds, having a substantial relation to the subject dealt with, is all that is necessary. We held that the assessment of rural lands under the Act of 1868, P. L. 565, at two-thirds of their value as against full value for city lands was, under the Constitution, a proper classification: Kitty Roup’s Case, supra. We also held that difference in the manner of collection where different parties were involved was within the Constitution. See Com. v. Del. Div. Canal Co., supra.

That body has entered the field and defined the rebate for collection of county taxes to be allowed in townships and boroughs, and did not add cities. It has been suggested that the enabling Act of 1834, P. L. (1833-1834), 537, for counties, gives this authority. It provides, section 3, dealing with corporate powers: II. “To take and to hold real estate within their respective limits, and also personal property: Provided, that such real and personal estates shall be taken and held only for the benefit of the inhabitants of the respective county or township.” III. To make such contracts as may be necessary and proper for the execution of the same objects and purposes.” A county is a quasi corporation, and its corporate powers are to be exercised by the commissioners: Kittanning Academy v.

    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[301,1318,1153,692]]]'>While taxes, when assessed, become the property of the county for the benefit of the inhabitants, and, generally speaking, the Act of 1834 empowers the commissioners or officers acting through them to make contracts in relation thereto for its possession, preservation, protection or legitimate disposition, the strongest implication from this statute would not confer the power here suggested, — that of allowing rebates in cities. The court below extended to cities the Act of 1885 for townships and boroughs. It could not thus legislate, nor may we under the Act of 1834. There may be other acts not called to our attention; if there are, the responsible parties will no doubt be guided by them.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[303,2022,1148,261]]]'>The decree of the court below is modified — that part of it which sustained the constitutionality of the Act of 1885 is affirmed; that part which attempts to include cities into the Act of 1885 is reversed. Costs of this appeal to be paid by the County of Lackawanna.</p>
