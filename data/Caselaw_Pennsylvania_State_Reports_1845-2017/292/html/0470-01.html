It clearly evidenced an intention to omit Ellen and Paul from participation in the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. It is not what we might feel the testator should have done that governs, but what she expressed in her will.</p>

Here is a will which gives to a faithful servant $2,000, and to a son $5,000; then, before the ipk i§ :dry, another paragraph is written which <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>practically wipes out these two gifts, distributing all the available property to another set of persons. Did the testatrix really intend such a thing to happen? If she did, our duty is clear. The language used in the fourth paragraph reads: “As soon as possible after my death I desire my house on Cornell Avenue to be sold, and after all debts are paid the proceeds are to be invested in trust.” We said in Mayer’s Estate, supra, in speaking of a legacy that was called in the will a just debt, that ,the testator did not intend the legacy to rank with his ordinary debts, such as would have a preference in the settlement of the estate, but from the terms of the will, he intended it to have a preferential treatment in a class by itself, so that it might be paid consistent with the terms of the will directing preservation of the estate. This disposition had the effect of creating what might be termed three classes of obligations, (1) ordinary debts, (2) preferred legacies, and (3) other legacies and the residue of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[122,1397,1153,369]]]'>Appellants argue that the intention of the testatrix in regard to the legacies to Ellen Predo and her son, Paul, was that they should be regarded in the light of a debt, to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. It is not necessary to consider that question. We find that the second part of the fourth paragraph controls the disposition of this property.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[123,1778,1151,642]],["BL_514.1",514,[299,352,1147,97]]]'>The testatrix, who wrote-her own will, said: “My furniture and effects can be divided among my heirs, or sold and the proceeds used as above.” “Can be divided among my heirs,” may have relation to the division which she made above, but the words “may be sold and the proceeds used as above” shows the real thought or purpose. She intended that the general proceeds of her property from real and personal estate were to be used as a whole; the latter were to be added to the former and “used as above,” or, as above directed, and, so used or directed, Ellen was to get $2,000, Paul $5,000, and, the balance of all proceeds was to go to the children, <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>named. Thus used, there is an equitable distribution of the estate as intended by the testatrix.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[297,461,1151,360]]]'>The court below was in error in disregarding altogether the last part of the fourth paragraph. It is true, as the learned auditing judge states, that the intent of the testatrix must be gathered from the will itself, but where there is an apparent confusion in results, the court should examine all the will closely to ascertain if that confusion was intended.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[297,849,1151,314]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed and the record remitted so that distribution may be made in accordance with this opinion. The costs of this appeal and the cost in the court below are to be borne by each of the legatees respectively in proportion to the amounts they will receive under that distribution.</p>
