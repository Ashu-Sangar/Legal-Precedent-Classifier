Later, plaintiff, following a suggestion of the court below, amended the statement of claim so that the action was brought in the name of Greene County to the use of the real plaintiff. The claim arose out of a contract made by the county with Samuel Gamble Company for the improvement of State Highway Route No. 109. The contractor failed to pay the use-plaintiff, a materialman, and this action was brought by it against the surety. The use-plaintiff relied on the terms of the bond and the various statutes governing contracts for the improvement of state highways; the court below held, in an opinion by Judge Moore, that the action was properly begun in the name of Greene County for the use of plaintiff, and that, though the use-plaintiff was not a party to it, the bond inured to its benefit. Later, an additional question of law was raised and decided adversely to defendant in an opinion by Judge Drew. We do not pass upon this question. Judgment was entered for the full amount of the claim, and this appeal followed.</p>

If such contracts relate to private property, the promise operates to protect the owner from liability to satisfy liens given by law to workmen and materialmen. The promise is in relief of the promisee, the owner. The law gives no right to lien by laborers and materialmen, where the owner of property in a contract is a municipality, and it may be thought that the promise was primarily for the benefit of these creditors of the contractor. To some extent this is true, but a more important reason exists for a contrary view, — the municipality is vitally interested in the completion of the work according to plans and specifications, and if suit is permitted by materialmen and others, the bond may be exhausted, leaving the municipality without security for an uncompleted job. It is also interested in being protected in the future if it develops the work has not been done according to the plans. An apparently finished job may be handed over, but this does not end a surety’s liability. In road work, the first severe winter may develop inferior workmanship or materials furnished. Unless otherwise provided, the bond must answer for this default. Suretyship is then a continuing obligation unless, the contract otherwise provides. For the breach of covenants in a bond, enforcement is by an action on the bond to recover the penalty; it could not be for the wages or the price of the materials. The amount of recovery is payable, not to the materialmen or the workmen, but to the obligee.</p>

B. sued C. on the promise, and was denied recovery. It is to be noted that property was transferred and the money to come from it was to pay the debt. It may be said that the case holds only that a creditor beneficiary cannot recover.

Moreover, the promisee, though entitled to sue on the promise on ordinary principles of contract, has suffered no pecuniary damages by the failure of the promisor to perform his agreement, and, it would seem, cannot recover substantial damages. Even if it be granted that the wrong of the defendant, not the injury to the plaintiff, furnishes the measure of damages, the beneficiary gains nothing thereby; for it is no easier to find a principle requiring the promisee to hold what he recovers as trustee for the benefiqiary than to find <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>a principle allowing a direct recovery by the beneficiary against the promisor: Williston on Contracts, sec. 357, p. 683.</p>

He is a stranger to the contract, having paid no part of the consideration moving to the promisor. The objections omit consideration of the lack of an enforceable pecuniary interest in the promisee. In all the exceptions to the general rule, there is primarily considered the basic or underlying promise from one to another, to render some service to a third person.

In the case of a donee beneficiary, or where the contract is made for the sole benefit of a third person, there may be recovery only where the consideration for the promise is a transfer of property or money to the promisor, or where unusual circumstances are present. There are several classes of cases, — such as suits against an assignee for the benefit of creditors (Hinds v. Holdship, <a href="/watts/2/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="2 Watts 104" data-case-ids="1840135" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0104-01">supra)</a> or suits by an undisclosed principal on a contract made by his agent (Hubbert v.

As we pointed ont above, that case was decided purely upon the ground of public policy. Furthermore, we cannot agree that the proposition that one not a party to a sealed instrument cannot sue upon it rests entirely upon rules of pleading. Prof. Williston says (see. 401) that “none of the earlier cases which allowed a right of action to one who was not a party to the contract related to contracts under seal, and where statutes have not taken away the importance of the distinction between sealed and parol contracts the rule that one who is not a party to a contract under seal cannot sue upon it is still applied to contracts [either] to benefit or pay a debt to a third person.” In this State, speaking generally, a seal retains its common law force, and we must conclude that the rule remains unchanged.</p>

No question of a state agency is pretended. Appellee’s position presents an extended view of the rights springing from such obligation. We must not only import an unnamed promisee into the bond, but through such promisee enforce plaintiff’s supposed right. It will be noticed the Commonwealth is neither a party to the contract, nor is it an obligee in the bond; nor is there any recital in the bond that it is given for the benefit or protection of the Commonwealth, and the state is relieved of any liability whatsoever on the contract.</p>

A state may create subordinate municipal subdivisions as government entities with limited powers, but, unless otherwise ordained in matters of contract within these powers, they act as independent authority. Laws enacted for the benefit of the one do not embrace the other, nor do they create relations which exist only through contract; the vol<a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>untary act of one performing a service in' which the other may be interested neither brings the one so performing within the acts, nor would such acts create a contract relation.

    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[295,611,1151,1019]]]'>The contract was with the county; it assumed all liability. The Act of 1919 is wholly insufficient to raise any relation between the Commonwealth or the materialmen. &gt; The contract and bond did not do so, and to extend the surety’s liability beyond the limit clearly known to be set by the law when the bond was executed, would be an extension of its language beyond its plain import, and in opposition to all our cases. The acts did not change the common law in this respect. When a statute affects a modification of a rule of the common law, it will be enforced only to the extent of the modification intended. “Legislative enactments are to be expounded as near to the use and reason of the prior law as may be, when this can be done without violation of its obvious meaning; for, say the cases, it is not to be presumed the legislature intended to make any innovation upon the common law, further than the case absolutely requires.” Cadbury v.

The bond in these cases was to the Commonwealth in the terms of section 13 of the State Highways Act of May 31, 1911, P. L. 468. We held that the statute provided for an agreement to pay the workmen and materialmen, and in the bond it was so agreed. It was a statutory obligation. While the name of the materialman was not written in the bond, it was, by force of the act, legislated in with the same effect as in Commonwealth v. National Surety Co., supra. The bond before the Superior Court was in the name of the Commonwealth for the use of Wash<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>ington County, or any other person interested.
