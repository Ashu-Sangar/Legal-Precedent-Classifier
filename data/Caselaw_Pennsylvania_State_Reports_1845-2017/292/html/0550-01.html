The only question raised is, whether that finding is based on any competent evidence. As that must be answered in the affirmative, the appeal fails. Skroki, an apparently well man, thirty-five years of age, was stricken at his work and died the next morning. The physicians, called as witnesses, gave as the cause of his death acute myocarditis, commonly called dilatation of the heart, which frequently results from overexertion. His employment in the mill was that of a shearman’s helper and he was one of three who lifted and carried steel bars weighing two hundred pounds, held them in place while they were cut in two and then carried the halves and placed them on trucks. The day in question (November 15, 1926) was the warmest November 15 in the history of the local weather bureau and in the mill the air was hot and sluggish. Skroki began the day’s work at seven o’clock and had continued about ten hours, working over time, during which he had, as his share of the loads, lifted and carried steel to the weight of over thirty thousand pounds. Late in the afternoon he suddenly became sick and after a rest was helped into an automobile, taken to his home and put in bed. He was air hungry and the doctor, finding him suffering from shock, with pulse and respiration very rapid and temperature subnormal, concluded his death was near. At midnight he became unconscious and died in the morning at seven o’clock.</p>
    <p id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[270,1930,1152,361]]]'>In effect the opinion of the three physicians called by claimant was that Skroki’s death resulted from acute dilatation of the heart caused by overexertion in a hot room. This met the requirement of our most recent cases (see Vorbnoff v. Mesta Machine Co. et al., <a href="/pa/286/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="286 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1096435" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0199-01">286 Pa. 199</a>) and to some extent was corroborated by the physician called for the defendant.</p>
