Said entry, mining, removal, sale and <em>conversion </em>were made by defendant wilfully, intentionally, without the consent of plaintiff, and with knowledge that the coal removed was the property of plaintiff,......that said taking of said coal was unlawful and tortious......said coal when sold was the property of plaintiff and [it]......is entitled to the proceeds received by defendant from the sale thereof.” The statement says nothing about waiving the tort and suing in assumpsit; and while there are minor averments in it, which would not be inappropriate in such an action, taken in its entirety the claim, as declared upon, is one in what was formerly known as trover and conversion, now included in the action of trespass. Under such circumstances, the case would be governed by the Act of May 8,1876, P. L. 142, and plaintiff could recover only upon proof of the value of the coal in place (Oak Ridge Coal Co., Limited, v. Rogers, <a href="/pa/108/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="108 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="539251" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0147-01">108 Pa. 147</a>; Trustees of Kingston v.

The failure to prove this fact is the basis of the judgment below. Plaintiff gives as the reason for its refusal, that such evidence was unnecessary, since the cause of action was intended to be in assumpsit, and it was always so treated by the court and by counsel on both sides. The record bears out the latter contention, and hence it must be likewise so considered by us; for, if objection had been made that the statement averred only an unwaived tort, it could have been amended as of right.</p>

      <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>We are thus brought directly to the point relied on by plaintiff and skilfully argued by its counsel, namely, that it had the right to waive the tort arising from the wrongful taking and conversion (though it had not averred such waiver), and proceed in assumpsit for money had and received to its use; and, since it alleges that the coal was intentionally and tortiously taken, it was entitled to recover, as at common law, the amount defendant received for it, without any allowance for the labor and money expended to bring it to the condition in which it was when sold, although otherwise this would not have been so. Plaintiff’s contention amounts to this, therefore: as it waived a tortious taking, and then based its right on that tortious taking, it may, by thus affirming and disaffirming in the same sentence, recover, because of the tortious taking, an amount which' it says is ten times as great as it would have been entitled to in the case of an unwaived tortious taking. Without stopping to consider whether or not the common law would have sustained such an anomaly, it suffices that, under the circumstances here appearing, the law of this State does not permit it.</p>

L. 326, 332, says the remedy thus provided shall be exclusive. This latter statute declares that “in all cases where a remedy is provided or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by any act or acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth, the directions of such acts shall be strictly pursued, and no penalty shall be inflicted or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law in such cases, further than shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into effect.” It follows that plaintiff’s attempt in this case to obtain a remedy “agreeably to the provisions of the common law” must necessarily fail, since the Act of 1806 limits the remedy to that specified in the Act of 1876: Moyer v. Kirby, 14 S. &amp; R. 162, 164; Chestnut Hill Turnpike Co. v.

Normally, a remedy is a method or means for effecting a cure; which, if applied to the Act of 1876, would indicate the actions of trespass and trover, both of which had existed for centuries before that statute was passed, and hence could not be “additional remedies.” If, however, the phrase means “additional <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>liabilities,” as tbe imposition of double and treble damages shows that it does, then plaintiff’s argument on this point wholly fails, and the expression furnishes another reason for applying the Act of 1806; for the legislature, though presumably knowing of our earlier decisions holding that recovery could be had only for the value of the mineral in place, where such evidence was available, made no attempt to change this as the standard, but only to double or treble that value, in order to provide “additional remedies” for the wrong.</p>
    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[287,874,1153,749]]]'>Plaintiff also argumentatively inquires whether the effect of sustaining the judgment of the court below, as we now do, would not be to strike down, under the circumstances specified in the Act of 1876, the right of an owner to specifically recover, by an action of replevin, his coal, iron or other mineral from a wrongdoer who still had possession of it. This appeal neither raises nor suggests such a question, and we do not care to indulge in obiter dictum. What we decide is, that where any such mineral is tortiously and knowingly mined or dug from the lands of another, without his consent, damages can be recovered only under the Act of 1876, supra, and the value of the coal in place is the standard, where, as here, such evidence is available.</p>
