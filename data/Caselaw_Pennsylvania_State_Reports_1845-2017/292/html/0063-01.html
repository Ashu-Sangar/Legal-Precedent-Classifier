The record discloses the filing of a bill by plaintiffs, who claimed to have entered into an oral agreement of partnership with defendant, averring that funds, paid to the latter to establish a trade in soft drinks, had not been properly expended. It was alleged that part of the money so contributed was deposited by the relator in his own name, and a portion thereof used to purchase real estate and automobiles, to which he had taken title individually. An accounting was asked, as well as an order restraining disposition of the property claimed to be assets of the partnership. The answer set up that plaintiffs had purchased and advanced money in payment of stock in a proposed corporation, for which no charter had as yet been granted, though application therefor was filed, and that the defendant was prepared to turn over to it the property taken in his name, when the company was authorized to proceed. In the meantime the proposed business was conducted by him.</p>

An examination of the only evidence taken fails to establish any fraudulent misconduct by defendant. Before final hearing the parties adjusted their differences, and, by consent, the court entered a decree directing defendant to pay, within ninety days, to the three plaintiffs, specified sums agreed on, each party to pay his own costs. No finding was made as to the accuracy of the charges of wrongdoing, as set forth in the bill filed, nor is there any declaration that the defendant was acting in a fiduciary capacity, and had misappropriated funds belonging to plaintiffs. The order was merely for the payment of moneys which it was averred were contributions to a partnership, but which defendant insisted had been transferred to him in payment of stock in a company to carry on the concern, for which as yet no charter had been granted.</p>

And there is no force in the suggestion made by relator here that imprisonments for such cause have been restrained by our Equity Rule 86, which provides for final process to execute decrees.

But we must not lose sight of the main object of the statute, which was to relieve from imprisonment in all cases where no offense appears except that of omitting to pay money due on a contract.

As was said in Morrison v. Blake, <a href="/pa-super/33/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="33 Pa. Super. 290" data-case-ids="868572" data-case-paths="/pa-super/33/0290-01">33 Pa.

His obligation to perform them arises not from the union of his will with that of another individual like himself, but from the mandate of the law. Hence, such obligation is, strictly speaking, legal rather than contractual, and his refusal to perform may be fairly and properly termed an infraction of a legal duty and not merely a breach of contract.” A trustee who fails to pay over the funds entrusted to his care, is subject to attachment for contempt, as is an executor (Tome’s App., <a href="/pa/50/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="50 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="425143" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0285-01">50 Pa. 285</a>), or guardian: Leiter’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20225" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 225">10 W.

It was there said, where the parties bore a similar relation to that found in the case at bar: “Manifestly the decree is founded upon a contract express or implied between the parties.” Likewise, where defendant was ordered to return certain deeds and pay money due under a violated contract, this court said he could not be committed for failure to pay, using this language: “The only part of [the decree] which remained unperformed, was that which required the payment of the money due on the contract and the costs. For this, and this alone, the relator Avas committed to prison. Where the record shows that the imprisonment is for this purpose alone, and that no other contempt was alleged or adjudicated, the process of imprisonment is void, and may be disregarded, on habeas corpus, as furnishing no sufficient cause of detainer”: Scott v.

The parties voluntarily agreed, before final hearing, to adjust their differences, determining the amount due to each of the plaintiffs, and, by consent, it was decreed that the defendant should pay these respective amounts. There is no adjudication to show that relator was other than a debtor for the sums fixed under the obligation arising from his oral agreement. Though the bill averred misconduct as a partner, the truth of such allegation is not made the basis of the decree, which at most is a direction to account for the sums due under the express contract between the parties, which brings the case within the ruling in Pierce’s Appeal, supra. The defendant was therefore protected from arrest, by the terms of the Act of 1842, for failure to comply with the consentable order directing him to make payment, and was unlawfully committed to the county prison when he became in default. He is, therefore, entitled to present release.</p>

In the original proceeding, that court had jurisdiction of both person and subject-matter, for relator was summoned and appeared to the action, which that tribunal had express statutory authority to hear and determine. So, also, it had jurisdiction over both the person and subject-matter of the proceedings resulting in commitment, for this, in a proper case, is but an incident to the original action. So, too, it had jurisdiction over both the person and subject-matter of relator’s right to a discharge from the commitment, and he, himself, so recognized when he applied for the rule to show cause why it should not be set aside, because of the court’s alleged <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>error in attaching him for contempt of its decree. The jurisdiction below being established, and indeed admitted by the majority, relator’s remedy for any error made is by an appeal from the order of commitment and the refusal to discharge him therefrom; and that course he has taken, the appeal being now pending in this court. Until those orders are reversed they are res adjudicata of every question which was or could have been raised, and public policy forbids further litigation on the points decided: State Hospital for Criminal Insane v. Consolidated Water Supply Co., <a href="/pa/267/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="267 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1057765" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0029-01">267 Pa. 29</a>. We have said that habeas corpus cannot properly be made a substitute for a writ of error: Com. v. Reifsteck, <a href="/pa/271/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="271 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="295703" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0441-01">271 Pa. 441</a>; Scranton v. Peoples Coal Co., <a href="/pa/274/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="274 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="1073024" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0063-01">274 Pa. 63</a>; Haldemann’s Petition, <a href="/pa/276/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="276 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1077704" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0001-01">276 Pa. 1</a>. To me it seems clear that, if ever that doctrine ought to be applied, it should be here. In this day and generation, litigants should know that they cannot rightfully contest the same question over and over again, first in one court and then in another (instead of appealing from the orders' of the first tribunal), and so on indefinitely until all the courts are exhausted, (possibly in more senses than one), and then, mayhap, begin all over again because of their right, in proper cases, to be discharged on habeas corpus. We have said that a relator is not entitled to such a writ in the first instance, merely for the asking; we have never heretofore said that, if it was allowed, as here it was, it must result in relator’s discharge, if we disagree with the view of the law taken by the court below, especially where, as here, that course will violate wise and well settled legal principles, applicable to all proceedings, and which, never more than now, should be steadily adhered to. I would refuse the discharge of relator, leaving him to prosecute his pending appeal, with the right to apply therein for a supersedeas, if he shall be so advised.</p>
