    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[277,734,1154,844]]]'>It is the use of the word “assessment” in conjunction with the time of payment “on or before August 31st” that brings the language of the lease within the rules applicable to the payment of taxes and water rent imposed by the municipality. When these taxes were assessed, they became, under the general law as well as under the law of the lease, due and payable, though they may not be collectible until a later date. August 31st corresponds with the time when a penalty is added by the city for unpaid taxes. It stands for more than that in the lease. It gives the lessor an immediate and effective remedy to enforce collection. Paragraph 7 of the lease provides that, if the rent or any charges therein included as rent shall remain unpaid for five days, then judgment and execution may issue at the suit of the lessor.</p>

The lessee was, therefore, liable, on the principles above stated, for taxes and water rent for the year 1927, unless the lease contemplated apportionment.</p>
