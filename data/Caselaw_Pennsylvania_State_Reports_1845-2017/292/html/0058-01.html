Coffey, plaintiff’s brother. The certificate <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>was issued on December 5, 1890, and the beneficiary named therein was Johanna Coffey, mother of John. She died August 10, 1905, and on the following September 15th John signed a written request for a change of beneficiary, naming the plaintiff as such. This paper was not in form satisfactory to the officers of defendant and it was returned to plaintiff. He did not procure it to be executed by John as requested and did nothing further to have himself correctly designated as the beneficiary. He was not so designated on the books of appellee. With matters in this shape, plaintiff continued to pay assessments and dues on the certificate until May, 1922, when John H. Coffey was suspended from the organization for failure to have reported his whereabouts with his post-office address to defendant in accordance with the requirements of one of its by-laws.</p>

He went first to Kansas and subsequently elsewhere in the west; in 1916 all track of him was lost. In April, 1922, plaintiff advised the record keeper of defendant of the disappearance of his brother and his inability to locate him for more than seven years and asked for blank forms for proof of death. Defeiidant declined to furnish the blank forms or to receive any further dues and notified plaintiff that his brother had been suspended from the society by reason of his disappearance from home for more than one year without making report to it and that the certificate had been declared lapsed and forfeited. The suspension of John H. Coffey was entered on the records of the society on May 15, 1922, and so remained until his death on February 21, 1923. No action was taken by plaintiff or by anyone else after the receipt of the suspension notice and no objection or protest was made to defendant and no effort was made to bring about his reinstatement.</p>
