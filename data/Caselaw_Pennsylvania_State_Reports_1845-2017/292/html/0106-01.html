The interstate character of the occurrence was admitted. Under one of defendant’s tracks at Washington, Penna., there was an ash pit, forty-five feet long, forty-five inches wide and forty-two inches deep. It was open at the top except a third rail for narrow gauge cars, and three metal cross ties. Live ashes, including burning coal, red hot clinkers, cinders, etc., were dumped therein from engines standing over. As the engines moved on the ashes were drenched by means of a hose, then shoveled onto the platform and from there into a car. It was one of Baumgartner’s duties to assist in shoveling the ashes. As he finished this work on the day above stated he lapsed into a semi-unconscious condition, and died some hours later. He was a man thirty years old, in good health, and this case was based on the contention that he was fatally poisoned by carbon monoxide gas, arising from the hot ashes. It is a well known fact by those familiar with the subject that such gas is deadly poison, and is generated, inter alia, by imperfect combustion, especially of coal. Water sprinkled on live coal ashes, sufficient to check but not to fully extinguish the fire, will sometimes cause the poison gas to arise in sufficient quantities, if inhaled, to cause death. Carbon monoxide gas is more dangerous because its presence cannot be detected by sight, taste or smell. When a sufficient quantity is taken into the lungs, it causes death by a destruction of the red blood corpuscles. It was the duty of a coemployee named Bebout to drench the ashes so thoroughly as to fully quench the fire before attempting their removal; but there is evidence that on the occasion in question there was a partial failure to perform this duty and that the ashes, piled to the depth of eighteen inches, were shov<a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>eled while steaming. When engaged in this work Baumgartner’s face was over the ashes, so he naturally inhaled the released gas. He was a common laborer, had been working for defendant ten weeks, but had received no instruction as to the proper performance of the work or of the danger to which he was subjected, and, as far as appears, had no knowledge thereof. The gas in question is a trifle lighter than air and in general when the latter circulates freely it will dissipate the former so as to avoid danger; but, as the pit was located between an embankment and a hill, sometimes the air was not active there. Experiments made by plaintiff’s experts after the occurrence disclosed gas there in fatal quantities, while those made by defendant’s experts did not.</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[304,1109,1153,910]]]'>The suggestion that defendant was ignorant of the fact that burning coal ashes would, under certain conditions, give off carbon monoxide gas is untenable. The evidence contains no such averment and the master is presumed to know the nature and qualities of the materials he places in the hands of his servants. In other words, he is presumed to have such knowledge of matters pertaining to his business as is possessed by those having special acquaintance with the subjects involved. For example, a master placing dynamite in the hands of his servants is bound to know its dangerous character by reason of liability to accidentally explode and his ignorance thereof is no defense.

The proof was to the effect that the undertaker found the arteries of the deceased full of fluid blood (cherry red) which according to some of the experts was a demonstration that carbon monoxide poison caused the death. In addition, there was evidence that the pupils of the eyes were like pin points and that there were blotches about the neck, both corroborative of the same conclusion. Baumgartner’s age and prior health rendered improbable the theory of death from an apoplectic stroke, although carbon monoxide poisoning will sometimes cause a brain lesion, resulting in paralysis. The rule announced in Mudano v. Phila. Rapid Transit Co., <a href="/pa/289/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="289 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="1103281" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0051-01">289 Pa. 51</a>, that a case depending on opinion evidence cannot be established where one of plaintiff’s two experts expresses a favorable opinion and the other an opinion directly to the contrary, has no application here, for there was no substantial conflict among plaintiff’s experts.</p>
    <p id="b151-3" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[128,1475,1153,531]]]'>There was no such glaring contradictions in the testimony of any witness as to render a finding thereon a mere guess. Furthermore, the case did not depend on the evidence of any one witness. Appellant’s searching analysis of the evidence for plaintiff went to its credibility, but that was for the jury. We cannot set aside a verdict because of doubt as to the credibility of oral testimony. The only error assigned is the trial court’s refusal to enter judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto, and that cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b151-4" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[176,2017,527,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
