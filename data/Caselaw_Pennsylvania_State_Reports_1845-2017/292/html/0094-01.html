Murphy when in their unanimous judgment and conclusion they may have deemed and considered my said son competent and able to carry on and make a success of my said business, the said business in no event, however, to be turned over to my said son until after he has arrived at the age of twenty-five years. The profits derived from carrying on said business to be divided among my family as follows: One-fifth of said profits to be paid to my beloved wife Jane M. Murphy. One-fifth of said profits to be paid to my daughter Elizabeth R. Smith. One-fifth of said profits to be paid to my daughter Mary O. Wilson. One-fifth of said profits to be paid to my daughter Anna C. Murphy. The remaining one-fifth to be added to the trust hereinafter provided for my son Matthew J. Murphy.” This son died without issue on June 9, 1923.</p>

Murphy, administratrix of the estate of Matthew J. Murphy, deceased, claimed, in accordance with what she contends to be the proper construction of the will, that the business disposed of in the above-quoted excerpt should be awarded to her, on the ground that her decedent had an absolute right to or ownership of such business and the trustees under the will of his father should have “turned it over” to him when he arrived at the age of twenty-five, which he attained on October 15, 1921.</p>

The direction to carry on the business is coupled with the direction to divide the profits and is merely the means to the end. If the testator meant to give it to his son he would have said so, and to ‘turn it over’ in this connection cannot have such a meaning......The testimony showed clearly enough......that the trustees did not exercise their discretion in favor of Matthew and could not have done so, in view of Matthew’s dissolute and profligate conduct. It is not necessary to repeat the uncontradicted testimony which showed that Matthew was entirely unable to carry on the business and make a success of it.”</p>
