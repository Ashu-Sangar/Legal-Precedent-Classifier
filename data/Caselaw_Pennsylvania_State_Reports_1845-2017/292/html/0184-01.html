    <p id="b225-3" data-blocks='[["BL_225.6",225,[153,403,1154,1235]]]'>One member of a partnership filed a bill in equity against the other, praying a winding up of the affairs of the firm and an accounting. This resulted in the appointment of a receiver, whose account, when filed, included moneys obtained from the sale of personalty belonging to the partnership, and of realty, which stood in the name of the partners as tenants in common. The latter sale was made by virtue of a consent decree, which provided that it should be without prejudice; the rights of all parties interested therein to be determined on the.settlement of the receiver’s account. By the final decree on the account, all the partnership creditors, and certain judgment creditors of the individual partners, were paid, and the balance of the fund for distribution was divided between the partners themselves. Three questions are raised on this appeal, which is taken by the defendant partner: (1) Was Charles B. Rosenberger, who is a judgment creditor of plaintiff, entitled to share in the distribution; (2) Was plaintiff entitled to any award in his favor; and (3) Should the court below have stated an account between the partners, and entered a decree in favor of appellant for the amount thus ascertained to be due to him?</p>

While a long line of cases holds that real estate, standing in the name of the partners as tenants in' common, may, as between them, be shown to be partnership property, it is equally well settled that the rights of bona fide purchasers and lien creditors of the individual partners must be determined solely by the record title to the realty. Appellant admits this to be the true rule, but claims it ceased to be applicable when the receiver was appointed and took possession of the realty; and hence, he says, appellee never acquired a lien, because his judgment was not entered of record until after that time. Though it is more than doubtful whether anything short of a convey<a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>anee, or a duly indexed proceeding showing that a court of record has been asked to reform the deed, or an actual decree of reformation, will affect the rights of a bona fide purchaser or lien creditor of a tenant in common (see Hale v.

Twining be appointed receiver of the within named partnership.” It will be observed that this order does not assert that the real estate was or even might be partnership property; nor, so far as the printed record discloses, is there any such averment in the proceedings leading up to it. Nor is there anything to show that the receiver was authorized to. or did take possession of, or exercise any dominion over, the real estate until after the judgment was entered of record on February 11, 1922, though doubtless he was in possession of the partnership personalty thereon, preparatory to its sale. This, however, raises no presumption that he was in exclusive possession of the realty, as realty. On the contrary, the presumption is that he was not (Shafer’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="106 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="455680" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0049-01">106 Pa. 49</a>), and the fact accords with the presumption. The first time the court, or its receiver, had anything to do with respect to the realty, was after June 2, 1922, when appellant petitioned for a rule to show cause why the receiver should not sell it as firm property, and this resulted in the consent decree, with all rights reserved, as hereinbefore set forth. We therefore hold that the award to the judgment créditor was <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>proper, because it was entered before anything appeared of record affecting his right to have a lien upon plaintiff’s apparent interest as a tenant in common.</p>

After awarding payment of all the firm debts, and the lien claims against the shares of the individual partners in the realty, a balance remained which was directed to be divided pro rata between the partners according to their respective contributions. This was error; it should have been applied first to equalizing the contributions. The partnership articles do not specifically say that the partners are to contribute equally to the carrying on of the business, or to bear the losses equally; nor do they say anything to the contrary. They provide, however, that the profits shall be expended for the benefit of the partners equally, or be divided equally between them. In view of this, the Uniform Partnership Act of March 26, 1915, P. L. 18, determines what are the respective rights and duties of the parties. Section 18 (P. L. 22), provides that “The rights and duties of the partners in relation to the partnership shall be determined, subject to any agreement between them, by the following rules: (a) Each partner ......must contribute towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the partnership, according to his share of the profits.” And section 40 (P. L. 30), prescribes: “(d) The partners shall contribute as provided by section 18 (a) the amount necessary to satisfy the liabilities......(f) Any partner or his legal representative shall have the right to enforce the contributions specified in clause (d) of this paragraph, to the extent of the amount which he has paid in excess of his share of the liability.” It is interesting to note that the duty to thus contribute has long been the law of Pennsylvania: Yohe v. Barnet, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 81" data-case-ids="1854605" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0081-01">3 W. &amp; S. 81</a>; Emerick v.

It follows, from what has been said, that the court below should have enforced that duty, so far as the fund <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>before it was concerned, before it awarded any part thereof to the debtor partner.</p>

Appellant was entitled to such a decree in his favor, if the facts warranted it, though he did not file a crossbill praying an accounting. The general rule that a defendant cannot have affirmative relief unless he files a crossbill, does not apply in matters of accounting: Kelley v. Shay (No. 1), <a href="/pa/206/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="206 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="931690" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0208-01">206 Pa. 208</a>; Findley v.

Perhaps it may not be inappropriate to add that a decree for payment of the amount shown to be due cannot be enforced by attachment of the person of the debtor, but only by execution against his property: Com. ex rel. v. Heston, <a href="/pa/292/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="292 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="1109682" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0063-01">292 Pa. 63</a>.</p>
