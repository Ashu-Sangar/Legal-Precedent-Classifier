Edward C. Brown, owner of the property known as 427 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, did, on November 29, 1922, execute and <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>deliver a $45,000 mortgage thereon to the defendant, which was recorded December 10, 1924. Meantime, on December 3, 1924, Brown executed and delivered a $50,000 mortgage to the plaintiff, on the same premises, which was recorded December 13,1924. The mortgages, taken without notice and for full value, were discharged by a sheriff’s sale of the premises on a prior lien and the question is, which of the two is entitled to the balance of the fund for distribution, — being insufficient to pay either in full.

The case turns on the effect to be given the various recording acts. The first is that of May 28, 1715, 1 Sm. L. 95, 1 Stewart’s Purdon’s Digest 1181, which says: “No deed or mortgage, or defeasible deed in the nature of mortgages, hereafter to be made, shall be good or sufficient to convey or pass any freehold or inheritance, or to grant any estate therein for life or years, unless such deed be acknowledged or proved, and recorded within six months after the date thereof, where such lands lie, as hereinbefore directed for other deeds.” This was supplemented by the Act of March 18, 1775, section 1 of which provides, inter alia, “All deeds and conveyances, which from after the publication hereof, shall be made and executed within this province, of or concerning any lands, tenements or hereditaments, in this province, whereby the same may be in any way affected in law or equity......, shall be recorded in the office for recording of deeds in the county where such lands or hereditaments are lying and being, within six months after the execution of such deeds and conveyances; and every such deed and conveyance that shall at any time after the publication hereof be made and executed, and which shall not be proved and recorded as aforesaid, shall be adjudged fraudulent and void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, unless such deed or conveyance be recorded as afore<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>said, before the proving and recording of the deed or conveyance under which subsequent purchaser or mortgagee shall claim”: 1 Smith’s Laws 422 (and, as amended, see 1 Stewart’s Purdon’s Digest 1173). This was reenacted by the amended Act of May 19, 1893, P. L. 108, which reduces the time for recording deeds and conveyances from six months to ninety days and omits the final clause that, “unless such deed or conveyance be recorded as aforesaid, before the proving and recording of the deed or conveyance under which subsequent purchaser or mortgagee shall claim.” There is also the Act of March 28, 1820 (7 Sm. L. 303, 1 Stewart’s Purdon 1181), relating to the recording of mortgages as follows: “All mortgages, or defeasible deeds in the nature of mortgages, made or to be made or executed for any lands, tenements or hereditaments within this Commonwealth, shall have priority according to the date of recording the same, without regard to the time of making or executing such deeds......And that no mortgage or defeasible deed in the nature of a mortgage, shall be a lien, until such mortgage or defeasible deed shall have been recorded, or left for record as aforesaid”; with a provision excluding therefrom purchase-money mortgages if recorded within sixty days, reduced to thirty days by the amendment of May 28, 1915, P. L. 631. The recording Acts of 1925 and 192T are subsequent to the transaction here in question and need not be considered.</p>

It follows that defendant’s mortgage, not having been recorded for over two years, when plaintiff’s mortgage was executed for value and taken without notice, was as to it fraudulent and void. Plaintiff parted with its money on the faith of the record and was not in default, as its mortgage was recorded within ten days: <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>hence, it is not easy to see how defendant, whose mortgage was void as to plaintiff could reverse the status by getting first on record. The mischief had already resulted from his unwonted delay and the belated effort to secure a preference should not succeed unless plaintiff was also in default, which it was not. Had the latter delayed recording beyond the ninety days, both would have been in default and a different question would be presented.</p>

Pending the appeal therein, the above mentioned amendatory Act of 1893 was introduced in the legislature and, upon final passage, was signed by the Governor eleven days after the case was decided.

    <p id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[290,874,1154,1399]]]'>The contention that the case at bar, involving mortgages, falls within the Act of 1820, whereby the one first of record has priority, is untenable. This statute refers to the liens of mortgages, while that of 1775 and 1893 make unrecorded conveyances fraudulent and void under circumstances therein stated. A statute dealing with the question of liens is not inconsistent with another dealing with the question of fraud. That a mortgage is prima facie a lien, under the Act of 1820, does not preclude the defense that it is fraudulent and void under the Act of 1775, as amended by that of 1893. Where both mortgages were within, or both without, the ninety days stated in the last named statute, the Act of 1820 might be controlling. See Britton’s App., <a href="/pa/45/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="45 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="9502540" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0172-01">45 Pa. 172</a>.

As well stated by the late Judge Arnold, in Davey v.
