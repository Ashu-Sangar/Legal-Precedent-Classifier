Both in his statement of the questions involved (which limits the scope of the appeal: Furman v. Broscious, <a href="/pa/268/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="268 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1061618" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0119-01">268 Pa. 119</a>; Slemba v.

Barber, <a href="/pa/270/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="270 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1066100" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0186-01">270 Pa. 186</a>. It is a matter of no moment, even if it be so, that defendant’s compensation, as sucb employee, was to be measured by a percentage of tbe gross sales or tbe net profits of tbe business, in tbe absence of averment and proof,— and here neither appeared, — that tbe money which paid for tbe property bad, prior to or at tbe time of tbe purchase, been transferred to or set apart for tbe benefit of defendant. Until thus segregated, all tbe firm money belonged to plaintiffs’ father, as sole owner of tbe business. It follows that a resulting trust arose in favor of tbe father (Lynch v. Cox, <a href="/pa/23/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="23 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="974010" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0265-01">23 Pa. 265</a>; Casciola v.

Tbe expression evidently means, I think, that, if there be neither entry nor possession taken by the party, in whose favor tbe trust results, within five years after it accrues, and no acknowledgment in. writing, tbe trust cannot thereafter be asserted in law <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>against the trustee. It means this or nothing, and we may not urge the latter, if the words are susceptible of a definite meaning......Every possession, where there is title, is supposed to be in subordination to it. It is notice of title to all the world, and most clearly so to the trustee. If the statute was intended to bar stale and secret claims against legal titles, as it undoubtedly was, it is wide of that purpose to apply it to cases in which, as between the parties, it is neither; but in a state of execution daily and hourly, as must be the case where possession and enjoyment is in exact accordance with the trust......We think that neither in the words, nor by interpretation, founded on the mischief to be prevented by the statute, is a case within it where the cestui que trust has possession and occupancy during the period in which the statute is running. If the statute had begun to run this would stop it.” To the same effect are McLaughlin v. Fulton, <a href="/pa/104/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="104 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="452212" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0161-01">104 Pa. 161</a>; White v.

But, says defendant, there was .also uncertain testimony by plaintiffs’ own witnesses, as to the time when possession was first taken, and hence the proof fell short of the “clear, precise and unequivocal” evidence required in this class of cases. The evidence which the court below believed, and on which it based its finding of possession duly taken, was of the character required, and hence the fact thus found is conclusive <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>on this appeal, irrespective of objections which might be made to any other evidence. Moreover, on the point now under consideration, that strictness of proof was not required. Everything necessary to be proved in order to establish the fact that the equitable title did not accord with the legal title, as expressed in the deed, had to be shown by evidence of the character stated, for, so far as concerns such matters, the attempt was to write extrinsic trust provisions into a deed which is absolute on its face, and hence the strict rule relating to the alteration of written instruments should be applied. In what we are now considering, no such attempt was made, and no writing was sought to be altered; hence, the reason for the rule not existing, the rule itself is not applicable: cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex.</p>
