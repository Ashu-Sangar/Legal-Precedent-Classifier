    <p id="b361-8" data-blocks='[["BL_361.13",361,[129,1775,1154,587]]]'>John J. Fox, son of plaintiffs, who sue as his administrators, was employed by defendant as a traveling fireman on its locomotives. He was killed in a collision between the fast passenger train on which he was working and two freight engines and caboose, due to the fact that neither the engineer nor the fireman observed, or, if they observed, obeyed the signals which warned them of the danger ahead. The engineer and fireman were also killed in the collision. Damages were recovered by plaintiffs in the court below and this appeal is by defendant from the judgment entered.</p>
    <p id="b362-3" data-blocks='[["BL_362.3",362,[279,353,1154,1508]]]'>
      <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>Appellant argues that the jury was not properly directed to pass upon the deceased’s assumption of the risks of his employment and that the issue of his contributory negligence was not properly submitted. The accident was due to the fact that none of the persons on the locomotive gave heed to the danger signals; if they had the collision would not have occurred. We are convinced that the signals were in working order and properly set, indeed defendant says they were. It follows, therefore, either that the engineer and fireman were not watchful for the signals, as their duty required them to be, or that plaintiffs’ decedent was not, if his duty required him to observe them, which is a disputed point in the case. If it was the decedent’s duty to observe (and we think it was not shown that it was) and he failed to notice them, he was guilty of contributory negligence; but under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (Act of April 22,1908, c. 149, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Stat.%2065" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="35 Stat. 65">35 Stat. 65</a>) this does not defeat the right of recovery. Quoting from the act, “the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee.” Appellants’ challenge of the trial judge’s instructions on the subject of contributory negligence cannot be sustained. We conclude the jury after hearing them must have understood what was required of it in making up the verdict.</p>

The court left it to the jury to say whether decedent assumed the risk and this was as much as defendant was entitled to; the burden of proof as to this was on it: Buehler v. Phila. &amp; Reading Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/280/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="280 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1084505" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0092-01">280 Pa. 92</a>. Far from showing, as required, that decedent was aware of the existence of the unusual and extraordinary speed (Buehler v. Phila. &amp; Reading Ry. Co. supra), our reading of the testimony leads us to the conclusion that Fox must have been engaged in firing the locomotive when the signals were passed, for his body was found between the engine and the tender, from which place he could not see the signals. An employee assumes only the risk of those ordinary dangers that are normally and necessarily incident to his occupation and also those risks and dangers, sometimes characterized as unexpected and extraordinary, that become known to him or are plainly observable: Schlemmer v. Buffalo, Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Ry. Co., <a href="/us/220/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="220 U.S. 590" data-case-ids="3656651" data-case-paths="/us/220/0590-01">220 U.

In the printed rules of the company his duties were laid down as being to instruct the regular firemen in the proper method of firing the locomotive and in the careful handling of fuel, and to instruct engineers, in so far as the pumping and handling of engines effect fuel economy. He was required to demonstrate by actually firing the locomotive how to bring about the desired result and was directed to follow up each fireman and to report whether he was improving. Nothing was said in the printed rules about it being a duty of the traveling fireman to observe signals. There was testimony as to verbal instructions being given by their superiors to other traveling firemen in this regard, but no one said any such verbal rules or commands were given to Fox, hence there was no proof of such <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>duty imposed upon Mm and the argument of Ms violation of it is extraneous.</p>
