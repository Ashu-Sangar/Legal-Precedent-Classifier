    <p id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[287,1161,1154,1074]]]'>The plaintiff, Miller, was injured as a result of a defect in a car coupler while working for the Reading Company, defendant. Admittedly, the railroad was engaged generally in interstate business, but, at the time of the accident, Miller was employed as a brakeman in the Port Richmond yard about a train undertaking intrastate movements. He brought an action to recover for injuries sustained, averring both a violation of the Federal Employers’ Liability and the Safety Appliance Acts. The evidence introduced at the trial failed to disclose an employment in interstate commence, and therefore no recovery could be had by reason of the first cause set up, but the proof established a loss occasioned by failure to comply with the requirements of the federal Act of March 2, 1893, as amended March 2, 1903, in that defective appliances furnished for use resulted in the damage complained of. The liability of defendant, under the circumstances, was submitted to the jury, and a verdict was rendered for plaintiff. From the judgment entered, this appeal is taken.</p>

But the Safety Appliance Act protects intrastate traffic on an interstate highway, such as the defendant in the present instance was engaged in (Sims v. P. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/279/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="279 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="1083624" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0111-01">279 Pa. 111</a>), and this is true though the railroad itself is entirely within the bounds of the state, if it has a connecting point with one passing beyond: McMahan v.

L. 736) furnished a proper and exclusive remedy for all employees sustaining injuries in the course of their service, and to it alone must plaintiff look for redress, as its provisions were impliedly accepted by him, since he failed to dissent in writing from an assumption of obligation thereunder. It is said that the rights of master and servant are now regulated by the legislation referred to, and, where the parties are within its scope when the injury occurs, an award of compensation as therein provided must be held to furnish the only satisfaction obtainable, and an action in trespass will not lie: Liberato v.

He can reject its provisions if deemed wise, and is bound only if he fails to signify an intention to preserve the legal right of action existing as between master and servant.

In passing upon the like question, where the Employers’ Liability Law was involved, it was said by this court: “So long as it remains upon the books, in cases involving accidents happening upon interstate railroads to employees engaged in interstate commerce, such state laws as the compensation acts must be viewed as though nonexistent, — including, of course, all the direct and indirect effects thereof, whether these, when applicable, create contractual relations or otherwise”: O’Donnell v.

Congress has seen fit to provide that certain appliances shall be used by railroads engaged in business between the states, or connected with others furnishing such service, and, for the protection of all, the performance of certain duties is made requisite. Recovery may be had by employees, irrespective of the character of their work at the particular moment of injury, when there has been a violation of the requirements as to the use of safety appliances. These rights of the one injured are not affected by the Workmen’s Compensation Act, for the same underlying reasons which led to the conclusion that the Federal Employers’ Liability Act may notwithstanding be enforced: McMahan v.

In the latter case, it was said: “it is immaterial whether the injured employee was at the moment engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce, because the congressional right that was called into play was the power to prescribe the equipment of interstate carriers for the protection of all persons upon such roads, both employees and travelers, regardless of their participation in interstate commerce. A state legislature, therefore, has no more power to curtail the federal right of an employee than of a traveler....... But our conclusion, which rejects a result that would make the operativeness of the act dependent upon the legislative wills of the several states, and which aligns that act with the Employers’ Liability Act in substantive and procedural effect, is supported by our understanding of Schlemmer v.

The act of Congress gave to the employee rights not granted under state laws, and our courts have frequently sustained proceedings based on the federal statute in question (Sims v. P. R. R. Co., supra, and cases there cited) and the exercise of this jurisdiction has been approved on appeal to the United States Supreme Court: McMahan v. Montour R. R. Co., supra: Pursglove v. Ry., <a href="/pa/285/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="285 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="1095123" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0027-01">285 Pa. 27</a>, certiorari denied, <a href="/us/270/0654-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="270 U.S. 654" data-case-ids="6149588,6149644,6149699,6149761,6149814" data-case-paths="/us/270/0654-01,/us/270/0654-02,/us/270/0654-03,/us/270/0654-04,/us/270/0654-05">270 U.

The state courts must always hold themselves open for the prosecution of civil rights growing out of the laws of the United States: 2 Roberts Federal Liability of Carriers, sec. 877; Claflin v.

Our Workmen’s Compensation Act gave to a board exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings to adjudicate claims of employees, which, by consent, express or implied, it was agreed should be so disposed of, and, as to such cases, jurisdiction of the courts to try and determine is ousted. But as to demands, not arising from the ordinary relation of employer and employee, such as the enforcement of rights fixed by federal statute, their powers remain as if no such state legislation was in force. It follows that there was power below to entertain the present proceeding. No complaint of trial error, or of the verdict rendered is made, and the assignments of error, directed to the jurisdictional questions discussed, are overruled.</p>
