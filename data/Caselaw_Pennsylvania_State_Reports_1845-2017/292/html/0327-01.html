Afterward, before plea filed, Agnes L. Woomer, a weak-minded person, intervened by her guardian, the Pennsylvania Trust Company, as a defendant, she being a sister of Edward Schuldt and claiming an interest in the properties as an heir of Frederick Schuldt. Her claim rested on the theory that Edward had only a life estate and that the will of Frederick, which created this life estate, made no disposition of the reversion; therefore, aside from this life estate, Frederick died intestate as to the property in controversy. Upon instruction from the trial judge, the jury found in favor of plaintiff, but judgment was entered “for defendant,” non obstante veredicto, without, however, specifying which defendant. The court below held that, since plaintiff had failed to show a fee in Edward for the entire estate claimed by her under his will, she had not sustained her case, and, accordingly, judgment should be given against her gen<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>erally.

Bloch, were, by agreement filed of record after the present appeal, substituted in her place as parties defendant and appellees.</p>

The death of Edward has placed all of these questions at issue; and the first point that must be disposed of is the duration of the active trust, that is, whether the words of his father’s will, “and pay ......to my son Edward for the support of himself, wife and children,” continue the trust in favor of the wife and children. If the trust still exists, plaintiff, the widow of Edward, and her children are beneficiaries of the income from the properties in dispute, but she would have no present right to possession and could not maintain an action of ejectment any more than could Edward in his lifetime: Schuldt v. Reading T. Co., <a href="/pa/270/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="270 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="1066011" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0360-01">supra.</a> If, on the other hand, the last words above quoted are to be taken as a mere explanation of the testator’s purpose in making the gift to Edward, then the trust ended at the latter’s death. Usually the words, “for the support of [the donee] and his family,” or “for <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>the support of the donee and her children,” and similar expressions, are regarded as merely explanatory of the object of the devise, not as vesting any interest in the members of the family or the children: Paisley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="70 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1028179" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0153-01">70 Pa. 153</a>, 158; Cox v.

She bases her claim of a fee in Edward on the contention that the gift of the income of the properties to him was, in effect, a gift of the properties themselves. When the will of Frederick Schuldt was before us in Schuldt v. Reading Trust Co., supra, pp. 363, 364, where the same contention was made by Edward, we said what it is now appropriate to repeat: “The trouble with plaintiff’s position is that it fails to take into consideration the language of the gift as a whole; [she] would separate the devise into two parts and discard the second one, whereas each portion of the expression of an entire testamentary idea must be read in connection with its context, in order to ascertain the real intent of the testator (Boies’s Est., <a href="/pa/177/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="177 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="883703" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0190-01">177 Pa. 190</a>, 194-5; Kreb’s Est., <a href="/pa/184/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="184 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="987957" data-case-paths="/pa/184/0222-01">184 Pa. 222</a>; Cooper’s Est., <a href="/pa/150/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="150 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="834374" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0576-01">150 Pa. 576</a>, 583-4), ‘especially is this so when, as in the present case, the prior gift is made in words which in themselves only raise a presumption of a fee’: Sheets’s Est., <a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">52 </a><a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a><a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">Pa. 257</a>, 263-4......Ordinarily, to warrant the implication of a fee from a devise of income, there must be ‘a gift......of the gross rents’ (Deniston v.

The devise was to testator’s wife during life, of the rents and profits of certain property, for her support and the support and education of her children, “under the direction of” testator’s executors. We held (1) that the children of donee had no vested interest; (2) that, aside from the life estate given to his wife, the testator died intestate as to the property in question; and (3) that testator’s children, as his heirs under the intestate law, would come into enjoyment of the property on the death of their mother, the life tenant.</p>

Now, on our former reasoning, we hold that Edward was not given a fee by the will of Frederick Schuldt; his interest thereunder was an equitable life estate, and, aside from the creation of that estate and the trust to support it, so far as the property here involved is concerned, Frederick Schuldt died intestate. In other words, the will of Frederick made no disposition of the property in controversy after the death of Edward, and that event, which occurred in 1925, brought the latter’s life interest and the trust in the hands of the Reading Trust Company upon which it rested, to an end, resulting in an intestacy, which relates back to the time of Frederick’s death: Gorgas’s Est., <a href="/pa/248/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="248 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1011466" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0343-01">248 Pa. 343</a>, 344; Neel’s Est., <a href="/pa/252/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="252 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1021597" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0394-01">252 Pa. 394</a>, 414; see also Gibson’s App., <a href="/pa/108/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="108 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="539274" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0244-01">108 Pa. 244</a>, 246.</p>

Of these three, as already told, the grandchild died without issue and unmarried, before either one of the other two heirs. When the latter died, plaintiff, under their respective wills, became seized of the ultimate interest possessed by Edward, and the four substituted defendants of that possessed by his sister. Thus we see that, while plaintiff does not have the right to recover the entire estate for which she sued, yet she is entitled to an undivided half thereof in fee; the court below should have given judgment accordingly, instead of entering it for defendant n. o. v.</p>
