    <p id="b41-7" data-blocks='[["BL_41.8",41,[150,951,1157,1456]]]'>Alperdt, one of the plaintiffs, was driving his automobile for pleasure north on Parkside Avenue in Philadelphia, being accompanied by his wife, sitting on the'front seat, .with five other members of his family and friends in the rear. When he approached Wynnefield Avenue, his view to the east was unobstructed, and as he slowed his machine almost to a stop on the cross street, he observed the car of Paige, the defendant, traveling down the incline in a westwardly direction. Without looking further he accelerated his speed, and attempted to pass before the approaching automobile. He successfully moved forward to a point where his rear wheels had reached the center of the highway. At this place he again looked and saw the car of defendant thirty feet away. Fearing that a sufficient clearance could not be effected, plaintiff swerved his machine to the left, increasing its momentum, with the result that it ran onto the curb on the northwest comer, striking a tree, and causing the injury complained of. The oncoming automobile did not come in contact with any part of plaintiff’s car, but, seeing the imminence of a collision, Paige swerved to his left, causing the car he was driving to overturn. These actions were brought by husband and wife to recover damages for the loss due to the defendant’s alleged negligence. A nonsuit was entered, which the court refused to remove, and, from the judgment entered, these appeals are taken.</p>

      <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>The right of the driver to recover was denied on the authority of Frank v. Fleet, <a href="/pa-super/87/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="87 Pa. Super. 494" data-case-ids="571090" data-case-paths="/pa-super/87/0494-01">87 Pa. Superior Ct. 494</a>, where similar facts were considered, and a nonsuit entered because of the contributory negligence of plaintiffs. In the present case, Alperdt was driving on the right side of Parkside Avenue. When he came to the intersection of the cross street he saw Paige’s car 80 feet away, moving forward down an incline at thirty miles an hour, or more. He practically came to a standstill at the crossing, then started to advance at 7 or 8 miles an hour, promptly increased to 12. At the time of observation he could have stopped within two feet, and when moving at the greater speed in five or six. Instead of doing so, he went forward without looking out for the automobile advancing from the east until his rear wheels were at the center, a distance of approximately 40 feet, considering the length of the machine, at which time Paige was still 30 feet distant. He then suddenly turned his automobile, causing the injury. Though not struck by defendant, who, in an effort to prevent a collision, upset his own vehicle, yet if the seeming necessity for deflecting his course was due to the negligent conduct of Paige, there could be a recovery, if plaintiff was free from contributory negligence.</p>

This fact did not relieve him from his duty to use reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid a collision, and if it appears there was a failure to exercise common prudence, the consequences must be visited upon him, though the defendant was also negligent: Mehler v. Doyle, <a href="/pa/271/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="271 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="295736" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0492-01">271 Pa. 492</a>; Lewis v.

    <p id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[141,469,1155,1027]]]'>Prior to the Act of 1919 (June 30th, P. L. 678), the rule was that the vehicle first approaching a crossing had the right of way (Simon v. Lit Bros., <a href="/pa/264/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="264 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1048503" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0121-01">264 Pa. 121</a>), and the legislation referred to was intended to govern the contingency of two vehicles arriving simultaneously, in which case the relative duties of the parties are defined. Paige had the right of way, as fixed by the statute, and Alperdt was bound to permit him to pass before “unless [the latter was] so far in advance of the other as to afford reasonable time to clear the crossing and thus, in all probability, avoid a collision”: Weber v. Greenebaum, <a href="/pa/270/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="270 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1066113" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0382-01">270 Pa. 382</a>. The car first reaching the street intersection is not bound to wait until another coming at a right angle has gone by, if there appears to be ample opportunity to cross ahead (Kutz v. Baking Co., <a href="/pa-super/87/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="87 Pa. Super. 297" data-case-ids="571233" data-case-paths="/pa-super/87/0297-01">87 Pa.

A mathematical calculation will show that if the two cars were moving at the respective rates testified to by plaintiff, Paige would have passed the crossing before Alperdt reached it, or at least arrived at the center at the same time. Instead of keeping any watch on the movement of the automobile coming toward him down the hill, he increased his momentum, and failed to look for the defendant until he had traversed 40 feet, and practically crossed its center. It follows that he contributed to the accident, either by failing to continue to observe, or by testing what was apparently an obvious danger in recklessly advancing when he knew defendant was approaching rapidly from the right. He cannot, therefore, recover, and a compulsory nonsuit was properly entered <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>as to him. A different question presents itself as to the wife, who was sitting on the front seat of the car with her husband, and was injured <em>by </em>its striking the tree, when driven to the left across the curb at the corner.</p>

C. L. 151. This general rule has been applied where they were joint occupants of an automobile involved in an accident, as has been decided in practically all of the states where the question has been considered (see note <a href="/citations/?q=48%20A.L.R.%201077" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="48 A.L.R. 1077">48 A.

To charge with contributory negligence on the ground that the party injured was engaged in a joint undertaking, something more must be shown than that the parties were riding together. It must further appear that the passenger had some voice in the control of the vehicle, so as to make it subject to common command, as well as possession: Hoffman v. P. &amp; L. E. R. R.

If, however, the facts show without dispute a want of care under the circumstances, a nonsuit is properly entered. In the present case, Mrs. Alperdt was on the front seat, when the car, in which she was riding, practically stopped at the intersection. At that time, she testified to seeing the defendant’s car a short distance away rapidly approaching down the incline. Notwithstanding, she permitted, without protest, the car to be driven forward in violation of the legislative rules of the road, and at no time thereafter even looked toward the oncoming auto, until the rear wheels of the machine in which she was riding were at the center of the street. Had there been ignorance of the surroundings or danger, she would be excused for not complaining, as she had ample opportunity to do, against a further movement forward, which she must have seen was necessary if danger of injury was to be avoided. Instead, she impliedly consented to the driver’s proceeding, thus joining in the risk of making the crossing in advance of defendant’s car, legally possessed of the right of way. The undisputed facts lead inevitably to the conclusion that she failed to exercise the care to be expected of ordinarily prudent persons, and, therefore, cannot recover.</p>
