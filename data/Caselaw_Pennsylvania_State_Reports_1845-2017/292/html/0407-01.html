The will further provides: “All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, and property, real, personal and mixed, and wheresoever situate or being, of which I shall [die] seized or possessed, including all indebtedness due from [and] payable by my son, George T.

It is perfectly competent for a donor or testator to creat a valid spendthrift trust so as to protect the trust property from the creditors of the donee or legatee. In the language of Mr. Justice Sterrett, in Mehaffey’s Est., <a href="/pa/139/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="139 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="11251383" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0276-01">139 Pa. 276</a>, 281: “It is well settled by an unbroken line of cases, commencing with Fisher v.

(No. 1), <a href="/pa/223/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="223 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="961012" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0228-01">223 Pa. 228</a>; Thackara v.

As stated by Judge Rice, in Shoup’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/31/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="31 Pa. Super. 162" data-case-ids="864451" data-case-paths="/pa-super/31/0162-01">31 Pa.

While the will or deed often expressly exempts the trust fund from the claims of the creditors of the beneficiary, yet any language which calls for that conclusion is sufficient. In the instant case, however, the will contains no suggestion that the trust fund shall be exempt from the beneficiary’s creditors or that he had any creditors, except the testatrix, or that he was improvident. The trust created by the will is alike for the three children and the testatrix shows especial confidence in the son George T., by providing for his approval of the sale of real estate.</p>

There a father was making provision for an insolvent son, who had made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and the language of the will, read in the light of the attending circumstances, was held sufficient to indicate an intent to protect the fund from the claims of creditors. It has been regarded as an extreme case. See Winthrop Co. v. Clinton, <a href="/pa/196/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="196 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="916837" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0472-01">196 Pa. 472</a>, 477; Kunkel v.

In the latter case, Judge Bicm says: “Even in that extreme case there were circumstances, partly disclosed by the will itself, tending to show the motive of the testator, and the purpose he had in view in putting the gift of the income to his son Moses in trust, and the consideration of these circumstances turned the scale in favor of the construction which would accomplish that purpose.” The Stambaugh Case cannot be construed as indicating that a spendthrift trust can be created without language in the instrument fairly justifying the conclusion that such was the donor’s or testator’s intent.</p>
