      <em>1. </em>Where, on the trial of. a negligence case, counsel for plaintiff states to the jury “for a long period the Supreme Court of this State has not set aside a verdict on the ground that it was excessive,” the trial judge commits reversible error if he refuses a request to withdraw a juror, or fails to warn the jury to pay no heed to the statement.</p>

This request was refused, the judge saying, “The law in the case will be given to the jury by the court, and you [the jury] will follow the court’s instructions as to the law.” The trial judge, however, gave no instructions to the jurors concerning the above quoted improper remarks, nor did he, either then or afterward, warn them to ignore counsel’s suggestion that they might with entire safety give an excessive verdict to the injured plaintiff. Such an intimation was an inexcusable breach of professional conduct, plainly calculated to mislead the jury to the prejudice of defendant; it should have met with a prompt rebuke from the court, and the withdrawal of a juror, or, at least, with a strong warning to the jury that they must pay no heed to such remarks; but neither of these courses was pursued. Moreover, the remarks objected to are not only wrong in law, but the statement that the Supreme Court had not “for a long period” set aside an excessive verdict is also incorrect in point of fact, for, within the last few years, this court, in Gail v. Phila., <a href="/pa/273/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="273 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1070791" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0275-01">273 Pa. 275</a>, 281, and Goldman v.
