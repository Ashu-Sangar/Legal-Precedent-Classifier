Prior to the beginning of the tax year 1894 it had issued 160,00.0 shares of capital stock of the par value of $50.00 each, on which part of the par value had been paid, leaving them subject to calls for the balance due. At various times during the tax year additional amounts were paid in on 159,153 of these shares until $25.00 in all had been paid oh each share. No more than $6.25 per share has ever been paid on the remaining 847 shares. On September 13, 1894, defendant issued to its stockholders, in proportion to their ownership of shares at that date, 39,910 additional shares of the par value of $50.00 each, on which the stockholders paid in $25.00 per share, receiving certificates showing that the shares were subject to calls for the additional $25.00.</p>

In December, 1894, defendant’s president and treasurer, having first taken the oath prescribed by law, made a report to the auditor general, which stated, inter alia, that defendant’s total authorized capital stock was $10,000,000, divided into 200,000 shares of the par value of $50.00 each, and that 199,910 shares had been issued, on 199,063 of which $25.00 each had been paid, and on the remaining 847 shares $6.25 each. They also reported that the amount of capital so paid in, which was taxable for the tax year 1894, was $3,113,667.97. That the gross earnings during the year were $247,813.89, all of which had been expended in payment of rents, salaries, necessary repairs and interest accrued during the year, leaving no net earnings; and that the average price of sales of stock during the year was $41.37i-, and that defendant owned shares of stock in other corporations, which paid the tax upon their respective capital stocks, $4,992,827; and they accompanied this report with an appraisement in which they stated as follows: “We have estimated and appraised the average capital stock of said company at its actual value in cash as follows, viz : shares at ' dollars and cents per share, amounting in the whole to $5,150,953.35.”</p>

This appraisement was not made by estimating the shares which had been issued at their actual value in cash, but assuming that shares on which $25.00 had been paid were shown by the average price at which they had sold for during the year to be worth $41.37j-, the amount of the appraisement was fixed at a sum which bore the same proportion to $3,113,667.97 — which <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>was assumed to bo tbe average amount taxable during tbe year —that $41.37 bears to $25.00, the amount thus arrived at being $5,150,953.35.</p>

The auditor general accepted this report and appraisement and settled an account June 18, 1895, for tax thereon, deducting the value of the shares of the capital stock of other corporations upon which the taxes were paid by those corporations, and charged defendant with a tax at the rate of five mills on $158,126.35, amounting to $790.63, which was paid by defendant.</p>

Afterwards, on April 26, 1896, believing that the former account was settled on an erroneous basis owing to the wrong principle on which the report and appraisement had been made, the auditor general resettled the account against defendant, charging it with a tax on 199,063 shares at the rate of $56.75 per share, that being the highest price of sales of stock between the 1st and 15th days of November, 1894, amounting to $11,296,825, and on 847 shares at $50.00 per share, amounting to $42,350, the total being $11,339,175, which, after there was deducted therefrom $4,992,827, the value of shares of other companies, left taxable $6,346,348, the tax upon which at the rate of five mills amounting to $31,731.74, upon which defendant was entitled to a credit of $790.63, for tax already paid, which the auditor general no doubt inadvertently failed to allow.

The testimony produced at the trial, includes a certificate of certain computations made by agreement of the parties by an officer of the Commonwealth Guarantee, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, of Harrisburg, which states, inter alia, “ If the average is to be obtained by multiplying the number of shares sold in each transaction, by the price of said transaction, adding together the number of shares and also tbe total proceeds of all tbe sales at the exchange, tbe result thus obtained shows the total number of shares sold from November 6, 1893, to November 3,1894, to have been 325,442, and the aggregate of all sales at tbe stock exchange to have been $16,441,114.27. This aggregate, divided by the number of shares sold, shows a result of $50.52 per share.” There were, as we already show, 39,910 shares distributed by tbe company to its shareholders at $25.00 per share, but as this was a distribution and not a sale, and as <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>tbe evidence shows that the shares at the time this distribution was made were of much greater value than $25.00 each, we do not think these ought to enter into the computation, and we therefore find that the value of each share between the 1st and 15th of November, 1894, was $50.52.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[292,685,1171,1475]]]'>We think the- report and appraisement made by defendant’s president and treasurer was made on a wrong basis and resulted in an incorrect settlement by the accounting officers. After reporting the number of shares of stock issued, if all were not issued before the beginning of the tax year; and an apportionment of the tax was asked for on this account, the report should have shown the date during the year when the additional shares were issued. This it did not do, but instead it gave the dates when the several instalments upon the shares were paid during the year, which was of no consequence, as whatever influence this could have upon the appraisement was involved in the selling price of the shares from time to time from which the average price during the year was obtained. And in making the appraisement the president and treasurer did not appraise the stock at so much per share, but appraised the average amount of the money paid in. This was incorrect and misleading, and the settlement made on the basis of this appraisement did inr justice to the commonwealth. The accounting officers were therefore well within the limit of their authority and duty in resettling the account, as this was done within a year from the date of the first settlement. But in this resettlement the tax should have been apportioned on the appraised value of the 89,910 shares for the portion of the -tax year remaining at the date of its issue, and the appraised value of the shares should have b.een fixed at $50.52 per share, instead of $57.75. And as there were no sales of the 847 shares on which only $6.25 had been paid and no evidence was given of their value, we think it equitable to appraise them- at that amount, We therefore reach the following :</p>

From that judgment the defendant appealed to this Court, and assigned fifteen errors, some of which relate to findings of fact and others to conclusions of law. The learned court’s findings of fact, conclusions of law and rulings on defendant’s exceptions — of which the judgment is predicated — are fully set forth in the record, and need not be recited here. Our consideration of these and other portions of the record, in connection with the specifications of error, has satisfied us that the judgment should not be reversed or modified. We find no error in any of the findings of fact, or in the legal conclusions drawn therefrom by the learned president of the common pleas; nor do we think that any of the questions presented by the record require further notice than has been taken of them by him. We therefore affirm the judgment on his findings of fact and conclusions drawn therefrom, as set forth in his opinion, etc., sent up with the record.</p>
