The suit is on a note ; the note is under seal, and is dated September 27, 1878, payable in six months after the date thereof, and signed, as alleged by the plaintiff, by Henry Snyder, whose executor is the defendant in this action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b201-8" data-blocks='[["BL_201.8",201,[200,1296,1180,1126]],["BL_202.1",202,[268,379,1197,2050]],["BL_203.1",203,[241,350,1171,97]]]'>The plaintiff, in order to make out his case, calls several witnesses ; four witnesses are called upon the question, and the only question of fact involved in the case ; three of these had a personal acquaintance with Henry Snyder in his lifetime. They testify that they were familiar with his hand-writing; that they had acquired familiarity with his signature by having business transactions with him and by seeing him write; and these three witnesses all testify that in their opinion this is the genuine signature of Henry Snyder. In addition to this, the plaintiff calls one J. B. Flack, who is an expert in handwriting. After an examination of this paper and after a comparison of it with admittedly genuine signatures, he testifies thatfinhis opinion this signature - is genuine and not forged. After the introduction of this testimony, the plaintiff offers the note, whichfis admitted in evidence. In answer thereto, there is no testimony on the part of the defendant expressing an opinion different from the opinion given by the witnesses on behalf of the plain-’ tiff. There are admitted, however, a number of papers bearing the signature of Henry Snyder; these are admittedly genuine ; a great many have been offered on behalf of the plaintiff, and a great many others, being checks, we believe, are offered on behalf of the defendant. These all contain the genuine signa<a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>ture of Henry Snyder, according to the admission of both parties ; and being admitted in the case they are also for your consideration in connection with the other testimony which you have heard; and it is for you to take into consideration the evidence that bears upon this question and take into consideration and make a comparison of this paper in suit with tbe admittedly genuine signatures of Henry Snyder, and then to • determine whether or not this is genuine. The defendant, as we have said, in answer to this, calls no witnesses to give any opinion; neither those who are familiar by long acquaintance or association with Snyder, nor any experts to give an opinion as to the genuineness of this signature. The defense is that there is presumption of payment. The law fixes the period of twenty years where a presumption of payment arises about an ■instrument such as this. After a period of twenty years there could be no recovery. Sometimes, however, a presumption of ■payment arises in a less period than twenty years; as, for instance, if it were shown that the plaintiff was in needy cireum- ■ stances, and that the defendant was abundantly able to pay, 'the inference would naturally arise from such circumstances that some demand or effort to collect the note would have been ■ made at a much earlier period than within sixteen years, which is about the time that elapsed before this suit was instituted. ' But there is no evidence in this case to show any circumstances that would justify' any such inference. There is some evidence ' which was introduced to show the receipt of money, or the pay- ■ melit of money by D. C. George to Henry Snyder, but this stand- • ing alone proves nothing; it does not establish the fact that Henry Snyder is a man of abundant means, and even if it did ■ establish that fact, standing alone it would prove nothing that ■would raise the presumption that this instrument was paid. ■ This is about all that is in the case. [There is a single, simple proposition for your determination, and that is whether this is the genuine signature of Henry Snyder. If so, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the face of the note, with interest thereon from September 27, 1878. In determining that question,-you • must have recourse to the evidence which you have heard, and after carefully reviewing it decide that'question. If you decide ■ that it is the genuine signature of Henry Snyder, find a verdict -for plaintiff for the amount of his claim.] [1] If the signature <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>is not tbe genuine signature of Henry Snyder your vercLct ought to be for the defendant.</p>
