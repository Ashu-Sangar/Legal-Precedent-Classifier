The Ohio Valley Gas Co. paid the rental for three months, but then ceased, and no more was paid. The contention of the defendant is : first, that the lessee had an option to sink a well or pay the monthly rental, or to do neither, and by refusing to do either the lease was at an end, and they were relieved from further liability, and second, in any event there is no joint liability of the defendant. On the first contention it is sufficient to say, that, in McMillan v. Philadelphia Co., <a href="/pa/159/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="159 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="850160" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0142-01">159 Pa. 142</a>, on a lease with a clause precisely similar to this, the Supreme Court held the lessee was not relieved from liability, even when he had tendered, back the lease, which .was not done in this case.</p>

We cannot sustain that contention. The assignment is a sale of the one half undivided interest in the lease. The two parties then became joint owners of the lease, and jointly liable to sink the <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>well or pay the monthly rental. In the statement of claim by the plaintiff it is stated that the lease was assigned by O’Hara to the Ohio Valley Gas Co. which implies that O’Hara had parted with all his interest in the lease. Were that the fact there could not be a joint action. The same general statement is made in the affidavit of defense. But the assignment, made part of the affidavit of defense, shows that it was only a one half undivided interest that was assigned. In view of these facts, and in order to have the case decided upon its merits, the plaintiff is allowed to amend the statement so as to set forth the assignment as it actually was.</p>
