    <p class="summary" id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[260,448,1173,606]]]'>The same day a number of the creditors entered into an agreement by which they employed the assignee to take charge of the plant and continue the business, and provided for the gradual payment, out of the earnings, of all the liabilities. A few months of this experiment demonstrated that the business could not be successfully operated, and the project was abandoned. The assignee then procured an order to sell the premises, and disposed of them. Distribution of the proceeds was made by the auditor, and exceptions to his report are now pressed, because he permitted the Weld judgment to participate in the fund, and because he did not allow the labor claims held by Josiah Boyts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[255,1063,1173,1065]]]'>In the first place, it was argued that all the assets must be regarded as personalty, and that no lien had been acquired by the judgments. Sec. 1 of the Supplemental Act of June 25, 1885, P. L. 182, amending sec. 4 of the original act, says, “ interest in such partnership associations shall be personal estate,” etc., but that provision was intended only for the control of the interests of partners as between themselves, in the management of the affairs of the concern, and for the convenient transfer of such interests while the partnership continues. It was not meant to exempt the real estate of the association from the effect of a lien on the ordinary incumbrance held by an outside person. So that the position of the auditor, supported by him on the authority of Moore v. Moore, <a href="/pa/158/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="158 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="848272" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0495-01">158 Pa. 495</a>, is correct. But the general rule is that “ land held by a partnership is considered as realty so far as firm judgments are concerned; and they are liens upon <em>it; </em>but as the separate interests of partners in it are considered as personalty, judgments against them, individually, are not liens upon it or upon those interests: ” 8 Trickett’s Law of Liens in Pa. 276. And the face of the title must govern as to whether land held by members of a partnership shall be regarded as firm property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b118-6" data-blocks='[["BL_118.6",118,[256,2137,1168,249]],["BL_119.1",119,[206,370,1169,2037]],["BL_120.1",120,[286,372,1173,1121]]]'>The lease in the present case -was not to the firm, but to Boyts and his two associates as tenants in common. The separate two-fifths interest of Boyts might therefore be bound by the Weld judgment. But it is further objected that the land on which the works were afterwards erected was not designated in <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>the lease with sufficient certainty to sustain a decree for specific performance, and hence no lien could attach to his equity therein. While the exact lines were not ascertained at the time, yet the description above quoted would seem to be sufficient to support an order for its conveyance. The judgment was taken for what was really a partnership debt, but was against Boyts alone, and so bound only his interest in law, as it purported to do in fact. The interest of Boyts was a mere equity arising on articles of agreement for the purchase of the small piece of ground, in connection with the lease, but the rule is so well settled by the cases cited to us, and many others, and so thoroughly understood by the profession to be, that a judgment binds every interest or estate which a defendant has in land, including a mere inceptive title, and that the lien on the equity grasps the legal title into which the equitable becomes perfected by a subsequent conveyance, that it barely needs repetition. But see Waters’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Pa.%20524" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="35 Pa. 524">35 Pa. 524</a>, Holmes’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Pa.%2027" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="108 Pa. 27">108 Pa. 27</a>, Zeigler’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Pa.%20473" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="69 Pa. 473">69 Pa. 473</a>, and cases there cited and considered. If no lien existed prior to the conveyance from Weld to the firm, April 27,1891, there was, I think, an express lien established in the face of the title, by the deed of that date. In Iliester v. Green, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Pa.%20101" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="48 Pa. 101">48 Pa. 101</a>, it is said, “ the sum of the authorities is, that though equitable liens are not favored by our law, yet parties may, by clear and express words in a deed of conveyance, create liens upon land, .... which will be binding between themselves and their privies, and such liens will be divested by subsequent sheriff’s sales,” etc. Such a lien is not, of course, to be left to legal implication. The intention to create it must clearly appear, but the language used in the deed from Weld to this partnership association says, “subject to the following conditions, thirdly, that the North Savage Fire Brick Company, Limited, .... shall and do acknowledge that the amount of a certain judgment, (reciting it fully,) exists against four-tenths of everthing conveyed in this deed and in the lease aforesaid.” Language substantially like this was held sufficient to create a lien by deed in Brownback v. Ozias, <a href="/pa/117/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="117 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="555844" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0087-01">117 Pa. 87</a>; Myers v.

The intention to fix the lien of the Weld judgment on the property to the extent mentioned is too clear for doubt. It is contended on behalf of <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>Josiah Boyts that “the three papers referred to, (the lease, judgment note and deed,) constitute a lease of ground, and any interest that Weld had in the same was not disturbed by the assignment and <em>sale; </em>” and also, “ that if Weld had a lien, it is in the nature of a defeasance, runs with the land and was not disturbed.” The cases of Blood v. Crew Levick Co., <a href="/pa/171/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="171 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="985596" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0328-01">171 Pa. 328</a>, aiid Ringrose v.

In the first case mentioned the vendor had giAren a mortgage, which incumbered the land at the time of the conveyance, and in the deed stipulated that it was “ under and subject to the payment ” thereof. This was held to involve an implied covenant on the part of the vendee to indemnify the vendor against the payment of the mortgage, should he be required to pay it. That principle does not arise here. In the latter case the deed embraced an agreement for the future support, during life, of the parents of the vendee, with the annual payment to each of them of the sum of $25.00 during their natural lives. This was held to create a charge upon the land, which would follow it into the hands of a subsequent purchaser at private or judicial sale.'</p>

The personal estate was <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>first liable for all debts, including labor claims. But Boyts and some others of the creditors entered into an agreement to continue the business. They did so at a loss, and disposed of most of the personal effects during that time. It is, however, further found by the auditor that these claims were not, in fact, purchased by him in the first instance, but that his money was merely loaned on the credit of the firm to aid in settling with its men, and was charged to it on his books at the time. We are not prepared to say that this finding is not sustained by the evidence. Noarly all the testimony on the subject is from the claimant himself. On page 42 he says the claims were assigned to him “ for a valuable consideration.” On page 53 he says, “ in my account I have charged the company with the claims I have put in for labor, all of which are named in the list marked ‘ A.’ My orders for the labor claims were taken after my entries in this book against the N. S. F. B. Co., Limited.”</p>

On page 56, “ the first item of $464.78 was made at the time the company and I had a settlement, January 5, 1892. Bills were made by me against the company of these individual claims up to August 20, 1892, then it was settled up to October.” He was conducting a store a.t the company’s works, in the same building in which it had its office. If it was originally a loan to the firm, at a time when he still believed it solvent, and not for the purchase of the claims, and if he did not then mean to succeed to the statutory rights of the laborers, as the auditor concludes, he could not afterwards protect himself by the assignments.</p>
