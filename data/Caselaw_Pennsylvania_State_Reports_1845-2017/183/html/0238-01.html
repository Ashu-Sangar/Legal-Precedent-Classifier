We think this case is clearly within the principles of Hiester v. Yerger, <a href="/pa/166/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="166 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="864208" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0445-01">166 Pa. 445</a>, and the cases upon which it was ruled. By devise of rents, profits and income of lands, the corpus of the estate passes: Silknitter’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/45/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="45 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="9503015" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0365-01">45 Pa. 365</a>; Wilson v.

Wilde, <a href="/pa/63/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="63 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1018991" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0170-01">63 Pa. 170</a>; Dale v.

The fact that the gift was charged with the payment of debts and other expenses would not tend to lessen the estate, but rather to enlarge it. Such a charge was held to indicate an intention to grant a fee simple <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>without words of inheritance, before the passage of the act of April 8, 1833, sec. 9, giving such an effect to a general devise. No other person is, or can become interested in the income of this estate, and the amount to be expended, except for payment of debts, is left to the discretion of the devisee. There can be no doubt that the plaintiff took a life estate in the lots mentioned. In this case there is no devise over. There is no devise of the remainder at all. It is simply provided that at the death of the life tenant “ the same shall descend to his heirs.” Not only as to the persons to take, but as to the mode of taking, the words are strictly technical.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[264,899,1167,899]]]'>Technical words, or words of a definite meaning in a will, must be construed according to their legal or definite effect, unless from other inconsistent words in the will it be clear that the testator intended to use them in some other definite sense: Carroll v. Burns, <a href="/pa/108/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="108 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="539243" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0386-01">108 Pa. 386</a>. In most of the cases in which the question has been considered there was a specific devise to heirs and in many of them qualifying words, as in Criswell’s App., <a href="/pa/41/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="41 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="480073" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0288-01">41 Pa. 288</a>, “ to their heirs jointly, to such of them as be then living; ” in App. of Cockiiis and Harper, <a href="/pa/111/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="111 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="545433" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0026-01">111 Pa. 26</a>, “ in equal amounts to all heirs living at the time of their deaths; ” in Hiester v. Yerger, <a href="/pa/166/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="166 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="864208" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0445-01">166 Pa. 445</a>, “unto his then surviving heirs in fee simple.” In these and many other cases, the rule in Shellej^’s case was held to apply and to create an estate in fee simple, and surely it must be applicable to this case in which the words are unqualified, are purely technical, and have a well defined legal meaning. The rule in Shelley’s case is applicable without regard to the actual intent of the testator. Carroll v. Burns, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Pa.%20294" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="108 Pa. 294">108 Pa. 294</a>.</p>

All her real estate was given to her son, and the personal estate, if any, passed to him under the intestate laws. The only doubt arises from the fact that in the second clause of the will she devised to him one piece of ground in fee simple by apt words. Her purpose in not doing so, as to the residue, is not apparent, but it is probable that she had some undefined notion that it should be held until the debts and the cost of a burial lot and monument were paid out of the income. However this may be, the estate granted is clearly a fee simple estate, which the plaintiff has the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>right to convey, and judgment must be entered in favor of plaintiff on the case stated.</p>
