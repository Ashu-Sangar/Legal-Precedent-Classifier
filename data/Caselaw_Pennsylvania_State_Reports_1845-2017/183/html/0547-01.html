Now, you must take into consideration, in deciding that question, not only what was done on March 5, 1896, (which is the day on which the plaintiffs allege they did these acts and commenced operations) I say you may not only take into consideration what was done at that time, but you can take into consideration the conduct and acts of the parties previous to that time, (and after the lease was executed), and Avhat they may have done after March 5, up to the time suit was brought, and also Avhat they failed, to do, in order to deter<a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>mine the effect that must be given to the acts done on that day. The commencement of operations, or the commencement of anything, of course, might be a very trivial act. It has to be, because everything, be it ever so great, is accomplished by doing little things one after the other, and the commencement of the drilling of a well may be made by doing an act insignificant in itself. The commencement of the buildings for the World’s Exposition, perhaps, tvas the striking of a pick into the ground. But whether any given act is a commencement or not depends on circumstances. So in commencing operations in the drilling of a well, a very little thing may be the commencement, while acts more extended might not be. You must take all the circumstances into consideration, all the surroundings, to determine the character and effect of the act. Now, if the plaintiffs, Adams and Henderson, went upon this lot on March 5, (which was the last of the thirty days) and in good faith staked out a location for a well, showing where they wished to erect their derrick, and ordered lumber and had some of it put upon the lot, with the intention of proceeding with the work on the next day and continuously thereafter to the completion of a well, then locating the well on the ground and driving the stake and hauling the first load of lumber and delivering it upon the lot, in our opinion, would be a commencement.] [3] But the defendants claim here that what was done was not done in good faith; that it was, to use a slang expression, “ a bluff; ” that it was not followed up; that they didn’t do anything between that time and the time this suit was brought, nor between that time and the time the second lease was made; that they abandoned the prosecution of the work. Well now, if that is true, then it was not a commencement to drill a well, — it was simply putting a stake in the ground and putting some lumber there for the purpose of pretending to commence a well, and it would not be a compliance with the terms of the lease. It would be an act that is like and similar to commencing a well, but an act done in bad faith, and would not have the effect that it would have had if it had been followed up and the well completed. [Now, that brings us to another important question in this case. The plaintiffs explain this failure to do more by saying that it was the fault oí Mr. Behling; that they didn’t do anything more, but that they did what was done in good faith, and that <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>the reason that they did not proceed on the morning of March 6, to complete- the derrick and to drill the well, and the reason they did nothing more before the second lease was made and the" defendants went into possession was because Mr. Behling would not let them, but stopped and prevented them from going on and completing the well. Now, gentlemen, if that was so that would' excuse any further performance. If you believe .what has preceded that was done in good faith and the plaintiffs were actually interfered with and prevented from doing more by Mr. Behling, and this before the thirty days were entirely expired, then they would not be responsible for not doing •more. This is an important matter for your consideration.] [4] What transpired there on March 5, when Mr. Reed brought the lumber, and what did the parties do or fail to do at that time, —that is, Mr. Henderson and Mr. Adams? Did Mr. Behling simply talk to these people, as the defendants here argue, about being mistaken as to the lot, and about not putting the lumber there? Was that all that he did? And then did Adams and Henderson take advantage of what he said as an excuse to stop doing anything further ? Did they make what he said an excuse for stopping when realty they wanted to stop ? Was there such opposition on the part of Mr. Behling that it was a fair and reasonable thing for- Adams and Henderson to do to abandon the work and not go back there the next morning or have their men go? Were there such things done there as to preArent them going on safely with this enterprise ? If there was, why then it is not in Mr. Behling’s province to say they didn’t go on, — that what they did was not enough to make a commencement. If they did what they did there in good faith, ■intending to follow it up so as to drill the Avell to completion and get the oil and gas which was the primary object of Mr. Behling in making the lease, and they were actually stopped •by Mr. Behling himself before the thirty days were up, then I say that Mr. Behling would not be in a position to set up that they had not gone on and supplemented what they had already done by finishing the well. On the other hand, if they did not put the lumber there in good faith, and merely made an excuse for not going on out of Avhat conversation there was between •Behling and Reed, — made- that an excuse for not going on, and for stopping the further prosecution of the Avork, why then <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>what they did. do would not be a commencement; it would be, as I said before, but a bluff or an attempt to make a display of commencing when they didn’t intend to commence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b571-6" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[173,501,1170,1329]]]'>Now, gentlemen, we intend to leave that question entirely with you, and you will take into consideration these different things that have been testified to here by the witnesses in regard to this transaction, both before and after March 5, 1896, and take into consideration what happened there that day, and what was said in regard to the matter between the parties in interest, and then determine the two'questions; first, was‘this staking out and indicating of the location, — going on the lot to indicate the location at which the well was to be drilled and the placing of the lumber upon the lot, — was that done in good faith with the intention of proceeding the next day with the Avork on to completion? And second, was Mr. Behling responsible for the stopping of the work; did ho so interfere Avith Avhat Avas done there that day as to justify Mr. Henderson and Adams in abandoning it the next morning, or did they take Avhat was done there and Avhat Avas said as an excuse to do what they intended to do already, — simply make an effort at commencement and then stop. N ow, gentlemen, we leave the question Avith you. [If you believe, as I said before, that these men started this work in good faith, intending to follow it up and drill the well to completion, and that they were stopped by Mr. Behling who owned the land, then Mr. Behling would be responsible for their not going on, and they would be entitled to recover; for these defendants, taking under him, and taking only the title they got from him, stand on no higher ground than he would.] [5]</p>

Nothing was done on the premises by the lessees or by their direction, until the 5th of March, that <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>being tlie last day of tlie period allowed by the lease within which to commence operations. On that day Henderson drove a stake near the center of the lot to indicate the location of the proposed well and the point at which the lumber required in the performance of the work called for by the lease should be deposited. In the afternoon of the same day, and while an employee of the lessees was unloading some lumber upon the lot in accordance with their instructions, he was met by the lessor who denied that they had any right to put it there. The ground of the denial was that the time allowed for the commencement of operations expired in the forenoon of that day. The lessor was accompanied by a number of persons who appeared to be in accord with his manifest purpose to prevent the unloading of the lumber upon the lot, or tlie occupancy of it by the lessees or their workmen. The lessor’s insistence that the lumber should not be deposited on the lot resulted in the unloading of the balance of it by the roadside, and in his removal from the lot of the lumber unloaded there. It may be stated in this connection that the stake driven by Henderson as above described had been taken up and carried away by the lessor or some member of his family before any lumber was unloaded upon the lot, and that the lessees were not present when the stake or lumber was removed, or when tlioir employee was forbidden to deposit the lumber where they had directed him to.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[186,1594,1171,400]]]'>The lessees had a clear right to enter and commence operations upon the lot on March 5, and if thejr did so in good faith, and with a purpose to continue the work in accordance with the provisions of the lease, the resistance of the lessor to their occupancy of the lot furnished no warrant for a forfeiture of the lease. This was the view that was taken of the lessor’s action by the learned court below, and which the lessor contests on this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b573-6" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[188,2003,1172,401]],["BL_574.1",574,[233,354,1180,1468]]]'>As the entry of the lessees upon the lot was before the time allowed for the commencement of operations under the lease had expired, it was prima facie at least a lawful entry, and the lessor’s action was apparently an unlawful interference with it. It would seem therefore, that the burden was on him to show conduct on their part which justified his action. But the lessees did not rest their suit for the possession of the lot on a bare presumption. They alleged, and introduced evidence to prove, <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>that their entry was made in good faith, and with a determination-on their part to prosecute with due diligence the work they were authorized by the lease to do. The evidence submitted by them showed the obstructions in the way of an earlier commencement of operations, and the efforts they made to secure the materials, machinery and labor necessary to the proper performance of the work. It also showed that when they commenced operations on the lot they intended and were prepared to continue them, and that their failure to do so was caused by the refusal of the lessor to allow them to proceed. It is true that the defendants introduced evidence inconsistent with and tending to discredit the evidence to which we have referred. But this would not have justified a peremptory instruction from the court to the jury to find for the defendants. Certainly the court could not say that the lessees had forfeited their right under the lease to enter and commence operations upon the lot when they did, or that their entry was a mere bluff, and that they did not intend to comply with the provisions of the lease. Whether they commenced operations in good faith, and whether they intended to proceed with due diligence, were questions for the jury, and so was the question whether their failure to continue them was caused by the action of the lessor. These questions were submitted to the jury in a clear and impartial charge, and the result was a verdict based on a finding of facts in accord with the lessee’s contention. In other words, it is established by a v.erdict authorized by the evidence, that the lessees entered and commenced operations upon the' lot in good faith, and that they were prevented from continuing them by the unlawful interference of their lessor.</p>
