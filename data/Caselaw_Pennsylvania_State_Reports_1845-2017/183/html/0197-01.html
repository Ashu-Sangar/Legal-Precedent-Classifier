In view of the evidence properly before the jury this could not have been done. It presented questions of fact which were properly for their consideration and determination. The case was accordingly submitted to them with instructions of which the defendant is not here complaining, and a verdict for plaintiff was rendered. There is nothing in the record to justify a reversal of the judgment entered on that verdict.</p>
