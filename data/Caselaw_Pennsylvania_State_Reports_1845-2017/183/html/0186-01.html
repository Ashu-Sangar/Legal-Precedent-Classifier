The prayers were for an account and payment to plaintiffs of one half the profits realized from the sale. The answer denied the partnership averred in the bill; averred an arrangement with Frazer and Parkinson, whereby they were to share in the profits of a specific sale to a particular proposed purchaser of two tracts upon which defendant had an option of purchase; the failure to make said sale, and the subsequent arrangement made by defendant with McWilliams, who procured a purchaser for said two tracts in connection with other lands secured by defendant at his own risk and expense, as necessary to the sale; and that plaintiffs had no part in effecting the sale.</p>

      <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>Sométime during July, 1895, W. Y. Parkins.on and W. E. Frazer met together and had a conversation about procuring “ options ” on some coal in the Fourth Pool of the'Monongahela river. It was then agreed between them that Parkinson would look the matter up after he returned from a trip he was then about to make. When he returned he went to Robert Linton, the defendant, who was in the glass business at Bellevernon, and talked to him about coal, and asked if he knew of any that could be bought. Linton said he did, and spoke of coal belonging to McKee, and also other coal. Parkinson told Linton that he had some parties in town who had a purchaser for somé coal. Linton said he thought the coal was optioned, but wasn’t certain. He could look the matter up and let Parkinson know about it. On August 3, 1895, Linton sent Parkinson, who was then in Kittanning, a telegram, saying: “ Have secured option to August 15th.” About August 10, Parkinson arrived at his home in West Elizabeth, and in a day or two received the letters, dated August 10 and August 12 (exhibits “3” and “4”), from Linton. In the first he says:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[256,1354,1169,338]]]'>“ I saw Mr. Phillipps this morning.

Frazer said that it was rather short notice, but he would do the best he could to get the party up there. There was also some figuring done and the prospective profits talked about, but no arrangement made as to what share each should receive. Frazer said he thought lie could get a party to go up the next or following day, and Linton agreed to meet him and show him over the ground. In pursuance of this arrangement Frazer, through H. W. Strickier, got Daniel McWilliams to take the matter in hand, with a view to obtain a purchaser for the coal for which Linton held the option, and which was the subject-matter of the arrangement entered into at the Seventh avenue hotel. Frazer sent word to Linton that McWilliams would be up on the 14th. On the 15th McWilliams went to Bellevernon with a letter of introduction from Frazer to Linton, and there met Linton, and the two went to Brown’s house together, and after an interview with him the option of purchase was extended. After this Frazer seems to have been dropped by defendant out of any actual participation in the subsequent proceedings. It was understood by all the parties to the suit that McWilliams was <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>not himself a proposed purchaser, and that he was only acting as agent for others. On August 16, Parkinson writes to Linton:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[253,507,1170,186]]]'>“ McWilliams has moved out of town and could not learn of his address, but left word for him to meet me at 10 A. M. Will wire you Monday if anything new. I feel confident that we can sell the coal.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[252,713,1169,809]]]'>The negotiations were started through McWilliams, with the cooperation of Parkinson, Frazer and Linton, and by this means the option held by Linton on the Brown land was extended, and ultimately a purchaser secured. It is true that to secure the cooperation of McWilliams, Linton was induced to allow him one half of the profits (see exhibit “16,” dated October 5, 1895), and Parkinson, by his letter of August 19th, to Linton, showed a disposition to turn his back on Frazer. Parkinson and Linton, however, continued for some time thereafter, acting and working together to secure a purchaser for the coal. Parkinson’s last letter on the subject was dated August 30 (exhibit “ 10 ”). After this date Linton and McWilliams conducted the negotiations, entirely ignoring both Frazer and Parkinson, obtained a renewal of option of the Brown and McKee tract, but with terms somewhat different from the original option, and finally a sale was consummated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-7" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[247,1532,1174,401]]]'>It is true, that to accomplish this end, there were changes made in the terms of the original option, and some additional coal optioned or contracted for by Linton and put into the transaction to secure the purchaser represented by McWilliams, and through this means, through the intervention of McWilliams, a sale of the lands was made to a certain Johnson Coal Company, at prices in advance of the prices fixed in the said options, and defendant realized considerable profit therefrom.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-8" data-blocks='[["BL_210.7",210,[244,1942,1173,288]]]'>There is no evidence that Linton, at any time during the negotiations for sale of the coal, notified either Parkinson or Frazer that they were no longer in the transaction, or that he desired or he intended to conduct the transactions upon his sole responsibility, or that they were no longer to be interested in the transaction.</p>

In pursuance of this arrangement the parties began to operate to secure the land contemplated. Frazer, through Strickler, induced McWilliams to go to see the land. Linton meets him, and they go together to Brown, and get an extension of the option. Parkinson is in constant communication with Linton in regard to the matter till August BO. And then it appears that Linton, without communicating the facts to either Frazer or Parkinson, undertook to conduct the business thereafter upon his own responsibility and in his own way, ignoring entirely the rights of Parkinson and Frazer, and with the intention of securing all the profits of the joint enterprise to himself. This, we think, he had no right to do, and that be is, therefore, liable to account to Parkinson and Frazer for one half of the profits of the transaction which he made. It might be for two thirds, but as plaintiffs only claim one half of the net profits in their bill, and Linton avers that the arrangement made at the Seventh avenue hotel, while it differs radically from that alleged by plaintiffs in other respects, was upon the basis of one half of the profits to him and one half to the others, we adjudge that defendant account for only one half of his net profits. We are of the opinion, however, that there is no evidence justifying the conclusion that II. W. Strickler ever was in any sense a partner with defendant, and therefore the bill is dismissed as to him.</p>
