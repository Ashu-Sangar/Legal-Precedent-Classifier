Had examination of the records of this court been made, it would have appeared that the guardian had asked authority to make improvements on certain real estate of his wards to the extent of $5,000, “ with the receipts and revenues arising from the estate of said minors during the current year, together with the funds already in the hands of your petitioner, will afford a sufficient sum of money for to make said improvements,” and that an order had been made on the petition authorizing such improvements.</p>

Renewal notés were given in these instances from time to time, fluctuating in amounts; sometimes increased and sometimes diminished, as shown by the attached schedule, until the loans seem to have been reduced to $2,000. An application was then made for a loan of $20,000, for an alleged purpose, similar to that of the former loan. It was not asked upon the strength of an order, alleged to have been made, authorizing an improvement, but upon an allegation that because similar orders had been made heretofore this court would make another order; and upon the strength of this statement the loan was made; stock of the Merchants and Manufacturers National Bank being substituted for that of the Bank of Pittsburg, as security. The promised order of this court was never made, nor even applications made therefor. Two thousand dollars of the proceeds of this loan went in satisfaction of the balance of the former loans, which the guardian now alleges had gone in fact into the improvement authorized; and $18,000 was invested by the guardian in a private corporation, of winch he was the president.</p>

A petition was shortly afterwards presented to court, on behalf of the succeeding guardian, setting forth that these sureties had made an offer of compromise of these judgments, and this offer being in the petitioner’s opinion, after investigation, advantageous, asked that authority be given to accept it; whereupon the court granted an order with the following qualification:</p>

It is conceded that if the loans and pledges in this case were made with notice of the breach of trust, the prayer of petititioner must be granted; hut it is insisted that there was neither breach of trust nor notice. These are the issues, and in respect of both the decision must be in favor of petitioner.</p>

The guardian had no power by virtue of his office, nor of any order of court, nor was there any occasion to borrow. It may be conceded that this guardian had power to sell his wards’ personal estate for purposes incidental to his trust, as <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>with a view to make other more advantageous or safer investments ; but what reason could he have to borrow ? Certainly for no ordinary purpose. The reasons which gave rise to the rule, that a power to sell implies a power to mortgage, do not exist here. These powers are simply alternative modes to raise funds for the payment of debts used in the administration of estates by executors or administrators. A guardian has ordinarily nothing directly to do with the payment of debts of an estate; that is a peculiar function of the administrator; while his function is to receive, hold and invest the “surplusage,” he has no power to create new debts (McCreery’s Appeal, 31 P. J. L. 230), consume any part of the principal, nor change the course of descent by converting personal into real or real into personal estate, without the sanction of the orphans’ court, but must maintain in its integrity and character the whole corpus. In the exercise of powers of sale, abuses are unavoidable. Thus in this very estate the guardian sold a large number of valuable bank stocks with a view to relieve himself of encumbered real estate, which his wards were afterwards compelled to accept, because of his insolvency. Such instances as this are fortunately of rare occurrence. Necessity compels their endurance, but opportunities and temptations to abuse will be greatly increased without any occasion, by concession to guardians of the power to borrow. Injudicious, improvident or fraudulent trans-' actions will happen, and the wards’ property, pledged at an undervalue, be forfeited for want of redemption when sale at the market value in the first instance would have averted the loss; and difficulties in fixing the liability of guardians in such cases are increased to the wards’ great disadvantage. These are hazards which there is no reason to assume, and can only be prevented by the denial of any right to borrow, unless with the prior sanction of the orphans’ court. The occasions are so rare in the course of guardianship, in which borrowing becomes necessary or advisable, either on security of real or personal estate, that such a rule can cause no inconvenience. The guardian cannot engage in active business; his duty is to “ hold ” and “ invest.” There is no reason why his power in respect of borrowing on security of personalty should differ from his restricted power over realty. There was not only no authority given by this court to borrow, but an implied prohibition. The decree <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>was an adjudication, (a) that petitioner’s averment of sufficient available assets belonging to the estate with which to make the Improvements was true; and (6) an appropriation of those assets to that purpose, which neither the guardian, nor those who claim under him can now deny.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[182,610,1173,1222]]]'>As no modification of this decree was ever asked or made, it must be conclusively presumed that these funds were used as decreed. Power to convert a ward’s personal into real estate by making valuable improvements ought not to be assumed without sanction, because it affords the guardian an opportunity to act independently of court, whoso officer he is, alter the course of descent or improve the ward out of his own estate, contrary to the policy of the law. Where improvements have been made judiciously, the court may, of course, in its discretion, ratify them: Miller’s Estate, <a href="/pa/1/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="949827" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0326-01">1 Pa. 326</a>; Eberts v. Eberts, <a href="/pa/55/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="55 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1470656" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0110-01">55 Pa. 110</a> ; Kilpatrick’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/113/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="113 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="457614" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0046-01">113 Pa. 46</a>. But the evidence here fails to show that more than the amount appropriated by this court was needed in making the improvements. Eighteen thousand of the twenty thousand dollars last borrowed was traced distinctly into another investment and credit therefor stricken from the guardian’s final account as illegal. What became of the other money borrowed has not been sufficiently shown. But the inconsistency of this transaction with the guardian’s sworn statement, and his concealment of it from this court for so long period, taken in connection with his waste of over $100,000 of trust funds that have been placed in his care, are pregnant with suggestion of suspicion. Done without and in defiance of authority, without occasion, and without apparent benefit to the estate, it was a palpable breach of trust.</p>

Those who deal with trustees are presumed to do so with notice of the legal limitations of their power; and when they go outside of this, they do so at their own risk. Absolute owners may do as they please with their property so long as they do not infringe the laws of public policy; but trustees, whether bankers, attorneys, guardians or others, act in a representative character, and are limited by the purpose of the trust which each holds. Administrators, executors and guardians are quasi-public trustees, with duties prescribed by law, which every one is obliged to know, and notice of whose character is notice of the limitation of their power. The application of this principle <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>is aptly illustrated by tbe case of Marshall’s Estate, <a href="/pa/138/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="138 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="11251613" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0285-01">138 Pa. 285</a>. An executor, without authority, offered in pledge stocks belonging to his trust to a bank with a view to secure a loan, the proceeds of which he declared were intended to be used in the continuance of the business in which his testator had been engaged. Trusting to these representations, without further inquiry, the bank made the loan; and proceedings having been thereafter taken to compel restoration of the stocks, it was held that there was enough to put the bank on inquiry, which would have led to a knowledge of the facts; and that it was therefore a party to the breach of trust. “ The absence of any reference in the will,” said the court, “to the firm of James Marshall &amp; Company, ought of itself to have excited inquiry. But there is no evidence that they even examined the will, or made any inquiry of the coexecutors, or colegatees of James Marshall, Jr., or consulted an attorney in reference to the matter.</p>

Respondent dealt with Mr. Chapman, in his representative character as guardian, and with stocks known to belong to his wards. It having been informed that the purpose was to improve the wards’ real estate, respondent was bound to know that the guardian had no power to improve without the sanction of this court; and when told that the court had authorized such improvements, was bound in the exercise of ordinary prudence to inquire into the extent of this authority. “ Every man is bound,” said the Court in Mes-singer v. Kintner, <a href="/binn/4/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Binn. 97" data-case-ids="1792452" data-case-paths="/binn/4/0089-01">4 Binn. 97</a>, “ to take notice of the record which is the foundation of his title. If they look into the title at all, the decree of the orphans’ court stares them in the face at the first glance, and seeing the decree, they must take notice at their peril, of the proceedings on which it is founded.” So, on the same principle here, if respondent had examined the i-ecord which, as already seen he was bound to do, it would have found that not only was there no authorization, nor occasion for a loan, but an implied prohibition. In making the last of the <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>series of loans, they did not even wait, but took tlie risk of an anticipated order, for improvement. The specific purpose in making all these loans was to provide means for carrying out alleged orders of court, made or anticipated, for the improvement of the wards’ real estate. The attention of the respondent having been thus specifically directed, made the duty of inquiry the more imperative. If the guardian had offered fox-discount aix ordinary promissoi-y note, the bank would doubtless have made ixxdependexxt inquiry, as in the usual course of business, into the responsibility of the ixxdorser; and had at least as much reasoxx to do so here, in respect to the responsibility of this trust estate : Bedford Bank v.
