L. 19, commissioners were appointed to erect a new state capítol oil land owned by the state, at a cost not to exceed a sum specified. Apart from the location, cost and fireproof character of the building, everything was left to the discretion of the commissioners. The commissioners employed au expert architect under authority given them by the act, and with his assistance issued specifications, styled the programme. Under the programme three disinterested architects were selected as a board of experts to whom all plans were submitted anonymously with the assurance to those competing that all the plans submitted would have full consideration; that the board would recommend eight designs, out of which the commissioners agreed to select one, whose author should be appointed architect “to design and supervise' the erection ” of the building, and two others whose authors should receive first and second medals respectively. Out of thirty designs submitted the board of experts selected eight which they recommended to the commissioners, and also reported that all the designs submitted would exceed the appropriation unless the materials used and the character of the workmanship were to be unworthy of the capital of <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>the commonwealth. They also reported that two of the designs submitted had been excluded from the competition for violation of the directions of the programme, one because trees were shown in one of the drawings, and the other because all the elevations in the drawing were not rendered in monotone. The commissioners disapproved the action of the board of experts, set aside the competition under the programme, ordered all designs to be returned, and invited submission to the commissioners of new plans by all the competing architects. Two architects who had submitted plans filed a bill in equity against the commissioners to compel them to award the prizes to three of the eight preferred designs. The complainants did not aver in their bill that their designs were among the eight. <em>Held, </em>(1) that complainants had shown no such interest in the subject-matter as entitled them to relief; (2) that they had violated the terms of the competition and were therefore not entitled to be considered in the selection ; (3) that the action of the commissioners was not illegal, but was justified under the terms of the programme; (4) that even if the action of the commissioners had been in disregard of the programme they could not bind themselves so as to delegate their discretion, or limit their final judgment ; (5) that the state being the real party in interest as defendant, and it not being alleged that its officers were acting in violation of the law which created their authority, the courts were without jurisdiction of the subject-matter.</p>

The/ programme is elaborate and voluminous, and after examining carefully its numerous parts and paragraphs, we are not surprised that a difference of opinion as to its purpose should have arisen between the board of experts and the majority of the commissioners; and that this difference should be emphasized by the counsel on the opposite sides of this case. That this difference of opinion did exist as early as September 3 is apparent from the statement of one of the experts at the meeting of the commissioners on that day, that “the whole purpose of the competition had been misunderstood ; that it had been established solely with the view to the selection of an architect and not the selection of plans.” It also appeal's from the tenor of the action of the commissioners, which shows that they were looking for and passing upon the merits of plans with a view to obtain such as would, in the language of the act constituting the commission, secure “ a new Capitol Building of such size and form as may in their judgment be adapted to the present and future use of the General Assembly, its officers, committees, and employees.” And as we have said; this difference of opinion was emphasized on the argument when counsel for plaintiffs contended that the competition was designed to secure the selection of an architect, and not of a design or plan for the building; while the opposite counsel maintained that its purpose was to obtain a satisfactory plan, with the understanding that the author of the plan satisfactory to the commission was to be employed to supervise its execution.</p>

The programme is entitled : “Programme of a Competition for <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>the Selection of an Architect for the New Capitol Building to be Erected by the Commonwealth oE Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.” Paragraph 5 of part I. states that “ the object of the commissioners in instituting this competition is to select and appoint an architect to design and supervise the new legislative building to be erected in Harrisburg, Pa.” Paragraph 7 of the same part states that “ the prize of this competition is the award of a commission to design and supervise the erection of said legislative building.” These paragraphs and some others give plausibility to the argument that the design of the competition was the selection of an architect. On the other hand, in paragnvpli 1 of part III. it is stated that “The problem before the commissioners is therefore one of securing a general scheme for the arrangement and design of a group of capitol buildings, in order that the new legislative building, in its arrangement, location, and architectural character, may bear a convenient and harmonious relation to a complete system of which it will eventually form a part.” And in paragraph 2 of the same part it is stated that “ The problem to winch the attention of architects is invited is therefore that of a general design, comprehending tbe legislative and several departmental structures in addition to tbe present executive building. Such design must permit tlie erection of a new legislative building without disturbance to either of the two old departmental buildings, must accept the executive building and the proposed Ilartranft monument as fixed elements of the design, and must not exceed certain limitations of cost.” And in paragraph 35 of part II. it is stated that “ upon the appointment of said architect all designs not accepted will be returned forthwith at the expense of tbe state to their authors, and tbe names of those not among the authors of the eight designs selected by tbe board of experts will not be publicly announced, and no use will be made of any of the drawings not accepted, nor of anything contained in them which is original as to this competition, except by written permission of its author and on payment of proper compensation therefor as determined by the board of experts.” And section 36 declares that “none of the unaccepted drawings will he exhibited to the public or to any competitor without the written permission of its author.” These and other provisions of the pro-gramme which might be quoted certainly tend to give weight <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>to the argument that the primary purpose of the competition was to procure plans for the capitol buildings, coupled with the provision that the author of the plans accepted should be employed as the architect to carry them into execution.</p>

We do not believe that any business man of ordinary discretion about to expend the sum of $550,000 immediately, and perhaps twice that amount prospectively, would select and employ an architect to prepare plans and supervise the erection of buildings to cost that amount without ever having seen him, without any knowledge whatever of his character, his habits, his executive ability, or his pecuniary responsibility, or any other knowledge of his fitness except that to be acquired from inspecting a plan for the buildings drawn by him. Yet this is what the commissioners must have agreed and intended to do if the sole purpose of the competition in question was to determine the selection and employment of an architect. The programme itself recognizes the unquestionable fact that the result of such a method of selecting an architect might be the selection of one who would be “ an unsuitable person to be placed in charge of this work; ”' and it attempts to remedy the evil of such a result by providing that in that event the architect employed “ shall at the request of the commissioners associate with himself in the performance of his duties an architect who shall be acceptable to the commissioners. And such associated architect shall be paid a portion of the fee provided herein to be paid to. such appointed architect, such portion to be as agreed upon by both architects, or in the event of their failure to agree, then as fixed by the board of experts.” In that event the outcome of the scheme would be, that the commissioners would have employed as their principal architect “ an unsuitable person to be placed in charge of the work,” and would have associated with him another architect whose compensation they could not fix. And if this were done there would certainly be danger, which no prudent man would willingly encounter, that this architect and the chief architect, being an unsuitable person, would not act in harmony in carrying on the business. For these and other reasons which might be <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>stated, we think, if the sole purpose of this scheme was the selection of an architect, it is unfortunate that it was ever adopted by the commissioners.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[193,503,1172,507]]]'>But in the view we take of the case, it is not necessary to determine what was the primary and what was the secondary purpose of the competition. It was certainly in some order, designed to secure both an architect and a plan. But the fundamental question, in our opinion, is whether the commissioners have by any of the provisions of the programme delegated to the board of experts the right, in whole or in part, to control their discretion, either in the selection of the architect whom the act requires them to employ or in the selection of plans for the buildings.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[187,1018,1176,1433]]]'>We understand it to be conceded by the counsel of plaintiffs that the commissioners could not delegate to the board of experts, or to any other person or persons, any discretion committed to them by the act with respect to the selection and employment of an architect or the adoption of a plan; and whether we are right in so understanding or not, there can be no doubt that this is the law. But counsel contend that the commissioners have not done this. They refer us for their position on this question to the opinion of the learned attorney general reported in 6 Dist. II. 597, wherein he says: “ There is no limitation upon the powers of the commission found in the act of assembly, in the selection of an architect. They could have selected one, if they bad so chosen, to do the work without competition. They chose, however, to exercise their discretion for what they believed to be the best interests of the commonwealth, and invited all architects to exhibit their skill. The commissioners all being laymen, and architecture being a science with which they were not familiar, they asked the board of experts to determine the ability of the architect from the design he submitted. Of this all competitors were fully advised, and there can be no reasonable ground of complaint. I therefore conclude, first, that the commissioners, neither in paragraph 2 of part I., nor elsewhere in the programme, have abdicated, as such commissioners, or delegated to others, the powers vested in them; second, that it is the duty of the commissioners to select as architect of the new capitol building the author of one of the eight designs reported by the board of experts as exhibiting the best talent.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b330-3" data-blocks='[["BL_330.3",330,[259,351,1177,1224]]]'>
      <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>This is a clear and concise statement of the claim made on the argument on behalf of the plaintiffs. But we regret that after the most careful consideration, we are unable to concur in this conclusion. It will be conceded that the act itself does not make it the duty of the commissioners to select an architect from the eight recommended by the board of experts. Guided by the act alone, it would be their duty to select and employ from all the architects available the.one whom they believed the best for their purpose. If it is now their duty to select one of the eight, the range of their discretion,has at least been much circumscribed. And this has been done, not by a process of exclusion carried on by themselves, but by a board of experts to whom they have delegated the power to exclude. The learned attorney general says: “ They ask the board of experts to determine the ability of the architect from the design he submitted,” and he decides “ that it is the duty of the commissioners to select as architect of the new capitol building the author of one of the eight designs reported by the board of experts as exhibiting the best talent.” But if it be their duty to select one of eight thus nominated by the board of experts, they have certainly precluded themselves from exercising an independent judgment, and from giving only the weight to the opinion of the experts to which in the exercise of their sound judgment and discretion they may think it entitled.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[259,1583,1174,808]],["BL_331.1",331,[203,345,1164,1120]]]'>It will be seen by a reference to paragraph 4 of part II. that the commissioners have had nothing whatever to do with the selection of a majority of this board of experts. The commissioners selected one. The second was selected by a majority of the six architects asked to compete, and the third was selected by the first and second. The result is, that instead of exercising the discretion given to them in the act to “ advise with and employ an architect or architects,” the only discretion which the commissioners retained was to select and employ one of eight propounded to them by a board of experts not selected by the commissioners, when there were thirty seeking the employment. We are wholly unable to see how it can be even plausibly argued that this does not imply a delegation or surrender of their discretion. It is true, as is said by the attorney general, that “there is no limitation found in the act of assembly upon the powers of the commission in the selection of an archi<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>tect.” It rests in their discretion to determine what information and advice they will obtain, and how they will obtain it, to assist them in making a selection. As is said in Lyon v. Jerome, above cited, at page 495: “In cases of authority to represent private individuals, the person thus entrusted may have occasion to depend upon scientific or professional advice for the guidance of his own judgment. He may even, in matters out of the scope of his own information, rely entirely upon the authority of his adviser or assistant, yet he is still bound to form a judgment for himself and to assume its responsibility.” I le cannot contract in advance that he will adopt the advice of liis counselor and thus abdicate his own judgment instead of exercising it. The application of the principle does not depend upon the proportion of the discretionary power which is delegated or surrendered. If the commissioners may agree that they will surrender their discretion and decline to consider the availability of twenty-two out of thirty architects and plans submitted, it certainly cannot be said that they could not surrender it as to twenty-six, and if as to twenty-six, then certainly as to twenty-eight ; yet in that case no one would, we think, contend that they had not limited or circumscribed the discretion vested in them by the express terms of the act.</p>

We cannot see the force of this argument. The discretion vested in them is to “ advise with and employ an architect,” not to determine the manner in which they will bind themselves to employ one named by others. It can hardly be necessary to cite authorities to show that the commissioners cannot delegate to others the discretion vested in them by the act. We refer, however, to a few eases of the many which may be found which declare this to be a well-establisbed principle. In Lyon v. Jerome, already cited, the Court, construing an act of the legislature, decided that the authority conferred by the act upon canal commissioners to enter upon and take possession of the land of individuals for the construction of a canal, could be executed only by the commissioners in person or under their express direction; and that an engineer or <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>any other subagent of the state could not lawfully exercise such power except by their express direction, although the construction of the canal in the vicinity of the premises entered upon had been confided to the engineer. Senator Verplanck, delivering the opinion of the Court, said : “ The language of the statute, as well as the nature of the trust itself, shows that this is an authority confided to the judgment and discretion of the commissioners themselves, for the impartial discharge of which they are responsible to the state.” And in conclusion he said: “ I have only to add that it is of the greatest public importance to establish the general rule of agency, that delegated authority cannot be delegated again without special power so to do as governing the official powers, acts, and contracts of our state officers.” In State v. City of Paterson, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20N.J.L.%20167" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 N.J.L. 167">34 N. J. L. 167</a>, it appeared that the charter of the city provided “ that the mayor and aldermen of the city of Paterson are hereby authorized and empowered to purchase a city hall or other buildings, or to purchase a suitable site or sites and erect thereon, one or more public markets, city hall, or other public buildings, and to employ suitable architects, engineers, and other persons necessary to accomplish the purpose hereby contemplated, and to pass all such ordinances, niles, regulations, and by-laws for the establishment, maintenance, using, renting and governing said markets, city hall, or other public buildings as they may deem proper.” The board of aldermen of the city, intending to put in effect the provisions of this and other sections of their charter, passed a resolution appointing three commissioners “ to proceed in the premises according to law and purchase a site and build a public market thereon.” The power of the mayor and aldermen to appoint this commission being contested, the court said: “The mayor and aldermen are to purchase a suitable site or sites and erect thereon one or more public markets, and to employ suitable architects, engineers, and other persons necessary to accomplish these purposes. They are therefore required to use judgment and discretion in determining the suitableness of the site, and also of the architects, engineer, and other persons employed to accomplish the purpose. This they must use and cannot delegate to others without express legislative authority.” Tn Birdsall v. Clark, <a href="/ny/73/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="73 N.Y. 73" data-case-ids="2169796" data-case-paths="/ny/73/0073-01">73 N.

The common council directed the superintendent of streets, by resolution, to cause such work to be done when the owners neglected to do so. The plaintiff brought an action to enjoin the superintendent from doing such work in front of the plaintiff’s premises. The Court held that the action was maintainable; that the power conferred by the charter, involving the exercise of discretion as to the time and manner of the performance of the work, must be pursued by the council and could not be delegated. And several cases are cited in the note at the end of this case in the American Reports.</p>

Tbe location, upon or near tbe site of the old capitol, the colonial style of architecture, and the cost, not to exceed $550,000, were fixed by the act, and were mandatory upon the commissioners and every one dealing with them. So, to a lesser extent was the fire proof character of the building, but everything else was left to the discretion of the commissioners under the general direction that the building should “ in their judgment be adapted to the present and future use of the General Assenibty, its officers, committees and employees.” The commissioners were further directed “ with the least possible delay, to advise with and employ an architect and adopt plans,” etc.</p>

It asks the court to compel the commissioners to award the prizes to three of the eight preferred designs, but does not say that complainants’ designs were among the eight. If the relief asked were granted there is nothing to show that complainants would be in any way benefited by it. Courts of equity are not set in motion upon speculative contingencies. In strict practice, therefore, the bill should be dismissed, on this ground alone. But as there are questions of public interest involved we prefer to consider the case further, and if the hill is otherwise sustainable, to allow an amendment on this point, especially in view of the pendency of another bill by a different complainant, in which this defect does not occur.</p>

It is admitted that the selection of a plan must rest in tbe discretion of the commissioners, but it is argued that the choice of an architect Avas, by tbe action of tbe commissioners in issuing tbe programme, made a preliminary step, as to whicli tbey bound themselves to abide by tbe report of the experts, and that such action Avas not a delegation of discretion as <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>to a plan but a mere means of informing themselves as to a class of architects from whom the selection could best be made.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[269,469,1177,1475]]]'>This brings us to.the examination of the programme, and it must be conceded that some of the expressions look towards the complainants’ view. Thus it is entitled “Programme of a Competition for the Selection of an Architect for a new Capitol Building.” Section 5 of part I., states that “ the object of the commissioners in instituting this competition is to select and appoint an architect to design and supervise ” the building. Section 7 provides that “ the prize of this competition is the award of a commission to design and supervise the erection” of the building; and some other expressions tend the same way though less strongly. On the other hand by section 1, of part I., all American architects are invited “ to submit drawings in competition ; ” by section 4, “ all draw ings with accompanying description .... will have full consideration; ” by section 10, the advice of the board of experts was to be “ upon the relative merits of the designs submitted; ” by various sections of part II., the board of experts are to select “ those eight designs which in their judganent are best;” the “selection of designs will be governed by the merit of each design as a whole ; ” it is “ the designs so selected ” which are to be reported to the commissioners, who are then to select “ one of-the said designs as being in their opinion the most satisfactory ; ” and other sections bearing in the same direction. The view of the appellants would require us to hold that these reiterated provisions as to the drawings and plans had no reference to the merits of the plans themselves as means of obtaining the best building, but only intended them as evidence from which to judge of the ability of the authors as architects, and left the subject of plans for the actual building entirely open for future and separate consideration.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[276,1952,1170,452]],["BL_339.1",339,[158,346,1166,853]]]'>That the elaborate scheme, so advertised as to bring in thirty competitors from all parts of the United States, each preparing twenty-four large and laborious drawings, should be intended only as a preliminary skirmish for the appointment of an architect, to be followed by another and separate contest for a plan, the thing with which the real interest of the state is concerned, is not only unusual and startling, but in the highest degree unbusinesslike. Under it the author of the best plan might be a youth just through his professional studies, of great artistic <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>ability, but without the practical experience of ever having built a single bouse. Indeed tlie programme itself foresees and provides for this very contingency. By section 24 of part II., “ If by reason of youth or inexperience or for any other reason, the architect chosen as above provided shall, in the judgment of the commissioners, be an unsuitable person to be placed in charge of this work, be shall, at the request of the commissioners, associate with himself in the performance of his duties an architect who shall be acceptable to the commissioners, and sucb associated architect shall be paid a portion of the fee,” etc. A construction which would thus seem to provide a method for the selection of an architect only, and then at the same time provide in express terms for the contingency that the method might lead to the selection of an unsuitable person, so obviousty stultifies tbe wliole programme, that it should not be adopted unless tbe language used admits of no more sensible construction.</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[153,1218,1171,1166]],["BL_340.1",340,[272,354,1177,1663]]]'>There is no compulsion to adopt such a view. On the contrary it is opposed not only by the clauses already cited but also by tbe whole scope and object of tbo programme. What the state wants, and the act of assembly commanded, was a building. That was the sole object in view. Tbe architect and the plans are only means to that end, and the selection of the architect is not the first step in importance, nor necessarily in order of time. This is already shown by the provision for an associated architect. But the adoption of a plan as well as the selection of an architect is demonstrated in the next section, 25 : “ The architect so appointed shall then revise his competitive drawings to meet the further requirements of tlie commissioners, and upon the basis of these revised preliminary drawings shall prepare fully detailed working drawings and specifications of the Legislative Building, and shall during its construction supervise tbe work,” etc. What possible purpose can be attributed to the command to prepare “ fully detailed working drawings and specifications ” according to his plan, and to proceed with the construction, if his plan has not been adopted? Much stress was laid in the argument by appellants upon the expressions in tbe programme already quoted, that the object of the competition was to select an architect “(o design and supervise,” etc.: that the prize was a commission “ to design and <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>supervise,” etc., and other like uses of the word design. But this section shows that the designing meant was that which was done for the competition and not afterwards. All difficulty is avoided by this construction. The prize is truly stated as a “ commission to design and supervise ” the construction of the building, for that is the appointment which carries with it the very considerable sum of five per cent upon the cost of the building, much more, probably, than would be paid for the design alone. The best design having been selected, its author was to be the architect, not to make a new design which might not be equal to the first, and not to supervise the building on another’s plan, but on his own; and if notwithstanding the merits of his plan he was likely to fall short in practical ability he was to have an associate. This view does away with the self condemning features of the programme and makes it sensible and consistent throughout.. The plan of the successful architect was to be revised, and this was the real object of all the provisions sought to be construed as looking to a separate selection of architect and plan. The best plan was to be selected and adopted, and treated as evidence of the capacity of the architect for doing the work, but the adoption was not to be absolute in either aspect. The architect might be required to take an associate of more experience, and his plan was to be open to revision upon suggestions by the commissioners. The incorporation of ideas from other plans was provided for in section 35 with the consent of the authors and upon compensation. But, with an associate or without one the author of the plan selected as best was to be the architect of the building, and with revision or without it his plan was the one to be put into working drawings and constructed. Considered as a whole and with regard to its purpose and the circumstances of its issue, the programme does not admit of any other rational construction.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[270,2036,1170,348]],["BL_341.1",341,[136,355,1170,2035]],["BL_342.1",342,[302,362,1170,145]]]'>We come now' to the action of the hoard of experts and of the commissioners. As already said, the experts reported that all the plans would exceed the limit of the appropriation and would require modification or the use of inferior materials and workmanship. They also reported that they had felt constrained to exclude two designs from the competition “ for serious violation of clauses well defined in the programme,” to wit: No. 15, <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>because of “ trees being shown on the elevation at one sixty-fourth scale, and their shadows shown on the plan at same scale,” and No. 21 because of “all the elevations and sections not being rendered in monotone, at least three colors being used.” This action by a board of professional gentlemen of such high character and intelligence can only be accounted for by their erroneous view of the scope of the programme as limiting their duties to the selection of an architect. The two plans excluded, it is true, violated the plain conditions of the competition, and the authors have no ground of complaint, for they were bound to know the risk of departures from the programme. But the violation was of requirements that affected only the drawings, and did not touch the merits of the designs, but only the work of the experts in estimating them relatively to the others. When therefore the experts enforced the conditions so relentlessly against two minor offenders, it was not to be expected that they would overlook violations that went to the very substance of the plans themselves. Yet each of the eight recommended exceeded in cost the amount of the appropriation, and this was the most important and mandatory requirement, not only of the programme, but of the statute itself. It is no answer to say that the designs could be modified to bring them within the necessary limit. Distinct notice was given in section 1 of the programme of the amount of the appropriation available and “in order to permit uniformity in estimating the probable actual cost of the building,” the preliminary expenses of the competition, to be deducted from the gross appropriation, were assumed to be $10,000. And in the supplement to the programme it was again explicitly reiterated that “ the provisions limiting the cost and specifying the areas required are mandatory, and will be strictly and fully observed in judging the designs.” The nature and extent of modification necessary to produce the required reduction of cost are peculiarly matters of technical knowledge on which however the experts gave the commissioners no assistance. And if modifications were permissible at all, prior to the selection of a design, it would seem that mere corrections of the drawings should more readily be allowed than modification of the substance of the plans. The commissioners therefore had a right to be dissatisfied with the action of the board of experts, and in setting aside all the com<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>petitive designs and reopening the whole competition they were not only within their powers but were doing merely what the board of experts as a matter of strict right should have advised.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[300,515,1174,553]]]'>It is much to be regretted that a scheme so carefully prepared and so well intended should result in failure. But the responsibility does not rest upon the commissioners. Primarily it is the fault of the competing architects who disregarded the most important and mandatory requirement of the whole scheme, which even the commissioners themselves were not at liberty to depart from, and secondarily, in a lesser degree, of the board of experts who neither enforced the conditions strictly against all competitors, nor gave the commissioners the necessary information to enable them to judge how far the departures from the programme could safely be excused and remedied.</p>
    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[297,1076,1174,1320]]]'>These views necessarily put an end to all claims for relief under this bill, but as some other points of importance have been argued we proceed to notice them, although briefly. The commissioners are invested by the statute with a discretion on the subject-matter which cannot be controlled or reviewed by the courts or parted with by the commissioners themselves. The law is not disputed that delegated authority requiring the exercise of the personal discretion and judgment of the agent cannot be delegated by him. We think it quite clear that if the appellants’ construction of the programme should be adopted, and the commissioners be held to have bound themselves to limit their choice of an architect to one of the authors of the eight plans recommended by the board of experts it would be an illegal delegation of their discretion. It is urged that so long as the commissioners retained the ultimate right and power of selection, they might take any steps they thought proper to secure a class of competent persons from whom to select. The argument is entirely sound so long as it is applied to the voluntary action of the commissioners. If they had selected one of the class, no other outside of the class could object that their action was illegal by reason of delegation of authority to select the class. They might voluntarily or in the exercise of their discretion limit their choice to one of eight, chosen by others as most competent, but they could not bind themselves to do so. The discretion which was free at first must remain free to the last or up to the time of final judgment and action.</p>

      <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>A further objection to the bill is that it is virtually against the state. The defendants have no personal interests in the matter. They are clothed with authority as agents of the state, and their acts which are made the basis of the bill were done by virtue of their office only. Three of them, a majority, are named in the act by their office only. The building is upon ground of the state, and is to be built and paid for by the state. An injunction concerning it in any way would not affect the commissioners in their personal capacities but only as the officers of the state, and through them the state itself. It is not charged tbat they are acting against the law, but against private rights growing out of their own previous action. The state cannot be interfered with on such grounds.</p>
    <p id="b343-5" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[186,1024,1165,83]]]'>On the whole case our conclusions may be summed up as follows :</p>
