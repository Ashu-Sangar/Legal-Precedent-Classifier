On June 1,1895, a further order was made authorizing the receiver to operate the plant for the Linden Steel Company for six months or until further order of the court. The receiver also presented to court a petition asking to be allowed to borrow money to be used in operating the plant, and on June 17, 1895, the court made an order authorizing the receiver to borrow a sum not to exceed $30,000 for that purpose, and to secure the payment of the money so borrowed by issuing receiver’s certificates, m the form prescribed in that order. This order provides that the “ said certificates shall be a lien upon the personal property and earnings of the Linden Steel Company, in possession of the receiver, prior in right to all other claims thereon, and shall be first payable thereout.” By an order of June 29,1895, the form of the receiver’s certificates provided in the order of June 17, 1895, was changed, but no other change was made in the order. Mr. Warner, as receiver, issued certificates to the amount of $80,000. He continued to operate the works until the early part of September, 1895, when he died, and on September , 1895, Charles F.

In December, 1895, Naylor &amp; Company made a contract with the receiver, Mr. Wells, to supply to him three thousand five hundred tons of Bessemer pig iron at the rate of $12.75 per ton, to be delivered monthly, five hundred tons per month. They continued delivering the metal called for by the contract, the last delivery being made on May 25,1896, when all or nearly all of the metal called for by the contract had been delivered to the receiver. For the metal delivered during the months of April and May, 1896, there was <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>a balance due Naylor &amp; Company of the sum of 18,162.33. On July 1, 1896, Naylor &amp; Company presented their petition to this court, setting forth the contract and the fact that part of the pig iron delivered during April and May, 1896, as set forth in said petition, was still unpaid for; that they had demanded payment for the same but had never received it; that a large portion of the Bessemer pig iron so sold and delivered to the receiver, was still in the metal yards of the Linden Steel Company, under the control of the receiver, and could be readily identified, and asking the court to direct the receiver to redeliver to Naylor &amp; Company, without further costs, the said pig iron, or a sufficient amount thereof, still retained by the receiver, to cancel this debt.</p>

They sold the Bessemer pig iron to the receiver to assist in carrying on the business, as other parties furnishing supplies, with direct knowledge that the receiver was conducting the business under the order of court. They sold and delivered the pig iron, parting with their title, and relying upon the receiver for payment. So there was no fraud, deception, or misrepresentation in the purchase, they have no ground on which to claim a return of that portion of the pig metal not used up. They stand on precisely the same footing as other creditors who furnished supplies. This exception dismissed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b271-8" data-blocks='[["BL_271.7",271,[194,1963,1170,455]],["BL_272.1",272,[238,370,1174,1680]]]'>The order of court authorizing Mr. Warner to issue certificates expressly made them a “ lien upon the personal property and earnings of the Linden Steel Company in possession of the receiver, prior in right to all other claims thereon and shall be first payable thereout.” The order of court authorizing Mr. Wells to issue receiver’s certificates to the extent of 170,000, omits this as to the lien and priority. The auditor says the order to Mr. Wells was “slightly different” from the order to Mr. Warner. I think it was radically different in a most impor<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>tant particular. The court might well make the $30,000 asked for by Mr. Warner when he first entered upon the receivership a first lien upon the personal property and earnings, but refuse to give that preference to $70,000 more, which would make a total of $100,000. Mr. Wells did not ask for $70,000 to be used partly in lifting and retiring the $30,000 issued by Mr. Warner. He might have used it all in contracting new debts. Possibly that consideration may have influenced the court in not making these new certificates a prior lien, and possibly may have thought that with $70,000 of new certificates there would be no necessity of incurring other debts. True, the petition of Mr. Wells asked that these new certificates be given a preference, like those issued by Mr. Warner. But as the order of court did not contain that clause, we must conclude that the court refused that part of his petition. Under the discretionary power given to Mr. Wells, he could use $30,000 of the new certificates in lifting and retiring the old, and probably acted wisely in doing so. That left $40,000 for other purposes, of which he issued only $35,000. But he incurred other debts to the extent of some '$41,000. These other debts, it is admitted, were all for supplies necessary to carry on the business and were contracted by Mr. Wells after he applied to court for power to issue certificates. The holders of the certificates issued by Mr. Warner had, undoubtedly, a preference to other creditors, as specified in his order of court, and if they had held on to those certificates, they would now have a preference. But they voluntarily surrendered those certificates and accepted in lieu of them, certificates issued by Mr. Wells. Before they accepted these new certificates they were bound to look into the order of court to see what power Mr. Wells had. Had they done so, they would have seen that these new certificates had no preference. Not having done so they have no just ground of complaint.</p>

The purchase of the necessary materials and supplies was incident to, and impliedly granted, in the authprity to carry on the works. The schedule of the other debts, attached to the auditor’s report, aggregating <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>$41,486,36, is composed of sixty-three creditors, and most of them of small accounts.

All of these debts were contracted by the receiver under the authority given to him by the court, and they have as much claim upon the court for protection as the holders of the certificates. The receiver had no power to contract debts, or issue certificates, without authority from the court, and when that authority is given, they stand on the same footing, unless the court expressly places the certificates on higher ground.</p>
