Under proceedings in partition in the orphans’ court, the real estate of the deceased husband of the defendant was appraised and accepted by one of the heirs, who entered into recognizance to pay the widow (the above-named defendant) annually during her life, the interest on the one third of the appraised valuation. Subsequently the defendant contracted the debt for which the judgment in this case was obtained against her. The application before us is founded on the acts of assembly of 13th of-October, 1840, and 24th of January, 1849, relating to sales under execution of life estates. ■' See Purd. Dig. pp. 651, 652.

If the position <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>taken by the defendant’s counsel is correct, it follows that a sequestrator may be appointed, who may have the full and undisturbed possession of the premises delivered to him, and thus turn out the heir to whom the orphans’ court has awarded the lands, and who is now admitted to be in possession. The partition and acceptance of the real estate prior to the time the widow contracted the debt to the plaintiff worked a conversion of the premises awarded to the heir. In the case of the Lancaster County Bank v. Stauffer, <a href="/pa/10/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="962689" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0398-01">10 Pa. 398</a>, it is decided that the sixth section of the act of 1840, before cited, authorizes the appointment of a sequestrator only “where an unconverted life estate is taken in execution, in order to make the debt out of the rents and profits, without a sale, but neither the letter nor the spirit of the enactment extends to lands already turned into money.” See Scott on Intestate Laws, 411.

It is admitted that no application for the writ was made to the court, and no notice given. Had the defendant such a life interest in the real estate as made this necessary? This is the only question. Her interest is a widow’s interest in the estate of her deceased husband. Under proceedings in partition in the orphans’ court, the property was sold and the one third of the purchase money remained charged upon the land, the interest upon which was decreed to be paid to her annually during her life.

They could no longer be sold; but after an inquisition which was to ascertain the clear yearly profits of the real estate, making allowance for taxes, necessary repairs and all reprises, the plaintiff could have the estate extended and delivered to him by a writ of liberari facias, according to the valuation fixed by the inquest, or he might have a sequestrator appointed who was to receive the rents, issues and profits. The sequestrator had authority to rent or sell such lands or tenements for a length of time sufficiently to satisfy all the liens, expenses, repairs, etc., but not for a longer period than the life interest of the defendant. This took away the power to sell on a vend. ex. By the act of October 13,1840, a sequestrator might be appointed on the application of any lien creditor.

Could a sequestrator take possession of her lands and tenements, sell them, or <em>lease </em>them, or could the sheriff put the sequestrator in possession as is required by the act? Clearly not, unless her share has been laid out in metes and bounds, and she has a life estate assigned to her as land, or unless she, by virtue of her right, is entitled to the actual possession of lands or tenements. In such a case possession might be delivered to the sequestrator, and he might either sell or lease. Such an estate would, I think, be embraced within the provisions of the act of January 24, 1849. But can the act be made to apply when the land has been sold under proceedings in partition? It is true that these proceedings, and the sale under them, did not change her interest from realty into personalty. It would still be bound by the lien of a judgment, and could only be sold on a vend. ex. But the manner of holding her interest has, I think, been changed from what it would have been if her interest had been set off by metes and bounds in the land itself. In the latter case she would have had the possession, and it might be delivered over to a sequestrator, in the former case she would not. By the proceedings in partition, her interest has becomé not a corporeal but an incorporeal hereditament; not an interest in the land itself as land, <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>but an interest issuing out of it —-a life interest only in the annual sum which is to be paid to her, and which is charged upon the land and flows from it. This distinction, in the manner in which she holds her estate in the land is recognized in Gourley v. Kinley, <a href="/pa/66/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="66 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="432463" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0270-01">66 Pa. 270</a>: “Where the widow’s share is laid off by metes and bounds, she has a life estate in the portion assigned her as land, which carries with it as a necessary incident the right to receive the rents and profits; but when the estate is accepted at the appraisement or sold, she has a life estate, not in any specific portion of the land, but in an equivalent share of the rents and profits of the whole estate, measured by the interest on her share of its value as ascertained by appraisement or sale.” In the former case the act of 1849 would apply. Possession could be delivered and enforced, and the sequestrator could perform the duties enjoined in the act. But in the latter no possession could be given of the lands and tenements subject to the dower, and the sequestrator would be a supernumerary. As bearing upon the general principle see also The Lancaster County Bank v. Stauffer, <a href="/pa/10/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="962689" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0398-01">10 Pa. 398</a>. From what we have said it follows that no notice of an application for a writ of vend, ex., and no special application to the court for the writ were necessary.

It involves the nature of the interest of the widow of an intestate in the lands of the deceased husband after a sale of the lands in partition. The general rules applicable to an estate in dower are well settled. Dower consummate is a life estate. After it has been assigned by metes and bounds the title and the possession are in the widow and she has the same absolute ownership and control of her estate as though her title had accrued by deed or will. She may alien, incumber or otherwise dispose of it, <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>and it may be seized and sold for her debts. Is the nature of her estate or interest changed by proceedings in partition under our statutes ? In this case the decedent was the owner of a valuable farm. Soon after his death proceedings were instituted by his heirs for making partition. The appraisers appointed by the court made return that the farm could not be divided without injury and fixed its value as a whole. The heirs thereupon declined to take it at the valuation and requested that an order be made for its sale. The widow joined in this request. The court then made the order of sale usual in such cases, and directed that one third of the price at which the land should be sold should remain in the hands of the purchaser until the death of the widow, and be then paid to the heirs at law of the former owner, and that meantime the interest on said sum at the rate of six per cent should be paid to the widow during her life. After this sale was made a creditor of the widow obtained judgment against her for about $400. Assuming that her interest in the land was a life estate, after, as well as before the sale, in partition, the creditor levied upon it and sold it as he would have levied and sold an estate in fee simple without any application to the court, and without a special writ, and became himself the purchaser for the sum of. $25.00. Did this sale vest in the purchaser a title to the interest or estate of the widow? That must depend upon what her interest or estate was, and whether it was sold in the manner required by law. It would seem to be quite clear under our cases that the interest of the widow was that of a tenant for life. It was unquestionably a life estate before the proceedings in partition were instituted. The object of this partition was not to destroy or divest her estate, but to make division among the heirs at law subject to her dower. A decree making partition by purparts among the heirs would not have prevented her from asking an assignment of her dower by metes and bounds, nor did the decree of sale qualify her estate except as to the manner of its enjoyment. She could not require the purchaser to assign her dower upon the land after the sale, for the decree had assigned her dower by a different method of admeasurement, viz : by valuing her estate, and requiring her to accept six per cent upon such value in lieu of actual possession of the surface. The return of sale was, therefore, in effect, of a sale subject to her estate in dower, <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>■to be enjoyed by her in the manner provided by the statute and the order of sale, instead of by assignment by metes and bounds .on the surface : Martha Mann’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/50/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="50 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="425128" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0375-01">50 Pa. 375</a>.

This must depend upon the construction of the act of October 13, 1840, by which the manner of the seizure and sale of life estates in execution is regulated. Section sixth of that act authorizes the court upon the application of a lien creditor to appoint a sequestrator, with power to take the “ rents, issues or profits ” of the life estate and apply then upon the liens against it or, if the life tenant is in the actual possession of the land, to enter upon such possession and “ rent or sell such lands or tenements .for such terms during the life of the persons upon whom such estate shall depend as shall be sufficient to satisfy all the liens against the same, together with all charges for taxes, repairs and expenses,” and make application of the same to the payment of the liens under the direction of the court, and according to their priority as liens upon the life estate. The sequestrator is entitled to the possession of the life tenant. If, before the entry of the liens, a valid lease had been made to one who was ■in actual possession of the land, paying rent therefor, we do not understand that the sequestrator would have any legal right to dispossess, or enter upon such tenant. He could however seize and apply the rents paid by him. He would, as to such prior valid lease, be clothed with the rights and powers of the life tenant and authorized to collect and apply all the “rents, issues or profits ” until the purposes of his appointment were fully •met. But what if no lien creditor applied for the appointment of a sequestrator ? Then the execution creditor might proceed under the provisions of the third section of the act of January 24, 1849 which authorized the sale of “life estates yielding rents, issues or profits,” in the same manner as estates of inherit<a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>anee may be sold upon execution process, viz: upon a writ of venditioni exponas after advertisement. Tlie defendant was however permitted to have an appraisement made by a sheriffs inquest of the yearly value of the land, and to elect to retain possession and pay the rental fixed by the inquest in semiannual payments to his creditor. A proviso to the fourth section of this act expressly declared that no venditioni exponas should issue for the sale by the sheriff of the life estate, “unless by the direction of the proper court; and on the application of any lien creditor for a writ of venditioni exponas the tenant for life shall have at least ten days’ notice of the application for such writ.” Thus it will be seen that the right to sell a life estate, in the same manner as estates of inheritance axe sold, upon a writ of venditioni exponas, is subject to two conditions; first, the right of the defendant to an appraisement of its annual value by an inquest, and to elect to retain possession at the rental fixed; second, the consent or order of the proper court, made after ten days’ notice to the defendant that such writ is asked for. These conditions, like the provision for the appointment of a sequestrator, are really in aid of tlie tenant for life, whose estate is of such uncertain duration as to make it of little value to ordinary purchasers, and render its sacrifice at a public sale practically certain.</p>

But it is not necessary to rest our ruling on general principles alone, since the construction of the act of 1849 seems to have been settled in several cases. In Com. v. Allen, <a href="/pa/30/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="30 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="415597" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0049-01">30 Pa. 49</a>, it was held that a life estate can not be sold upon a fi. fa., but must be sold as provided by the act, upon a venditioni exponas. The further point that no writ of venditioni exponas could issue without the order of the proper court, made after ten days’ notice to the defendant, was distinctly ruled as early as 1858, in Kintz v. Long, <a href="/pa/30/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="30 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="415563" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0501-01">30 Pa. 501</a>, and it was also said, a sheriff’s sale of a life estate “ under a venditioni exponas issued without such notice is void, and confers no title upon the purchaser.” The invalidity of such a <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>sale was again distinctly ruled in Snyder v. Christ, <a href="/pa/39/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="39 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="996423" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0499-01">39 Pa. 499</a>, in which our late Brother Strong said: “We think therefore the court should have affirmed unqualifiedly the fifth point proposed by the defendants below, which was that if Snyder’s interest in the land was a life estate only the sale did not divest the title, unless the venditioni exponas on which it was sold was issued by the order of the court of common pleas on ten days’ previous notice of the application for such writ to said Snyder.” To the rule thus stated three exceptions are recognized: first, where the. life tenant has no possession, but the person in possession claims to hold in hostility to the life tenant; second, when the defendant alleges his interest to be a fee and not a fife estate : third, when the creditor has reasonable ground to believe that the debtor is the owner of the fee, and proceeds upon that-theory. In the first case the creditor merely buys a right to litigate with the person in possession over the existence of the life tenancy. In the second he takes his debtor at his word and sells the interest he claims to have in the land. In the third he acts upon his own judgment as to the defendant’s title and takes the risk of its correctness.</p>

Inghram, <a href="/pa/32/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="32 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="986709" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0214-01">32 Pa. 214</a>, and the existence of the exceptions was again recognized in the opinion of this court in Snyder v. Christ, <a href="/pa/39/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="39 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="996423" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0499-01">39 Pa. 499</a>. But, exceptio probat regulam. The rule applies with full force when the existence of the life estate is asserted by the defendant and acknowledged by the person in possession of the land charged with the payment of the ascertained “ rents, issues or profits of the life estate to the holder thereof.” In the present case it is conceded that the life estate was sold without an order of the court allowing the writ, made under the act of 1849, and without notice to the defendant. The sale so made was, in the language of Kintz v. Long, <a href="/pa/30/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="30 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="415563" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0501-01">supra,</a> “void, and confers no title upon the purchaser.” With what he acquired under the attachment in execution there seems to be no controversy. He obtained a judgment in that proceeding which has not been complained of, but which has been fully paid. Judgment should therefore be entered upon the case stated in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of her claim, less the amount secured by the attachment execution. The case stated appears to adjust <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>that amount at $429. Upon that understanding we adjust tlie amount due to the widow as the parties seem to have adjusted it, at $3,700, with the interest from August 6, 1894, the day of demand made in this case.</p>
