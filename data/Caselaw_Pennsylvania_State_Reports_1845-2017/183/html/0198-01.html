    <p class="summary" id="b219-7" data-blocks='[["BL_219.12",219,[211,760,1171,1018]]]'>At the trial it appeared that the borough of Willrinsburg improved a portion of Hill avenue, one of its streets, under the provisions of the Act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, by grading, curbing with Beaver sandstone and paving with fire brick a width of 30 feet and a total length, exclusive of cross streets, of 2,179.94 feet. This improvement extended from a point in Pitt street on the west to the west line of Coal street on the east. About midway between these termini Hill avenue is bisected by Wood street, a leading thoroughfare, and that portion of the improved part of Hill avenue lying west of Wood street is level, and the grade of the improved street practically that of the abutting property, while that portion of the improved avenue lying east of Wood street rises sharply from Wood street almost to the eastern terminus of the improvement, where there is a crown. Plaintiff’s property fronts 376 feet on the extreme west end of the improvement, lying between Pitt street and Hay street, on the level portion of the avenue, and has a complete outlet via Wood street. The crown near the eastern end of the improvement was cut, causing damages to abutting properties amounting to more than $2,000.</p>

A. I know there was a cut in Hill avenue, but I don’t know whether you would call it a change of grade, at the uj)per end of Hill avenue. Q. Between Center and Coal? A. Between Center and Coal; but whether it was a change in grade or not I don’t know. It was a change from the original contour of the ground. Q. Well, if that was a change of grade between those points connected with this improvement, was that change of grade on Hill avenue between Center and Coal streets of any special or peculiar advantage to the property of Mrs. L. A. Boyd?” Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant.</p>

The counsel for plaintiff here admits the truth of the testimony of the witnesses to the effect that regarding this whole improvement there is a peculiar benefit to the plaintiff’s property to the amount of the assessment, $1,473.94. He maintains that he has a right to separate the two portions of the street, and maintains that there is part of this improvement, which perhaps was the most costly part, which does not benefit his client’s prop<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>erty. We are unable to see how we could permit him to go into that matter, because if we go into one, we must go into all of these cases, and we would have an inextricable mix in trying these various issues. It seems to us that we have gone as far as we can in allowing him to show matters which would reduce the assessment of his client. Counsel does not claim that there has been anything improperly assessed upon the property along this entire street. The cost of improvement, he concedes was all right, and was not improperly increased; but he thinks that he ought to be allowed to show that his client’s property would have been as much improved if they had only improved part of this street — had not improved it clear through. We think he must take the improvement as a whole ; and the question is whether he has had benefits which justify this assessment. Under that ruling, as I have said, while the borough was prepared to submit further testimony, counsel for plaintiff candidly concedes that the assessment should be sustained, and therefore, under this concession, your verdict would be properly in favor of the borough. The issue here possibly is not made up as it should be logically. Probably the borough should be plaintiff; but we will arrive at the same end by taking your verdict in the form that I suggest — that would be a verdict for the defendant, and that the peculiar advantage resulting to the plaintiff’s property from the improvement in question is equal to the amount of the assessment, to wit: $1,473.94.</p>
