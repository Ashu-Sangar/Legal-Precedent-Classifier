After the execution of this deed, but before the execution of the lease, the lessor conveyed portions of the surface of his land to various other persons, without reserving to himself any right to drill wells upon the portions of the land so conveyed. The defendant, lessee, filed an affidavit of defense in which he averred that the corporation had denied the right of the lessor and his lessees to drill wells for oil and gas, and that under threat of suit defendant had agreed to pay the corporation a certain amount for each well, and that subsequently the corporation had obtained an injunction restraining the drilling of any wells upon the lots conveyed to others. <em>Reid, </em>that the affidavit of defense was insufficient to prevent judgment.</p>
