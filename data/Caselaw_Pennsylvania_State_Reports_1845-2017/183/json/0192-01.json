W. O\u2019Neil therein set forth. Tbe other is in sustaining plaintiff\u2019s objection and excluding defendant\u2019s offer of testimony therein specified. Our consideration of these rulings has led us to the conclusion that there is no error in either of them; and inasmuch as there is nothing else in the record to justify a reversal of the judgment, hoth specifications of error should be dismissed and the judgment affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "A. R. Braden v. W. H. McCleary, Sheriff, Appellant.\nSheriff- \u2014 Wrongful levy \u2014 Evidence.\nIn an action against a sheriff to recover damages for a wrongful levy, where the defendant in the execution testified that he was the owner, of the property levied on, it is competent to ask him on cross-examination whether his mother-in-law to whom he had confessed the judgment on which tbe writ issued had not given a bond to indemnify the sheriff.\nPrincipal and agent \u2014 Authority of agent \u2014 Change of ownership.\nAn agent who is merely placed in charge of property cannot change its ownership by delivering it to others, without the consent of his principal.\nArgued Oct. 25, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 43, Oct. T., 1897, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Go., April Term, 1894, No. 356, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Stekhett, C. J., Gi\u00edeen, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, I)ean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass against the sheriff to recover damages for alleged wrongful levy. Before Magee, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the property levied upon was three boat bottoms, one loaded with pit posts and two with check posts. It was levied upon as that of W. W. O\u2019Neil. The levy was under a judgment confessed by O\u2019Neil to his mother-in-law, Rachel K. Pollard. O\u2019Neil testified that he had bought the property from Braden, the plaintiff, and that it had been delivered to him. Braden claimed that the boats had not been delivered.\nO\u2019Neil, under cross-examination, was asked this question:\n\u201c Did Mrs. Pollard give a bond to the sheriff to protect him? \u201d Objected to.\nBy the Court: How does that affect it?\nBy Mr. Rodgers, of counsel for plaintiff: To show the interest of this witness. His mother-in-law, the real party in the case, having given a bond to the sheriff to protect him in making this levy.\nBy Mr. Petty, of counsel for defendant: My objection is this, the sheriff did get a bond which is worthless\u2014\nBy Mr. Rodgers : Counsel having stated in open court that a bond was given, I now propose to press the question whether a bond was given by Mrs. Pollard, his mother-in-law, to protect the sheriff in relation to this execution.\nObjected to as incompetent and irrelevant. Objection overruled. [1]\nThe plaintiff having testified that, after bringing down the boat of pit posts and boat of brace poles, he went back home and before doing so left the boats in charge of John Shoup (who has since died) to take care of them for him, and that when he again came to Pittsburg on April 21 or 22, Shoup was still in ehai\u2019ge and possession of the boats, and the plaintiff took them off Shoup\u2019s hands, the defendant, having Cal. Wilson upon the stand, proposed to ask him: \u201cDo you know Mr. Shoup? A. Shoup ! O, yes, I saw him around there. Q. Did you hear Mm say anything about the boats ? A. He was bailing them out. Q. Bailing out which boat ? A. Bailing out Mr. Braden\u2019s boat. Q. Which boat do you mean ? A. Well, he had been bailing around there at this pit post boat and brace pole boat, I think was the way of it. Q. Did he say anytlfing about the pit post boat? \u201d\nObjected to as incompetent.\nBy Mr. Petty: Mr. Braden testified that he put Mr. Shoup in charge of certain boats. Now I propose to prove by the wituess on the stand that Mr. Shoup had charge of the brace pole boat and turned the pit post boat over to witness and told him that that was O\u2019Neil\u2019s and he would like to have Mm take care of it, and that Mr. John Shoup, referred to in the testimony of A. R. Braden, the plaintiff, turned over to the witness the boat loaded with pit posts and said to the witness that was O\u2019Neil\u2019s boat, and that he [the witness] would have to take care of it.\n' Objected to as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial under the proof in this case, and for the further reason that no time or place is mentioned'.\nBy Mr. Petty: I will add to the offer that this was on the landing where Mr. O\u2019Neil had his other boats at about the 12th of April, 1893, and several days before the boats were levied upon by the sheriff.\n, Objected to as being too indefinite, and for the reason that it does not come within the scope of Shoup\u2019s authority as proved.\n. By Mr. Petty: This offer for the purpose of showing that the witness as O\u2019Neil\u2019s emploj^ee was in charge of these boats, from and after April 12th, and at the time of the sheriff\u2019s levy, and that the boat was not in charge or possession of Mr. Braden, or Mr. Shoup, his agent.\nObjected to.\nBy the court: Objection sustained as incompetent. The person put in charge of the property could not in the line of his authority subject the property to other ownership without the assent of Mr. Braden, whose agent he was, and the delivery of the property to others is not within the line of his authority.
