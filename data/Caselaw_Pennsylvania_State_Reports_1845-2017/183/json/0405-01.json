J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from tax settlement.\nSimonton, P. J., filed the following opinion :\nThis is an appeal from a settlement made by the auditor general and state treasurer, April 26, 1896, against the corporation defendant, for tax on capital stock for the tax year 1894. It was tried by the court without a jury, as provided by the act of April 22, 1874, and on the testimony and documentary evidence we find the following facts:\n1. The defendant is a corporation of the state of Pennsylvania, incorporated March 6, 1898. Prior to the beginning of the tax year 1894 it had issued 160,00.0 shares of capital stock of the par value of $50.00 each, on which part of the par value had been paid, leaving them subject to calls for the balance due. At various times during the tax year additional amounts were paid in on 159,153 of these shares until $25.00 in all had been paid oh each share. No more than $6.25 per share has ever been paid on the remaining 847 shares. On September 13, 1894, defendant issued to its stockholders, in proportion to their ownership of shares at that date, 39,910 additional shares of the par value of $50.00 each, on which the stockholders paid in $25.00 per share, receiving certificates showing that the shares were subject to calls for the additional $25.00.\n2. In December, 1894, defendant\u2019s president and treasurer, having first taken the oath prescribed by law, made a report to the auditor general, which stated, inter alia, that defendant\u2019s total authorized capital stock was $10,000,000, divided into 200,000 shares of the par value of $50.00 each, and that 199,910 shares had been issued, on 199,063 of which $25.00 each had been paid, and on the remaining 847 shares $6.25 each. They also reported that the amount of capital so paid in, which was taxable for the tax year 1894, was $3,113,667.97. That the gross earnings during the year were $247,813.89, all of which had been expended in payment of rents, salaries, necessary repairs and interest accrued during the year, leaving no net earnings; and that the average price of sales of stock during the year was $41.37i-, and that defendant owned shares of stock in other corporations, which paid the tax upon their respective capital stocks, $4,992,827; and they accompanied this report with an appraisement in which they stated as follows: \u201cWe have estimated and appraised the average capital stock of said company at its actual value in cash as follows, viz : shares at ' dollars and cents per share, amounting in the whole to $5,150,953.35.\u201d\n3. This appraisement was not made by estimating the shares which had been issued at their actual value in cash, but assuming that shares on which $25.00 had been paid were shown by the average price at which they had sold for during the year to be worth $41.37j-, the amount of the appraisement was fixed at a sum which bore the same proportion to $3,113,667.97 \u2014 which was assumed to bo tbe average amount taxable during tbe year \u2014that $41.37 bears to $25.00, the amount thus arrived at being $5,150,953.35.\n4. The auditor general accepted this report and appraisement and settled an account June 18, 1895, for tax thereon, deducting the value of the shares of the capital stock of other corporations upon which the taxes were paid by those corporations, and charged defendant with a tax at the rate of five mills on $158,126.35, amounting to $790.63, which was paid by defendant.\n5. Afterwards, on April 26, 1896, believing that the former account was settled on an erroneous basis owing to the wrong principle on which the report and appraisement had been made, the auditor general resettled the account against defendant, charging it with a tax on 199,063 shares at the rate of $56.75 per share, that being the highest price of sales of stock between the 1st and 15th days of November, 1894, amounting to $11,296,825, and on 847 shares at $50.00 per share, amounting to $42,350, the total being $11,339,175, which, after there was deducted therefrom $4,992,827, the value of shares of other companies, left taxable $6,346,348, the tax upon which at the rate of five mills amounting to $31,731.74, upon which defendant was entitled to a credit of $790.63, for tax already paid, which the auditor general no doubt inadvertently failed to allow. And from this settlement the appeal now before us was taken.\n6. The testimony produced at the trial, includes a certificate of certain computations made by agreement of the parties by an officer of the Commonwealth Guarantee, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, of Harrisburg, which states, inter alia, \u201c If the average is to be obtained by multiplying the number of shares sold in each transaction, by the price of said transaction, adding together the number of shares and also tbe total proceeds of all tbe sales at the exchange, tbe result thus obtained shows the total number of shares sold from November 6, 1893, to November 3,1894, to have been 325,442, and the aggregate of all sales at tbe stock exchange to have been $16,441,114.27. This aggregate, divided by the number of shares sold, shows a result of $50.52 per share.\u201d There were, as we already show, 39,910 shares distributed by tbe company to its shareholders at $25.00 per share, but as this was a distribution and not a sale, and as tbe evidence shows that the shares at the time this distribution was made were of much greater value than $25.00 each, we do not think these ought to enter into the computation, and we therefore find that the value of each share between the 1st and 15th of November, 1894, was $50.52.\nWe think the- report and appraisement made by defendant\u2019s president and treasurer was made on a wrong basis and resulted in an incorrect settlement by the accounting officers. After reporting the number of shares of stock issued, if all were not issued before the beginning of the tax year; and an apportionment of the tax was asked for on this account, the report should have shown the date during the year when the additional shares were issued. This it did not do, but instead it gave the dates when the several instalments upon the shares were paid during the year, which was of no consequence, as whatever influence this could have upon the appraisement was involved in the selling price of the shares from time to time from which the average price during the year was obtained. And in making the appraisement the president and treasurer did not appraise the stock at so much per share, but appraised the average amount of the money paid in. This was incorrect and misleading, and the settlement made on the basis of this appraisement did inr justice to the commonwealth. The accounting officers were therefore well within the limit of their authority and duty in resettling the account, as this was done within a year from the date of the first settlement. But in this resettlement the tax should have been apportioned on the appraised value of the 89,910 shares for the portion of the -tax year remaining at the date of its issue, and the appraised value of the shares should have b.een fixed at $50.52 per share, instead of $57.75. And as there were no sales of the 847 shares on which only $6.25 had been paid and no evidence was given of their value, we think it equitable to appraise them- at that amount, We therefore reach the following :\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW. .\n1. The settlement made by the auditor general and state treasurer on June 17, 1895, was incorrect, and the amount of tax charged therein was much, less than the amount justly due from defendant to the commonwealth.\n2. The auditor general and state treasure]' had full authority to make the resettlement of April 29,1896, and said settlement is valid and binding on defendant, except as modified herein.\n8. The commonwealth is entitled to recover from defendant a tax at tlie rate of five mills on the dollar of the actual value of its capital stock, as follows, viz: For the whole tax year 1894 on 159,158 shares at $50.52 per share; on 39,063 shares at the same rato per share for the proportion of the tax year remaining on September 13, 189-4, when said shares were issued; and on 847 shares for the whole tax year at $6.25 per share; less $4,992,827 invested in shares of other corporations.\n4. The prothonotary is directed to enter judgment in favor of the commonwealth and against the defendant for the amount of the tax which shall be found due when properly calculated upon the basis stated in the foregoing conclusion, if exceptions be not filed within the time limited by law.\nDefendant\u2019s exceptions alleged that the court erred:\n1. In not including in its sixth finding of fact the whole of the certificate of computations made, by agreement of the parties, by an officer of the Commonwealth Guarantee, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, of Harrisburg, which said certificate is as follows, viz:\n\u201cI hereby certify that, as requested, I have made certain computations from the sales of the capital stock of the People\u2019s Traction Company as said sales appear in a certain affidavit made by Charles O. Kruger, on tlie fifth day of December, 1896, in the case of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. People\u2019s Traction Company, No. 619, Commonwealth Docket, 1896, in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, for the purpose of ascertaining the average price of said sales.\n\u201c Taking the sales at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange by themselves, if the average is'to be determined by taking the highest sale and the lowest sale, adding the two together and dividing the result by two, tbe average thus obtained is $41.37] per share.\n\u201c If the average is to be obtained by multiplying tbe number of shares sold in eacb transaction by tbe price of said transaction, adding together tlie number of shares and also tbe total proceeds of all tlie sales at tlie exchange, tbe result thus obtained shows the total number of shares sold from November 6,\" 1893, to November 3,1894, inclusive, to have been 325,422 shares, and the aggregate of all sales at the Stock Exchange to have been $16,441,114.27. This aggregate divided by the number of shares sold shows a result of $50.52 per share.\n\u201c If the average is to be ascertained by including not only the shares sold at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, but also the 39,910 shares sold by the company itself at $25 per share, then the total of all the shares is 365,332 shares, and the aggregate price for which all said shares were sold $17,438,864.27. This aggregate divided by the number of shares sold shows a result of $47.73 per share. I believe the foregoing computations to-be correct.\u201d\n2. In that portion of its sixth finding which reads as follows:\n\u201cThere were, as already shown, 39,910 shares distributed by the company to its shareholders at $25.00 per share, but as this was a distribution and not a sale, and as the evidence shows that the shares at the time tins distribution was made were of much greater value than $25.00 each, we do not think these ought to enter into the computation, and we therefore find that the value of each share between the 1st and 15th of November, 1894, was $50.52.\u201d\nThe fact being, as shown by the undisputed testimony, that \u201c the new shares issued by the company were not subscribed for, but were sold outright by the company at $25.00 per share, that being the par value of the amount paid in.\u201d\n3. In not finding as a fact, which clearly appears from the undisputed testimony in the case, that:\n\u201c There was upon the stock exchange a good deal of speculation in this company\u2019s shares, as may readily be seen from the wide and violent fluctuations in price. Furthermore, the transactions upon the stock exchange represent many more thousand shares of stock than were actually transferred upon the books of the company during said ye&T.\n\u201cThe gross receipts of the company during the year were $247,813.89, while its expenses, including interest, amounted to $249,264.51. The company was incorporated March 6, 1893. It paid no dividends in either 1893 or 1894. The value of the stock depended to a large extent upon the future success of the company, and upon the success of the People\u2019s Passenger Railway Company, in whose shares the capital stock of the People\u2019s Traction Company was largely invested. There was nothing in the character of the property and assets of the business of either company up to that time to indicate intrinsic value in the capital stock of the People\u2019s Traction Company largely in excess of the amount which had been paid in upon each share, and no more than $25.00 had been paid in on any share.\u201d\n4. In not taking into consideration the 39,910 shares of stock sold by the company at $25.00 per share.\n5. In not finding the fact, as requested in No. 4 of defendant\u2019s request for findings of fact, that:\n\u201c During the tax year 1894 there was a great deal of speculation in defendant\u2019s shares, the transactions at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange aggregating 325,422 shares, or nearly twice as much as the entire capital stock of the company. Taking the highest sale and the lowest sale, adding the two together, and dividing the resirlt by two, the average thus obtained is $41.37 J per share for $25.00 paid shares.\u201d\n6. In not finding the fact, as requested in No. 6 of defendant\u2019s request for findings of fact, that:\n\u201c The actual value in cash of defendant\u2019s capital stock, not less than the average price which said stock sold for during said year ending with the first Monday of November, 1894, did not exceed $41f per share for $25.00 paid shares, or a premium of 65-^ per cent.\u201d\n7. In not taking into consideration under all the circumstances of the case, the 39,910 shares of stock sold by the company at $25.00 per share in determining the average price of sales of stock.\n8. In not finding as a matter of law that under the facts of this case the proper method of determining the average sales of stock was by taking the highest and lowest sales during the year, and accepting the mean thereon as said average.\n9. In its first conclusion of law :\n\u201c The settlement made by the auditor general and state treasurer on June 17,1895, was incorrect, and the amount of tax charged therein was much less than the amount justly due from defendant to the commonwealth.\u201d\n10. In its second conclusion of law:\n\u201c The auditor general and state treasurer had full authority to make the resettlement of April 29,1896, and said settlement is valid and binding on defendant, except as modified herein.\u201d\n11. In its third conclusion of law:\n\u201c The commonwealth is entitled to recover from defendant a tax at the rate of five mills on the dollar, of the actual value of its capital stock, as follows, viz: For the whole tax jear 1894 on 159,153 shares at $50.52 per share; on 39,063 shares at the same rate per share, for the proportion of the tax year remaining on September 13, 1894, when said shares were issued; and on 847 shares for the whole tax year at $6.25 per share; less $4,992,827 invested in shares of other corporations.\u201d\n12. In its fourth conclusion of law:\n\u201c The prothonotary is directed to enter judgment in favor of the 'commonwealth, and against the defendant for the amount of tax which shall be found due when properly calculated upon the basis stated in the foregoing conclusion, if exceptions be not filed within the time limited by law.\u201d\n13. In finding and holding to be taxable, a valuation of the shares of defendant\u2019s capital stock, instead of a valuation of its tangible property and assets, and its franchises, between the first and fifteenth days of November, 1894.\n14. In directing judgment to be entered in favor of the commonwealth and against defendant.\n15. In not directing judgment to be entered in favor of defendant.\nSimonton, P. J., filed the following opinion on exceptions.\nException 1: We have included in the sixth finding of fact all the certificate made by agreement of the parties which we consider pertinent. The whole certificate is in the record, and this exception is sustained to the extent that we hereby refer to said certificate and make it a part of our sixth finding.\nException 2: This exception is overruled. The new shares were not sold on the market, but were taken by the then shareholders at par of the amount paid in, the market price being at that time much above par. It is true that the defendant\u2019s treasurer stated in his affidavit: \u201c The new shares issued by the company were not subscribed for, but were sold outright by the*-company at $25.00 per share, that being the par value1 of the amount paid in.\u201d But he also said: \u201cThe holders of the existing 160,000 shares were permitted to acquire the new shares in the proportion of one share of new stock to every four shares of old stock.\u201d\nThe fair inference from these statements is that which we have drawn, namely, that the shares were allotted to the stockholders in proportion to their holdings at par of the amount paid in. When proof of facts is tendered in the form of an affidavit, we cannot be bound to accept the affiant\u2019s inferences involved either in the language or in the form of the affidavit, but must be at liberty to draw such inferences as the facts seem to us to warrant.\nException 3: This exception is overruled. Much of the matter quoted in this exception is opinion and inference, and all of it is irrelevant, as the average selling price of the shares was conclusive evidence of the actual value of the capital stock.\nThe court dismissed the other exceptions.\nErrors assigned were (1 \u2014 15) in overruling exceptions, quoting them.\nM.
