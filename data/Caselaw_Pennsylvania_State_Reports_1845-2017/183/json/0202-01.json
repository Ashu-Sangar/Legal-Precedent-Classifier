The appropriation was a very reasonable one; and the purpose for which it was made was certainly not foreign to the material interests and general prosperity of the municipality, but quite the contrary.

Such an appropriation does not violate article 9, section 7, of the constitution, which forbids a municipality \u201c to appropriate money or loan its credit to any corporation, association, institution, or individual.\u201d\nArgued Oct. 26, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 67, Oct. T., 1897, by defendants, from order of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., April T., 1897, No. 123, awarding peremptory mandamus.\nBefore Steriiett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for mandamus.\nThe facts and sufficient of the allegations of the petition and answer appear by the opinion of the lower court, White, J., which was as follows:\nThis case comes before us on an amicable submission, to decide the legal questions involved. The original petition, answer and demurrer, were filed the same day, January 22,1897. At the hearing certain facts seemed to be necessary to a proper decision of the case, and the relators were allowed to amend. The amendment, answer thereto and demurrer, were filed at the same time, March 18,1897, and the case submitted for final disposition.\nThe relators were \u201c The Provisional Committee of the Lake Erie and Ohio River Ship Canal,\u201d appointed in pursuance of a resolution of the board of directors of the chamber of commerce of the city of Pittsburg, passed July 2, 1894, for determining the practicability of such a canal, and the benefits and advantages that would accrue from it to the trade and industries of Pittsburg, and if found such, to secure a corporation of private capital to undertake it, or the national government to undertake it. Pursuant thereto the committee raised, by voluntary subscriptions, $29,000, which were expended in the employment of'-engineers, gathering statistics, etc., and were unanimously of opinion that tbe proposed canal \u201cwas entirely practicable and feasible, and would be of inestimable value to the city of Pitts-burg and its citizens, by increasing the trade and commerce of said city.\u201d Finding that the fund voluntarily subscribed was not sufficient to complete their work, and \u201c to remove all doubts as to the practicability of the project, and to establish clearly its great utility to the commerce, trade and industries of the city of Pittsburg,\u201d they wished \u201c to employ impartial experts to test and examine the work and to complete the work in the most perfect detail,\u201d and for that purpose appeared before the councils of the city, \u201c and gave a full explanation and history of their work done, and stated that the money requested was to be used by the committee in completing their work in the most perfect and detailed manner,\u201d and the necessity and great utility of such a canal for the people of Pittsburg. Thereupon the councils of the city unanimously passed an ordinance, July 11, 1895, which was duly approved by the mayor, for the appropriation of $10,000 out of the revenues of the city for the fiscal year, commencing February 1, 1896, \u201ctobe expended solely for the purpose of the provisional committee of the Lake Erie and Ohio River Ship Canal, a public improvement and highway designed to promote the commercial interests of the city, the sum, or so much thereof as shall be required, shall be paid by the controller upon proper vouchers and affidavits presented and made by the chairman of said committee, to the treasurer thereof, and \u25a0shall be charged to appropriation No. .\u201d\nThe relators say that, \u201c relying upon the faith of said ordinance and appropriation, they subsequently entered into contracts, and expended in carrying out the work contemplated, requiring the sum of $7,500 ($5,000 yet remaining- unpaid), $2,500 being advanced by the relators, and that in addition thereto, some $1,500 will be needed for publishing the reports, etc., making a total of $9,000, which will be necessary to finish the work.\u201d That on application to H. I. Gourley, the controller, for the certificate for a warrant for the appropriation, he refused to issue the same, for reasons stated in his letter of June 5,1896, addressed to the chairman of the committee, in which he says: \u201c I very reluctantly decline to issue the certificate. . . . The conclusion which I am compelled to reach is based on a provision of the state constitution, which I am advised prevents the use of public money for the purpose designed. I can see no way, at the present time, by which the money can be placed in the possession of your committee.\u201d\nAt the argument on the original petition, answer and de\u25a0murrer, it was further urged that the relators had not presented vouchers and affidavits, as required by the ordinance of July, and also that all appropriations, under the general ordinances of the city, must be made at the beginning of the fiscal year, in January or February. It was claimed by the relators that they \u2022had given or would give the vouchers, etc., and also that in the annual appropriation ordinance of February, 1896, this specific sum of $10,000 was included. The relators were permitted to amend on these points. The amendment filed March 13,1897, showed a compliance as to the vouchers and affidavits, and also the general appropriation ordinance of February, 1896, containing this item: \u201c 47. Lake Erie Ship Canal, $10,000.\u201d The ordinance is headed : \u201c Appropriations for 1896. The following sums of money are hereby specifically appropriated for the purposes hereinafter set forth.\u201d\nIn the answer of the controller to the amendment, he denies that the $10,000 in the ordinance of February, 1896, should be paid to the relators, because it is \u201c an appropriation made to and for a different and distinct body entirely, namely, the Lake Erie Ship Canal.\u201d If the answer raised a question of fact it would have to be referred to a jury. But I do not understand that the controller raises a question of fact, but a legal question upon the words of the ordinance. In considering this question we must take into consideration all the circumstances. It is not alleged that there is any corporation or association by the name of the \u201cLake Erie Ship Canal.\u201d If there is none such, then the appropriation could not have been intended for a nonentity. The appropriation in the ordinance of February, 1896, was manifestly intended to refer to the ordinance of July, 1895. That ordinance did not appropriate the money at that time, for it expressly provided it shall be paid out of the revenues of 1896. The ordinance of February, 1896, was intended to carry out the ordinance of July, 1895. It is for the precise sum, and there is no appropriation to the provisional committee. The object is the same in both ordinances. It was suggested in the argument that possibly the city might have to pay the sum twice. Perhaps that was a good reason for raising the question. But certainly the city is in no danger. There is no body now in existence that can claim this money, as the \u201c Lake Erie Ship Canal.\u201d No doubt if the money be paid to the relators under the order of court the city will be fully protected, especially as no body or person representing the \u201c Lake Erie Ship Canal \u201d has appeared for more than a year to claim this money. When the controller wrote his letter to the committee, June 5, 1896, doubtless he knew of the appropriation in the ordinance of February, but he did not give that as any reason for refusing to certify a warrant; nor does he refer to it in his answer to the original petition, filed January 22, 1897.\nThe other, and perhaps the main question in the case, is the one raised in the controller\u2019s letter to the committee. Had the councils power to make the appropriation ? The section of the constitution referred to (art. 9, sec. 7) is in these words: \u201c The general assembly shall not authorize any county, city, borough, township, or incorporated district, to become a stockholder in any company, association or corporation, or to obtain or appropriate money or loan its credit to any corporation, association, institution or individual.\u201d The principle of this section is not new. It is substantially the same as an amendment to the constitution of 1837, adopted in 1857. It is the same as in the constitution of Ohio. The city of Cincinnati, under an act of the legislature of that state providing that cities of the first class when a railroad was material to the development of a city might contract a loan and build a railroad, actually built a railroad entirely outside of the state of Ohio, except the bridge over the Ohio river, which connected it with the city. The Supreme Court of Ohio gave an interpretation to that section of their constitution, 21 Ohio, 52-4. Our Supreme Court, in Wheeler v. Philadelphia, '77 Pa. 338, adopted the interpretation of the Supreme Court of Ohio, as contained in the opinion of Scott, Chief Justice, by this quotation: \u201cThe mischief which tins section interdicts is a business partnership between a municipal or subordinate division of the state, and individuals or private corporations or associations. It forbids the union of public or private capital or credit in any enterprise whatever. In no project originated by individuals, whether associated or otherwise, with a view to gain, are the municipal bodies named permitted to participate in such manner as to incur pecuniary expense or liability. They may neither become stockholders, nor furnish money or credit for the benefit of the parties interested therein. As this alliance between the public and private interests is clearly prohibited in respect to all enterprises of whatever kind, if we hold that these municipal bodies cannot do on their own account what they are forbidden to do on the joint account of themselves and private parties, it follows that they are powerless to make any improvements, however necessary, with their own means, and on their own sole account. We maybe very sure that a purpose so unreasonable was never entertained by the framers of the constitution.\u201d\n\u25a0 , In this case the city of Pittsburg does not propose to build the canal, or to loan or appropriate money for that purpose, or to join with any person, association or corporation for that purpose. It simply appropriates $10,000 \u2014 a very small sum for the city in view of the great object aimed at \u2014 for surveys, getting information, etc., to ascertain whether a ship canal between Pittsburg and Lake Erie is practicable, and would be a benefit to the city.\nThat such a ship canal is practicable, and would be of very great benefit to the trade and industries of Pittsburg, must be taken as true, in this case, for the provisional committee so reported, and it is so stated in the ordinance of July 11, 1895, and is not controverted by the controller in his answers. There can be no doubt, if practicable, it would be of immense importance to Pittsburg to have a ship canal from here to Lake Erie.\nIt is objected that the provisional committee was appointed by the chamber of commerce, and not by the city. That is true in one sense. But they are all citizens and business men of the city. It was evidently proper for the chamber of commerce, the incorporated body representing the commerce and business of the city, to take the initiative in the matter. Besides, the committee appeared before councils, giving a history and explanation of the project, what they had done, and what they proposed doing, and in view of those facts the councils unanimously passed the ordinance of Juty, 1895, thus sanctioning the investigation, and indorsing the appointment of the committee.\nThe objection that the canal would be outside th\u00f3 boundaries of the city, I do not think is entitled to much consideration. There can be no doubt the city could establish gas works or waterworks beyond the city limits to supply the citizens with gas and water; or could purchase and erect a poorhouse outside of the city limits, which was recently done. And in that case some expense was incurred in ascertaining a good location.\n,The real question is, was a preliminary investigation as to the feasibility of a ship canal, connecting Pittsburg with Lake Erie, and its advantages to Pittsburg, a proper subject for the councils to inquire into and appropriate a reasonable sum for that purpose. If so, I have no doubt of the power of the councils to make the appropriation. There is no complaint of the amount appropriated in this ease. It is certainly very reasonable, as the relators, by private subscriptions, had raised and expended for that purpose $29,000 before they asked councils to appropriate the $10,000.\nThere is another and good reason why the relators should have this money. The ordinance of July, 1895, pledged the .city for $10,000. No objection was made to it by the controller or any other citizen until the controller refused to certify a warrant, in June, 1896, nearly one year after the passage of the ordinance. In the meantime, on the faith of that ordinance, the committee contracted debts in carrying out the very object declared in the ordinance, and actually advanced $2,500. Shall they suffer this loss, or the city pay what it promised to pay. them, on- the faith of which they incurred the expense ? Even if there is a doubt about the power of the city to pass the ordinance of July, 1895, or some legal irregularity in the ordinance of February, 1896, good faith and common honesty would require the city to pay.\nThe relators have incurred debts, for which proper vouchers have been furnished, to the amount of $7,500. They can only ask for a certificate for that amount at this time. The reports and statistics should undoubtedly be printed for public information. The city would otherwise lose the entire fruits of the investigation. The committee are of opinion it will require $1,500 more for that purpose. When these are printed it will be time enough to ask for another certificate.\nThe following decree was entered:\nAnd now, March 18, 1897, this case came on to be heard, and was argued by counsel, and upon due consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed, that a writ of peremptory mandamus issue upon H. I. Gourley, controller of the city of Pittsburg, directing\u2019 him to issue and approve a warrant to the provisional committee of the Lake Erie and Ohio River Ship Canal, for the payment to them of the sum of $7,500, as set forth in the sworn statement, filed by John B. Jackson, treasurer .of said committee, with the said controller.\nError assigned was decree of the court.\nJ. H. Beal, with him Clarence Burleigh, for appellants.\nWithout express legislative authority the city has no power to make such an appropriation as this: 1 Dillon on Municipal Corporations, see. 149 ; Sharpless v. Mayor, 21 Pa. 147; Penna. E. E. Co. v. Phila., 47 Pa. 189.\nThe appropriation in this case is within the prohibition of article IX., sec. 7, of the constitution: Speer v. School Directors, 50 Pa. 150; Penna. E. E. v. Phila., 47 Pa. 189; Wheeler v. Phila., 77 Pa. 338; Wilkes-Barre City Hospital v. Luzerne Co., 84 Pa. 59.\nJ. W. Kinnear, John 0. Slack and John U.
