If \u201c the amount of money really in controversy in \u201d the case under consideration \u201c is not greater than one thousand dollars, exclusive of costs,\u201d the Superior Court clearly has jurisdiction. The record shows that while the plaintiff, in his statement, claimed more than $1,000, his claim in this appeal is less than $1,000. On the trial, the learned judge submitted to the jury the question as to the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and they rendered a verdict in his favor for $800, subject to tbe opinion of tbe court on the question of law reserved; and afterwards the court disposed of that question by entering judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto. From that judgment plaintiff took this appeal and assigns for error the refusal of the court to enter judgment on the verdict for the amount ($800) found by tbe jury. He thus by his pleading limits his claim to that sum, and it follows that we have no jurisdiction.\nIt is therefore ordered that this appeal be remitted to the Superior Court, at the costs of the appellants, for hearing and decision.",
