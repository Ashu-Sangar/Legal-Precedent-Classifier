Pittsburg Bridge Company, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Master and servant \u2014 Defective machinery \u2014 Safety device\u2014 Question for jury.\nIn an action by an employee against his employer to recover damages for personal injuries caused by an accidental change of gear of a crane so constructed as to be operated by either a, slow or fast gear, the case is for the jury where the evidence for the plaintiff shows that the accident could have been prevented by a safety lock, a well known and not expensive device, bud the testimony is conflicting as to the general use of such a device on cranes similarily constructed and operated.\nArgued Nov. 1, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 133, Oct. T., 1897, by defendant, from judgment of Superior Court, Ajiril T., 1897, No. 168, affirming judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., Oct. T., 1895, No. 732, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, G. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nThe facts appear by the report of the case in 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 281. See Bonner v. Bridge Co., ante, 195.\nError assigned was in affirming judgment of the court of common pleas.\nW. P. Potter, with him Wm. A. Stone, for appellant.\nNothing is better settled under the law of Pennsylvania than that an employer is not bound to furnish for his workmen the safest machinery and provide the best methods for its operation in order to save himself from responsibility for accidents resulting from its use. If the \u2022 machinery be of ordinary character, and such as can, with reasonable care, be used without danger to his employees, it is all that can be required of the employer: Drew v. Gaylord Coal Co., 3 Kulp, 207; Faber v. Carlisle Mfg. Co., 126 Pa. 387; Pittsburg R. R. v. Sentmeyer, 92 Pa. 276; McAvoy v. Pa. Woolen Co., 140 Pa. 1; Coal Co. v. Hayes, 128 Pa. 294; Phila. & Read. R. R. v. Hughes, 119 Pa. 302; Shaffer v. Haish, 110 Pa. 575; Payne v. Reese, 100 Pa. 301; Iron Ship Building Works v.\u2019Nuttall, 119 Pa. 149.\nThe master is not responsible for injuries to an employee; the result of carelessness or negligence on the part of such employee\u2019s fellow workmen: Barlow v. Steel Co., 154 Pa. 130.\nIn an action for negligence \u2014 the proximate, and not the remote cause of the injury suffered is to he considered.\nJohn F. Miller, with him James F. Burke, for appellee.\nIt is not contended on the part of plaintiff that an employer is hound to furnish the Lest possible tools, machinery and appliances for the use of his workmen. It is, however, well settled law that he must provide machinery, tools and appliances which, with the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care on the part of the workmen, can be used with safety: Faber v. Carlisle Mfg. Co., 126 Pa. 387; Coal Co. v. Hayes, 128 Pa. 294; Brown v. Hughes, 128 Pa. 194; Phila. & Reading R. R. v. Hughes, 119 Pa. 301.\nNovember 8, 1897:"
