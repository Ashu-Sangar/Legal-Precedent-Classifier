The learned court\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law and opinion on defendant\u2019s exceptions \u2014 of which its judgment is predicated \u2014 are all fully set forth in the record. A careful perusal and eonsideration- of these, with special reference to the specifications of error, has led us all to the conclusion that neither of said specifications should be sustained. YVe find no substantial error in any of the learned trial judge\u2019s findings of fact or legal conclusions. All the questions involved in this appeal have been so fully considered and so satisfactorily disposed of by him in the opinions referred to that little, if anything, can be profitably added to what has been so well said therein.

P. Dauphin Co., Commonwealth Docket, 1896, No. 870, on trial by court without a jury.\nBefore Steiirett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from tax settlement.\nMcPherson, J., filed the following opinion:\nThis case was tried without a jury under the provisions of the act of 1874. We find the facts to be as follows :\n1. The defendant is a domestic corporation. During the year 1895 its indebtedness was $750,000, evidenced by three series of bonds, each series being secured by a separate mortgage.\n2. Of this amount $10,000 was held and owned by a corporation of Pennsylvania paying tax upon its capital stock; $278,000 was held by domestic corporations as trustees, agents or attorneys in fact, or by individual residents of Pennsylvania either as agents or trustees or in their own right; $17,000 was held by nonresidents and $447,000 was held by persons concerning whose residence defendant\u2019s treasurer reported that it could not be ascertained after diligent and careful inquiry. Of tbe last mentioned item $67,000 was held in 1895 by domestic corporations as trustees or by domestic corporations having no capital stock and paying no tax upon capital stock.\n3. The defendant\u2019s bonds are all coupon bonds, the coupons being payable to bearer. Interest coupons are ordinarily presented by the messengers of banks, brokers and other collecting agencies, who rarely know, or refuse to disclose, the names of the owners of the bonds or coupons.\n4. Concerning the diligence of the defendant\u2019s treasurer, the testimony is vague and unsatisfactory. It has failed to convince us that the proper search was made after the owners of the bonds. The treasurer does not state the facts from which he draws the following important inferences: that he \u201c made every possible effort to ascertain the residence of the holders;\u201d that \u201c the most thorough investigation possible .... has failed to disclose the ownership of the bonds .... further than is above shown; \u201d and that he has \u201c no means of knowledge \u201d that any other bonds than those reported were held in Pennsylvania. It does not help the matter to add with like vagueness that \u201c the sources from which coupons were received would seem to indicate that the bonds, the ownership of which could not he ascertained as above shown, were wholly outside of the state.\u201d In a word, the treasurer gives his figures in lump sums, without schedules of persons and items, does not state how he obtained the information upon which he acted, fails to specify what that information was, and draws his own conclusion'(which we are asked to accept without the means of verifying its accuracy) that his investigation has been \u201cthe most thorough investigation possible \u201d and that he has made \u201c every possible effort.\u201d\nObviously such an inference is equivalent to a decision of the point in controversy, and this is not within his province. It is his duty to detail the various steps he has taken; and thereupon it becomes the duty of the court to decide whether he has made diligent inquiry. A treasurer\u2019s report may in itself furnish sufficient evidence of diligence, but from some source the court must learn what he has done before it is possible to draw the inference that he has discharged his full duty. From the evidence now offered we cannot avoid the finding that the defendant\u2019s \u25a0 treasurer did not use due diligence and care in making inquiry during the year in question. Accordingly the company is liable for his default.\nCONCLUSION OU LAW.\nThe commonwealth is. entitled to recover as follows:\nPrincipal, four mills on $723,000, . . $2,892 00\nLess treasurer\u2019s commission, .... 144 60\nBalance, .... $2,747 40\nInterest at 12 per cent., from October 30, 1896,\nto March 30, 1897, ..... 137 38\nAttorney General\u2019s commission, . . . 137 38\nTotal, .... $3^022] 6\nDefendant\u2019s exceptions alleged that the court erred as follows :\n1. In not finding as a fact that in the blank form prescribed by the auditor general defendant\u2019s treasurer did, for the year 1895, make to the auditor general the following report and accompanying schedules, viz: .\n\u201c REPORT OE LOANS, VIZ :\n\u201c Scrip, bonds, mortgages, promissory notes, bills, judgments, certificates or other evidences of indebtedness, issued or assumed by the People\u2019s Passenger Railway Company for the year ended December 31st, 1895.\n\u201cAddress of company \u2014 Philadelphia, Penna.,\n\u201cDate \u2014 November 4, 1895.\n\u201c To the Auditor General of Pennsylvania :\n\u201c In accordance with the provisions of the fourth section of the act of June 30, 1885, and the first section of the act of June 8, 1891, and the requirements of your department, I make, as treasurer of the above-named corporation, the following report of the indebtedness of said company for the year 1895, and I do also hereby assess each and every of the scrip, bonds and other evidences of its indebtedness at its nominal value, and report the amount of indebtedness of the corporation owned by residents of the commonwealth and others, as nearly as the same can be ascertained, as follows :\nNominal par value of all scrip, bonds, mortgages, promissory notes (except notes discounted or negotiated by banks or savings institutions), penal or single bills, judgments or other evidences of indebtedness held or possessed by any person, persons, co-partnership, unincorporated association, company, joint stock association or company, limited partnership, bank or corporation, in his, her, their or its own right or as active trustee, agent, attorney in fact, or in any other capacity, for the use, benefit or advantage of any other person, association, partnership, company or corporation.\n$750,000.00 Total indebtedness ....\nNominal par value of said indebtedness owned by non-residents of Pennsylvania, .\nNominal par value of said indebtedness held, owned or possessed by individual residents of Pennsylvania, or by any co-partnership, unincorporated association, company, joint stock association or company, limited partnership, bank or corporation', in their own right,\nHeld, owned or possessed by them as trustee, agent, attorney in fact or in any other capacity, .......\nSee schedule of \\ loans hereto attached.\n(Signed) . \u201c D.

D. 1895, personally appeared before me, a notary public in and for the county aforesaid, D.- C. Golden, treasurer of the said company, who, being duly sw'orn according to law, did depose and say that the foregoing report and the attached schedule of indebtedness, with the amounts owned by residents and non-residents of Pennsylvania, respectively, as nearly as the same can be ascertained, after diligent inquiry having been made, is correct and true.\n(Signed) \u201cD. C. Golden,\n\u201c Treasurer.\n\u201c Sworn and subcribed before me the day and year last aforesaid.\n[seal.] \u201cWm. F. Boyd,\n\u201c Notary Public.\u201d\n2. In not finding the facts set forth in the undisputed affidavit of D. C. Golden, defendant\u2019s treasurer, which was admitted in evidence without exception, as follows:\n[ am the treasurer of the People\u2019s Passenger Railway Company and was such treasurer in 1895. The bonded indebtedness of the said company during said year was $750,000, as reported by me to the auditor general, N ovember 4, 1895, consisting of three separate loans as follows, viz:\nFirst mortgage, five per cent bonds, . . $285,000\nFirst mortgage, seven per cent bonds, . 219,000\nConsolidated mortgage, five per cent bonds, . 240,000\n1 made every possible effort to ascertain the residence of the holders of these bonds in the year 1895 with the following result:\nInterest upon the first mortgage, seven per cent bonds is payable January 15 and July 15 in each. year. At the payment of interest due January 15, 1895, $10,000 of these bonds were held by tlie Spring Garden Fire Insurance Company, a corporation of tlie state of Pennsylvania paying tax upon its capital stock; $194,000 were held by individual residents of Pennsylvania or by corporations or others in trust; $15,000 were held by nonresidents of Pennsylvania.\nAt the payment of tlie July interest $10,000 were held by the Spring Garden Insurance Company, $192,000 by residents of Pennsylvania, and $17,000 by nonresidents.\nThe interest upon the first mortgage, five per cent bonds, $285,000, is also payable January 15 and July 15. At tlie date of the January payment of interest $48,000 were beld by individual residents of Pennsylvania, or by corporations in trust, and $237,000 by persons whose residence could not be ascertained. At the payment of the July interest $33,000 Avere held by individual residents of Pennsylvania, or by corporations in trust, and $252,000 by persons whose residence could not be ascertained.\nUpon the consolidated mortgage, five per cent bonds, $246,000, interest is payable March and September. At the payment of interest March 1, 1895, $32,000 of these bonds were held by individual residents of Pennsylvania, or by corporations in trust, and $214,000 by persons whose residence could not be ascertained. At the payment of September interest $86,000 \\yere* held by residents of Pennsylvania, or by corporations in trust, and $210,000 by persons whose residence could not be ascertained.\nThe company\u2019s bonds are all coupon bonds, the coupons being negotiable and payable to bearer. Coupons representing the interest upon those bonds mentioned above as held or owned by persons whose residence could not be ascertained were presented by banks, brokers and other collection agencies through their messengers, who either did not know or refused to disclose the names of the owners of the bonds from which the said coupons had been detached. The most thorough investigation possible for me to make has failed to disclose the ownership of the bonds of the. company in 1895 further than is above shown.\nI have no knowledge, or means of knowledge, that any other than the bonds- above reported are, or were in 1895, held or owned by residents of Pennsylvania, or by corporations of Pennsylvania or others in trust. The sources from which the coupons were received would seem to indicate that the bonds, the ownership of which could not be ascertained as above shown, were wholly outside' of the state.\n3. In its fourth finding of facts.\n4. The learned court erred in not finding as a conclusion of law that the report, and the schedules which form part thereof, having been made by defendant\u2019s treasurer, the officer designated by the fourth section of the act of June 30, 1885, under oath, must be presumed to be correct in the absence of proof to the contrary. \u25a0\n5. In not sustaining the first objection specified in defendant\u2019s appeal, said objection being as follows, viz:\n\u201c In the settlement of account hereby appealed from, tax to the amount of $1,890,000 is charged upon $472,500 of bonds, none of which are known, or can be ascertained to be held, or to have been held or owned, at any time during the year 1895 by residents of Pennsylvania. The state cannot lawfully impose a tax upon property, persons or business not within her jurisdiction. The acts of June 30, 1885, June 1, 1889, and June 8, 1891, cannot, nor can either or any of them, be construed to require the companj-, or the treasurer thereof, to retain a tax from interest paid upon bonds, save such only as are held by residents of Pennsylvania; or if they can, they are void because in conflict with section 10 of article I., of the constitution of the United States as impairing the obligation of contracts. And the state of Pennsylvania, having forced, or attempted to force, upon the company appellant an obligation to act as tax collector not provided for in its charter, cannot, in any event, hold the company responsible for failure to collect a tax upon bonds until it shall be shown that said bonds are taxable by reason of their ownership within the state.\u201d\n6. In not sustaining the eighth objection specified in defendant\u2019s appeal, said objection being as follows, viz :\nAll the indebtedness of the corporation appellant is evidenced by bonds which have attached to them coupons representing the interest from time to time accruing, which coupons are payable to bearer, and are detachable from all said bonds and are separate and distinct contracts possessing all the attributes of commercial paper, the title to which passes by delivery, and the same may be owned, and often are owned, when presented for payment, by persons other than those who own the bonds to which they were originally attached; and if the act of June 30, 1885, the act of June 1, 1889, or the act of June 8, 1891, requires the company to withhold from persons owning and presenting the coupons a tax due upon bonds owned by other persons, then the said act impairs the obligation of the contract between the company and the owner of the coupon, and is in conflict with section 10 of article I. of the constitution of the United States and is, therefore, void.\n7. In its conclusion of law as follows, viz:\nThe commonwealth is entitled to recover as follows :\nPrincipal, four mills on \u00a7723,000, . . . \u00a72,892 00\nLess treasurer\u2019s commission, .... 144 60\nBalance,.......\u00a72,747 40\nInterest at 12 per cent from October 30, 1896, to\nMarch 30, 1897,...... 137 38\nAttorney general\u2019s commission, . . . 137 38\nTotal,.......\u00a73,022 16\n8. In not finding that the defendant company, having upon a similar report and similar testimony been held by this Court to be not liable for a tax on bonds lield b}?- persons of unknown residence for the year 1890, in Com. v. People\u2019s Passenger Railway Co., No. 386, September term, 1891, in Dauphin common pleas, cannot reasonably be expected to make a different report for 1895, or to detail at greater length the steps taken by defendant, or its treasurer, to ascertain the residence of the bondholders in 1895.\n, 9. In not finding as a conclusion of law that, defendant\u2019s treasurer having reported to the auditor general under oath for the year 1895 that the amount of defendant\u2019s indebtedness \u201c owned by residents and nonresidents, of Pennsylvania, respectively, as nearly as the same can be ascertained after diligent inquiry having been made,\u201d and also the \u201camount thereof held or owned by persons whose residence cannot be ascertained after diligent and careful inquiry,\u201d defendant is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, entitled to the presumption of law that said report is correct and that diligent and careful inquiry was made.\n10. In not directing judgment to be entered in favor of defendant.\nThe court filed the following opinion on defendant\u2019s exceptions :\nIn answer to the first exception, we find the facts to be as therein stated, namely: the defendant\u2019s treasurer did make the report as specified.\nTiie remaining exceptions must be overruled, but a few words may be said as to the eighth, fourth and ninth. The eighth exception rests upon an averment of fact that was not supported by any evidence at the trial, and for this sufficient reason cannot now be considered. The fourth and ninth exceptions raise a question of importance. The report made by the defendant\u2019s treasurer contains an averment that the amount of the company\u2019s indebtedness \u201cowned by residents and nonresidents of Pennsylvania respectively, as nearly as the same can be ascertained after diligent inquiry having been made,\u201d has been correctly returned; and a further averment, that the \u201c amount thereof held or owned by persons whose residence cannot be ascertained after diligent and careful inquiry\u201d is also correctly stated. These are the formal averments of every report on this subject made to the auditor general, and therefore the question now raised is in the interest of every domestic corporation collecting the tax upon corporate loans. The defendant argues that these averments are prima facie true, and cast upon the commonwealth the burden of proving that the duties imposed upon the treasurer have not been fulfilled. We do not agree with this position. For the purposes of this tax, the treasurer of the corporation is not an independent official, but the agent of the commonwealth, required by statute to undertake a special service. His duties are clearly defined; he must assess the tax upon corporate loans against resident owners, and collect it from persons liable to pay; and he must also report annually to the auditor general how much of the corporate indebtedness is owned by residents of Pennsylvania as nearly as the same can be ascertained. In making this report, which requires him to make a proper effort to ascertain who the bondholders are and where they reside, he is in the position of any other agent making report to bis principal. It is not within the power of such an agent to sit in judgment upon his own conduct, and decide either finally or provisionally that he has fulfilled his duty. He may report in these terms if he chooses or is required so to do; but if the principal is not satisfied, his right to call for a detailed account of the agent\u2019s conduct cannot be doubted. It is true that a public officer \u2014 assuming the treasurer to be a public officer \u2014 is presumed to do his duty; but this presumption is usually applied when his conduct is questioned by some other person than his superior. Generally, it does not apply when the superior is scrutinizing his subordinate\u2019s report. To allow it to prevail in such a situation would reverse the relation of the parties and make the subordinate the temporary superior. For the time at least, he would thus be relieved of any liability to account and would be bound to offer explanation only after his superior had made some attempt to prove the negative averment, that he had not fulfilled his duty.\nMoreover, according to a well known rule of evidence, where the subject-matter of a negative averment lies peculiarly within the knowledge of one party, the burden lies upon him to disprove it, although under ordinary circumstances, the burden of proof might be upon his antagonist: 1 Greenleaf onEvid. (13th ed.) sec. 79. The reason of the rule applies to the case in hand. Here, and in all similar controversies, unless the commonwealth calls the treasurer as a witness, it is a very difficult task to discover whether proper diligence has been exercised. The kind and degree of effort made by the treasurer to discover the residence of the bondholders, the examination he may have made of the corporate records and correspondence, the use made of other sources of information that may be open to him \u2014 in short, all the details of his conduct \u2014 lie peculiarly within his own knowledge, and therefore, should be disclosed by his own lips. He should describe with sufficient minuteness what he has done; but he an ay not draw an inference in his own favor from undisclosed facts, and treat it. as evidence that requires the commonwealth to rebut it.\nThis particular question has not yet been decided in Pennsylvania, but for years we have been acting in the opposite sense. It has always been the practice in this court to require from the treasurer not only the formal report made upon the blank furnished by the department, but also affirmative testimony concerning the manner in which he has discharged the duty imposed by law. Believing this practice to be correct, because warranted by the statute and by legal principles, we decline to adopt the position urged upon us by the two exceptions now under consideration.\nThe exceptions are overruled, and judgment is directed to be entered in accordance with the opinion previously filed.\nError assigned was in overruling exceptions to the opinion of the court.\nM.

Olmsted, for appellant.\nThe treasurer of the defendant company has faithfully performed the duties imposed upon him by statute, according to the interpretation of the court below, and has made the report in the exact language of the learned judge, which is also the act of assembly; that is to say, has reported the corporate indebtedness owned by residents of Pennsylvania \u201cas nearly as the same can be ascertained.\u201d But having made this report, it is not made by law the duty of the treasurer of the corporation to follow it up with evidence to prove that it is correct. Until the contrary is proved the legal presumption is that it is correct: Com. v. Lehigh Yalley R. R., 87 Leg. Int. 407 ; Com. v. Phila. & Read. R. R. Co., 145 Pa. 74; Com. v. P., Ft. W. & C. Ry., 74 Pa. 83; Com. v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 104 Pa. 89; P. & A. Tel. Co. v. Com., 3 Brewster, 517; Pliila. v. Com., 52 Pa. 451; Com. v. Hays, 1 Pitts. 316; Speck v. Com., 8 W. & S. 324; Del. & Hudson Canal Co. v. Walsh, 33 Leg. Int. 349; New Orleans v. Louisiana Savings Bank, 31 La. Ann. 828; Com. v. Haines, 97 Pa. 229; Com. v. Erie & Pittsburg R. R. Co., 74 Pa. 94; Com. v. Erie Ry. Co., 2 Pearson, 380.\nJohn P. Elkin, deputy attorney general, with him Henry 0. MeOormick, attorney general, for appellee.\nThe officers of the defendant corporation did not make such an effort to ascertain the residence of the bondholders as would exempt the corporation from the payment of the tax sought to bo recovered by the commonwealth in the proceeding now pending before the court.\nIt is the duty of the officers of the defendant corporation to deduct the tax and pay the same into the state treasury. When an exemption is claimed by reason of the fact that certain bonds are held by nonresident bondholders, the burden of proof is upon the company to show that fact. The commonwealth invokes the presumption that all bonds issued by a Pennsylvania corporation are held by residents of Pennsylvania, and that the burden of proof is upon the person claiming that they are held by nonresidents to establish that fact: Com. v. Lehigh Valley R. R., 129 Pa. 449; Com. v. Penna. Salt Mfg. Co., 145 Pa. 55; Com. v. Lehigh Valley R. R., 129 Pa. 429; State Tax on Foreign-Held Bonds, 15 Wallace, 300; Com. v. New York, Lake .Erie & Western R. R., 150 Pa. 234; Com. v. City of Chester,\u2019 123 Pa. 626.\nJanuary 3, 1898:"
