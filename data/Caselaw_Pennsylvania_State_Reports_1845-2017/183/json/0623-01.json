The right to recover depended, not upon the dangerous character of the machinery or appliances used by the company in the prosecution of its business, but whether, in the construction or operation of the same, it was guilty of any negligence which was the proximate cause of the young man\u2019s death. We find nothing in the testimony that would have justified the court in submitting any such question as that to the jury, and hence there was no error in refusing to take off the nonsuit.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Youghiogheny River Coal Co., a Corporation.\nNegligence \u2014 Master and servant \u2014 Goal mine.\nIn an action by parents against a coal company to recover damages for the death of their son, aged eighteen years, employed by defendant, a compulsory nonsuit is properly entered where it appears that the deceased while boarding an empty coal car in violation of defendant\u2019s orders, was killed by striking his head against an electric trolley wire strung six feet above the track, and there is no evidence to show that the company was negligent in the construction or operation of the trolley wire and the cars.\nArgued Oct. 20, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 151, Oct. T., 1897, by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. Westmoreland Co., Nov. T., 1896, No. 167, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Steiurett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, J J.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s son. Before McConnell, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on March 19, 1896, Alexander Johnston, plaintiffs\u2019 son, aged eighteen years, was killed in defendant\u2019s coal mine, where he was employed as a miner. The testimony showed that at the time of the accident the deceased boarded an empty coal car to enter the mine, and struck his head against an electric trolley, wire strung six feet two inches above the track. Johnston was instantly killed by contact with the live wire. There was no evidence of any negligence on the part of the defendant in constructing or operating the trolley line or the cars. The empty cars in the defendant\u2019s mine were propelled at a rate exceeding six miles per hour. A rule of the mine forbade miners to ride in empty cars when the speed of the cars exceeded six miles per hour.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nPaul II.
