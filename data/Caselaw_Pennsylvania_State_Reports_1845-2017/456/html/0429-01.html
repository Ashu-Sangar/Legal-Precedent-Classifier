Shortly after Kimberly’s birth, Diane and her parents executed a written authorization permitting the Lutheran Children and Family Service of Eastern Pennsylvania to remove the child from Beading Hospital for “proper placement and/or for legal adoption.” Pursuant to this authorization, Kimberly was placed in appellee’s custody on January 3, 1969, and has since remained in its care.</p>
    <p id="b529-6" data-blocks='[["BL_529.6",529,[164,933,1151,1086]]]'>After appellee assumed custody of the child, Diane on February 5, 1969, agreed to pay $5.00 per week for the support of her daughter. No payments, however, were made under this agreement. As a consequence, more than two years thereafter, on April 5, 1971, a court order of support at the rate of $10.00 per week was entered against appellant. Payments totaling $60.00 were made between April 8 and June 18, 1971. Between May 30 and July 25, 1972, an additional $211.00 was paid, $186.00 of which was paid in compliance with a writ of capias issued against Diane. Her last payment, $100.00, was tendered on January 24, 1973, upon special demand of the non-support office. Thus during the four and one-half years between Kimberly’s birth and the filing of the petition for involuntary termination — a period during which Diane regularly was employed — she only sporadically contributed toward the support of her daughter. Aside from a total of $371.00 support, she did not otherwise provide for Kimberly’s care.</p>

Twelve scheduled visitation appointments were not kept; only twenty-six visits were made during the fifty-four month period following Kimberly’s birth. Diane’s last visit was on September 30, 1972, and she has not since asked for a visit or had contact with her daughter.

And she irregularly made only some minimal support payments thereafter upon court demand.

Here, a long history showing virtually no attempt on appellant’s part to perform her affirmative parental responsibility sustains the court’s conclusion that appellant’s refusal and neglect is irremediable and that she forfeited her parental rights.

Both sections, however, address refusal to perform essential parental duties — care, control, love, protection, support, and subsistence. Consequently, appellant was on notice that the basis of the petition was her failure to be a parent. It was for the court to determine whether that refusal was wilful throughout a continuous six-month period<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> (section 311(1)) or repeated, continued, and irremediable (section 311(2)).
