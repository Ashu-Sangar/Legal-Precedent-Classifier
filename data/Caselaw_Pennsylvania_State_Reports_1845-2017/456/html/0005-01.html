One property is owned by John A. Stozenski and Mary Stozenski, husband and wife. A second property is owned by Michael Yurko and Mary Yurko, brother and sister. The Stozenski property and the Yurko property are separated by a private road. The <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>private road begins at Wyoming Avenue and runs between the Stozenski property and the Yurko property. The road provides access to a third property which is owned by the Borough of Forty Fort. The parties agree that each property owner is entitled to the use of the private road which was established as an easement when the properties were part of a single larger tract. The parties also agree that the road easement, as originally recorded, was twenty feet in width. They disagree, however, as to the present width of the road easement and as to the extent of the permitted use of the easement by the Borough of Forty Fort.</p>
    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[182,1068,1154,206]]]'>The Stozenskis and the Yurkos were plaintiffs in an equity action in which the Borough of Forty Fort was the defendant. Both plaintiffs and defendant now appeal from the trial court’s final decree.</p>

We affirm the first part of the trial court’s decree and modify the second part of that decree.</p>

The trial court found that the Stozenskis had maintained grass on a two foot wide portion on the alley which parallels their property and used the strip as part of their side yard. The trial court also found that the Yurkos maintained grass on an eight foot strip of the alley which parallels their property. At the edge of the eight foot wide strip, running through the middle of the road <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>easement, someone had erected a low concrete curb before the Yurkos had acquired their property in 1951.

      <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>In the present case, nothing was done which interfered with the use and enjoyment of the twenty foot wide road easement by the defendant or any of its predecessors in title. The grass and the low curbing did not in any way obstruct or inhibit ingress and egress from Wyoming Avenue, over the road easement, to defendant’s property. Plaintiffs’ use of a two foot strip and an eight foot strip on either side of the road as part of their yards was not inconsistent with the defendant’s easement rights. The plaintiffs erected no fences, planted no trees or shrubbery, constructed no walls or gates — did nothing, from which an inference can be drawn that they disclaimed any of the defendant’s right-of-way interest in the land. Moreover, it is irrelevant that defendant and its predecessors in title may never have improved, maintained, or used the road as a means of ingress or egress to their property. Non-use, no matter for what duration of time, will not extinguish an easement. <em>Graham v.

The defendant agrees with those conclusions and does not claim that it has any rights except as the grantee of the 13.75 acre tract.

Its rights as an offeree of a dedicated public road, therefore, expired in 1933.
