It solicits business by telephone and personal contacts made by travelling sales personnel. Appellant has one permanent studio in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but in all other locations in Pennsylvania the customers go to hotels and other similar places for picture sittings. Business is solicited on the representation that appellant’s photographs are custom-made. Following the taking of pictures in Pennsylvania with a special portrait camera and unexposed film, the then exposed film is sent by mail to appellant’s plant in Springfield, Ohio. The film is placed in a chemical developing solution, resulting in the formation of nega<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>tives. Light is then transmitted through each negative onto sensitized sheets of paper, resulting in what are commonly known as proofs. The proofs are then sent to appellant’s sales personnel whereupon the customer selects the desired proof which in turn is then returned to appellant’s Ohio plant and matched with the negative from which the proof was made. Light is again transmitted through the negative and the image is transmitted onto a sensitized sheet of paper which is then immerced [sic] in a developing solution, resulting in a permanent print which is then washed and dried. Appellant employs 75 to 85 artists to retouch the negatives and prints and utilizes a permanent finishing technique of placing oil and water colors on the individual portraits followed by baking them in an oven. After the portrait is custom-made, it is sent to the sales representative who completes the sale by delivering it to the customer at which time final payment is made.</p>

    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[165,829,1161,1518]]]'>The application of this dual test to the facts of the case at bar leads us to the conclusion that appellant’s cameras and film are used in the manufacture of personal property in accordance with the Act’s definition. In <em>Sitkin’s Junk Co., supra, </em>we found the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule of interpretation inapplicable to the language of this section and adopted the dictionary definition of “operation”, i.e., “the action of making or producing something”. The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. VII, p. 145. Such a broad definition would certainly encompass appellant’s activities in the instant case. Appellant is engaged in the business of “making or producing” custom-made portraits. An essential step in that process is the “making or producing” of a negative from which the print (which ultimately becomes the finished portrait) is made. The making of the negative in turn involves a series of chemical reactions i,n the coating of the film, the first of which is caused by the in-camera exposure of the film to light, the “taking” of the picture. Also, when we consider the <em>result </em>of appellant’s activity, we readily see that personal property is placed “in a form, composition or character different from that in which it is acquired” by appellant. The sensitized paper, oil and water colors are changed into a portrait. The unexposed film, when developed, becomes the negative. In both instances, the composition and character of the property is “different from that in which it is acquired”.</p>

      <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>It matters not, in our view, that the particular operation here in question, the exposure of the film, results in a change in the composition or character of property which does not itself become an integral part of the finished portrait. The Act specifically defines “manufacture” as “the performance of . . . operations, engaged in as a business, which place <em>any </em>personal property in a form, composition or character different from that in which it is acquired <em>whether for sale or use by the </em>manufacturer.” (Emphasis supplied.) The making of the negative is an operation which is an essential part of appellant’s business and involves a change in the composition or character of the film <em>for use </em>by the manufacturer in making the portrait. The process is analogous to the making of a cast or mold in which an object is shaped. The mold is the “negative” of the product to come, and the machines and materials used to make the mold are as much a part of the manufacturing process as those used to make the product itself.</p>

It follows that where, as here, the taxpayer’s activity fits within the statutory definition of “manufacture”, the use of equipment and supplies in such activity is necessarily excluded from the statutory definition of “use”, and the Department of Revenue is without authority to assess a tax on such use. We are unable to agree, however, with the holding of the majority below that, although use of the property in question is within the manufacturing exclusion of the statute, such use may nevertheless be taxed because other steps in the manufacturing process (the “production stages”) take place outside the Commonwealth. We can find nothing in the statute to indicate that, unless a certain number or a certain type of the operations in the manufacturing process are performed within Penn<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>sylvania, the property used in those operations that are performed within the Commonwealth may be taxed. To the contrary, the Act provides that the “use of . . . equipment. . . and supplies ... in <em>any of the operations </em>of (i) the manufacture of personal property” is nontaxable.
