Unbeknown to the felons, Mrs. Washick succeeded in phoning the police who arrived on the scene while the robbery was still in progress. One of the officers entered the residence through a rear door and was immediately fatally shot by Seely. In gunfire that followed, Seely was killed by one of the other police officers. Moments later, Schwartz surrendered after being discovered armed and hiding in an upstairs closet.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

He was also to share in the loot. His arrest and indictment on the charges here involved followed.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.7",659,[182,1491,1149,317]],["BL_660.1",660,[203,343,1154,371]]]'>The trial testimony was very much in conflict as to Russell’s involvement in the robbery.

I was as close to Mr. Borschell as I am to the first gentleman seated in the first row. Mr. Borschell looked at me and said, ‘Joel, . . .’ he referred to me as Joel . . . he said, ‘.. . there’s nothing personal here.’ I asked him, ‘Have you told the jury in this case that I told you to lie or fabricate or enlarge or do anything other than tell the truth?’ and he didn’t answer. And other people said, ‘Tell Mr. Moldovsky what you said,’ and he wouldn’t. Finally, he said, no, I hadn’t asked him to lie about anything, and that he told me everything in here. And ladies and gentlemen it was only after very, very careful scrutinizing of the evidence and independent interrogation of other -witnesses in comparison that the arrest was made of Mr. Russell. Only when there was no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, that he had mastermind<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>ed this crime.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This comment was clearly prejudicial to the accused because it was a clear expression of opinion of guilt on the central issue in the case, i.e., conspiracy. This witness explicitly told the members of the jury that after the district attorney’s office had investigated the crimes, there was “no doubt” Russell was guilty. Moreover, in drawing such a conclusion the witness passed on the credibility of all the defense witnesses, and, in effect, told the jury these witnesses were lying. This witness completely usurped the function of the jury by drawing a conclusion on the ultimate issue of the case. Moreover, under the facts of the instant case, this witness was not in a position to make such a conclusion, since he had no firsthand knowledge of the crimes, and he was called for the limited purpose of impeachment.</p>

See <em>Commonwealth v.

We believe the instant case fits squarely within this line of cases. As recently as <em>Lipscomb, </em>we made it emphatically clear that expression of personal belief has no place in the argument of a district attorney to the jury. Herein the former assistant district attorney not only expressed his opinion on the guilt of Russell, but he also expressed an opinion on the believability of the defense witnesses who exonerated Russell, and these ex<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>pressions of personal belief were without proper foundation. We, therefore, rule that a district attorney, whether he be a witness or a prosecutor, may not make improper statements of this nature, which clearly prejudice the accused. To do so is to violate the rights of the accused, and the professional standards which this Court demands and which society deserves.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[198,708,1158,1029]]]'>The Commonwealth attempts to distinguish the instant case from our prior cases on two grounds. First, the Commonwealth points out the witness at the time of trial was not a member of the district attorney’s staff. Although, we fully recognize that a distinction must be made between the standard of conduct to which we hold a district attorney in his statements to the jury, and the standard of conduct to which a “lay” witness must conform, we do not believe such a distinction should be made instantly. Herein, the Commonwealth made every effort to impress upon the jury the witness was a “former assistant district attorney.” When the Commonwealth clothes a witness in the vestiges of the office of district attorney, which clearly bear upon his credibility,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the witness must conform to the standards this Court has established for district attorneys. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that when this witness made the statement he fully knew it was improper and highly prejudicial.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[198,1748,1156,154]],["BL_663.1",663,[169,317,1150,805]]]'>Second, the Commonwealth argues that because the trial judge gave a curative instruction to the jury on the improper opinion, the effect of the improper opin<a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>ion was rendered harmless. Although, we recognize the trial judge gave curative instructions, under the instant facts, we do not believe this was adequate to fully protect the rights of the accused. Presently, the opinion of the former assistant district attorney went right to guilt or innocence, and the witness unequivocally told the jury he personally knew, beyond a doubt, Russell was guilty. Moreover, this witness, in effect, expressed his opinion that all the defense witnesses were lying, and in this case the credibility of the witnesses was the crucial determination the jury had to make. Where the ultimate issues in the case rest upon a resolution of such conflicting testimony as the jury was faced with instantly, we have no alternative but to hold this is reversible error.</p>
    <p id="b663-3" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[169,1140,1151,868]],["BL_664.1",664,[205,316,1155,152]]]'>Since a new trial is required, we feel one other issue deserves discussion. In the course of the trial, the Commonwealth called a witness who was to testify Russell was involved in the crime. However, when the witness took the stand, he completely exonerated Russell. The Commonwealth was allowed to plead surprise,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> and the district attorney attempted to impeach the credibility of the witness through the use of a prior inconsistent statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> At the close of the case, the written statement was allowed to go out with the jury as an exhibit for impeachment purposes, and defense counsel strenuously objected to the jury having the written statement.
