Brown testified at trial that he was accosted by appellant, who struck him with a nightstick, and took eighteen dollars from his person. Brown stated that after the robbery, he followed appellant to the residence of Mrs. Lavern Bighum, Brown’s next-door neighbor, and as the two men stood on the steps of the two adjacent houses, appellant again confronted him and asked what he wanted. Brown entered his residence, called the police, and directed them to the Big-hum house. The police arrested appellant, who was then in bed.</p>

The statute has been interpreted by this Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to mean that a comment by a district attorney or a trial judge which indicated a duty on the part of a criminal defendant to testify, and which permits an unfavorable inference of guilt to be drawn therefrom by the jury is violative of the statute. Instantly, by characterizing the conduct of the Commonwealth’s witnesses in testifying as “doing what they are supposed to do” the jury could have reasonably drawn the conclusion appellant had a duty or an obligation to take the witness stand. Moreover, the context within which the district attorney’s comment was made could have led the jury to believe the only reason the appellant did not take the witness stand was because he was in fact guilty.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[187,1202,1161,757]],["BL_337.1",337,[169,323,1154,926]]]'>Next, focusing our attention on the <em>Griffin </em>decision, we are equally satisfied the complained of comment violated the federal constitutional rule therein announced. In <em>Griffin, </em>the Supreme Court considered the anti-comment rule in the context of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court recognized that allowing the prosecution to comment on the accused’s failure to testify was, in effect, allowing that failure to take the witness stand to be used as evidence against him, which in the minds of the jurors would be indicative of guilt. In this regard, the Court aptly said: “If the words ‘Fifth Amendment’ are substituted for ‘act’ and for ‘statute’, the spirit of the Self-Incrimination <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>Clause is reflected. For comment on the refusal to testify is a remnant of the ‘inquisitorial system of criminal justice’, Murphy v. Waterfront Comm., <a href="/us/378/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="378 U.S. 52" data-case-ids="6165037" data-case-paths="/us/378/0052-01">378 U.S. 52</a>, 55, <a href="/us/378/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="378 U.S. 52" data-case-ids="6165037" data-case-paths="/us/378/0052-01">84 S.

It is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly. It is said, however, that the inference of guilt for failure to testify as to facts peculiarly within the accused’s knowledge is in any event natural and irresistible, and that comment on the failure does not magnify that inference into a penalty for asserting a constitutional privilege. . . . What the jury may infer, given no help from the court, is one thing. What it may infer when the court solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him is quite another.” <a href="/us/380/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="380 U.S. 609" data-case-ids="1524757" data-case-paths="/us/380/0609-01">380 U.S. at 613-14</a>, <a href="/us/380/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="380 U.S. 609" data-case-ids="1524757" data-case-paths="/us/380/0609-01">85 S.

It is asserted the jury would only view this comment as a reflection on the demeanor and conduct of the appellant in the courtroom.

Moreover, viewed in the context of the entire statement, the jury could have interpreted the statement as imposing a duty on appellant to testify. Likewise, although there was a great deal of evidence presented against the accused, including the eyewitness testimony of the victim, a description of the clothing worn by the felon which substantially matched the clothing of appellant, and testimony that a nightstick similar to the one used by the assailant to strike the victim was discovered in the garbage behind the Bighum home, this evidence was rebutted to a certain extent. Mrs. Bighum was called by the appellant as an alibi witness, and she testified appellant was at her home, in bed, watching television at the time of the robbery. Considering the adverse statement in light of the alibi defense, the jury could have reasonably concluded that had the alibi been true, the appellant would have taken the witness stand to fortify the testimony of his witness. Given the fact appellant did not testify, the jury could have believed that not only was the alibi testimony untrue, <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>but that appellant was admitting Ms guilt by not testifying. Thus, it was reasonably possible that in light of the comment, the jury could have surmised appellant’s failure to testify was an admission of guilt. Thus, the exercise of a constitutional right could have been damaging evidence against the appellant. Moreover, the facts of the case may have troubled the jury. As related by the victim, after the assault the appellant walked from the scene of the crime with the victim following closely behind. When appellant reached the steps of the Bighum home, he turned around and confronted the victim and asked what he wanted. Then when he entered the Bighum home, he undressed, went to bed, and apparently waited for the police to arrive. Lastly, the Commonwealth argues the judge’s charge to the jury cured any harmful effect of the district attorney’s comment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Although, we recognize the trial judge may have done all he could under the circumstances, his corrective charge only would have vindicated the adverse effect of the summation with respect to appellant’s duty to take the stand. The judge’s charge did not cure the adverse inference the jury could have drawn on the issue of guilt or admission of guilt. This set of facts simply does not meet the standard set forth in <em>Chapman.</em>

      <em> </em>supra; however, it is clearly distinguishable. In <em>Camm </em>Mr. Justice Pomeroy, speaking for a majority of the Court stated: “The case before us stands in sharp contrast to Anderson and Fontaine. Here the comment was not extensive, no inference of guilt from silence was stressed to the jury, and there was no evidence that could have supported acquittal. The assistant district attorney’s statement was lacking the vindictive qualities of those questioned in Griffin, Anderson and Fontaine, and must be viewed in light of the fact that here the defendant was in fact a witness, even though for a limited purpose. The only ground on which Camm could have been acquitted was not evidence of his innocence, for there was none, but a finding that the confession was involuntary. The facts stated in the confession, while subject to disbelief by the jury, were not put in issue in any way, and there was damaging circumstantial evidence in the form of a witness’ testimony which was corroborative of the confession.” <a href="/pa/443/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="443 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1937034" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0253-01">443 Pa. at 268-69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20A.2d%20325" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="277 A.2d 325">277 A. 2d at 333</a>. Instantly, although the comment was not extensive, the jury could clearly have inferred a duty to testify and an adverse inference of guilt could have arisen from the emphasis placed on appellant’s silence. There was also evidence to support an acquittal. The district attorney’s comment also had a vindictive quality in that he branded the appellant a “vicious man.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Moreover, the appellant did not take the witness stand, so the impact of the comment would <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>be clear.
