It also reveals that a number of the defendants after being apprehended, including the appellant, admitted their complicity in the crimes charged. The majority is laboring under the unwarranted assumption that if in fact a conflict existed at the investigatory stage, it necessarily persisted and still existed at the time of the guilty plea hearing.</p>

      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>The majority assumes that where counsel is representing two defendants, each of whom are entering guilty pleas, that counsel’s advice to one must have necessarily been motivated by intent to aid the other. From this record, however, there is nothing to suggest this to be a fact. As a result of the entry of his plea, a number of the charges against appellant were dropped. This obviously was not a benefit to Mangold, but a benefit to appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

The majority states as an uncontroverted fact that counsel by his representation of Mangold and appellant was in a position where it was virtually impossible “to avoid neglecting appellant’s case”. Again this is a conclusion completely devoid of support in the record.</p>
    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[132,1297,1156,536]]]'>The majority concludes that the case against the appellant was not “very strong”. There is absolutely no showing as to what evidence the Commonwealth at that time would have been in a position to present had appellant elected to force the Commonwealth to its proof. The attempt to equate the evidence produced by the Commonwealth during the guilty plea hearing of a number of defendants to what the Commonwealth could have amassed against a particular defendant in a trial is completely unwarranted.</p>

While <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>we will presume prejudice from the existence of a conflict, today’s decision has unfortunately fantasized prejudice solely from the fact of dual representation.</p>
