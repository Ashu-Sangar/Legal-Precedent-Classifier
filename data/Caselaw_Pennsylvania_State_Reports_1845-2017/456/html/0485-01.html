A review of the legislative and judicial history of the “long-arm statute” prior to the 1968 amendment is instructive. Prior to 1963, section 1011(B) of the Business Corporation Law provided: “B. Any foreign business corporation which shall have done <em>any business </em>in this Commonwealth, without procuring a certificate of authority to do so from the Department of State, shall be conclusively presumed to have designated the Secretary of the Commonwealth as its trae and lawful attorney authorized to accept, on its behalf, service of process in any <em>action arising out of acts or omissions of such corporation within this </em>Commonwealth.” Act of May 5, 1933, P.

For the purposes of determining jurisdictions of courts within this Commonwealth, the <em>entry </em>of any corporation into this Commonwealth for the doing of a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act in this Commonwealth for such purpose, with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts, shall constitute ‘doing business.’ ” Act of May 5, 1933, P.

In <em>Swavely, </em>a Michigan corporation marketed its products through distributors in Pennsylvania who were separate and independent from the corporation. In addition, the foreign corporation had manufacturer’s representatives in Pennsylvania who recommended distributors to the parent company. A Pennsylvania resident brought an action in trespass against a retailer for faulty installation of an incinerator which caused a fire. The retailer, in turn, attempted to join the Pennsylvania distributor and the Michigan corporation. The Michigan corporation denied that it was “doing business” in Pennsylvania. We agreed, adopting the trial court’s construction of section 1011 (C). The trial court’s opinion stated “obviously an impersonal corporate entity organized and located in another jurisdiction can be said (in the words of the statute) to have ‘entered’ the State of Pennsylvania only if its <em>agents </em>or property had been <em>physically present </em>therein on the relevant occasion.” <em>Id. </em>at 165-66, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.2d%20779" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="154 A.2d 779">154 A. 2d at 786</a> (emphasis added).

Section 1011(C) became applicable regardless of the situs of the acts or omissions giving rise to the cause of action.

L. 459, No. 216, §54. Since the complaint in the present case was filed subsequent to the effective date of the 1968 amendment, the amended language of section 1011(C) is controlling as to the issue of whether or not <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>the appellant is properly subject to this State’s jurisdiction. <em>See Kilian v. Allegheny County Distribs., </em><a href="/pa/409/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="409 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1883244" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0344-01">409 Pa. 344</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20517" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="185 A.2d 517">185 A.2d 517</a> (1962). Section 1011(C), as amended, provides: “For the purposes of determining jurisdictions of courts within this Commonwealth, the doing by any corporation in this Commonwealth of a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act in this Commonwealth for such purpose, with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts, shall constitute ‘doing business’. <em>For the purposes of this subsection the shippvng of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth shall be considered the doing of such an act in this Commomoealth.” </em>Act of July 20, 1968, P. L. 459, No. 216, §54 (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[164,1189,1151,752]]]'>The legislative deletion of the “entry” requirement in section 1011(C) and its addition of the last sentence, in effect, abolished the <em>SwmeVy </em>test. A nonregistered foreign corporation may now be subject to suit in Pennsylvania whether or not its agents or employees were ever physically present in this State and regardless of the contractual relationship between the foreign company and its Pennsylvania representative. Under the last sentence of amended section 1011(0), “the shipping of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth” is sufficient conduct to establish that a foreign corporation is “doing business” in Pennsylvania, and that conduct would therefore subject the foreign corporation to Pennsylvania’s jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.6",591,[165,1952,1150,373]],["BL_592.1",592,[193,317,1158,754]]]'>We conclude that the activities of appellant, The Walter Reade Organization, Inc., fall under the “doing business” clause of section 1011(C), as amended. The appellant on numerous occasions shipped motion picture film, either directly or indirectly, into Pennsylvania. Under the last sentence of the 1968 amendment, such conduct constitutes the “. . . shipping of merchan<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>dise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth. . . .” Appellant contends that the motion picture film which it shipped into Pennsylvania was not “merchandise.” Appellant argues that the film shipped was “of little intrinsic value.” It claims that the “image” embodied in the film was that which was leased and shipped. Appellant, therefore, claims it was shipping a “copyrighted story” on film which does not constitute “merchandise.” We do not agree. There is no such restriction in the statute and the word “merchandise” clearly applies to a motion picture film, just as it would to any product which is marketable because of its artistic value rather than the value of its physical components.</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[191,1083,1156,361]]]'>Appellant also argues that it did not ship the merchandise for sale but only for temporary use. Section 1011(C), however, does not require that the shipment be of merchandise that is to be sold. Under section 1011(0), a “pecuniary benefit” to the appellant is a sufficient objective. That objective is clearly present in this case.</p>
    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[188,1465,1157,809]]]'>We are similarly unmoved by appellant’s argument that the 1968 amendment was only intended to apply to actions in trespass and not to actions on a contract. The statutory language does not indicate, either expressly or impliedly, such a distinction. The purpose of our “long-arm statute” is to provide an appropriate forum for citizens to seek redress for harm caused by foreign corporations which have availed themselves of the privilege of “doing business” in this Commonwealth. Under the statute, the type of harm inflicted is immaterial to the jurisdictional issue. The statute applies to all forms and causes of action, except those enumerated in section 1011(D), which is not applicable to this case. The trial court properly dismissed appellant’s preliminary objections.</p>
