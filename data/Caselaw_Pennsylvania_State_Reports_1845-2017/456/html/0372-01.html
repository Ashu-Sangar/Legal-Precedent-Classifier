The issue is whether the arresting police officer had the constitutionally required probable cause to arrest the appellant, Thomas Mackie. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. IY; Pa. Const, art. I, §8. The appellant raised the issue in a pretrial application to suppress evidence. The application was denied, and the appellant was found guilty, in a nonjury trial, of receiving stolen goods. Post-verdict motions were denied and the judgment affirmed per curiam in an appeal to the Superior Court. <em>Commonwealth v.

[t]he field glasses were in a case.” The officer decided to stop the appellant for “investigation and to ask him why he was walMng down the street with the television.” The officer testified: “I asked him — I asked the defendant where was he going. The defendant told me he was going home. I asked him where did he live at. He told me in the [3100] block of Bancroft. I asked the defendant where he was coming from. He told me 3800 North 18th Street. I asked where did he get the t.v. from. He told me him and Ms girl friend had an argument. He took the t.v. back. So I told him it was unusual for him to be coming from 3800 North 18th Street all the way to Broad and Erie and Bancroft Street is only seven blocks away. The defendant told me that he was looking for a cab and there was no cab that passed Mm on the way. So I asked the defendant did he have any money to catch a cab. He said no, he was going home, let the cab take him home and pay the cab when he got home. So the story didn’t seem right. So I took the defendant in for investigation.”</p>

That issue must be determined on the facts and circumstances known “at the moment the arrest was made.” <em>Adams v.
