Then the two men placed their hands together in an apparent exchange. The California Supreme Court, holding that there was clearly no probable cause to arrest, said: “. . . an area known to be the site of frequent narcotics traffic should not be deemed to convert circumstances as innocent as an apparent transaction by pedestrians who seem generally concerned with their surroundings into sufficient cause to arrest those pedestrians. Transactions conducted by pedestrians are not per se illegal. . . . To uphold an arrest based upon these activities because the officers believed they were in an area of frequent narcotics traffic would abridge, if not abrogate, the Fourth Amendment’s protection against police intrusions conducted without substantial justification, and might well exacerbate community resentment of harassment.” <em>Id. </em>at 164, <a href="/citations/?q=466%20P.2d%20704" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="466 P.2d 704">466 P. 2d at 708</a>.</p>

He subsequently observed the defendant and the suspected addict come closer together at which time he saw what appeared to be a movement of the hand. Explaining its result, the Court characterized such behavior in the following manner: “Although the observed acts of the defendant and the suspected narcotics addict were not inconsistent with a culpable narcotics transaction, they were also susceptible of many innocent interpretations, even between persons with a narcotics background. The behavior, at most ‘equivocal and suspicious’, was not supplemented by any additional behavior raising ‘the level of inference from suspicion to probable cause.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 20, <a href="/ny-2d/24/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="24 N.Y.2d 421" data-case-ids="2289745" data-case-paths="/ny-2d/24/0421-01">24 N.Y. 2d at 423</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20N.E.2d%20867" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="248 N.E.2d 867">248 N.E. 2d at 868</a>.</p>
