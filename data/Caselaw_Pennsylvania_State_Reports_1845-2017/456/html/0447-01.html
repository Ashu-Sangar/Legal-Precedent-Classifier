Subsequent to the impaneling of the jury, the trial judge was informed that the victim’s father was then employed as a tipstaff during that session of criminal court and was attending the jurors. The trial judge immediately summoned appellant and Ms counsel and, after informing them of the position which the victim’s father held, he asked defense counsel if he or appellant wished to make a motion. Counsel, after consultation with appellant, advised the court that they would make no motion. Thereupon, the trial court declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte. </em>Appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that a retrial would constitute double jeopardy.

Although acts of a defendant and his counsel most definitely influence this Court’s determination of reviewable error, the question of whether the ends of justice are served is a determination solely for the Court, which determination is not necessarily affected by the interposition of motions by the defendant or his attorney. The trial court was insuring that appellant would receive a trial by a fair and impartial jury which would return a verdict based solely on evidence adduced at trial.

It was probably felt that the defendant and his counsel are best able to evaluate how well the trial has gone from a strategic standpoint and how serious will be the harm caused by the prejudicial event.

In my view the exposure of the jury to the deceased’s father was so pregnant with the possibility of improper influence, that the trial judge properly declared a mistrial. It is not necessary to find that the father actually communicated with the jury in any illegal way to justify such a result. The very nature of the crime involved and the position held by the deceased’s father created an air of impropriety so great as to demand a mistrial. “There can be no condition of things in which the necessity for the exercise of this power is more manifest, in order to prevent the defeat of the ends of public justice, than when it is made to appear to the court that, either by reason of facts existing when the jurors were sworn, but not then disclosed or known to the court, or by reason of outside influences brought to bear on the jury pending the trial, the jurors or any of them are subject to such bias or prejudice as not to stand impartial between the government and the accused.
