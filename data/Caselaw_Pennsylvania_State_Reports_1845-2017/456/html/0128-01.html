At that time he was informed, as were his parents, that he was being taken into custody for questioning involving the murder of Byron Harden the previous evening. He was immediately thereafter taken to the Homicide Unit at the Police Administration Building, arriving there at 8:35 A.M. The first interrogation session commenced at 8:50 A.M. at which time appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and was informed of the nature of the crime being <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>investigated. The session ended at 9:50 A.M. No statement was elicited except a denial by Alston of his involvement in the entire criminal episode under investigation. The appellant was then asked to take a polygraph examination, to which he aequiesed. Between 9:55 A.M. and 11:05 A.M. the polygraph procedures were conducted. When the test was completed the investigating detective resumed his interview with the appellant which continued until 12:55 P.M. This session was stopped when the detective was informed that appellant’s mother was on the telephone and wished to speak with her son.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The appellant until this time had continued to deny any involvement in the homicide. After speaking with his mother for approximately fifteen minutes the questioning resumed. He was questioned from 1:10 P.M. to 1:20 P.M.; at which time Alston asked to be allowed to use the men’s room and permission was granted. At 1:28 P.M. he was returned to the room where a meal which had been ordered for him was waiting. At 1:50 P.M. another interrogation session was commenced which terminated at 3:40 P.M., during the course of which the appellant gradually implicated himself, first being present at the scene of the crime, then as the driver of the automobile implicating Benjamin Smith, a co-defendant, as the individual who actually did the shooting, and then finally admitting that he in fact shot the deceased. At this point he was joined by his mother. When asked by her, “What has happened, what did you do?”, the appellant responded, “I shot that boy.” Appellant then talked to his mother and uncle from 3:50 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. This was then followed by further police ques<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>tioning from 5:2G P.M. to 6:42 P.M. wherein the appellant gave a formal written statement in the presence of his mother and uncle.</p>

If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of his confession offends due process. Rogers v.

Most significant is the fact that prior to the first inculpatory statement the appellant was allowed an opportunity to speak at length with his mother.
