Two of the appellants, it is averred, are purchasing gas from an independent supplier, and their rent, accordingly, has been raised $2 per month; the remaining two appellants are purchasing gas from the landlord, but allege that they are doing so only because they are restrained by the $2 per month surcharge from purchasing their gas elsewhere.

R. C. P. No. 2230.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The first challenge is that appellants will not adequately represent all persons claimed to be in the classes. In determining the ability of a plaintiff to represent adequately a purported class, as required by the rule, it must appear that the relief sought is beneficial to the class members, and that the plaintiffs’ interests be consonant with those of the other members of the class. <em>Penn Galvanizing Co. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/388/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="388 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1272549" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0370-01">388 Pa. 370</a>, 379, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20511" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="130 A.2d 511">130 A.2d 511</a> (1957); <em>Oas v.

The relief sought in the present case is facially beneficial to both of the classes set forth in the complaint, since it is directed at removing a financial burden upon the members of both groups when they seek to purchase propane gas from someone other than the appellee. Nor does it appear that the plaintiffs have any interests which are adverse to those of the class; they stand in the same relationship to the landlord as do the tenants whom they would <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>represent and they would benefit from the relief sought to the same extent as all other members of their class.</p>
    <p id="b633-3" data-blocks='[["BL_633.4",633,[169,434,1150,1357]]]'>Appellee’s other challenge to the maintenance of this suit as a class action is that the persons constituting the two classes are not so numerous as to make it impracticable to join them as parties. The appellants, in their complaint, assert that more than half of the 1100 units in appellee’s apartment complex use bottled gas for heating their water, so that it is clearly possible that both classes identified in the complaint contain enough members to justify a class action. The chancellor’s opinion expresses doubt that there are indeed other persons similarly situated to the named plaintiffs in either of the asserted classes, and states that “[t]his is a class action in name only”. On the record before us, however, we are not able to determine this matter, and are unable to perceive how the trial court could do so. When factual issues are created on preliminary objections, the trial court should resolve the dispute by receiving evidence thereon through interrogatories, depositions or an evidentiary hearing: <em>Peters Sportswear Co., Inc. v.
