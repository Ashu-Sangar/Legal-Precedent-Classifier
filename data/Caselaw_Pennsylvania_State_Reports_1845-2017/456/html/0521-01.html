III, §322, <em>as amended, </em>24 P.S. §3-322. The trial court, therefore, ordered the appellant to choose between the two positions.

      <em>Doebler </em>involved the incompatibility of the positions of instructor in a community college and that of school director of one of the school districts sponsoring the college. Although the incompatibility clause of the Public School Code of 1949, P. L. 30, Article III, Section 322, <em>as amended </em>(24 P.S. §3-322), does not expressly encompass community college employment, it was the opinion of the Court in that case that a community college “comes within the purview of ‘joint school’ as that term is used in Section 322 of the School Code”. <a href="/pa/446/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="446 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1941721" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0130-01">446 Pa. 130</a> at 133.</p>

Thus, while in <em>Doébler </em>we were free to construe the quoted language so as to encompass community colleges, we are not similarly free with respect to intermediate units.
