As we stated in <em>Wrona, supra, </em>as quoted in <em>Commonwealth v. Lee, supra, </em>at 156: “Whether a trial judge imposed a proper sentence on a criminal defendant does not present a pure question of law [thereby making it renewable], unless the sentence exceeds the statutorily prescribed limits or is such as to be constitutionally impermissible. In the usual case, the problem presents a mixture of law and fact. . . . [T]he sentence imposed on a person convicted of crime lies with one exception (where the conviction is for first degree murder following a jury trial) within the sole discretion of the trial court, and the sentence imposed will not be reviewed by an appellate court, unless it exceeds the statutorily prescribed limits or is so manifestly excessive as to constitute too severe a punishment. (Citation omitted).” In short, a sentence will not be reviewed “unless there has been a showing of illegality,” <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, supra.</em>

Although the defendant testified that the shooting was the result of an altercation in which he was threatened with a knife, this was contradicted by two eye-witnesses. The trial judge concluded that the evidence could have supported a jury verdict of murder in the second degree. Although the defendant had no past criminal record, was clearly remorseful, and received a favorable recommendation for leniency from the prison chaplain, these facts do not render the sentence “manifestly excessive.” <em>Commonwealth v. Wrona, </em><a href="/pa/442/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="442 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1935391" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0201-01">442 Pa. at 206</a>.
