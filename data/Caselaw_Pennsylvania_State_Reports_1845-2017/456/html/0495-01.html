The appellant argued that the word <em>concealed </em>as used in the statute was speaking of total concealment. The court conceded that some jurisdictions with similar statutes had adopted such an interpretation and that there were no Pennsylvania cases on point. Nevertheless, stating that the courts have a duty “to see to it that the legislative intent is not thwarted by a construction which is unreasonably rigid and inflexible” and that the primary evil which the act sought to prevent was the carrying of unlicensed weapons rather than their concealment, the Superior Court opted for the broader reading. <a href="/pa-super/189/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="189 Pa.

While we concede that the word <em>abound </em>can be used to mean “outside,” its use in the present context connotes the more flexible definition — “in the vicinity or neighborhood.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 120 (1971). The statute in question was obviously designed to alleviate the danger to human life and quiet enjoyment of one’s dwelling which is presented by the nighttime loitering or prowling of malicious-minded individuals. Clearly, this danger is, if anything, intensified when the proscribed activity occurs inside, rather than outside, the dwelling. Consequently, to hold that only outdoor, but not indoor, loitering or prowling is proscribed by the statute would be to reach an absurd result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Such a result is at variance with the above cited authorities as well as the mandate of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

He walked into a hospital about twenty-five minutes after visiting hours were over. On the record before us, we must conclude that he did not break in. He did not unlock any locked doors. He walked to a door which opened into the stairway leading to the various floors of the hospital. The record uses the term “fire tower.” A “fire tower” is nothing more than the customary exit stairs required in most public buildings. The use of such stairs, particularly in a hospital, after visiting hours, is certainly not uncommon. The appellant did nothing except walk up to the third floor landing where he was arrested. A nurse heard bim making noise, but the record before us does not disclose any further information about the kind of noise which was heard. It could have been footsteps, or the opening and closing of doors, or coughing or sneezing. On this record, we cannot conclude that the noise heard gave rise <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>to any reasonable inferences of criminal conduct by the appellant.

In order to ascertain the intended meaning of a word, it must be viewed in the context in which it is used. Many definitions will then be excluded because, in context, they would be patently unreasonable. This Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Mason, </em><a href="/pa/381/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="381 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1258876" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0309-01">381 Pa. 309</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20174" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="112 A.2d 174">112 A.2d 174</a> (1955), and the Superior Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Butler, </em><a href="/pa-super/189/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="189 Pa. Super. 399" data-case-ids="744990" data-case-paths="/pa-super/189/0399-01">189 Pa. Superior Ct. 399</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.2d%20172" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="150 A.2d 172">150 A.2d 172</a> (1959), found certain proposed definitions <em>to be so narrow as to be unreasonable </em>when viewed in their statutory context. When, however, we have found several alternative definitions reasonable, we have stated that, “when a criminal statute calls for construction it is not the construction that is supported by the greater reason that is to prevail, but that one which, <em>if reasonable, operates in favor of life and liberty . . . .” Commonwealth v. Exler, </em><a href="/pa/243/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="243 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1001585" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0155-01">243 Pa. 155</a>, 162-63, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.%20968" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="89 A. 968">89 A. 968</a>, 971 (1914) (emphasis added); <em>see Commonwealth v. Clover, </em><a href="/pa/397/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="397 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1286238" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0543-01">397 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="156 A.2d 114">156 A.2d 114</a> (1959). Thus, the issue in the present case is whether appellant’s proposed interpretation of the word <em>aroiond </em>is reasonable in its statutory context. If it is reasonable, we must accept it.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[158,1690,1150,650]],["BL_602.1",602,[198,328,1156,972]]]'>Under the rules of statutory construction, we are to construe words “according to their common and approved usage.” Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa. S. §1903(a). The rationale for such a rule is obvious. Due process requires that a statute be published in order that citizens be given notice of prohibited conduct. The word <em>abound </em>is frequently used with the meaning suggested by the appellant. That meaning is one of the “common and approved usages” of the word <em>around. See </em>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 120 (1971). There are, as the prosecution argues, other “common and approved usages” of the <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>word <em>mound. See <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="156 A.2d 114">Id.</a> </em>The majority has chosen what it considers to be a more flexible definition — “in the vicinity or neighborhood.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="156 A.2d 114">Id.</a> </em>While such a definition may be a reasonable and commonly accepted one, it does not support the majority’s conclusion that <em>mound </em>means inside as well as outside. The same source defines <em>vicinity </em>as the “quality or state of being near” and “a surrounding area or neighborhood.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2550 (1971). <em>Neighborhood </em>is defined as “the quality or state of being immediately adjacent or relatively near to something.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1514 (1971). While I recognize that a battle of definitions may be endless, I think that there can be no doubt that an ordinary citizen could reasonably interpret the present statute as only prohibiting the malicious loitering or prowling <em>outside </em>of the enumerated buildings.</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[195,1312,1158,698]]]'>The majority also argues that even if the word <em>mound </em>in the statute is construed to be outside, the appellant would be covered by the statute because he was <em>outside </em>that <em>pmt </em>of the hospital building used for living quarters of hospital patients even though he was <em>inside </em>the hospital building. I cannot accept that interpretation of the statute. The statute does not say <em>mound </em>the <em>pmt </em>used for living or dwelling purposes. It says <em>mound </em>the <em>place </em>used in <em>pmt </em>for living or dwelling purposes. The <em>place </em>in this case is the hospital building. The result urged by the majority, therefore, is not warranted by the required strict construction of this penal statute.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[195,2021,1155,316]]]'>No citizen, reading the statute in this case, could ever reasonably anticipate that it applies to one entering or leaving a hospital after visiting hours by means of the exit stairs. If the statute, therefore, applies to such a citizen, it must be considered unconstitutional because of vagueness.</p>
