Geary’s duties involved the sale of tubular products to the oil and gas industry. His employment was at will. The dismissal is said to have stemmed from a disagreement concerning one of the company’s new products, a tubular casing designed for use under high pressure. Geary alleges that he believed the product had not been adequately tested and constituted a serious danger to anyone who used it; that he voiced his misgivings to his superiors and was ordered to “follow directions”, which he agreed to do; that he nevertheless continued to express his reservations, taking his case to a vice-president in charge of sale of the product; that as a result of his efforts the product was reevaluated and withdrawn from the <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>market; that lie at all times performed Ms duties to the best of Ms ability and always acted with the best interests of the company and the general public in mind; and that because of these events he was summarily discharged without notice.

He argues that the expectancies which the law protects from interference by outsiders should also be protected against the parties to the relationship. The courts of this Commonwealth have held that both employers and employees are entitled to freedom from meddling by third parties, even where the employment is at will. <em>Dorrington v.

But we do not think that the cases imposing liability on strangers to the protected relationship are apposite to the instant situation. A predicate to liability in such a case is “the absence of privilege or justification on the part of the actor. . . .” <em>Glenn v. Point Park College, </em><a href="/pa/441/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="441 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1933820" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0474-01">441 Pa. 474</a>, 480, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20895" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="272 A.2d 895">272 A.2d 895</a>, 898 (1971). Here, as in the <em>Glenn </em>case, the complaint does not negate the existence of a privilege, hitherto regarded as virtually absolute, insulating the company’s termination of Geary’s employment. Instead, we are asked to impose limitations on this privilege for reasons of policy. The cases involving interference by third parties, turning as they do on the presence or absence of privileges of a different sort, do not seem particularly helpful in evaluating this proposal.</p>

While this theory is “on the frontier of the law of tort,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> it received recognition in Pennsylvania at an early date. <em>See, e.g., Sommer v. Wilt, 4 </em>S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 19 (1818) (abuse of process); <em>Wheatley v. Baugh, </em><a href="/pa/25/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="25 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="975872" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0528-01">25 Pa. 528</a> (1855) (dicta; deprivation of water rights). The conduct recognized as tortious in cases of this sort necessarily involves an element of specific intent to cause harm or accomplish an ulterior purpose. Thus in <em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, </em><a href="/us/256/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="256 U.S. 350" data-case-ids="3679669" data-case-paths="/us/256/0350-01">256 U.S. 350</a>, <a href="/us/256/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="256 U.S. 350" data-case-ids="3679669" data-case-paths="/us/256/0350-01">65 L.Ed. 983</a> (1921), a case relied on by appellant, independent banks were held to have a cause of action against a federal reserve bank which accumulated checks drawn against the plaintiffs for the purpose of forcing them to join the federal reserve system. The right of a holder to present checks for payment was not questioned, but the exercise of that right in a particular manner and for a particular end was held to be impermissible. By the same token, the novel theory of recovery which appellant advances must surely involve specific intent on the part of the company to harm Geary or achieve some other proscribed goal. If a general intent, in the sense that an employer knew or should have known the probable consequences of his act, were all that a disgruntled employee need show in order to make out a cause of action, the privilege of discharge would be effectively eradicated, for some degree of harm is normally foreseeable whenever an employee is dismissed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Appellant purports not to seek a result so</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[181,1997,108,19]],["BL_277.1",277,[171,333,1153,372]]]'>-1 — i <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>drastic; he merely argues that a court should recognize the abuse of the privilege in a particular instance, and grant damages accordingly. To this extent, appellant’s proffered analogy to cases involving the malicious abuse of recognized rights seems apt enough. The difficulty is that the averments of Geary’s complaint do not add up to specific intent.</p>
    <p id="b277-3" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[168,717,1155,1420]]]'>Here again our decision in the case of <em>Glenn v. Point Park College, </em>supra, offers useful guidance. We there dealt with an allegation of interference by a third party in a prospective business relationship: an unconsummated real estate brokerage arrangement. Following the tentative draft of §766A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, we held that where the relationship allegedly interfered with is prospective rather than existing, specific intent on the part of the defendant to cause harm to the plaintiff must be alleged to make out a cause of action. Examining Glenn’s complaint, we found it deficient in this respect. The complaint averred that, relying on information supplied by the plaintiff brokers, defendant had negotiated a direct purchase of real estate, representing to the vendor that no brokers were involved in the transaction. It was alleged that in this manner defendant had intentionally and maliciously prevented plaintiffs from entering into a brokerage arrangement with the vendor, thereby depriving them of their commissions. In ruling that the complaint fell short of charging an intent to cause harm to plaintiffs, we made it clear that a bare recitation that defendant had acted “intentionally, wrongfully, maliciously, fraudulently, deceitfully and without justification” did not satisfy the specific intent requirement.</p>
    <p id="b278-3" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[186,333,1161,1256]]]'>
      <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>We think that the deficiency of the complaint in the instant case is even clearer than it was in the <em>Glenn </em>case. The facts alleged show only that there was a dispute over the merits of the new product; that Geary vigorously expressed his own point of view in the matter, by-passing his immediate superiors and taking his case to a company vice-president, and that he was ultimately discharged. There is nothing here from which we could infer that the company fired Geary for the specific purpose of causing him harm, or coercing him to break any law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> or otherwise to compromise himself. According to his own averments, Geary had already won his own battle within the company.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The most natural inference from the chain of events recited in the complaint is that Geary had made a nuisance of himself, and the company discharged him to preserve administrative order in its own house. This hardly amounts to an “ulterior purpose”, much less to “disinterested malevolence”, in the sense in which those terms are used by Mr. Justice Holmes in the <em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>case, <em>supra. </em>Under his own theory, therefore, appellant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

      <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>Appellant’s final argument is an appeal to considerations of public policy. Geary asserts in Ms complaint that he was acting in the best interests of the general public as well as of his employer in opposing the marketing of a product which he believed to be defective. Certainly, the potential for abuse of an employer’s power of dismissal is particularly serious where an employee must exercise independent, expert judgment in matters of product safety,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> but Geary does not hold himself out as this sort of employee. So far as the complaint shows, he was involved only in the sale of company products. There is no suggestion that he possessed any expert qualifications, or that his duties extended to making judgments in matters of product safety. In essence, Geary argues that his conduct should be protected because his intentions were good. No doubt most employees who are dismissed from their posts can make the same claim. We doubt that establishing a right to litigate every such case as it arises would operate either in the best interest of the parties or of the public.</p>

However, there is the danger that the average jury will identify with, and therefore believe, the employee. This possibility could give rise to vexatious lawsuits by disgruntled employees fabricating plausible tales of employer coercion. If the potential for vexatious suits by discharged employees is too great, employers will be inhibited in exercising their best judgment as to which employees should or should not be retained. . . . Compromise of the employer’s power to make such judgments about professional, managerial or other high-ranking employees ... is especially undesirable. The higher ranking the employee, the more important to the success of the business is his effective performance. Compounding the potential for undue inhibition of the employer’s judgment at the higher echelons of employment is the greater difficulty of articulating the basis for a discharge at that level. Compared to the wage earner, whose routine duties can generally be measured against a mechanical standard, the value of a salaried employee is more likely to be measured in such intangible qualities as imagination, initiative, drive, and personality. The employer’s evaluation of the higher ranking employee is usually a highly personalized, intuitive judgment, and, as such, is more difficult to translate into concrete reasons which someone else — a juryman — can readily understand and appreciate. Indeed, even if it is conceded that the protection from unwarranted discharges afforded rank and file employees by labor agreements is appropriate, it might still be argued that no intrusion of any kind upon the employer’s subjective evaluation of higher echelon employees should be tolerated.” Blades, op. cit. <em>supra, </em>note 6, at 1428-9. Professor Blades nevertheless favors judicial intervention to protect employees at all levels from abusive discharge, partly in the hope that “. . . a lack of confidence in courts and juries could lead, albeit in a roundabout way, to the creation of private means of settlement that might well be the most effective and expeditious way of handling such cases.” <em>Id. </em>at 1431.</p>
