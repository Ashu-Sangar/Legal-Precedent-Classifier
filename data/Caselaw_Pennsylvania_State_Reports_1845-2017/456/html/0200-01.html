    <p id="b299-7" data-blocks='[["BL_299.10",299,[158,1171,1156,866]]]'>Appellee, a Delaware corporation authorized to do business in Pennsylvania, filed its Corporate Net Income Tax Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1966 showing tax due in the amount of $11,850.38. The Department of Revenue settled the tax at $24,-400.43, and this determination was approved by the Department of the Auditor General. In arriving at this figure, the Commonwealth used the taxpayer’s entire taxable income as reported for Federal income tax purposes, which, of course, included income from its operations conducted outside of Pennsylvania. Appellee filed a petition for resettlement and a subsequent petition for review with the Board of Finance and Revenue. Both of these petitions were refused and an appeal was taken to the Commonwealth Court. That court reversed, and this appeal followed.</p>

Adyance-Wilson Industries, Inc., the appellee, has its principal office in New York City. It conducts its business through two operating divisions, Keystone Ridgeway Company [“Keystone”] and Electrolyzing Company [“Electrolyzing”]. The Keystone division operates three plants in Pennsylvania which are engaged in the manufacture and sale of ceramic tiles used in building construction. The Certificate of Authority issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to appellee as a foreign corporation permits appellee “to purchase, lease, produce, manufacture, sell and deal in and with building materials of all kinds”. The Electrolyzing division maintains places of business in Illinois and Rhode Island and conducts business throughout the United States. The business of this division is to receive machines or machine parts, equipment and tools which are subject to being abraded and, by an electrolyzing process, plate the worn parts of these items so as to increase their useful life. Between Keystone and Electrolyzing there is no money flow, no transfer of working capital, no sales or purchases nor any accounting transactions. There is no guarantee by either division of indebtedness of the other.</p>

Suffice it to say that to sustain its claim to multiform tax treatment, and thereby exclude a portion of its income from the computation of the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax, a foreign corporation doing business in this Commonwealth must establish that it “is engaged in a separate business outside of Pennsylvania”. <em>Commonwealth v.

It is true that Electrolyzing <em>solicited </em>business in Pennsylvania, as it did throughout the country, by means of advertising circulars mailed from the plant in Illinois to prospective customers. Except for this activity, however, the record discloses no business activity of the division within the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[173,1034,1163,869]]]'>Were Electrolyzing a separate foreign corporation conducting only the same business that it now conducts as a division, it is undisputed that it could not be taxed by Pennsylvania. The solicitation of business by mail is not a sufficient nexus for the imposition of a corporate net income tax; such a corporation is not “doing business” in Pennsylvania. <em>Commonwealth v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em><a href="/pa/385/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="385 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1267107" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0607-01">385 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.2d%20100" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="124 A.2d 100">124 A.2d 100</a> (1956); <em>Commonwealth v.

The business of <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>the Electrolyzing division has no connection with the exercise of the privilege granted to appellee by Pennsylvania to conduct the manufacture and sale of building materials in this state, and the limited mail solicitation activities of Electrolyzing in Pennsylvania do not amount to the doing of business. In short, neither that division’s tenuous relationship to the Pennsylvania division nor its own restricted activities within the state afford a basis for the imposition of the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax on that portion of the appellee’s income which is derived from its Electrolyzing Company division.</p>
