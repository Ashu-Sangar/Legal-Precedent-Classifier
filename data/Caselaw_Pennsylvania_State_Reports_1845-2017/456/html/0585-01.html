    <p id="b684-9" data-blocks='[["BL_684.14",684,[188,1619,1156,474]]]'>TMs is an action in equity instituted by Paul H. Vogel, Jr., and ConMe E. Vogel, Ms wife, and William A. Paul and Amelia J. Paul, his wife, against a group of individuals who, like the plaintiffs, are the owners of land in a residential development located in Loyal-sock Township, Lycoming County, known as “HigMand Farms.” The controlling facts were stipulated by the parties in the trial court and may be summarized as follows.</p>
    <p id="b684-10" data-blocks='[["BL_684.15",684,[188,2112,1155,208]],["BL_685.1",685,[208,331,1150,531]]]'>The plan of HigMand Farms was recorded in the recorder of deeds office of Lycoming County on December 8, 1927, by the then owners of the tract, Montague A. Percy and Ms wife, Edna M. Percy. A certain 50 <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>foot wide area included within the development was set apart on this recorded plan by dotted lines and was marked “Eeserved For Future Street.” This 50 foot wide area runs east and west and is approximately parallel to Orchard Avenue which lies to its north. It also lies parallel to Spring Garden Mills Eoad (now Four Mile Drive) which lies to its south. All lots included in the plan of Highland Farms run from Orchard Avenue southward to Spring Garden Mills Eoad and cut across the area reserved for the future street.</p>
    <p id="b685-4" data-blocks='[["BL_685.5",685,[208,882,1150,418]]]'>The street has never been open for public use; nor, has it ever been accepted as such by any public authority. However, each deed conveying title to purchasers of land from the subdivision was described by the lot number corresponding to that on the 1927 recorded plan, and each deed also included a specific reference to the 1927 recorded plan which, as noted before, contained the 50 foot wide reservation for a future street.</p>
    <p id="b685-5" data-blocks='[["BL_685.6",685,[207,1319,1150,372]]]'>In recent years, the plaintiffs Vogel and the plaintiffs Paul attempted to open two separate parts of the street leading from their land to nearby streets which are open and in use. The defendants named in the action objected and obstructed such efforts. As a result, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in equity seeking to enjoin this interference.</p>

The decree ruled against the claim of the plaintiffs Paul on the ground that any rights these plaintiffs had in the street were lost through adverse possession of that portion of the street leading to their property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Some of the defendants in the trial court filed the in<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>stant appeal challenging the trial court’s ruling in favor of the plaintiffs Vogel.</p>
