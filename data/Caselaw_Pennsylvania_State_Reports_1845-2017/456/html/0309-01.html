The trial judge questioned appellant as to his age, education, military service, employment record, and medical history. Turner gave responsive, complete, and correct answers. The court also questioned appellant thoroughly about his knowledge of the nature and consequences of his plea, the factual basis for the plea, the voluntariness of the plea, his knowledge of the possible sentence, his understanding of and participation in the plea negotiations, and his knowledge of his appellate rights. Appellant was at all times alert and his answers were responsive and articulate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

However, the record shows that after 1966, appellant honorably served in the military, was gainfully employed, and was continuing his education at the time <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>of his arrest. When viewed in the context of the entire record the isolated fact of his 1966 hospitalization does not establish that in 1972 appellant was mentally incompetent to plead or that his plea was involuntary.
