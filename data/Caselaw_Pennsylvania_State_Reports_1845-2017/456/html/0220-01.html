The specific question before us, therefore, is whether the covenant of non-competition entered into between Bello and his employer, Girard Investment Co., is a reasonable restraint of trade as defined in Restatement §516 (f) : “A bargain by an assistant, servant, or agent not to compete with his employer, or principal, during the term of the employment or agency, or thereafter, within such territory and during such time as may be reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer or principal, without imposing undue hardship on the employee or agent.” The majority interprets this section as establishing a three-pronged test of reasonableness: to be enforceable, a covenant must be reasonable in time, in geographical extent, and in relation to the conflicting interests of the parties. While this approach is con<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>sistent with some of our recent decisions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> I do not think that the test can be broken down in this fashion. Time and space are the dimensions within which a restrictive covenant operates; the reasonableness of a limitation in either dimension must be judged <em>in terms of </em>the employer’s need for protection and the hardship imposed on the covenanting employee. But my main point of disagreement with the majority concerns not the proper formulation of this test, but its application to the facts of the case at bar. Of course, balancing the conflicting interests of employer and employee may compel the conclusion that no restriction, however narrowly limited in time and space, may be reasonable in a particular case. I cannot agree, however, that we confront such a case today.</p>
    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[159,1155,1160,1014]],["BL_324.1",324,[200,336,1157,97]]]'>The majority holds that an employer is entitled to the benefits of a covenant not to compete only where, during the period of his employment, an employee acquires specialized training and skills, or gains access to methods of doing business which qualify as trade secrets. I agree that there is no evidence in the record that Bello either received specialized training from Girard, or learned any of Girard’s confidential business methods. Bello was employed by Girard as the manager of one of its consumer finance branch offices. In addition to general office supervision, his duties comprised making small loans to individual consumers— not an especially esoteric occupation, or one requiring a high level of technical expertise. What Bello did acquire during his years with Girard, according to the record before us, was a number of valuable personal contacts, both with individual loan customers, and, more importantly, with merchants and retailers who, -1 <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>by referring their customers to particular finance companies, are a crucial source of loam business.</p>
    <p id="b324-4" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[196,447,1161,1304]]]'>The importance of these contacts to the consumer finance business is documented by the testimony offered by both parties. Girard’s president testified that the company required restrictive covenants from its employees because of the “very personal type of business we’re in, where the borrowers have a tendency to follow a branch manager and also the sources of business, the very well-spring we get our business from is often developed in a personal way between [sic] a particular branch manager. And it is not uncommon for a branch manager to move from one location to another, where customers within his own company will follow him.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Bello himself testified that many of his loan customers were drawn from the circle of his friends and acquaintances. Explaining how loan companies were able to compete with banks, which offer lower interest rates, he remarked: “It’s a matter of whether the manager is interested enough to try to make dealer contacts. In our business the majority of the business that you get is through your merchant contacts, and you have to be aggressive and you have to get off your butt and go out and seek the business. It’s that simple. And the only way that an individual is going to come to you is through a merchant referral.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

There was no question in <em>Hayes </em>that the defendant employee had received all the training necessary to the practice of optometry before he entered the plaintiff’s employ. The lower court had held the covenant unenforceable, relying on <em>Morgan. </em>Reversing the decree, we said: “It is not necessary that an employee receive specialized training and skills before we will enforce a restrictive covenant.

      <em>may </em>receive specialized training and skills, not that an employee <em>must </em>receive specialized training and skills, before the restrictive covenant will be enforced.

The chancellor found as a fact that Kiley received no special training from Jacobson or insight into its methods of doing business, but nevertheless decreed enforcement of the covenant. We affirmed, citing §516(f) of the Restatement, and saying: “Under the above test, the covenant must stand. The evidence makes clear Jacobson’s need for the protection. The radiant heating business is one in which the close personal contact of the sales representative with prospective buyers is crucial to success. As appellee points out in his brief, for a number of years, to the builders, engineers and architects in the area described by the limited covenant, Kiley <em>was </em>Jacobson &amp; Co.

Bettinger had hired Berke as a sales manager in the temporary-help division of Bettinger’s employment service. Berke subsequently left Bettinger’s employ and established his own temporary-help business in violation of the covenant not to compete. Belying on <em>Jacobson, supra, </em>we upheld enforcement of the covenant, saying: “Berke [admitted] the crucial importance of customer contact in the business. Bettinger also testified that it was his experience that if close personal relationships were kept with his customers, they would for the most part turn their entire temporary-help needs over to him. Thus, it is reasonable for Bettinger to seek protection from competition from former employees, like Berke, whose sole job was to maintain the close affiliations with prospective employers of temporary help.” <a href="/pa/455/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="455 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="582171" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0100-01">455 Pa. at 104</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20296" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="314 A.2d 296">314 A.2d at 298</a>.

Bello failed to carry this burden. As I have noted above, the record clearly shows Girard’s need for the protection provided by the covenant.

Enforcement would not force Bello to abandon the consumer finance business in the greater Philadelphia area.
