As the court noted in <em>Groce v.

It continues through pretrial negotiations and influences the manner of preparation and trial of the case. An example of this might well be that plaintiff would expend additional money to obtain medical experts, surveys and diagrams or other evidence favorable to his cause if he knows there is ample coverage. All of this has great practical relevancy in the preparation and evaluation of the case.”</p>

As Judge Mansfield of the Southern District of New York observed in <em>Clauss v. Danker, </em><a href="/f-supp/264/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="264 F. Supp. 246" data-case-ids="1569055" data-case-paths="/f-supp/264/0246-01">264 F. Supp. 246</a>, 248 (S.D. N.Y. 1967): “This court has witnessed the dismal waste of time and effort, both on the part of the parties and the court, in cases where an early disclosure of limited policy limits would have led to prompt settlements that were not reached until the eve of the trial, when such information was first revealed after needless pretrial discovery and preparation for trial. Aside from such unnecessary consumption of time and effort resulting from inability to learn such crucial information until the very last minute, the effect frequently is to disrupt the court’s schedule and cause loss of trial time for many needy prospective litigants.” In this way, discovery of a policy of relatively low limits will be a very effective in<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>centive to settlement and will further the general purpose of all procedural rules: “The rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable.” Pa.

    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[156,601,1154,318]]]'>Appellant counters by suggesting that discovery of high policy limits will frustrate settlement by encouraging the plaintiff to seek an excessive recovery. First, we cannot assume, as appellant does, that settlement is a game whereby the defendant is entitled to crucial information not possessed by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[154,930,1158,1191]]]'>“The liberal rule thus does not upset the natural bargaining position of the parties. Instead, the effect of discovery of insurance coverage is to equalize the knowledge of both parties, with the result that settlements will be based more upon a fair evaluation of plaintiffs claim and less upon ignorant conjecture concerning the depth of defendant’s pocket. Courts cannot forever hold themselves, as if unknowing, above that stage of litigation wherein negotiation and settlement occur. It would contravene the liberal policy of the federal rules to encourage the knowledgeable resolution of disputes at one point and discourage it at another.” <em>Landkammer v. O’Laughlin </em><a href="/frd/45/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="45 F.R.D. 240" data-case-ids="3706772" data-case-paths="/frd/45/0240-01">45 F.R.D. 240</a>, 241 (S.D. Iowa 1968). Second, it is the insurance company, not the named defendant, who seeks to withhold such information. In so doing, the company may well be gambling on a verdict of non-liability where the only one who stands to lose from that gamble is the policyholder. See, <em>Gray v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/422/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="422 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1901730" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0500-01">422 Pa. 500</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%208" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="223 A.2d 8">223 A.2d 8</a> (1966).

Plaintiffs must consider the insurance company’s appraisal of the case and the fact that it also must take into account the same considerations.

Basically, he asserts that insurance coverage is no different from other private financial information which determines the defendant’s ability to pay a potential judgment. We cannot agree. Insurance coverage is not in the same category with the defendant’s other assets. The worth of such coverage is contingent on recovery by the plaintiff, and its sole purpose from the defendant’s point of view is to protect his other assets. This is not to require disclosure of the private financial status of an individual but merely to reveal the extent of pi'otection which was purchased specifically for such eventuality. <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>As we have noted, the defendant (presumably the person whose privacy would be violated) is not the party resisting disclosure since such disclosure would tend to dispose of claims within policy limits and relieve defendant of personal exposure.</p>
