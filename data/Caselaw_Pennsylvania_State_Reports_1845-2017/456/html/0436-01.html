This decree commanded that the defendant union should make such payments to the Union’s Pension and Welfare Plan as necessary to give the plaintiffs their normal pension according to the schedule set down in <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>the decree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The date for such payment was July 1, 1971. On the appointed day the defendant union failed to comply with the provisions of the consent decree.

They contend that it was the understanding of all parties that the consent decree was to be filed only after the approval of the trustees had been obtained. Such approval was never obtained and thus the consent decree should not be given any effect.</p>
