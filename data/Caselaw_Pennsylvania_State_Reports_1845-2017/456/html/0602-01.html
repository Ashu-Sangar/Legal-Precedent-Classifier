Mason was convicted by a judge and jury of thirteen counts of criminal libel and twenty-one counts of anonymous publication. These convictions all arose out of his attacks against four officials of Mifflin County in his irregularly published, mimeographed “newspaper,” the <em>Lewiston Liar. </em>The Superior Court affirmed the criminal libel convictions, but reversed the convictions for anonymous publications.
