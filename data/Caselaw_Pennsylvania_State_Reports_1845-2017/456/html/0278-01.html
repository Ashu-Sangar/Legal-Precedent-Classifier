    <p id="b378-7" data-blocks='[["BL_378.10",378,[190,877,1156,478]]]'>The appellee, Halford Bowden, was indicted for murder in connection with the death of Alphonso Saunders. The evidence established Saunders invited Bowden to share a bag of heroin with him, and provided the funds for the purchase of the narcotic. Bowden purchased the heroin and injected himself. Saunders was unable to properly inject himself, and requested Bowden to malee the injection and Bowden complied. Saunders died from an adverse reaction to the dosage of heroin.</p>
    <p id="b378-8" data-blocks='[["BL_378.11",378,[189,1367,1155,589]]]'>Appellee was tried before Judge Robert W. Williams, Jb. sitting without a jury and was found guilty of murder in the second degree. Motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied on April 21, 1972, but sentence was deferred. On September 20, 1972, the court reconsidered the disposition of the post-trial motions and after argument granted the motion in arrest of judgment on the ground the trial evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish malice, a necessary ingredient of the crime of murder in the second degree.</p>

All cases must be decided on théir particular facts, hence a detailed factual background is in order. Saunders, the deceased, inquired of Bowden if he wished to share a bag of heroin with him; Saunders furnished the money for the purchase and Bowden made the buy. Bowden prepared the drug and used half of the quantity himself, leaving the other half for Saunders. Saunders was unable to properly administer the heroin to himself and asked Bow-<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>den to inject him, which Bowden did, and Saunders subsequently died. The record established both Bowden and Saunders were heroin addicts and had used the drug together during the years 1969-1970, and during this period Bowden had injected Saunders with the drug with no adverse reaction.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[130,648,1149,528]]]'>The Commonwealth produced the medical examiner for the City of Philadelphia who stated that after performing a postmortem examination on Saunders, he found morphine and quinine in the blood stream and determined death was caused by an adverse reaction to an injection of the drug, heroin. The doctor stated the test showed the amount of narcotic taken by the deceased Avas consistent with that taken by an addict, and death would be unexpected or unforeseeable from such a dose in an addict.</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.6",381,[124,1197,1155,1081]]]'>Murder is defined as an unlawful killing of another with malice aforethought, express or implied. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

The legislature has divided murder into two classifications, murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. All murder perpetrated by poison or lying in wait, or any wilful, deliberate or premeditated murder or murder which is committed in the perpetration of certain felonies is murder in the first degree. Every other kind of murder is murder in the second degree. The distinguishing factor between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree is the former requires specific intent to take a life, whereas the necessary element for murder in the second degree is malice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Burton, </em><a href="/pa/450/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="450 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="1947061" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0532-01">450 Pa. 532</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20599" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="301 A.2d 599">301 A. 2d 599</a> (1973). It is well established malice may be found from the attending circumstances of the act resulting in the death. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

Initially, although we recognize heroin is truly a dangerous drug, we also recognize that the injection of heroin into the body does not generally cause death. Unfortunately, there are thousands of individuals who use or abuse heroin daily. As Mr. Justice Shapiro stated in a concurring opinion in <em>People v. Pinckney, </em><a href="/citations/?q=328%20N.Y.S.2d%20550" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="328 N.Y.S.2d 550">328 N.Y.S. 2d 550</a> (App. Div. 1972) : “While there has recently been a substantial increase in deaths from narcotics, the proportion of such deaths to the number of times narcotics are currently being used by addicts and for legal medical treatment is not nearly great enough to justify an assumption by a person facilitating the injection of a narcotic drug by a user that the latter is thereby running a substantial and unjustified risk that death will result from that injection.” <a href="/citations/?q=328%20N.Y.S.2d%20550" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="328 N.Y.S.2d 550">Id. at 556-57</a>.</p>
