Coyle, a duly licensed real estate broker, and Coyle received a commission for these services. The purchaser was the Oxgrove Development Corporation [Oxgrove], a recently formed corporation. The trial evidence established, and the trial court so found, that Coyle represented conflicting interests in the sale, in that he not only represented the seller but also was the owner of a substantial interest in Oxgrove, and that his interest in Oxgrove was not publicly disclosed, but was recorded in the name of a straw party. Under these facts, the law is clear that <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>in order for the sale to withstand a subsequent challenge by the seller as to its validity, the burden is upon the buyer to prove by clear and satisfactory proof that the seller was timely informed of Coyle’s dual interest in the sale and consented thereto.

    <p id="b406-4" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[165,866,1159,429]]]'>Instantly, Coyle was deposed pretrial and testified, in part, that prior to the sale he informed the seller of his dual interest in the transaction and that the seller consented thereto. This deposition was offered in evidence as part of the seller-plaintiff’s case at trial, and it is argued that since it remained uncontradicted by any other testimony offered by the seller,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> it is binding upon the seller for the purposes of this litigation.</p>

However, this is not so if the testimony of the adverse party is contradicted by the direct testimony of other witnesses, or is impeached by its own inconsistencies or by such intrinsic improbability or obvious falsity as to stamp it as unworthy of belief. <em>Argo v.

After our study of Coyle’s testimony, we are persuaded this conclusion should remain undisturbed. While Coyle testified he told the seller before the sale <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>that he was to have a substantial ownership in Ox-grove, in the beginning of his depositions Coyle attempted to evade questions as to this interest and only after persistent inquiry admitted that the interest recorded in the name of his secretary was, in fact, owned by him. For this and other reasons disclosed in the record, the trial court was amply justified in concluding Coyle’s testimony was not the “clear and satisfactory” proof required to carry the buyer’s burden of proof in this case.</p>
