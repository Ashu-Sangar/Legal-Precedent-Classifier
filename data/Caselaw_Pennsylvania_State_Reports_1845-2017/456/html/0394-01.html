The body bore evidence of horrible sex abuse and untimely death due to manual strangulation. It was the Commonwealth’s position at trial that McNeal and other males entered into an agreement or conspiracy to forcibly rape the victim, and in the perpetration of the rape she was killed by one or more of the group. McNeal testified that the victim willingly went with him and two others to a certain house where she voluntarily undressed and consensually engaged in sexual intercourse with his two companions; that four other males then arrived on the scene, and he left the premises because he feared there would be trouble due to the crowd.</p>

Even though McNeal testified he had departed from the scene of the killing before it occurred, his credibility was for the jury. Furthermore, the fact that he left the scene before the killing would not, in itself, exonerate him from culpability for the killing, if the killing were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy of which he was a part. <em>Commonwealth v.

Concomitantly, it is urged this evidence had no probative value and its only purpose was to inflame the passions of the jurors. The trial record discloses that <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>there was neither a request nor an objection to the failure of the court to give cautionary instructions. Additionally, the trial record discloses the admission of this evidence was not objected to at trial for the reasons now asserted. The only objection to the evidentiary use of the victim’s clothing voiced at trial was that it had not been established as belonging to the victim at the time it was offered for admission. It has long been the rule in this jurisdiction that if the ground upon which an objection to evidence is based is specifically stated, all other reasons for its exclusion are waived, and may not be raised post trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial evidence established that when the victim’s body was found, there was dry blood near her nose, mouth and rectum; there were lacerations in the area leading into the vagina; there were also lacerations of the peritoneum (the surface of the skin between the back of the vagina and rectum), and extensive lacerations of the rectal mucosa, plus tears of the anal sphincter. The clothing with bloodstains correlating to these injuries was relevant and of probative value to show the victim did not remove her clothing voluntarily, as contended by McNeal. Finally, the clothing was not unnecessarily displayed to the jury, and only exhibited at the time it was marked as a trial exhibit. This assignment of error will, therefore, be overruled.

Since both statements could not possibly be true, the prosecutor was justified in asking McNeal whether he was “lying” when he made the initial statement. In retrospect, the words “lie” or “lying” may have been a harsh classification of McNeal’s misstatement of a particular circumstance; however, these remarks fall far short of the type of prejudicial remarks which in the past we have held to be reversible error.

Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, No. 223, Art. III, §302, 17 P.S. §211.302. The Commonwealth has not interposed an objection on this score however, and the failure to object operated to perfect this Court’s jurisdiction of the judgment imposed on the rape conviction, unless the Court orders otherwise. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, supra, 17 P.S. §211.503.</p>
