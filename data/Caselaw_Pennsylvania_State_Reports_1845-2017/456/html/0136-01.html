They had been out together on a date. Six days later, the car Eckert had been driving on the night of his date was found abandoned on Railroad Street, in Leesport, Pennsylvania. In the car were the couple’s shoes, and $489.23, the exact amount of receipts of the father’s store for August 12. At this time, the police considered the disappearance an ordinary case of young people running away.</p>

After weeks of searching by local and state police, on October 23, 1969, Trooper Robert A. Kaunert spotted sunlight reflected from a pair of sunglasses, which, upon investigation, were in direct contact with the skull of a decomposed body. The body was later identified as Glenn Eckert’s.</p>

In the early morning hours of August 13, 1969, the four “Pagans” left their clubhouse to look for girls. They decided their best chance would be to find a couple “parking,” to “train”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the girl, and then to scare the couple into not saying anything about the rape. After a short time driving around, the four came across a young couple parked in a “light blue, ’64, 4-door” Ford.</p>

Bailey parked the car there, but kept the ignition keys. The three “Pagans” and the young couple entered the van.

Unknown to the four, the police were at Dreamland Park to arrest the “Pagans” for the alleged beating and stabbing of three young men earlier that night. The four decided to drive on. After randomly driving for some time, a second attempt was made to return to the clubhouse. But the police were still there.</p>

[Bailey] At another time there was, sir. Q. Do you recall when that was and where it was? A. That was later on, in the same afternoon, in the [prison] yard again, and at this time we were in the presence of another — Leroy Stolzfus, Martinolich and myself were in the yard. Q. Referring to the matter involving the boy, would you tell us, to the best of your recollection, the exact conversation between you and Mr. Martinolich? A. I asked Martinolich like, what had happened, and at this time, he told me that he asked the boy, Martinolich like asked the boy, what it was worth for him to live, and the boy laughed at him, he told me, and so he said that he shot him. Q. With regard to the boy, did Mr. Martinolich say anything further regarding the shooting of the boy? A. He told me, at that time, to keep quiet about it because I was the only one that knew about it, and if it ever got out that he’d get me for it. Q. Did he say — did Mr. Martinolich tell you where he had shot the boy; in what area? A. He said in the head, sir.” Both Eways and Bailey testified that appellant was in possession of a handgun when the four of them left Dreamland Park.</p>

The answer given by the witness, and apparently the correct answer as far as the witness is concerned, was exactly the opposite of what was made in the offer. It is unfortunate that the offer was made in the fashion it was, when the testimony was just the opposite. I ask you to strike out that question and answer and consider it in no way. I’ll go even further. Counsel can object to this statement if they want to. In the stipulation, they agreed that no expended bullets were found in the body of the victim or in the area. In the opinion of this trial judge, from many years experience as a defense lawyer, a prosecuting lawyer and a judge in many cases — and I think it’s also a fact in science — unless expended bullets are recovered, which definitely can be tied into the wound of an alleged victim, no comparison tests can be made by experts to determine whether any weapon was in fact used to make the wound. Have I correctly stated it? Mr. Van Hoove [District attorney]: Agreed, Your Honor. The Court: Is there any objection to what I have said? Mr. Cassidy [Defense counsel]: No, Your Honor. The Court: I have made this explanation to show you why you shouldn’t consider this evidence in any way that might harmfully affect the defendant.” In the charge to the jury, the trial court again emphasized that because no spent bullets were discovered, no comparisons of guns would be proper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

No bullets were recovered and so I charge you that you can’t conjecture about these weapons or any particular weapon, because if bullets are not recovered, so that a comparison can be made between a suspected weapon and the bullets found in or about the vcitim, no weapon can be identified as having been the weapon used. What was the death weapon? Where are the bullets? They are not in this case. Of course, their absence is not fatal to the Commonwealth’s case. It is a circumstance. But the jury must still be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, as I have mentioned ‘reasonable doubt’ of the death as charged, by the Commonwealth. In other words, that the Commonwealth has made out the three elements I mentioned by the burden I have mentioned, namely, that a death has occurred, that death resulted from a criminal agency and that the defendant is legally responsible for the death as we have defined such responsibility.”</p>

After we receive the information required from you we will then move in to Reading and while one man <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>stays in the ear with the motor running, me, flipout and the other man will inter the basement and put the drop on the hacks and spring you, and then when your armed we will proceed to kill everyone in there, lawyers, hacks anybody and everybody that is in there. I’ll kiU them. I mean everybody, but everybody will die God dammit — I <em>will not, </em>under any circumstances leave a witness alive but I want them killed silently if possible, if we are not forced to use our guns as a means of killing, I want them pricks knocked <em>out </em>— and after their knocked out I will personally cut each and every ones head off. and then we wiU walk slowly out to the car and drive slowly away to the hideout for a cooling off period of at least a week before we start on a killing spree. Now this plan is simple and effective if carried out properly but if you happen to split between now and then, so be it, if not we’ll use the plan, but juice one way or the other I’m busting you out, I will not let you die in the chair, if I have to kill a hundred men, women &amp; children to get to you, it matters less to me, but you are coming out. You can believe that, but the main thing I want to know right now, is can I trust your mother fully.</p>

However, it is not clear whether the defense objected to the first alleged breach of the trial court’s guidelines on security. Questions not raised at trial will not be heard by this Court for the first time on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v. Agie, </em><a href="/pa/449/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="449 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1945676" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0187-01">449 Pa. 187</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20741" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="296 A.2d 741">296 A.2d 741</a> (1972). Giving appellant the benefit of a doubt that an objection was made, we are convinced that this assignment of error is without substance. He complains that two alternate jurors, who did not participate in the decision of his case, on a single occasion during an eleven-day trial may have seen police removing handcuffs from him. The court en bane, after reviewing the record, concluded that “the jurors did not see the incident complained of.” <em>Commonwealth v. Martinolich, </em>65 Berks County L.J. 99, 108 (Pa. C.P. 1973). Furthermore, the incident, if it were witnessed by two alternates, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt See <em>Chapman v.

Pa. R. Crim. P. 310. Appellant, however, does not claim that the Commonwealth withheld any exculpatory material from him or <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>that it failed to provide him with any material necessary for the defense of his casa As well he could not, for the court en banc noted, “At trial, defense counsel were given statements of all Commonwealth witnesses, where statements were in existence, to aid in cross-examination.” <em>Commonwealth v. Martinolick, </em>65 Berks County L.J. 99, 110 (Pa. C.P. 1973).</p>
      <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.3",260,[183,1138,1161,495]]]'>Second, appellant asserts that he was denied due process because the trial court held a night session on the ninth day of trial during the presentation of his case. On the first day of trial, the judge made clear his intention to hold night sessions, if and when they became necessary. No objection was made then, and it is very unclear whether the defense in fact objected to the trial court’s actual declaration of the night session. In any event, it is difficult to perceive how appellant with his prepared defense was prejudiced by a single night session. The conduct of trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and here there was no abuse of that discretion.</p>
      <p id="b260-6" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[183,1654,1160,643]]]'>Third, reversible error allegedly was committed when the prosecution called as a witness Charles Eckert, the victim’s father. According to appellant, Mr. Eckert was so emotionally upset that the jury became incurably prejudiced against appellant. However, Mr. Eckert was called for the essential purpose of testifying that the car found in Leesport was the one Glenn had been driving on the night of August 12 and that the sum of money found in the ear was the exact amount of receipts from Mr. Eckert’s store for that day. After the defense stipulated to these facts, the Commonwealth immediately agreed to excuse Mr. Eckert. The record fully supports the conclusion reached by the court en banc. “We are also completely satisfied that the witness was not called to produce the sympathy of the jurors, but as a necessary link in the prosecution’s chain of evidence.” 65 Berks County L.J. at 111.</p>
