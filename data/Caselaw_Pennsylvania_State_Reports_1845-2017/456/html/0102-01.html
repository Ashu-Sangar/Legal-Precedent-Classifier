In <em>Kulik </em>this Court saw no reason to find prejudice resulting from a non-statutorily authorized change in the transcript before granting the defendant a new trial. Young’s case presents manifold prejudice: the omission of a highly significant element of the reasonable doubt charge resulted in a jury deciding appellant’s guilt without any guidance on its responsibility to convict only if it found appellant guilty, as the Constitution requires, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

Second, it is urged that the introduction of the confession, the revolver seized from appellant, and the expert ballistics testimony was error because the corpus delicti of each crime charged had not been established. Third, the district attorney in his closing argument deprived appellant of a fair trial, it is claimed, because he told the jury that appellant was preparing to commit a robbery when he was arrested on The Vehicle Code violation.

The expert testified that he fired ten bullets from the revolver seized from appellant. Although the bullet found in the victim’s head was 60% destroyed, the expert compared the ten bullets he fired with the lethal bullet. Five test bullets showed some matching striations; the other five were discarded. At trial the Commonwealth produced none of the test bullets. Eather, the expert relied on four photographs, which depicted a microscopic comparison of the bullet found in the victim with a bullet fired by the expert. Each photograph portrayed roughly one-sixth of the circumference both of the test bullet and of the lethal bullet. Only a single mark on the bullets in the expert’s photographs matched, and the expert testified that the pictures could all be of the same test bullet.</p>

Appellant lastly contends that the trial judge improperly refused appellant’s attempt to impeach by showing that in an earlier ease the expert had been totally discredited. In the former case, according to appellant, the expert testified that it was a simple task to drill the barrel of a starter pistol so that it could fire bullets. To prove his point the expert brought a drill to court. After forty-five minutes of the expert’s unsuccessfully drilling the barrel, the court found the defendant not guilty.</p>

The stenographer, without any knowledge of the testimony, or maps or papers, was called in to take down the charge.
