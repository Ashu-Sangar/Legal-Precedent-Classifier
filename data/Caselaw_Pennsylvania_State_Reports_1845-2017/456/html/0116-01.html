The Commonwealth’s evidence showed that in mid-February, 1968, it was discovered that checks were missing from the Flower Company and that one of the missing checks had been cashed at a local department store. At the time the stolen check was tendered for payment a photo was taken of both the check and the person seeking to cash the check, and an officer of the Flower Company identified the person in that photo as the appellant, a former employee of the company. On March 29, 1968, armed with this information, the police obtained a search warrant for appellant’s apartment and, upon executing that warrant, they discovered six of the stolen checks.</p>

The advent of densely populated communities, revolutionary advances in communication and transportation, the increased mobility which produced a more transient pattern of living for large segments of our society, and the myriad of other changes in the nature and character of our society have combined to create the need to redefine the term <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>“recent possession” in an attempt to preserve its rational connection to the identity of the thief.

It is this failing that requires the award of a new trial. We are satisfied that a finding of guilt would have been justified if it were based on all of the evidence produced by the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Relying on the inference, the trial court erroneously, under the facts of this case, instructed the jury that they could infer guilt from the evidence of the appellant’s possession alone. Proof that the appellant was in possession of a portion of the stolen goods four to six days prior to the discovery of the loss, in absence of any proof of the actual time of the taking, fails to provide the rational connection to the crime charged that would overcome the presumption of innocence and establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

It is true that in striking down inferences, the Supreme Court has not used a reasonable doubt standard. E.g., <em>Leary; Romano; Tot; </em>see <em>Turner. </em>For two reasons, however, the rationale of these inference cases is not here controlling. First, the approach of the Court when testing the constitutionality of inferences has developed over time. Each decision has added more precision to the articulation of its <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>standard.

Although the trial court did admonish the jury that it was compelled to find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the challenged instruction quite possibly could have induced the jury to eonvict on a lesser standard of proof. The practical effect of the challenged instruction was to submit the ease to the jury on an alternative theory. In such a case, if any of the theories are unconstitutional, the judgment of sentence must be reversed. See <em>Leary v.

The inference that the possessor of recently stolen goods was the thief of those goods was at issue in <em>Shaffer. </em>I agree with the views stated there by Mr. Justice Pomeboy. He found “it difficult to believe <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>. . . that it is more likely than not that the possessor was himself . . . the thief, or that . . . [the inference] is the equivalent of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the elements of [larceny].” Id. at 117, 288 A.2d at 741 (concurring and dissenting opinion). If an inference cannot conform to the requirements of the less stringent “more-likely-than-not” test, then it must necessarily fail to satisfy the reasonable doubt standard. See note 3 supra.</p>
