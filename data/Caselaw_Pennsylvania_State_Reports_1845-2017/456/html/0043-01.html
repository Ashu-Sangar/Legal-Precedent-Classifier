Generally, the intended beneficiary of a will should, if possible, be determined from the language of the instrument alone. <em>Berks Bounty Tuberculosis Society Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/418/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="418 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1896089" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0112-01">418 Pa. 112</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20857" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="208 A.2d 857">208 A. 2d 857</a> (1965). However, where an ambiguity exists in the will itself as to the identity of an intended beneficiary, extrinsic evidence may properly be received to aid the court in establishing the beneficiary’s correct identity: <em>Black Estate, </em><a href="/pa/398/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="398 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="1289086" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0390-01">398 Pa. 390</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.2d%20133" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="158 A.2d 133">158 A. 2d 133</a> (1960). This is just such a case.</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[198,1763,1157,536]]]'>Certainly, neither of the claimants involved in this appeal are described “with sufficient exactitude to clearly indicate a person or organization legally qualified to take.” See <em>Berks Bounty Tuberculosis Society Appeal, </em>supra, at 115, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20857" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="208 A.2d 857">208 A. 2d at 858</a>. The lower court incorrectly held that the testatrix’s will was unambiguous and that “the Pennsylvania Association comes <em>closest </em>to the designation used by the testatrix. To reach our conclusion, we need <em>only </em>change the word ‘Home’ to ‘Association’”. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>
    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.3",145,[185,340,1152,591]]]'>
      <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>First, as already indicated, the proper test in determining whether a will is unambiguous is: is it of such similarity as to identify the beneficiary with “sufficient exactitude to <em>clearly </em>indicate a person or organization legally qualified to take.” [Emphasis supplied.] <em>Berks County Tuberculosis Society Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/418/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="418 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1896089" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0112-01">418 Pa. 112</a>, 115, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20857" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="208 A.2d 857">208 A. 2d 857</a>, 858 (1965). It is obvious that the lower court applied an improper standard; it merely determined that the Pennsylvania Association came <em>“closest” </em>to the name used by the testatrix, not that it <em>“clearly” </em>indicated the proper beneficiary.</p>
    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[185,942,1150,1412]],["BL_146.1",146,[197,343,1153,89]]]'>Second, the lower court was incorrect in stating that only one change is necessary to equate the “named” beneficiary with the Pennsylvania Association. The identifying words “Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania” appear after the names of seven of the fourteen named charitable beneficiaries in the testatrix’s will. Of the remaining seven named charitable organizations in the will, two of them contain the word “Pittsburgh” in their title, one (Bickur Cholim Jewish Home For The Aged) located in Pittsburgh is the only such named organization in Pennsylvania, and the remaining four are all nation-wide organizations. Thus, it is evident that the placing of the words “Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania” after the names of many of the charitable organizations was merely the scrivener’s style to identify the beneficiary as being located in Pittsburgh. Of. <em>Berks County Tuberculosis Society Appeal, </em>supra. Therefore, the question we are faced with is, whether it can be unambiguously determined if the charitable gift bequeathed to the “Pennsylvania Home for the Blind” was left to the “Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children” or to the “Pittsburgh Branch, Pennsylvania Association for the Blind, Incorporated.” Although, the Pennsylvania Association is clearly closer in title to the name used by the testatrix, it is not of such similarity as to identify the beneficiary with “suf<a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>ficient exactitude to clearly indicate a person or organization. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[196,451,1157,375]]]'>In addition, it has long been held in Pennsylvania that a “latent ambiguity can ... be developed by extrinsic and collateral circumstances and it is always competent to show that such ambiguity exists.” <em>Metzger's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/222/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="222 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="959417" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0276-01">222 Pa. 276</a>, 281, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20A.%2096" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="71 A. 96">71 A. 96</a>, 97-98 (1908).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The testatrix’s “named” beneficiary presents just such a latent ambiguity.</p>

To buttress this argument, it contends: “The words used by Testatrix describe three characteristics of her intended beneficiary. First, not only is the term ‘Pennsylvania’ used in the forepart of the name of the beneficiary, but it is specifically stated that the address is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both claimants qualify in this respect. Second, it is an organization ‘. . . for the blind’. Again, both claimants provide services for the blind. Third, and it is submitted most important, Testatrix has characterized a particular function provided by her intended beneficiary. It is a ‘Home’ for the blind.” The School, which educates and trains the visually handicapped, does provide board and lodging for about 95% of its two hundred students; and, hence, may be considered a “Home.” While, the Pennsylvania Association, although encompassing a wide range of programs for the visually disabled, does not provide any housing for its clients. Thus, it cannot be considered a “Home.” Therefore, we are faced with the problem of whether the testatrix was referring to the School <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>—by its often used misnomer. To resolve this ambiguity a court must turn to extrinsic evidence.</p>
    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[192,446,1147,317]]]'>Hence, since there is an ambiguity in the will concerning the identity of an intended beneficiary, it was proper for the lower court to have admitted extrinsic evidence to aid the court in establishing the beneficiary’s correct identity. <em>Black Estate, </em><a href="/pa/398/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="398 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="1289086" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0390-01">398 Pa. 390</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.2d%20133" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="158 A.2d 133">158 A. 2d 133</a> (1960).</p>

Moreover, the record is persuasive that neither claimant involved in this appeal truly and adequately fits the description, “Pennsylvania Home for the Blind.”</p>
    <p id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[189,1213,1150,754]]]'>The School, although it provides lodging for many of its students, is not the legal residence of the students and, very significantly, its services are limited to children. And, there is nothing in decedent’s will indicating she sought to aid children only. Furthermore, there is evidence in the record that in a previous will dated January 14, 1958,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> testatrix also created a charitable bequest for the benefit of various charitable organizations, including the “Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,” and thus apparently knew how to identify the School correctly. This being so, if the testatrix intended the School to be the beneficiary in the 1965 will, why wasn’t the designee more carefully described?</p>

By its own terms this statement contradicts the majority’s view that an appellate court may act as factfinder, apply cy pres, and award a bequest equally to two claimants.

The orphans’ court, as factfinder, must resolve initially the factual issues that the majority believes were decided on the basis of mistaken legal principles.

The portion of that opinion quoted in the concurring opinion follows an extended discussion of <em>Black Estate, </em>and when read in context, merely restates the dictum there. More fundamentally, the orphans’ court in <em>Eagleson Estate </em>held that the bequest was to be awarded to a single beneficiary, and reached its conclusion by construing the will, not applying cy pres.</p>
