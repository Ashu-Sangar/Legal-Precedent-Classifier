An autopsy revealed that asphyxiation due to strangulation caused his death. Beer cans, discovered in the bedroom and determined to have been purchased on the day of the murder, were found to contain appellant’s fingerprints. The police also discovered that appellant was seen with the victim on the morning of the murder. The police, in the course of investigating the murder, sought to question appellant. When they were unable to locate him they left a message with his girlfriend that they wished to speak with him. In response to their request appellant went to the Public Safety Building at approximately 12:30 A.M. at which time he was taken to a private room and asked if he knew the victim and if he had ever been to or knew where the victim lived. Upon receiving answers contradictory to the information they had previously obtained, the police gave appellant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings for the first time. After confronting appellant with the contradictions between Ms answers to the initial, pre-warning questions and the evidence of Ms <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>fingerprints on the beer cans, appellant waived Ms rights and made a statement in wMch he confessed Ms complicity in the crime. TMs statement was admitted into evidence.</p>
    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[153,521,1155,1527]]]'>Appellant contends that the lower court erred in refusing to grant appellant’s motion to suppress the confession on the ground that it stemmed from, and was impermissibly tainted by, the initial custodial interrogation which was illegal in that it was conducted without <em>Miranda </em>warnings in violation of appellant’s rights against self-incrimination. <em>Miranda v.

We agree.

D’Nicuola, supra </em>where the police, knowing only that D’Nicuola and the victim had failed to appear for an appointment and that a recently fired weapon was found in D’Nicuola’s car, proceeded to question D’Nicu<a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>ola without warnings while he was confined to a hospital bed.

    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[190,533,1159,478]]]'>The instant case is at least as compelling. Here the police questioned appellant in the middle of the night, in a private room in the police building, knowing that appellant had been in the room where the victim was murdered on the day of the murder.
