The Commonwealth called as witnesses four detectives who had taken part in Ewell’s arrest and interrogation. The gist of their testimony was that Ewell was arrested at about 11:15 a.m. on May 23, 1970, the morning of the fire. The arresting officers informed Ewell that the charge was homicide. He was taken promptly to the police station, where he was given the required constitutional warnings by a detective Cleary. Ewell appeared to be normal and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and his answers indicated a clear understanding and waiver of his rights to silence and the assistance of counsel. A chronology compiled by Detective Cleary and offered in evidence shows that Ewell was given food, coffee and cigarettes an hour or so after the interrogation began, and received additional cigarettes and water thereafter. Ewell admitted his responsibility for the fire at about 2:20 p.m. After making three telephone calls, using the men’s room, and resting and smoking for a while, he dictated, read and signed the formal statement which was introduced at his trial. The credibility of the Commonwealth’s witnesses was a question for the hearing judge. On the record before us, the Judge was fully warranted in finding that the confession was voluntary.</p>

We will limit our consideration to the one point which requires a new trial. In his discussion of appellant’s confession, the trial judge instructed the jury that “... the burden of proving that the defendant’s statement was voluntary and <em>true </em>rests upon the Commonwealth and that burden must be sustained <em>by a preponderance of the </em>evidence” [emphasis <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>supplied]. While this is a correct statement of the law on the question of voluntariness,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> it is, of course, not correct with regard to the truth of appellant’s statement. The Commonwealth need not prove every specific evidentiary fact in its case in chief beyond a reasonable doubt; this burden attaches only to the elements of the crime charged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> A defendant’s voluntary out-of-court statement is merely another piece of evidence to be considered in resolving the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence, and jurors can attach as much or as little weight to it as they see fit. In the case at bar, the jury might have disregarded Ewell’s statement altogether and still have convicted him on the other evidence introduced by the Commonwealth. The difficulty here, however, is that the converse is also true; the statement constituted an admission of every fact necessary to establish appellant’s guilt. Since the facts constituting the corpus delicti were undisputed, the confession was in itself a sufficient legal basis for Ewell’s conviction. Indeed, the trial judge so instructed the jury when he said, soon after giving the erroneous instruction previously quoted: “Summing up on this issue, therefore, you can find the defendant guilty of felony-murder, if you find this statement which he gave to the police of his participation in the arson was voluntarily given and that it was true; however, <em>if you find his statement </em>was not voluntarily given or that it <em>was not true, </em>then you cannot consider that statement as any evidence of the defendant’s guilt and you must then determine from other evidence whether the defendant’s guilt of arson and murder has been established. . . (Emphasis supplied.) We think that, taken together, the passages we <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>have quoted from the charge permitted the jury to return a verdict of guilty on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, even if the jurors entertained a reasonable doubt as to appellant’s guilt.</p>
    <p id="b692-4" data-blocks='[["BL_692.5",692,[179,547,1162,1798]],["BL_693.1",693,[176,315,1149,592]]]'>It is, of course, a well-settled rule of law that the charge to the jury must be considered as a whole. <em>Commonwealth v. Fostar, </em><a href="/citations/?q=445%20Pa.%20216" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="445 Pa. 216">445 Pa. 216</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20188" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="317 A.2d 188">317 A.2d 188</a> (1974). In the case at bar, the court told the jury that “[y]ou should consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a statement, along with all other evidence in the case in judging its truthfulness and deciding how much weight, if any, the statement deserves on the question of guilt or innocence”. In addition, the court several times charged the jury that the burden was on the Commonwealth to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, on a matter as important as the Commonwealth’s burden in a criminal case to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot say that the error was cured by these other portions of the charge which correctly stated the general rule. A similar mistake was made in the charge to the jury in <em>Commonwealth v. Ross, </em><a href="/pa/266/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="266 Pa. 580" data-case-ids="1056071" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0580-01">266 Pa. 580</a>, 583, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%20327" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="110 A. 327">110 A. 327</a> (1920), where the trial court placed too high a burden of proof on the defendant in his attempt to establish the defense of self-defense. In that case, the court told the jury that “[w]here the defense is self-defense, it is not enough to present evidence under which the jury may doubt whether or not the defendant may have acted in self-defense. <em>When any doubt on that subject exists, self-defense is not established. </em>But when established by a fair preponderance of the evidence, it is excusable homicide.” (Emphasis supplied.) Reviewing this instruction, this Court said: “That [italicized portion of the] statement was equivalent to saying that self-defense must be established beyond a reasonable doubt, which is incorrect, for it ignores the distinction between fairly pre<a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>ponderating evidence and that which is beyond a reasonable doubt. We know, as lawyers, that the trial judge had no such thought in mind — in fact, <em>he repeatedly stated the law to the jury upon this branch of the case with entire accuracy; but we cannot know judicially that the accidental misstatement did defendant no harm. </em>It is enough that the jury may have received thereby a wrong impression as to the quantum of proof necessary to establish self-defense.” <a href="/pa/266/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="266 Pa. 580" data-case-ids="1056071" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0580-01">266 Pa. at 583</a>. (Emphasis supplied.) The underlying rationale of the <em>Boss </em>case and kindred decisions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> is controlling here.</p>
    <p id="b693-3" data-blocks='[["BL_693.4",693,[177,919,1150,866]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the error in the charge was harmless because the corroborative evidence introduced by the Commonwealth was so overwhelming. We cannot accept this argument, for we may not speculate as to the basis of the jury’s verdict. Strong as the Commonwealth’s case was, the jury was nonetheless free to reject it in its entirety and instead accept the alibi defense which Ewell tendered; it is conceivable that, absent the error in the charge, they might have done so. Moreover, under the instructions given by the court, a juror might have concluded that if he found Ewell’s statement credibile on its face, he was relieved of any obligation to consider the other evidence offered by the Commonwealth. It is not for us to say what in fact happened in the jury room, or what would have happened if the jury had been correctly instructed.</p>
