The allegations of error were that: (1) in appellant’s closing argument reference was made to a per diem figure in support of recovery of damages and (2) an uncontrolled experimental re-enactment of the accident was staged. The trial judge then directed the plaintiff to either file a remittitur of all sums in excess of $13,500 or undergo a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Superior Court quashed an immediate appeal on the issue of remittitur on the ground that no appealable order had yet issued. <em>Atene v.

It is not at all clear from the opinion of the trial judge whether he was ruling upon the appellee’s post-trial motion for a new trial or solely upon the merits of his own order suggesting remittitur as a basis for the grant of a new trial. This Court must assume the task of construing the propriety of a new trial against its background of a post-verdict ultimatum of remittitur or new trial and an imprecise trial court opinion granting a new trial.</p>

It is clear that the only issue treated by the <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>Superior Court on the second appeal was the propriety of the new trial order.

Consequently, his use of toy cars for purposes of clarification and illustration was, in my view, entirely proper and provides no basis for a new trial.</p>
