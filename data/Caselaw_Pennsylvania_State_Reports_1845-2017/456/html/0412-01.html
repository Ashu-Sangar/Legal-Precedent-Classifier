This is the correct approach. Restatement of Property § 478 (1944); 3 R. Powell, The Law of Real Property § 416 (1973). In his discussion, the chancellor stated that the case was controlled by <em>Soltis v.

An easement by necessity may be created when, after severance from adjoining property, a piece of land is without access to a public highway. See <em>Soltis v. Miller, </em>supra at 359, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20369" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="282 A.2d 369">282 A.2d at 370</a>; <em>Borstnar v.

An easement by prescription, on the other hand, is created by adverse, open, continuous, notorious, and uninterrupted use of land for the prescriptive period — in Pennsylvania, twenty-one years. Act of March 26, 1785, 2 Sm. L. 299, § 2, 12 P.S. § 72 (1953); <em>Lewkowicz v.

Because it is <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>created by adverse use, an easement by prescription is limited by the use made during the prescriptive period. <em>Donahue v. Punxsutawney Borough, </em><a href="/pa/298/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="298 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="1120309" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0077-01">298 Pa. 77</a>, 82-83, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20A.%2041" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="148 A. 41">148 A. 41</a>, 43 (1929); <em>Jones v.

    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[147,540,1151,1031]]]'>This limitation is not, however, absolute. Easements by prescription may be apportioned when the dominant tenement is subdivided. Restatement of Property § 488 (1944). Furthermore, “normal evolution in the use of the dominant tenement” will permit reasonable increases in the burden imposed on the servient tenement. Restatement of Property § 479 (1944). Here, the use during the prescriptive period was for entry and exit by various motor vehicles. Since a portion of the dominant tenement was sold the use has continued to be for access by motor vehicles. Although the number of vehicles using the lane may have increased, we conclude that the chancellor correctly found that the increase is not unreasonable. Only four cabins have been built. Testimony indicates that these cabins are to be sold to private parties who will use them for recreational purposes. On this record we cannot say that it was error for the chancellor to find that the burden imposed on the easement is reasonable.</p>

A driveway was used by a family for residential and farming purposes in <em>Gaither v. Gaither, </em>165 Oal.

After the prescriptive period had run, two rental units were constructed on the dominant tenement and the tenants of the dominant owner used the driveway for access to their home. The California Court of Appeal held that the change in the use of the easement was one of degree only and no greater burden was imposed on the servient tenement.

The court reasoned that the same physical objects — automobiles— used the driveway for the same purpose — ingress and egress. It noted however that the original prescriptive <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>easement would not support the use of the driveway for access to a planned trailer park. <a href="/citations/?q=332%20P.2d%20436" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="332 P.2d 436">Id.</a> See also <em>Pipkin v.
