Our first observation is that a complaint of unethical practice or violation of the Code of Professional Responsi<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>bility, were it to arise today, would not be within the cognizance of the court below or any other court of common pleas, but of The Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania established by the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement adopted by this Court in 1972 under its powers to prescribe general rules for admission to the bar and to practice law. Constitution of Pennsylvania, art. Y, § 10(c). The Disciplinary Rules superseded all other court rules and statutes pertaining to disciplinary enforcement previously promulgated. See Preamble to The Disciplinary Rules and also the repealer section of the Rules, Rule 17-24. The present proceedings, however, antedated the effective date of the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement and, hence, were properly not transferred to the new Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Rule 14 of this Court (since amended and renumbered Rule 13) was in effect at the commencement of the present proceeding and provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that admission to the bar of the Supreme Court “shall entitle such attorney to practice in every Court of this Commonwealth, upon <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>presentation to such Court of a certificate of the Supreme Court that the attorney is a member of the bar of this Court in good standing”. (419 Pa. xxxii.) The question arises whether, in light of this rule, a lawyer such as appellant who was in good standing before this Court and thus entitled to practice anywhere in the Commonwealth could for cause shown be suspended by the court of common pleas of one judicial district from the right to practice before that court. This question has not arisen heretofore, so far as we are aware, and in light of the new Disciplinary Rules, it is not likely to recur. The answer to it in this case, it seems to us, is that the appellant was domiciled in Montgomery County, maintained a law office there, and committed the offense in a judicial proceeding in that court. The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County had, therefore, a direct and peculiar interest in monitoring the professional conduct of appellant and administering appropriate discipline. It was obviously not intending to usurp an exclusive power of this Court, nor acting in any secretive manner, for in accordance with past practice in such matters, it directed copies of its decree to be sent to this and the other appellate courts of this Commonwealth, and the appropriate federal district court.</p>

It was not designed to take away the control that the courts of common pleas historically exercised over the professional conduct of members of their bars. That did not come about until later, with the adoption of The Disciplinary Rules heretofore mentioned.</p>

TMs issue was not raised below, and there is no warrant for us to consider it now. We must note, however, lest there be any misapprehension, that it would be anomalous indeed for us to condemn, as we do, a lawyer’s knowing participation in the introduction of perjured testimony by a client, see EC 7-26, Code of Professional Responsibility, 438 Pa. xxv, at xciii, and at the same time condone the giving of such testimony by a lawyer himself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The Code of Professional Responsibility <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>merely states the obvious and declares preexisting law when it provides that a lawyer shall not engage in “conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation” or conduct that is “prejudicial to the administration of justice”. [NR 1-102 (A)(4) and (5), 438 Pa. xxxi.] False swearing in a judicial proceeding is certainly an egregious species of dishonesty and is surely also patently prejudicial to the administration of justice. This is doubly so when it is a lawyer who is the perjurer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> That the lawyer was acting on his own behalf and not that of a client when the perjurious statements were made can in no wise serve to insulate him from disciplinary action by the courts to which he is admitted to practice.

The record shows that an arbitration award against Hecht and his wife was entered on June 30, 1966. On the preceding day, Hecht had caused the title to the Ventnor property, then in the names of himself and his wife, to be transferred to the names of himself and his wife as trustees for their children. The declaration of trust contained in the deed was by its terms revocable by the grantors or the survivor of them at any time, and the grantors reserved the right to sell the premises free and clear of all trusts. The portion of the deposition testimony principally giving rise to the charge of perjury is as follows: “Q.
