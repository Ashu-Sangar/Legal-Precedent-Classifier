A specific devise is a gift by will of a specific parcel which is identified and distinguished from all other parcels of land, and which may be satisfied only by delivery of the particular parcel of property. <em>Soles Estate, supra </em>at 573; <em>Snyder’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/217/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="217 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="953718" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0071-01">217 Pa. 71</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20157" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="66 A. 157">66 A. 157</a> (1907). Appellant first argues that this was a demonstrative devise and thus not subject to ademption. He argues that paragraphs seven<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and eight<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> evidence a clear intention on the part of decedent to assure Paul’s right to the proceeds in the event the Preble Avenue property was sold. Although, as has been stated, intention is not relevant on the question of ademption, it is relevant when the issue to be determined is whether the legacy is demonstrative or specific. <em>Shearer’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/346/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="346 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1216480" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0097-01">346 Pa. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20535" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="29 A.2d 535">29 A.2d 535</a> (1943); <em>Walls v.

Further, that intention must be gathered not only from the language used in creating the bequest or devise but from the provisions of the will as a whole, and if there is doubt, courts are inclined to find a demonstrative rather than a specific legacy, devise or bequest. <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>

Here, however, the language of paragraph four leaves no question of the intent to create a specific devise. Nor do we find any merit in the suggestion that paragraphs 7 and 8 in anyway alters this conclusion. Clearly paragraphs 7 and 8 were merely limiting the power of the Executor to prevent the sale of the property that was designated in paragraph 4 as the subject of the specific devise provided that the property was an asset of the estate at the time of death. In our judgment, these paragraphs strengthen rather than weaken the view that testator intended a specific devise.</p>

In <em>Shearer’s Estate, </em>the testator created by will a trust for the benefit of his son, for and during the lifetime of the son. After describing his farm along with the stock and personal property thereon as the corpus of the trust, testator provided: “[t]he value of the said farm, and contents I fix at the sum of Six Thousand Dollars, so that my said son shall receive the use and benefit of said amount out of my estate.” From other provisions in the document it was clear that testator was attempting to equalize the distributions among his children. This Court there properly held:“..., it is quite obvious that the intention of testator was that his son Clayton should, in all events, receive the benefit of an amount of $6,000, his paramount desire being to equalize the shares of his children after taking into consideration the amounts that some of them had received in his lifetime. As Jacob had already obtained $6,000, and each daughter $2,000, he gave to each daughter $4,000 more and to Clayton the farm and its contents, the value of which he expressly fixed at the sum of $6,000 ‘so that my said son shall receive the use and benefit of <em>said amount </em>out of my estate.’ ” <a href="/pa/346/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="346 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1216480" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0097-01">346 Pa. at 101</a>.</p>

In <em>Frost Estate, supra, </em>where testatrix provided a gift to her brother and sisters of the proceeds of her General Motors stock and prior to death sold the stock, however the funds were traceable, we held that the gift was not adeemed. Our decision in <em>Frost </em>was a recognition of a distinction between a gift of stock and a gift of its proceeds. Consistent with the decisions in a number of other jurisdictions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> we held in the latter instance where the money can be traced the gift is not adeemed and the legatee is entitled to the proceeds.

A specific devise or bequest shall not be adeemed when the testator or the testator’s estate receives an asset in exchange for the subject of the devise or bequest and the act which otherwise would have caused the ademption occurs while the testator is an adjudged incompetent. In such case the devise or bequest shall be deemed to apply to whatever was received in exchange. Added 1965, Dec. 22, P. L. 1194, §1.” Appellant attempted to demonstrate that the decedent became incompetent shortly after the sale of the subject <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>real estate and was therefore unable to make a new Will. To the contrary, there was substantial testimony in the record that indicates decedent continued to conduct his personal affairs competently for many months after the June 1968 sale. In any event there was never an adjudication of incompetency and thus this statutory provision is inapplicable. We therefore affirm the Court en banc’s ruling that the devise set forth in paragraph four of the will was adeemed.</p>

We recently observed in <em>Vajentic Estate, </em><a href="/pa/453/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="453 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="577611" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0001-01">453 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=306%20A.2d%20300" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="306 A.2d 300">306 A.2d 300</a> (1973): “We note first that, while contracts to make a will in a certain manner, are recognized in Pennsylvania, such contracts are viewed 'with misgivings and suspicion’. Fahringer v. Strine Estate, supra. As we said in Fahringer, at page 52: 'A contract to make a will in a certain manner or to bequeath by will a specific monetary sum is recognized in Pennsylvania as valid, provided the <em>creation </em>of such contract and its <em>terms </em>are proven with clarity and conviction and valid consideration shown [cites omitted]. However, because resort to such contracts represents an effort to effect a distribution, either in whole or in part, of the estate of a decedent in a manner different than the orderly procedure of a will — the stringent requirements of which have been set forth by the legislature — and because of the opportunity such alleged contracts afford for the presentation of false and fraudulent claims, tradition<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>ally the courts have been reluctant to give recognition to such contracts and have viewed claims based on such contracts with misgivings and suspicions.’ ” 453 at 7, <a href="/citations/?q=306%20A.2d%20300" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="306 A.2d 300">306 A.2d at 304</a>. To establish the existence of the contract Paul and his wife offered testimony to that effect. In addition, testimony was offered in support of the existence of the contract by Rosemarie Michelson, the mother-in-law of Paul and Rosemary, Paul’s daughter. The court below found the testimony of Paul and his wife Stella was barred by the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, par. 5, 28 P.S. §322. The court also determined that the testimony of Rosemarie and Rosemary standing alone failed to provide the degree of proof necessary to establish the existence of a contract. A review of the record satisfies us that the testimony of the daughter and the mother-in-law was indeed inadequate. The crucial issue, therefore, is whether the court was correct in determining that the testimony of Paul and his wife was excluded by the Dead Man’s Act. That statute provides in pertinent part: “Nor, where any party to a thing or contract in action is dead . . . and his right thereto or therein has passed, either by his own act or by the act of the law, to a party on the record who represents his interest in the subject in controversy, shall any surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract, or any other person whose interest shall be adverse to the said right of such deceased . . . party, be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of said party. . . .” Proceeding under the theory of breach of contract Paul stands in the position of any other creditor attempting to proceed against the assets of the estate and, therefore, the statute is clearly applicable and bars his testimony. Consequently, Stella, the wife of Paul is also barred.
