        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nIn 1972, appellants petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to set aside a 1969 decree of distribution. The court refused the requested relief and dismissed the petition. We affirm.\nOn June 25, 1949, decedent, Mihaly Kasula, then a resident of the Soviet Union, died intestate. For a number of years decedent had resided in Allegheny County and had been employed by the United States Steel Corporation. His estate\u2019s only asset was $2,949.80 in the corporation\u2019s pension fund. Letters of administration were granted to decedent\u2019s grandson, a resident of Allegheny County, on October 30, 1961.\nOn September 6, 1963, the orphans\u2019 court entered a decree which, inter alia, awarded to the Commonwealth, as custodian, the sum of $1,524.53, representing intestate shares of a purported son and daughter of decedent said to be living in the Soviet Union. These shares were to be held by the Commonwealth without escheat subject to the provisions of the Act of July 28, 1953, P.L. 674. Subsequently, on August 12, 1969, upon petition of the administrator, a final decree of distribution was entered. That decree directed the Commonwealth to repay to the estate the sums held, and directed the administrator to distribute that amount to known intestate heirs, three grandchildren of decedent living in the United States. Pursuant to that decree, the balance of the estate was distributed.\nAlmost three years thereafter, on June 19, 1972, a petition to set aside the 1969 decree of distribution was filed by the substitute attorney in fact for the alien claimants. That petition was dismissed. Appellants\u2019 exceptions were then argued before the court en banc and dismissed. This appeal ensued.\nThe critical question presented is whether appellants offered sufficient proof to establish their claim as heirs of Mihaly Kasula. The orphans\u2019 court as factfinder and the court en banc determined that they did not. We conclude that this determination is supported by the evidence, and therefore affirm.\nManifestly, a court may not decree distribution to persons whose identity as proper beneficiaries of a decedent\u2019s estate has not been established. In cases such as this, involving intestacy, two facts must be proved. A claimant must demonstrate not only Ms \u201cidentity as a qualified statutory heir but also that such an heir in fact existed.\u201d Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 218, 282 A.2d 700, 703 (1971).\nThe burden of proving heirship rests with the claimant. Demczuk Estate, supra; Krepinevich Estate, 433 Pa. 78, 248 A.2d 844 (1969); Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 194 A.2d 194 (1963); Davis Estate, 365 Pa. 605, 76 A.2d 643 (1950); Link\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 319 Pa. 513, 180 A. 1 (1935). The standard of proof necessary to sustain that burden was set forth by this Court in Bokey Estate, supra at 250, 194 A.2d at 197. We there said that \u201c \u2018the evidence must be so clean-, precise and definite in quality and quantity as to satisfy the court below that the relationsMp claimed existed.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied)\u201d (quoting Link\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 319 Pa. 513, 522-23, 180 A. 1, 5 (1935)). Here, neither the auditing judge nor the court en bane were satisfied that appellants established the claimed relationship.\nBoth the existence of foreign heirs and specifically appellants\u2019 identity as heirs were in controversy here. During the twenty-three years following decedent\u2019s death, appellants presented only the following evidence in support of their claim. On August 16, 1960, Iniurcolleguia, an association of lawyers in Moscow, U.S.S.R., dispatched a letter to the TJMted States Steel Corporation Pension Fund. That letter stated that a certain Nikolai Kasula, an appellant here, asked the association to represent Mm as a beneficiary of Ms father\u2019s estate. Approximately one year later, another letter was sent. That letter stated that the association also represented one Anna Fentsik, a daughter of decedent, who had also survived her father. On May 15, 1969, a power of attorney was executed before a Soviet notary by persons purporting to be Anna and Nikolai, and forwarded to the United States. No other evidence was offered by appellants.\nThe evidence in opposition to appellants\u2019 claim established that repeated requests by counsel for the administrator for evidence of appellants\u2019 entitlement to share in the estate were unproductive. His numerous letters remained unanswered. Moreover, decedent\u2019s grandson testified that neither his mother nor his grandfather (who had lived with him when he resided in the United States) ever mentioned the existence of any children living in the Soviet Union. He further testified that he had \u201clittle interest in the relatively small sum of money involved . . . .\u201d The court, in evaluating the evidence, declared that \u201c[the grandson\u2019s] testimony impressed us as being true.\u201d\nOn the evidence before it, the orphans\u2019 court concluded that appellants had failed to prove either the existence of any foreign heirs or their own identity as intestate beneficiaries. The court consequently refused to disturb the earlier 1969 adjudication and dismissed appellants\u2019 petition. This action was approved by the court en banc.\nThis Court\u2019s scope of review in cases of this nature is well defined. On appeal, it is not for the appellate court to assess the credibility of the testimony. Our evidentiary review is limited to a determination of whether the findings of fact of the chancellor are supported by sufficient, competent evidence.\n\u201cWe will not retry this case. The question for us to consider is, first, whether there is evidence to support the findings of fact and whether the findings of fact support the decree. The court below and the court en banc made a thorough review of all the evidence and arrived at certain findings. If the evidence supports the findings and the findings in turn justify the decree, the decree will not be set aside . . . .\u201d Pusey\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 248, 260, 184 A. 844, 849 (1936) (emphasis in the original, citations omitted); accord, Shewchuk Es tate, 444 Pa. 249, 260, 282 A.2d 807, 313 (1971); Mintz Trust, 444 Pa. 189, 196, 282 A.2d 295, 299 (1971).\nAppellants contend, however, that the court\u2019s findings were contrary to the evidence. Their position, it would appear, is that the recitals of kinship set forth in a power of attorney executed before a notary are conclusive proof of the facts asserted. This Court has held precisely to the contrary. Bokey Estate, supra at 251-52, 194 A.2d at 197-98. Here the power of attorney shows only that persons purporting to be decedent\u2019s children appeared before a notary, asserted their claims of kinship, and in his presence executed the document. As in Bokey Estate, the writing is an assertion, not proof. It is obvious that this document alone or in concert with appellants\u2019 other evidence fails to establish by clear, precise, and definite proof, as required by Bokey Estate, either the existence of any children in the Soviet Union or the affiants\u2019 identity as decedent\u2019s heirs.\nIn the absence of such proof, there is no basis for disturbing the court\u2019s decree.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nNeither appellants\u2019 identities nor entitlement were then adjudicated. In his 1963 petition captioned \u201cpetition to pay balance for distribution,\u201d the administrator clearly questioned the existence of any Soviet heirs, there stating:\n\u201cThere has been no verification of the existence of Nikolai . . . and Anna . . . both of whom are supposed to be living in the TJ.S.S.R. . . .\n\u201c. . . [S]aid petitioner . . . does not believe the existence of said individuals in the TJ.S.S.R. and therefore requests the court at this time to make distribution [awarding a two-thirds interest to the state treasury without escheat] for a limited time, and if the two alleged heirs ... do not claim said funds, then said monies to be decreed to [the known heirs].\u201d\nThis decree was only a partial distribution to known heirs and payment of the balance to the state treasury without escheat. The administrator proposed this distribution to avoid suspending the entire estate for an indefinite period. Because of uncertainty in 1963 as to the existence of a possible aunt and uncle, the administrator merely requested the court to hold the balance of the estate for a reasonable time to see if any competent evidence would surface showing the existence of any other heirs. The 1963 decree by its own terms was not final. Only after waiting six years, during which no evidence of entitlement was produced, did the administrator, in 1969, petition the court to decree final distribution. The dissent mistakenly elevates a 1963 partial custody-type distribution to the status of a final adjudication of appellants\u2019 kinship.\nThis Act, frequently called the \u201cIron Curtain Act,\u201d was since declared unconstitutional, Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971) ; see Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429, 88 S. Ct. 664 (1968), and was repealed. Act of June 30, 3972, P.L. 508, No. 164, \u00a7 3.\nA power of attorney executed in the Soviet Union on May 15, 1969, named the New York law firm of Wolf, Popper, Boss, Wolf & Jones to represent the foreign claimants. New York counsel subsequently nominated James Francis Lawler, Esq., of Philadelphia as substitute attorney in fact.\nSee also Bobko v. Ukrainian Workingmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, 71 Lackawanna Jurist 86 (Pa. C.P. 1970) ; Slotkin Estate, 40 Pa. D. & C.2d 334 (O.C. Phila. 1965), aff\u2019d per curiam, 423 Pa. 628, 222 A.2d 597 (1966) ; Martinzik Estate, 25 Pa. D. & C.2d 701 (O.C. Phila. 1962).\nAny notion that the Act of April 27, 1876, P.L. 49, \u00a7 1, 28 P.S. \u00a7 223 (1958), compels the factfinder to accept as true an affiant\u2019s assertions of kinship is contrary to this Court\u2019s express holding in Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 194 A.2d 194 (1963). There this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice (now Mr. Chief Justice) Jones, unequivocally held that the statutory phrase \u201cprima facie evidence of the matters therein set forth\u201d refers only to matters set forth by the notary, not to those of the affiants. Id. at 252, 194 A.2d at 198.\nMoreover, this Court in Bokey specifically held: \u201c \u2018The essence of the notarial certificate is that the document has been executed, and that the notary knows that he is confronted by the signer, and that the signer is asserting the fact of his execution.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 252, 194 A.2d at 198 (quoting Scott v. Penn Title Ins. Co., 49 Berks County L.J. 36, 39 (Pa. C.P. 1956)). See Sheaffer v. Baeringer, 346 Pa. 32, 36, 29 A.2d 697, 699 (1943).\nThe dissent inaccurately states the issue in this case. Neither this Court nor the orphans\u2019 court has questioned either the validity or authenticity of appellants\u2019 power of attorney. That American lawyers may, in accordance with the terms of the power, represent appellants before our courts and assert whatever rights appellants may have is not questioned. The power of attorney was here given the same recognition and effect as was done in Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971), and Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 194 A.2d 194 (1963). A claimant\u2019s right to have his interests advanced by counsel designated in a power of attorney must not be confused with the issue of proof of kinship in this case. Here the issue is whether the adjudications of the orphans\u2019 court and the court en banc that appellants did not prove their heirship are supported by the record.\nSee Demcmk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971), in which the applicable burden of proof was satisfied. In Demcmk, in addition to producing a power of attorney, the claimant demonstrated his identity by introducing affidavits of heirship executed by members of the village in which decedent\u2019s family resided, and copies of birth, death, and marriage certificates. Collectively, this evidence proved claimant\u2019s identity. Id. at 220-21, 282 A.2d at 704-05. See Comment, The Demise of the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d Statute, 18 Vill. L. Rev. 49, 65 (1972). Obviously, such proof is lacking in this case.\nFor further discussion of the necessity of and means for proving kinship and identity, see .Tones, Pennsylvania Custodial Statutes : Orphans\u2019 Court Proceedings for Recovery of Nonescheated Funds, 39 Temp. L.Q. 153, 164-68 (1966).\nThe dissent erroneously contends that our decision is \u201can unjustified intrusion into the area of foreign affairs.\u201d However, Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429, 88 S. Ct. 664 (1968), and Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971), upon which the dissent relies, surely do not stand for the proposition that courts may not require proof of heirship before distribution is decreed. Requiring all claimants \u2014 foreign and domestic \u2014 to prove their entitlement is fundamental to the sound administration of estates and does not offend foreign policy.\nIndeed, it has recently been observed: \u201cThe kinship of an alien heir in cases of intestacy, and the existence and identity of the heir are . . . usual matters of proof necessary to establish a valid claim to property .... Such qualifications are unaffected by Zschernig since these judicial inquiries are . . . objective and reasonable. Inquiry into these matters of proof would appear to proceed from a state\u2019s right and duty to guarantee a just distribution of an estate . . . .\u201d Recent Case Note, 72 Dick. L. Rev. 675, 681 (1968) (footnotes omitted).\nHere, claimants were faced with the same burden as American claimants. Any claimant is required to prove his identity and kinship before the orphans\u2019 court can make an award in his favor.\nThe dissent erroneously argues that a foreign claimant having executed a power of attorney asserting the affiant\u2019s kinship is entitled to share in a decedent\u2019s estate without producing corroborative evidence even in the face of other competent and contradictory evidence which the court finds credible. If the dissenting view were to obtain, a foreign claimant by use of a power of attorney would prevail with less evidence of heirship than any other claimant.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Pomeroy :\nTbe decision of tbe Court refuses to give recognition and effect to wbat I consider to be a valid power of attorney executed by tbe appellants in tbe Soviet Union. I, therefore, must respectfully dissent.\nA recitation of tbe procedural bistory of tbe case to date, in more detail than that given in tbe Court\u2019s opinion, will serve to put tbe issue before us in proper perspective.\nIn 1961, decedent\u2019s grandson, George Perick, one of tbe appellees, petitioned for and was granted letters of administration in tbe estate of bis grandfather, tbe decedent herein, who bad died in tbe U.S.S.R. eleven years earlier, in 1949. In bis capacity as administrator there came to Perick information that the decedent bad been survived by two children, a son and daughter, living in tbe Soviet Union. Their names were Nicolai Micbailovicb Kasula and Anna Mikhailovna Kasula Eencik (tbe appellants herein). Tbe administrator proposed, therefore, in bis petition for distribution, that tbe one-third interest of each child of tbe decedent be decreed to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without escheat, pursuant to the Act of July 28, 1953, P. L. 674, 20 P.S. \u00a71156 (sometimes called the \u201cIron Curtain Act\u201d), and the Orphans\u2019 Court so decreed. The sense of the decree was that said two-thirds share of the estate was to be held by the Commonwealth for the account of said children until such time as they might establish, in the words of the statute, their \u201cactual benefit, use, enjoyment or control\u201d of such funds, if transferred to them. The New York counsel for the testator\u2019s children living in the Soviet Union were advised of the award. No time limit was placed on the right of the Soviet heirs to petition for payment of their shares from the sum held in escrow by the Commonwealth.\nSo matters stood until 1968. In that year, the United States Supreme Court, in Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429, 19 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1968), declared that an Oregon statute similar to Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cIron Curtain Act\u201d was unconstitutional as an intrusion by a state into foreign affairs of the United States. In the same year and the year following, the Pennsylvania statute was declared unconstitutional by several Orphans\u2019 Courts of this Commonwealth, and in a federal court case the Attorney General of Pennsylvania conceded the unconstitutionality of the Act of 1953. Soon after these declarations of unconstitutionality the administrator, on July 28, 1969, filed a petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court praying that the funds originally set aside for the Soviet children of the decedent be paid over to himself, Ms brother and his sister, grandchildren of the decedent, as the heirs entitled thereto. No notice to the Soviet heirs or their New York counsel was given of this petition, and on August 12, 1969, the Orphans\u2019 Court granted it, apparently without a hearing.\nThe appellants\u2019 petition to set aside the ex parte decree of August 12, 1969 was denied on October 31, 1972. Exceptions were dismissed and a final decree entered December 22, 1972. It is from that decree that the Soviet heirs have appealed to this Court.\nIn my view, this estate was closed in 1963 when a decree of distribution was entered, no exceptions thereto were taken, and distribution was actually made in accordance therewith. There was no residual right in the administrator (who had himself proposed the distribution of 1963) to come in later and seek to revoke a portion of the distribution then ordered. The Iron Curtain Act had indeed been declared invalid in the interim, but this gave no right to the American grandchildren of the decedent then to hasten to court in an endeavor to preempt the rights of the Eussian children of the decedent, whose identities and entitlement had already been ascertained. The fund was supposedly in the hands of the Commonwealth for the protection of the foreign heirs until they could demonstrate that they would receive \u201cthe actual benefit, use, enjoyment and control of the property.\u201d The fact that the statute under which the distributive shares of the Eussian heirs had been held in escrow was declared unconstitutional did not negate the right of the Soviet heirs to their just shares of their father\u2019s estate; on the contrary, it merely meant that they were entitled to receive payment of the impounded funds forthwith, free of the strings imposed by the invalid statute.\nThe sole question properly before the court below on the petition to set aside the decree of August 12, 1969, under the circumstances above outlined, was the adequacy of the power of attorney presented by James Francis Lawler, Esquire, of Philadelphia, to authorize payment to him, as attorney-in-fact, of the previously escrowed monies. To that question I now turn.\nThe power of attorney, dated May 15, 1969, was in favor of the New York firm of Wolf, Popper, Boss, Wolf and Jones (who substituted Mr. Lawler for themselves) and was executed and acknowledged before a notary public in the U.S.S.B. The certificate of acknowledgment of the power of attorney recited, inter aUa, that Nicolai and Anna, the donors of the power, were known to the notary as the persons indicated in the power of attorney and that they had come in person before her to execute and acknowledge the power of attorney. The notary public, as might be expected, was a Bussian notary, and therein, in the view of the lower court and the majority opinion here, lay its infirmity. Had the acknowledgment been made before a consul of the United States and had he certified that he personally knew the individuals who presented themselves, the document would be of \u201csignificant probative value\u201d in determining the identity of the acknowledgers. Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 220, 282 A. 2d 700 (1971). Here, however, relying on Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 194 A. 2d 194 (1963), the Court holds the acknowledgment insufficient to indicate authenticity of the power of attorney because the power \u201cshows only that persons purporting to be decedent\u2019s children appeared before a notary, asserted their claims of kinship, and in his presence executed the document\u201d. (Majority Opinion, supra at 68. Footnote omitted.) But cf. Krepinevich Estate, 433 Pa. 78, 85, 248 A. 2d 844 (1969).\nThis conclusion overlooks the fact that the power of attorney here involved, while not acknowledged immediately before a United States consular officer, was duly authenticated in full compliance with the statutes of this Commonwealth. Indeed, the Pennsylvania legislature expressly provided as long ago as 1876 that \u201c[t]he official acts and exemplifications of foreign notaries in accordance with the laws of their respective countries shall be prima facie evidence of the matters set forth therein,\u201d provided there is proper certification by a United States consul as set forth in the statute. Here the acknowledgment taken by the Soviet notary was duly certified to be such by an official of the Supreme Court of Ukrainian S. S. E. That certification was in turn attested by one I. B. Konzhukov, a Soviet consular officer, and to the latter\u2019s certificate was attached a certificate of his authority executed by Eobie M. Palmer, Consul of the United States at the Embassy at Moscow.\nI do not understand Bokey Estate, supra, or any of our other decisions in this general field to have established a rule that only powers of attorney personally executed before a United States consul are entitled to recognition. Bokey and Link\u2019s Estate, 319 Pa. 513, 180 A. 1 (1935), on which it relied, were concerned with the quality of proof to establish \u201ckinship which carries with it a claim of property against the claim of the State.\u201d Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. at 249, quoting from Link\u2019s Estate, 319 Pa. at 519, 520. It was held that this must be proved \u201cby something more than a guess,\u201d and that to defeat a claim of the Commonwealth the evidence of kinship must be \u201cso clear, precise and definite in quality and quantity as to satisfy the court below that the relationship claimed existed.\u201d Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. at 250, quoting again from Link\u2019s Estate, 319 Pa. at 522, 523. Because such proof was found wanting in Bokey, this Court concluded that the lower court erred in awarding the balance for distribution to the Commonwealth under the Iron Curtain Act. 412 Pa. at 253. In the case before us, however, that hurdle was jumped ten years ago. The transfer at that time to the Commonwealth under the Act of 1953 has not been challenged and is not in issue; indeed, that disposition was recommended by appellee.\nThe sole question, as before stated, is the authenticity of the power of attorney. By our statute, that authenticity is at least prima facie evidenced by the certificate of acknowledgment, and no countervailing evidence has been forthcoming. For us to refuse to recognize the authority of the power of attorney here before us seems to me to be in practical effect as much an unjustified intrusion into the area of foreign affairs as was our Iron Curtain Act itself. Certainly most persons living abroad who have need to execute a power of attorney for use in this country will not find it possible or feasible, as did the claimant in Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A. 2d 700 (1971), to do so before a United States consul. They may well live in remote areas and be of modest means; there is no reason why they should have to travel to a city where we maintain a consulate. Our legislation was adopted for the very purpose of allowing recognition and credit to be extended to acts of notaries public of other countries. The invidious distinction now perpetuated by the Court is a vestigial remnant of the \u201cCold War\u201d attitude so prevalent in the post-World War II period. See Zschernig v. Miller, supra, 389 U.S. at 437; Belemecich Estate, 411 Pa. 506 (1963). It is out of place in today\u2019s world. Hence my dissent.\nMr. Justice Nix and Mr. Justice Manderino join in this dissenting opinion.\nThe exact provision of the decree of distribution was as follows :\n\u201cTo: Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Revenue, without escheat, the distributive shares of the following named alien beneficiaries, to be held in the State Treasury subject to the provisions of Act No. 209 approved July 28, 1953, viz:\n\u201cTo: Nikolai Michailovieh, son, heir, 1/3 balance 762.27\n\u201cTo: Anna Mikhailovich Kasula Fencik, daughter, heir, 1/3 balance 762.26\u201d\nIn response to a request by counsel for the estate that the award be for but a limited time, the auditing judge ruled at the 1963 audit hearing: \u201cI do not put any time limit on it because if there is ever peace with Russia, they can come into Court and get Harrisburg to release those funds. There is no time limit. It is indefinite. They cannot get it until there is some peace established between Russia and this country.\u201d\nStruchmanczuk Estate, 44 Pa. D. & C. 2d 155 (Phila.

Thereafter in 1971, tbe \u201cIron Curtain Act\u201d was indeed declared unconstitutional by this Court: Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A. 2d 700 (1971).\nTbe majority opinion notes that tbe time interval between tbe filing of tbe decree directing payments to tbe American grandchildren and tbe petition of appellants to set aside that decree was \u201calmost three years\u201d. Under Section 721 of tbe Fiduciaries Act, Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, Art. VII, \u00a7721 (now Section 3521 of tbe Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, Act of June 30, 1972, P. L. 508, No. 164), a petition to review a decree of distribution may be filed within five years of tbe date of confirmation of an account. Tbe instant petition is analogous to tbe procedure there permitted-\nI can find no warrant for the statement in the opinion of the Court [footnote 1, page 64, supra] that the 1963 decree was only \u201ca partial distribution\u201d and that the decree \u201cby its own terms was not final\u201d. On the contrary, it disposed of the entire estate, and there was nothing to suggest a lack of finality.\nAs this Court has pointed out, one of the conditions to bring into play a provisional distribution to the Commonwealth under the \u201cIron Curtain Act\u201d is that the identity of the person or persons entitled to ultimate distribution be first established. Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 253, 194 A. 2d 194 (1963).\nThis interpretation was followed by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia in Makery Estate, 46 Pa. D. & C. 2d 196 (1969). In a supplemental adjudication following the declaration of uneonstitutionality of the Iron Curtain Act, President Judge Klein stated: \u201cIn view of our ruling in the Struchmanczuk case, supra, no impediment now exists to the immediate payment of the entire shares of said [Soviet] beneficiaries directly to them without limitations or restrictions.\u201d 46 Pa. D. & C. 2d at 198. Payment was ordered to be made to James P. Lawler as attorney-in-fact.\nThe applicable statutes are the Act of April 27, 1876, P. L. 49, \u00a71, 28 P.S. \u00a7223, and the Uniform Acknowledgment Act, Act of July 24, 1941, P. L. 490, as amended, 21 P.S. \u00a7291.1 et seq. Section 4 of-the latter provides that \u201c[t]he ackowledgment of any instrument may be made without the United States before ... (2) a notary public of the country where the acknowledgment is made.\u201d 21 P.S. \u00a7291.4. Section 9 makes provision for the authentication of the notarial certificate which evidences the acknowledgment, as follows: \u201cIf the acknowledgment is made without the United States and by a notary public ... of the country where the acknowledgment is made, the certificate shall be authenticated by a certificate under the great seal of state of the country, affixed by the custodian of such seal, or by a certificate of a diplomatic, consular or commercial officer of the United States accredited to that country, certifying as to the official character of that officer.\u201d See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a71741 (Foreign Official Documents) ; Rule 44, Fed. R. Civ. Proc.\nAct of April 27, 1876, P. L. 49, \u00a71, 28 P.S. \u00a7223.\nMr. Palmer\u2019s certificate is to the effect that the attestation of Konzhukov bears his true signature and official seal, and that on the day of execution Konzhukov was Assistant Chief of the Consular Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, duly commissioned and qualified. The consular certificate ends with the statement that Konzhukov\u2019s official acts are entitled to faith and credit.\nFor a modern statement of the evidentiary role of an acknowledgment, see Clements, Trustee v. Snider, 409 F. 2d 549, 550 (C.A. 9, 1969) : \u201cThe function of the certificate of acknowledgment is to provide prima facie proof that a document \u2014 to whieh it is attached but not a part \u2014 has been executed by the person whose signature appears on the document. The certificate is \u2018evidentiary in character and is required so as to entitle the instrument to be recorded or to render it competent evidence without further proof.\u2019 Lillard v. Walsh, 172 Cal. App. 2d 674, 342 P. 2d 82, 85 (1959).\u201d See also 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Acknowledgments, \u00a7\u00a772, 92, 94.",
