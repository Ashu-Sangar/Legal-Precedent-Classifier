        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Mandkbino,\nThe appellant, The Walter Reade Organization, Inc., and the appellee, Image Ten, Inc., entered into a contract on June 10, 1968. Under the contract the appellant acquired, for a consideration, the \u201csole right and privilege\u201d to distribute, exhibit, rent, advertise and otherwise market the appellee\u2019s full-length motion picture entitled \u201cNight of the Living Dead.\u201d In February of 1972, the appellee filed a complaint in equity, demanding an injunction, an accounting and damages for appellant\u2019s alleged breach of contract. An amended complaint was later permitted. Service was made through the Secretary of the Commonwealth pursuant to section 1011(B) of the Business Corporation Law, Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, art. X, \u00a71011 (B), as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a72011 (B). The trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer alleging lack of jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\nThe central issue raised by the appellant is whether the shipping of motion picture films into Pennsylvania, either directly or indirectly, is sufficient to meet the \u201cdoing business\u201d requirement of the Pennsylvania \u201clong-arm statute.\u201d Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, art. X, \u00a71011 (B), as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a72011 (B) (repealed and replaced by Act of November 15, 1972, P. L. 1063, No. 271, \u00a75, 42 Pa. S. \u00a78309.\nAfter the appellant contracted with the appellee, it entered into agreements with numerous distributors and exhibitors in Pennsylvania for the showing of appellee\u2019s motion picture. Pursuant to those agreements, appellant has shipped the motion picture from outside of Pennsylvania into Pennsylvania where it has been shown on numerous occasions between 1968 and the time of the filing of the appellee\u2019s complaint.\nAppellant does not dispute the above facts but contends that they are insufficient to constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d because appellant has no offices in Pennsylvania; is not listed in any Pennsylvania telephone directories; has no agents in Pennsylvania; has no salesmen, clerks, or employees in Pennsylvania; enters into all contracts with Pennsylvania distributors and exhibitors in the State of New York; and does business with the Pennsylvania distributors and exhibitors by telephone and mail from the State of New York.\nAppellant first argues that in order for jurisdiction to attach under the Business Corporation Law, the presence of appellant or its agents in some substantial form is required. According to appellant, the presence of independent contractors or distributors in Pennsylvania is not sufficient to constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania. Appellant cites the following cases: Wenzel v. Morris Distrib. Co., 439 Pa. 364, 266 A.2d 662 (1970); Toffee v. Colin, 413 Pa. 154, 196 A.2d 317 (1964); Namie v. DiGirolamo, 412 Pa. 589, 195 A.2d 517 (1963). We do not agree.\nUnder Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 24 L. Ed. 565 (1878), the due process inquiry was addressed to the \u201cpresence\u201d of the defendant in the forum state. International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 90 L. Ed. 95, 66 S. Ct. 154 (1945), looked to \u201cminimum contacts\u201d in the forum state, not \u201cphysical presence\u201d in the forum state. International Shoe Co. said: \u201c[D]ue process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u2019 . . . .\u201d Id. at 316, 90 L. Ed. at 102, 66 S. Ct. at 158 (emphasis added). McGee v. Life Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220, 2 L. Ed. 2d 223, 78 S. Ct. 199 (1957), held that due process was met when an insurance company was subjected to the jurisdiction of the California courts, even though its only contact with the State was that insurance contracts were mailed to policyholders in that state. Due process only requires \u201cthat there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails [himself] of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283, 1298, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 1240 (1968).\nIn 1968, Pennsylvania amended its \u201clong-arm statute.\u201d We have not had occasion to consider the issue of \u201cdoing business\u201d since that amendment. A review of the legislative and judicial history of the \u201clong-arm statute\u201d prior to the 1968 amendment is instructive. Prior to 1963, section 1011(B) of the Business Corporation Law provided: \u201cB. Any foreign business corporation which shall have done any business in this Commonwealth, without procuring a certificate of authority to do so from the Department of State, shall be conclusively presumed to have designated the Secretary of the Commonwealth as its trae and lawful attorney authorized to accept, on its behalf, service of process in any action arising out of acts or omissions of such corporation within this Commonwealth.\u201d Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, art. X, \u00a71011 (B), as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a72011 (B) (emphasis added).\nSection 1011(C) provided the definition of \u201cdoing business\u201d as follows: \u201cC. For the purposes of determining jurisdictions of courts within this Commonwealth, the entry of any corporation into this Commonwealth for the doing of a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act in this Commonwealth for such purpose, with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts, shall constitute \u2018doing business.\u2019 \u201d Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, art. X, \u00a71011 (C), as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a72011 (C) (emphasis added).\nThe definition of \u201cdoing business,\u201d under the old section 1011(C), was first considered in Swavely v. Vandergrift, 19 Pa. D. & C. 2d 153, affirmed, 397 Pa. 281, 154 A.2d 779 (1959). In Swavely, a Michigan corporation marketed its products through distributors in Pennsylvania who were separate and independent from the corporation. In addition, the foreign corporation had manufacturer\u2019s representatives in Pennsylvania who recommended distributors to the parent company. A Pennsylvania resident brought an action in trespass against a retailer for faulty installation of an incinerator which caused a fire. The retailer, in turn, attempted to join the Pennsylvania distributor and the Michigan corporation. The Michigan corporation denied that it was \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania. We agreed, adopting the trial court\u2019s construction of section 1011 (C). The trial court\u2019s opinion stated \u201cobviously an impersonal corporate entity organized and located in another jurisdiction can be said (in the words of the statute) to have \u2018entered\u2019 the State of Pennsylvania only if its agents or property had been physically present therein on the relevant occasion.\u201d Id. at 165-66, 154 A. 2d at 786 (emphasis added). It was also noted that \u201c. . . even though Pennsylvania might not be precluded by the due process clause or commerce clauses of the Constitution of the United States from legislatively authorizing the assertion of jurisdiction over a foreign corporation in circumstances such as here presented, the fact remains that it has not done so.\u201d Id. at 168, 154 A.2d at 787.\nOur decision in Swavely, limited the concept of \u201cdoing business\u201d by concluding that the indirect distribution of products in Pennsylvania by a foreign corporation was not a sufficient basis for imposing jurisdiction. As a result of our holding that the test, in part, in-eludes the \u201centry\u201d into the Commonwealth by a foreign corporation as evidenced by the physical presence of corporate agents, many of our later decisions were controlled by a determination of whether the corporate representative present in this jurisdiction was an independent contractor or an agent or employee of the foreign corporation. Miller v. Kiamesha-Concord, Inc., 420 Pa. 604, 218 A.2d 309 (1966); Yoffee v. Golin, 413 Pa. 154, 196 A.2d 317 (1964); Namie v. DiGirolamo, 412 Pa. 589, 195 A.2d 517 (1963). Where, however, the presence of corporate agents was not disputed, we found that the essential jurisdictional inquiry is whether the contacts, ties and relations which the corporation has with Pennsylvania are sufficient to make this state an appropriate forum within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Wenzel v. Morris Distrib. Co., 439 Pa. 364, 266 A.2d 662 (1970). Prior to 1963, several cases were controlled by the statutory requirement that the cause of action must arise \u201cout of acts or omissions of such corporation within this Commonwealth,\u201d even though said corporations were doing business in this State through its agents or employees. Frisch v. Alexson Equip. Corp., 423 Pa. 247, 224 A.2d 183 (1966); Rufo v. Bastian-Blessing Co., 405 Pa. 12, 173 A.2d 123 (1961). In 1963, however, the legislature deleted this jurisdictional requirement from section 1011(B) and, thus, liberalized our \u201clong-arm statute.\u201d Act of August 13, 1963, P. L. 703, \u00a7\u00a71-2. Section 1011(C) became applicable regardless of the situs of the acts or omissions giving rise to the cause of action. The 1963 amendment, however, did not alter the \u201centry\u201d requirement of section 1011(C) and, thus, left our holding in Bwavely, unaffected.\nThe wisdom of the Bwawely test which focused on the particular contractual status of a foreign corporation\u2019s representatives in Pennsylvania was eventually questioned. In Cecere v. Ohringer Home Furniture Co., 208 Pa. Superior Ct. 138, 149, 220 A.2d 350, 357 (1966), the Superior Court noted: \u201c. . . our Commonwealth\u2019s right to assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation should not depend on whether the corporation\u2019s representative in the state was technically an agent or an independent contractor. A more fruitful and proper determination of jurisdiction might include a consideration of the parties relative access to proof and witnesses, the relative hardship to the parties, the foreseeability of consequences in a foreign state, the nature of the injury, and the nature of the corporation\u2019s business and activities. Certainly, a flexible standard should be adopted which will test the reasonableness of subjecting a foreign corporation to jurisdiction in the forum state.\u201d\nIn Myers v. Mooney Aircraft, Inc., 429 Pa. 177, 240 A.2d 505 (1967), we declined to strictly apply the Swavely test and held that the independent contractor relationship between a foreign corporation and a Pennsylvania resident, was not controlling where it appeared that \u201c[t]he distribution and sales agreements and the service contract between Mooney and Weber, who was also a member of Mooney\u2019s board of directors, the advertising methods required and provided, the advertising of Mooney\u2019s distributors as \u2018Official Mooney Service Centers,\u2019 the entry into Pennsylvania, although sporadic, of Mooney\u2019s vice-president of sales, assistant sales manager and other employees all indicate that Mooney for \u2018pecuniary benefit\u2019 did effect an entry into Pennsylvania.\u201d Id. at 188, 240 A.2d at 512.\nIn 1968, the Pennsylvania legislature amended section 1011(C), and significantly altered the definition and scope of \u201cdoing business.\u201d Act of July 20,1968, P. L. 459, No. 216, \u00a754. Since the complaint in the present case was filed subsequent to the effective date of the 1968 amendment, the amended language of section 1011(C) is controlling as to the issue of whether or not the appellant is properly subject to this State\u2019s jurisdiction. See Kilian v. Allegheny County Distribs., 409 Pa. 344, 185 A.2d 517 (1962). Section 1011(C), as amended, provides: \u201cFor the purposes of determining jurisdictions of courts within this Commonwealth, the doing by any corporation in this Commonwealth of a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act in this Commonwealth for such purpose, with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts, shall constitute \u2018doing business\u2019. For the purposes of this subsection the shippvng of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth shall be considered the doing of such an act in this Commomoealth.\u201d Act of July 20, 1968, P. L. 459, No. 216, \u00a754 (emphasis added).\nThe legislative deletion of the \u201centry\u201d requirement in section 1011(C) and its addition of the last sentence, in effect, abolished the SwmeVy test. A nonregistered foreign corporation may now be subject to suit in Pennsylvania whether or not its agents or employees were ever physically present in this State and regardless of the contractual relationship between the foreign company and its Pennsylvania representative. Under the last sentence of amended section 1011(0), \u201cthe shipping of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth\u201d is sufficient conduct to establish that a foreign corporation is \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania, and that conduct would therefore subject the foreign corporation to Pennsylvania\u2019s jurisdiction.\nWe conclude that the activities of appellant, The Walter Reade Organization, Inc., fall under the \u201cdoing business\u201d clause of section 1011(C), as amended. The appellant on numerous occasions shipped motion picture film, either directly or indirectly, into Pennsylvania. Under the last sentence of the 1968 amendment, such conduct constitutes the \u201c. . . shipping of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth. . . .\u201d Appellant contends that the motion picture film which it shipped into Pennsylvania was not \u201cmerchandise.\u201d Appellant argues that the film shipped was \u201cof little intrinsic value.\u201d It claims that the \u201cimage\u201d embodied in the film was that which was leased and shipped. Appellant, therefore, claims it was shipping a \u201ccopyrighted story\u201d on film which does not constitute \u201cmerchandise.\u201d We do not agree. There is no such restriction in the statute and the word \u201cmerchandise\u201d clearly applies to a motion picture film, just as it would to any product which is marketable because of its artistic value rather than the value of its physical components.\nAppellant also argues that it did not ship the merchandise for sale but only for temporary use. Section 1011(C), however, does not require that the shipment be of merchandise that is to be sold. Under section 1011(0), a \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d to the appellant is a sufficient objective. That objective is clearly present in this case.\nWe are similarly unmoved by appellant\u2019s argument that the 1968 amendment was only intended to apply to actions in trespass and not to actions on a contract. The statutory language does not indicate, either expressly or impliedly, such a distinction. The purpose of our \u201clong-arm statute\u201d is to provide an appropriate forum for citizens to seek redress for harm caused by foreign corporations which have availed themselves of the privilege of \u201cdoing business\u201d in this Commonwealth. Under the statute, the type of harm inflicted is immaterial to the jurisdictional issue. The statute applies to all forms and causes of action, except those enumerated in section 1011(D), which is not applicable to this case. The trial court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s preliminary objections.\nOrder affirmed. Each, party to pay own costs.\nMr. Justice Bobebts took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Pomeroy concurs in the result.",
