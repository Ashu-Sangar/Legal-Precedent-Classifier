        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Robebts,\nOn June 5, 1968, decedent Jules Harrison executed a will which made certain specific bequests and directed his executors \u2014 the Bryn Mawr Trust Company, his daughter, and his attorney \u2014 to hold the residue of his estate in trust for his daughter. Approximately two years later, on June 13, 1971, Mr. Harrison and appellant, Betty Rudley Harrison were married. It was the second marriage for each.\nPrior to this marriage on May 7, 1971, the couple executed an antenuptial agreement in which Jules Harrison fully and fairly disclosed the extent of his property. The parties, each represented by counsel, agreed that neither would have any claim against the estate of the other except to the extent either might voluntarily provide. These reciprocal waivers were \u201cin consideration of their contemplated marriage and of the mutual covenants and releases herein contained . . . ,\u201d\nThe covenants relevant to the present controversy are found in paragraph 1, and require Mr. Harrison to create by will a trust funded with, at least $150,000. The entire net income from this trust was to be distributed to Mrs. Harrison quarterly, or in more frequent installments until her death or remarriage. Additionally, the trustees to be selected by Mr. Harrison would be authorized, in their discretion, to use whatever principal might be required to provide for Mrs. Harrison\u2019s medical and hospital care. If the net income in any year should be less than $12,000, the trustees were to be empowered to pay appellant, on her request, the difference between the income and $12,000. According to the agreement, at his widow\u2019s death or remarriage the corpus of the trust was to pass under Mr. Harrison\u2019s will.\nMr. Harrison lived for more than a year after the marriage but never executed the new will. Thus, at his death (September 6, 1972), decedent had failed to comply with the requirement of the antenuptial agreement. Following probate of the 1968 will, the widow petitioned for the family exemption.\nThe court refused to grant her petition because it concluded that despite decedent\u2019s failure to execute a new will, consideration for the agreement could now be supplied by acceptance of the executors\u2019 offer to set up a trust in the minimum dollar amounts recited in the agreement. The court reasoned that by failing to execute a will creating the trust, decedent had breached only a \u201ctechnical requirement\u201d of the antenuptial agreement. This breach, the court held, could be \u201creadily corrected by creating the trust now out of the corpus of his estate . . . .\u201d Harrison Estate, 96 Montgomery County L. Rptr. 296, 299 (Pa. O.C. 1973).\nWe cannot agree. The promise to execute a new will was a material undertaking by decedent basic to the antenuptial agreement. Without performance of this promise, wMch only decedent himself could carry out, the antenuptial agreement may not serve to bar Mrs. Harrison from her family exemption. We reverse.\nAn antenuptial agreement is more than an ordinary contract. As we noted in Hillegass Estate, 431 Pa. 144, 149, 244 A.2d 672, 675 (1968): \u201cParties to an Ante-nuptial Agreement providing for the disposition of their respective estates do not deal at arm\u2019s length, but stand in a relation of mutual confidence and trust that calls for the highest degree of good faith . . . .\u201d Antenuptial agreements are instruments designed and executed for a particular purpose \u2014 to alter or extinguish a spouse\u2019s statutory rights of inheritance. It is true that by a valid antenuptial agreement either party may waive his or her right to the family exemption. Nevertheless, our courts will carefully examine the agreement to make certain that it reflects \u201cthe Mghest degree of good faith.\u201d See Hillegass Estate, supra; Gelb Estate, 425 Pa. 117, 228 A.2d 367 (1967). Before the release of such significant rights may be enforced, the bargain on wMch the release is based must be performed. Here, in the absence of the bargained-for performance \u2014 execution of a new will \u2014 the surviving spouse retains her right to the family exemption.\nThe law of Pennsylvania has always conferred upon a surviving spouse specific and substantial rights in the estate of a decedent; the unchallenged policy of the Commonwealth has been to scrupulously protect these rights. In order for an inter vivos agreement, whether executed before or during marriage, to terminate these statutorily-conferred rights, our courts have required that the agreement be executed in good faith after full disclosure of the parties\u2019 financial condition or that the agreement provide a reasonable amount for the survivor. Ilillegass Estate, supra at 150, 244 A.2d at 675; Geld Estate, supra at 122-23, 228 A.2d at 370; see Kaufmann Estate, 404 Pa. 131, 171 A.2d 48 (1961).\nIndeed, this Court held in Levine Estate, 383 Pa. 354, 118 A.2d 741 (1955), that when a party to an ante-nuptial agreement fails to perform his promises, consideration for the agreement fails, and the survivor may claim her statutory rights. The agreement there provided that Mrs. Levine would waive all rights in her husband\u2019s estate in return for his promise to leave her, by will, one-half of a checking account maintained in his name. Following her husband\u2019s death, the widow elected to take against the will even though it left her one-half of the account. This Court held that because half of the funds in the account were derived from property owned individually by Mrs. Levine, there was a failure of consideration.\n\u201cSince Flora Levine did not receive the consideration contemplated and bargained for in the agreement of December, 1949, she is released from any assumed obligation owing from her in that same agreement; and she is thus not barred from electing to take against her husband\u2019s will.\u201d 383 Pa. at 359, 118 A.2d at 743.\nSimilarly, in Mornes Estate, 79 Pa. D. & C. 356 (O.C. Lawrence County 1951), the orphans\u2019 court held that the widow\u2019s attempt to take against the will was not barred by an antenuptial agreement. In tbe agreement, Mr. Mornes promised to make a will leaving to his wife a life estate in that portion of bis estate in excess of $6,000. Mrs. Mornes promised to make no claim against the first $6,000 of her husband\u2019s estate. During marriage tbe husband conveyed several thousand dollars worth of real estate to bis bank to be held in trust for certain friends and relatives. Not until after his death was it discovered that Mr. Mornes bad failed even to mention bis widow in bis will. Tbe orphans\u2019 court held that because decedent bad not made tbe agreed-upon testamentary provision for bis wife, tbe widow should be permitted to take against tbe will.\nHere, Mrs. Harrison promised by antenuptial agreement to relinquish her statutory rights in exchange for decedent\u2019s new will. When parties attempt by antenuptial agreement to surrender such significant rights our cases as well as compelling public policy considerations require full and exact performance of each provision of the agreement. Here, there has been, no new will and, hence, no performance.\nThe executors assert that they can provide for appellant exactly what Mr. Harrison would have if the promised new will had been executed. We cannot accept this argument. Although the antenuptial agreement speaks in amounts which appear to be reasonable these amounts are only the minimum which decedent might have provided had he executed a new will. We need not, as appellant urges, conclude that decedent\u2019s failure to make a new will evidences an intent that his wife take against his earlier will. However, Mrs. Harrison did bargain for her husband to provide for her in his new will at least the amount specified in the ante-nuptial agreement. She reasonably could have believed that if the marriage proved to be a happy one, he might have decided to give her more than the required minimums. Indeed, the agreement itself recognizes the possibility of gifts beyond the stated minimums by stipulating that each spouse \u201cmay voluntarily choose to make other provisions.\u201d That the executors cannot now know wkat decedent would tave provided for Ms wife had be written tbe contemplated new will is obvious.\nIt must be concluded tbat decedent\u2019s promise to make a will is material consideration for appellant\u2019s promise to forego ber statutory rights. Here, as in Levine and Mornes, tbe widow may not be denied ber statutory rights by an antenuptial agreement tbat has not been performed. We bold tbat in order for an ante-nuptial agreement to preclude tbe surviving spouse\u2019s statutory rights, promises made in tbe agreement must be fully and fairly performed. Here decedent failed to execute tbe will called for by tbe antenuptial agreement. TMs commitment was one tbat only Mr. Harrison could perform. Tbe executors\u2019 offer of a trust is not tbe new will bargained for. In these circumstances, nothing less than actual performance by tbe husband can compel tbe wife\u2019s relinquishment of ber family exemption.\nTbe decree of tbe orphans\u2019 court is reversed. Tbe case is remanded with directions tbat tbe court enter an appropriate decree granting tbe petition for tbe family exemption. Each party pay own costs.\nParagraphs 4 and 5 of the agreement provide respectively that neither party shall have any claim against the estate of the other and that each party shall independently own, control, and dispose of his or her own property. Not insignificantly, each of these paragraphs begins: \u201cProvided that the aforementioned testamentary trust is created and maintained . . . .\u201d\nIn the agreement Mr. Harrison promised to make other testamentary gifts to his future wife. None of these gifts are relevant to the instant controversy.\nSee 20 Pa. S. \u00a7\u00a73121-26 (Special Pamphlet 1972). The family exemption permits a decedent\u2019s spouse (or in certain cases children or parents) to retain or claim as exempt from disposition by the decedent, property to the value of $1,500. Id. \u00a7 3121.\nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp. 1973).\nIn other jurisdictions cases involving common-law dower have held that a surviving spouse need not accept substitute performance of an antenuptial agreement.\nIn Sullings v. Sullings, 91 Mass. (9 Allen) 234 (1864), a deceased husband\u2019s executors sought to compel his widow to waive dower hy accepting their performance of an antenuptial agreement. However, the agreement required decedent to make certain inter vivos transfers. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts observed, \u201cThe question is, will equity compel her to adhere to a contract which has been broken by the other contracting party?\u201d Id. at 238. The court held that because the husband had not performed the agreement, it could not bar the widow\u2019s right to dower.\nIn a similar situation, the Supreme Court of Tennessee commented : \u201cIt avails the defendants nothing, to say that the complainant might, in equity, have enforced a specific execution of the agreement, against the personal representative, as well as against the legatee under the will. This is doubtless so; but it is clear that, as the husband failed in his lifetime, to effectually execute the agreement on his part, the complainant was left to an election after his death, either to abide by and enforce a specific execution thereof, or to abandon it and claim her legal rights, as widow, in the estate of her husband, as if no such agreement had ever been made.\u201d Woodward v. Woodward, 37 Tenn. 49, 55-56 (1857). See also Sheldon v. Bliss, 8 N.Y. 31 (1853), aff\u2019g 7 Barb. 152 (Sup. Ct. Oneida County 1849).\nSee, e.g., Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 315, \u00a7\u00a71, 15 (statutory share in lieu of common-law dower) ; Act of April 14, 1851, P.L. 612, \u00a7 5 (family exemption).\nLevine Estate, 383 Pa. 354, 118 A.2d 741 (1955), also refutes appellees\u2019 contention that marriage itself, even when the other provisions of the antenuptial agreement remain unperformed, is sufficient consideration to prevent rescission of the agreement.\nUndoubtedly, the impending marriage is the motivation for preparation of an antenuptial agreement. But we cannot accept appellees\u2019 theory that once the marriage is consummated, nonperformance of other terms may not render the agreement unenforceable. Cf. Hillegass Estate, 431 Pa. 144, 244 A.2d 672 (1968) ; Gelb Estate, 425 Pa. 117, 228 A.2d 367 (1967) ; Emery Estate, 362 Pa. 142, 66 A.2d 262 (1949). The execution of the agreement itself demonstrates that consideration in addition to marriage is what the parties bargained for. This is not a contract to marry. Here the parties executed the antenuptial agreement \u201cin consideration of their contemplated marriage and of the mutual covenants and releases herein contained . . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).\nWere we to accept appellees\u2019 contention, once two persons married, their antenuptial agreement would be enforceable even if neither performed any of the terms of the agreement.\nFriese\u2019s Estate, 336 Pa. 241, 9 A.2d 401 (1939), relied upon by appellees, is not to the contrary. There the antenuptial agreement stated: \u201c \u2018It is mutually understood and agreed between the said parties hereto that said Mary W. Portman, his proposed second wife, shall not claim any part of the estate of the said Charles A. O. Friese except the amount given to her by his Last Will and Testament ....\u201d\u2019 336 Pa. at 242, 9 A.2d at 401 (emphasis supplied). The agreement also provided that Mr. Friese would pay to Mary Portman $10,000 in money and securities. This transfer was made the day the agreement was signed.\nThis Court was not there presented with the question whether the widow could take against the will. The issue was whether Mrs. Friese could recover in damages the amount of a bequest to her in her husband\u2019s unsigned will. The Court held that she could not because the invalid will did not establish \u201cthe amount\u201d to which Mrs. Friese was entitled.\nThis Court, in dictum, did say: \u201cWe are likewise impressed with the unfortunate result the law compels us to reach. But we cannot depart from the conclusions in Friese\u2019s Est., 317 Pa. 86, 91, that \u2018if it [the antenuptial agreement] is valid,\u2019 it bars the widow from \u2018any interest\u2019 in her husband\u2019s estate.\u201d 336 Pa. at 248, 9 A.2d at 404 (brackets in original).\nHowever, the earlier Friese\u2019s Estate, 317 Pa. 86, 176 A. 225 (1934), held only that the widow need not be appointed administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate. The sole mention of any antenuptial agreement was the abstract observation that \u201c[n]ot only does her antenuptial agreement, if it is valid, bar any interest, but if it is invalid, she has a direct claim against the estate because of its invalidity.\u201d 317 Pa. at 91, 176 A. at 227. Because the widow had a claim against the estate, whether the agreement was held valid or invalid, the Court affirmed the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s refusal to appoint her administrator.\nThe relevant clause reads: \u201cEach party desires to enter into this marriage upon the basis that neither shall have any legal claim on the estate of the other, or to the detriment of the children of the other, except as provided in this Agreement and except to the extent that the other spouse may voluntarily choose to make other provisions.\u201d\nWe are aware that the courts of other states have held the promise to make a new will not a material term of an antenuptial agreement. See Estate of Johnson, 202 Kan. 684, 452 P.2d 286 (1969) ; Cantor v. Cantor, 174 N.E.2d 304 (Ohio Prob. 1959). In each of these cases the court concluded that the promised execution of the will was not consideration but simply the means which the parties chose to effectuate the terms of the agreement.\nHere, we believe that Mr. Harrison\u2019s promise to make a new will was material consideration for appellant\u2019s waiver of her statutory rights. She bargained for a will executed by her future husband, not the executors\u2019 present attempt at substitute performance. As we have stated, this Court will not permit the legislatively-granted rights of the surviving spouse to be defeated unless the decedent has in good faith fully performed the terms of the ante-nuptial agreement.",
