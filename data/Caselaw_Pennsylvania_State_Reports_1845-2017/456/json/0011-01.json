The defendants filed preliminary objections to the complaint challenging the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the Civil Trial Division to entertain the action and asserting \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d was in the Orphans\u2019 Court Division. When these preliminary objections were overruled, the defendants filed this appeal under the provisions of the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, 12 P.S. \u00a7 672, as amended by the Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, Art. II, \u00a7 202, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202 (Supplement).\nThe issue presented is not one of jurisdiction. See Posner v. Sheridan, 451 Pa. 51, 299 A. 2d 309 (1973). Hence, the appeal is not cognizable under the Act of 1925, supra. The decree entered in the trial court is interlocutory in nature from which the instant appeal does not lie.\nAppeal quashed. Each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones dissents.\nUnder \u00a7 502(c) of the Act of 1970, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.502(c), this Court may grant a petition for allowance of appeal from an interlocutory order, but no such petition was filed in this case.",
