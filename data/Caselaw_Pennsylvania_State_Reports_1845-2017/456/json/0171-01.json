        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Pomeroy,\nThis appeal comes to us from an order of the trial court sustaining appellee\u2019s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and dismissing with prejudice appellant\u2019s amended complaint in trespass. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam, without opinion, and we granted allocatur to consider the novel and far-reaching arguments advanced by appellant in support of his alleged cause of action.\nThe complaint avers that appellant, George B. Geary, was continuously employed by appellee, United States Steel Corporation (hereinafter \u201ccompany\u201d), from 1953 until July 13, 1967, when he was dismissed from his position. Geary\u2019s duties involved the sale of tubular products to the oil and gas industry. His employment was at will. The dismissal is said to have stemmed from a disagreement concerning one of the company\u2019s new products, a tubular casing designed for use under high pressure. Geary alleges that he believed the product had not been adequately tested and constituted a serious danger to anyone who used it; that he voiced his misgivings to his superiors and was ordered to \u201cfollow directions\u201d, which he agreed to do; that he nevertheless continued to express his reservations, taking his case to a vice-president in charge of sale of the product; that as a result of his efforts the product was reevaluated and withdrawn from the market; that lie at all times performed Ms duties to the best of Ms ability and always acted with the best interests of the company and the general public in mind; and that because of these events he was summarily discharged without notice. Geary asserts that the company\u2019s conduct in so acting was \u201cwrongful, malicious and abusive,\u201d resulting in injury to Ms reputation in the industry, mental anguish, and direct financial harm, for which he seeks both punitive and compensatory damages.\nThe case having been dismissed on a demurrer, all properly pleaded facts are taken as admitted for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the complaint. Balsbaugh v. Rowland, 447 Pa. 423, 290 A.2d 85 (1972); Engel v. Parkway Co., 439 Pa. 559, 266 A.2d 685 (1970); Fawcett v. Monongahela R. Co., 391 Pa. 134, 137 A.2d 768 (1958).\nAppellant candidly admits that he is beckoning us into uncharted territory. No court in this Commonwealth has ever recogmzed a non-statutory cause of action for an employer\u2019s termination of an at-will employment relationship. What scant authority there is on the subject points the other way. In Henry v. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Co., 139 Pa. 289, 21 A. 157 (1891), a railroad employee was suspended because of alleged irregularities in his department. Although cleared in a subsequent investigation, he was refused reinstatement. He sued his employer, alleging that he was discharged \u201cmaliciously and without probable cause\u201d. 139 Pa. at 290. Sustaining the entry of a compulsory non-suit, Chief Justice Paxson said for the Court: \u201cThe right [to discharge the plaintiff] was not, and could not well be disputed, without a greater shock to the relations of employer and employee than we are disposed to sanction. A railroad corporation, or an individual, may discharge an employee with or without cause, at pleasure, unless restrained by some contract; so that I do not see that the questions of malice and want of probable cause have anything to do with the case.\u201d 139 Pa. at 297. The principle of the Henry case was recently recognized in a federal court as the law of this Commonwealth. McKinney v. Armco Steel Corp., 270 F. Supp. 360 (W.D. Pa. 1967).\nThe Pennsylvania law is in accordance with the weight of authority elsewhere. Absent a statutory or contractual provision to the contrary, the law has taken for granted the power of either party to terminate an employment relationship for any or no reason. This power of termination is explicitly recognized in the Restatement of Torts, \u00a7762, Privilege of Selecting Persons for Business Relations: \u201cOne who causes intended or unintended harm to another merely by refusing to enter into a business relation with the other or to contimie a business relation terminable at Ms will is not liable for that harm if the refusal is not (a) a breach of the actor\u2019s duty to the other arising from the nature of the actor\u2019s business or from a legislative enactment, or (b) a means of accomplishing an illegal effect on competition, or (c) part of a concerted refusal by a combination of persons of which he is a member.\u201d\nWe recogMze that economic conditions have changed radically since the time of Henry v. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Co., supra. The huge corporate enterprises which have emerged in this century wield an awesome power over their employees. It has been aptly remarked that \u201c [w] e have become a nation of employees. We are dependent upon others for our means of livelihood, and most of our people have become completely dependent upon wages. If they lose their jobs they lose every resource, except for the relief supplied by the various forms of social security. Such dependence of the mass of the people upon others for all of their income is something new in the world. For our generation, the substance of life is in another man\u2019s hands.\u201d\nAgainst the background of these changes, the broad question to which appellant invites our attention is whether the time has come to impose judicial restrictions on an employer\u2019s power of discharge.\nAppellant points first to the long-established tort of unjustified interference with prospective advantage. See Restatement of Torts, \u00a7766 (1939) and Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7766A and 766B (Tentative Draft No. 14, 1969). He argues that the expectancies which the law protects from interference by outsiders should also be protected against the parties to the relationship. The courts of this Commonwealth have held that both employers and employees are entitled to freedom from meddling by third parties, even where the employment is at will. Dorrington v. Manning, 135 Pa. Superior Ct. 194, 4 A.2d 886 (1939) ; Padden v. Local 90 United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen Plumbers, 168 Pa. Superior Ct. 611, 82 A.2d 327 (1951). But we do not think that the cases imposing liability on strangers to the protected relationship are apposite to the instant situation. A predicate to liability in such a case is \u201cthe absence of privilege or justification on the part of the actor. . . .\u201d Glenn v. Point Park College, 441 Pa. 474, 480, 272 A.2d 895, 898 (1971). Here, as in the Glenn case, the complaint does not negate the existence of a privilege, hitherto regarded as virtually absolute, insulating the company\u2019s termination of Geary\u2019s employment. Instead, we are asked to impose limitations on this privilege for reasons of policy. The cases involving interference by third parties, turning as they do on the presence or absence of privileges of a different sort, do not seem particularly helpful in evaluating this proposal.\nAs an operational principle for restricting an employer\u2019s power of discharge, appellant suggests the rationale of cases imposing liability on the actor on the basis of his motive. While this theory is \u201con the frontier of the law of tort,\u201d it received recognition in Pennsylvania at an early date. See, e.g., Sommer v. Wilt, 4 S. & R. 19 (1818) (abuse of process); Wheatley v. Baugh, 25 Pa. 528 (1855) (dicta; deprivation of water rights). The conduct recognized as tortious in cases of this sort necessarily involves an element of specific intent to cause harm or accomplish an ulterior purpose. Thus in American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, 256 U.S. 350, 65 L.Ed. 983 (1921), a case relied on by appellant, independent banks were held to have a cause of action against a federal reserve bank which accumulated checks drawn against the plaintiffs for the purpose of forcing them to join the federal reserve system. The right of a holder to present checks for payment was not questioned, but the exercise of that right in a particular manner and for a particular end was held to be impermissible. By the same token, the novel theory of recovery which appellant advances must surely involve specific intent on the part of the company to harm Geary or achieve some other proscribed goal. If a general intent, in the sense that an employer knew or should have known the probable consequences of his act, were all that a disgruntled employee need show in order to make out a cause of action, the privilege of discharge would be effectively eradicated, for some degree of harm is normally foreseeable whenever an employee is dismissed. Appellant purports not to seek a result so\n-1 \u2014 i drastic; he merely argues that a court should recognize the abuse of the privilege in a particular instance, and grant damages accordingly. To this extent, appellant\u2019s proffered analogy to cases involving the malicious abuse of recognized rights seems apt enough. The difficulty is that the averments of Geary\u2019s complaint do not add up to specific intent.\nHere again our decision in the case of Glenn v. Point Park College, supra, offers useful guidance. We there dealt with an allegation of interference by a third party in a prospective business relationship: an unconsummated real estate brokerage arrangement. Following the tentative draft of \u00a7766A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, we held that where the relationship allegedly interfered with is prospective rather than existing, specific intent on the part of the defendant to cause harm to the plaintiff must be alleged to make out a cause of action. Examining Glenn\u2019s complaint, we found it deficient in this respect. The complaint averred that, relying on information supplied by the plaintiff brokers, defendant had negotiated a direct purchase of real estate, representing to the vendor that no brokers were involved in the transaction. It was alleged that in this manner defendant had intentionally and maliciously prevented plaintiffs from entering into a brokerage arrangement with the vendor, thereby depriving them of their commissions. In ruling that the complaint fell short of charging an intent to cause harm to plaintiffs, we made it clear that a bare recitation that defendant had acted \u201cintentionally, wrongfully, maliciously, fraudulently, deceitfully and without justification\u201d did not satisfy the specific intent requirement.\nWe think that the deficiency of the complaint in the instant case is even clearer than it was in the Glenn case. The facts alleged show only that there was a dispute over the merits of the new product; that Geary vigorously expressed his own point of view in the matter, by-passing his immediate superiors and taking his case to a company vice-president, and that he was ultimately discharged. There is nothing here from which we could infer that the company fired Geary for the specific purpose of causing him harm, or coercing him to break any law or otherwise to compromise himself. According to his own averments, Geary had already won his own battle within the company. The most natural inference from the chain of events recited in the complaint is that Geary had made a nuisance of himself, and the company discharged him to preserve administrative order in its own house. This hardly amounts to an \u201culterior purpose\u201d, much less to \u201cdisinterested malevolence\u201d, in the sense in which those terms are used by Mr. Justice Holmes in the American Bank & Trust Co. case, supra. Under his own theory, therefore, appellant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nAppellant\u2019s final argument is an appeal to considerations of public policy. Geary asserts in Ms complaint that he was acting in the best interests of the general public as well as of his employer in opposing the marketing of a product which he believed to be defective. Certainly, the potential for abuse of an employer\u2019s power of dismissal is particularly serious where an employee must exercise independent, expert judgment in matters of product safety, but Geary does not hold himself out as this sort of employee. So far as the complaint shows, he was involved only in the sale of company products. There is no suggestion that he possessed any expert qualifications, or that his duties extended to making judgments in matters of product safety. In essence, Geary argues that his conduct should be protected because his intentions were good. No doubt most employees who are dismissed from their posts can make the same claim. We doubt that establishing a right to litigate every such case as it arises would operate either in the best interest of the parties or of the public.\nGiven the rapidity of change in corporate personnel in the areas of employment not covered by labor agreements, suits like the one at bar could well be expected to place a heavy burden on our judicial system in terms of both an increased case load and the thorny problems of proof which would inevitably be presented. We agree with appellant, however, that these considerations do not in themselves justify denying a legal forum to a plaintiff with a justiciable claim. See Niederman v. Brodsky, 436 Pa. 401, 261 A.2d 84 (1970). Of greater concern is the possible impact of such suits on the legitimate interests of employers in hiring and retaining the best personnel available. The ever-present threat of suit might well inhibit the making of critical judgments by employers concerning employee qualifications.\nThe problem extends beyond the question of individual competence, for even an unusually gifted person may be of no use to his employer if he cannot work effectively with fellow employees. Here, for example, Geary\u2019s complaint shows that he by-passed his immediate superiors and pressed his views on higher officers, utilizing his close contacts with a company vice president. The praiseworthiness of Geary\u2019s motives does not detract from the company\u2019s legitimate interest in preserving its normal operational procedures from disruption. In sum, while we agree that employees should be encouraged to express their educated views on the quality of their employer\u2019s products, we are not persuaded that creating a new non-statutory cause of action of the sort proposed by appellant is the best way to achieve this result. On balance, whatever public policy imperatives can be discerned here seem to militate against such a course.\nIt may be granted that there are areas of an employee\u2019s life in which his employer has no legitimate interest. An intrusion into one of these areas by virtue of the employer\u2019s power of discharge might plausibly give rise to a cause of action, particularly where some recognized facet of public policy is threatened. The notion that substantive due process elevates an employer\u2019s privilege of hiring and discharging his employees to an absolute constitutional right has long since been discredited. But this case does not require us to define in comprehensive fashion the perimeters of this privilege, and we decline to do so. We hold only that where the complaint itself discloses a plausible and legitimate reason for terminating an at-will employment relationship and no clear mandate of public policy is violated thereby, an employee at will has no right of action against his employer for wrongful discharge.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Nix dissents.\nMr. Justice Manderinq dissents.\nNo opinion in support of the order dismissing the complaint was filed by the trial judge in accordance with Superior Court Rule 46. In a post-argument statement submitted under Supreme Court Rule 34, counsel for appellant has admitted the possibility that the required notice of appeal was never served on the trial judge.\nFollowing his discharge Geary filed a claim, for unemployment benefits with the Bureau of Employment Security. The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review found that Geary was not guilty of willful misconduct in the company\u2019s employ, and allowed the claim. A copy of the Board\u2019s decision and order is attached to and made a part of the complaint herein.\nThe company in its brief denies that the new product was withdrawn from the market as a result of Geary\u2019s efforts, and has offered to prove that it has been marketed successfully without incident for several years. This factual contention is irrelevant at the preliminary objection stage.\nSee, e.g., Pearson v. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 332 F.2d 439 (7th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 914; Hablas v. Armour & Co., 270 F.2d 71 (8th Cir. 1959) ; Odell v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 201 F.2d 123 (10th Cir. 1953), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 941; May v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 189 Kan. 419, 370 P.2d 390 (1962) ; Jorgensen v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 25 N.J. 541, 138 A.2d 24, 72 A.L.R. 2d 1415 (1958) ; Comerford v. International Harvester Co., 235 Ala. 376, 178 So. 894 (1938). See generally 53 Am. Jur. 2d Master & Servant \u00a7\u00a734, 43 (1970).\nComment (e) to this section states that \u201cthe privilege stated in this Section exists regardless of the actor\u2019s motive for refusing to enter business relations with the other and even though the sole motive is a desire to harm the other\u201d; comment (d) makes it clear that \u201cthe rule applies to refusals between . . . employer and employee. . . .\u201d At the risk of belaboring the obvious, we note that none of .the enumerated exceptions applies to appellant. The \u201cduty to the other arising from the nature of the actor\u2019s business\u201d in clause (a) refers to the special rules governing public utilities. See Restatement of Torts, \u00a7763. None of the American Law Institute\u2019s tentative drafts of the Restatement (Second) of Torts deals directly with \u00a7762, and so far as appears, no change is presently contemplated in this section.\nF. Tannenbaum, A Philosophy of Labor 9 (1951), quoted in Blades, Employment at Will vs. Individual Freedom: On Limiting the Abusive Exercise of Employer Power, 67 Colum. L. Rev. 1404 (1967) (emphasis in original deleted). See also Comment, Towards a Property Right In Employment, 22 Buffalo L. Rev. 1081 (1073).\n1 Harper & James, The Law of Torts, \u00a74.10 (1956).\nBy the same token, some degree of harm, however minimal, is generally foreseeable whenever any employee voluntarily leaves his job. The theory of malicious abuse of recognized rights is, of course, available to all litigants, including employers as well as employees. Were we to recognize a right of action in this area which did not include the strict requirement of specific intent, it might have the ironic result of giving employers a potent weapon with which to harass key employees who wish to change jobs.\nAppellant suggests in Ms brief that continued sale of the defective product might have entailed both criminal and civil liability. This is mere speculation, particularly since the product was allegedly withdrawn from the market.\n\u201c. . . As a result of re-evaluation at plaintiff\u2019s insistence, the program was withdrawn.\u201d Complaint, Par. 8.\nIn the derm case, we granted the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint. Here, however, we think it clear from the face of Geary\u2019s already once-amended complaint that any further attempt to amend would be unavailing. \u201cAmendment of a complaint should be freely allowed, and a claim ought not to be jeopardized by minor defects in pleading or technical errors of counsel. But liberality of pleading does not encompass a duty in the courts to allow successive amendments when the initial pleading indicates that the claim asserted cannot be established.\u201d Behrend v. Yellow Cab Co., 441 Pa. 105, 110, 271 A.2d 241 (1970).\nSee Blades, supra, note 6, at 1408 note 22.\nProfessor Blades has analyzed some of the difficulties in this area: \u201cOrdinarily, where both sides present equally credible versions of the facts, the plaintiff will have failed to carry his burden. However, there is the danger that the average jury will identify with, and therefore believe, the employee. This possibility could give rise to vexatious lawsuits by disgruntled employees fabricating plausible tales of employer coercion. If the potential for vexatious suits by discharged employees is too great, employers will be inhibited in exercising their best judgment as to which employees should or should not be retained. . . . Compromise of the employer\u2019s power to make such judgments about professional, managerial or other high-ranking employees ... is especially undesirable. The higher ranking the employee, the more important to the success of the business is his effective performance. Compounding the potential for undue inhibition of the employer\u2019s judgment at the higher echelons of employment is the greater difficulty of articulating the basis for a discharge at that level. Compared to the wage earner, whose routine duties can generally be measured against a mechanical standard, the value of a salaried employee is more likely to be measured in such intangible qualities as imagination, initiative, drive, and personality. The employer\u2019s evaluation of the higher ranking employee is usually a highly personalized, intuitive judgment, and, as such, is more difficult to translate into concrete reasons which someone else \u2014 a juryman \u2014 can readily understand and appreciate. Indeed, even if it is conceded that the protection from unwarranted discharges afforded rank and file employees by labor agreements is appropriate, it might still be argued that no intrusion of any kind upon the employer\u2019s subjective evaluation of higher echelon employees should be tolerated.\u201d Blades, op. cit. supra, note 6, at 1428-9. Professor Blades nevertheless favors judicial intervention to protect employees at all levels from abusive discharge, partly in the hope that \u201c. . . a lack of confidence in courts and juries could lead, albeit in a roundabout way, to the creation of private means of settlement that might well be the most effective and expeditious way of handling such cases.\u201d Id. at 1431.\n\u201c. . . [T]he claimant was critical of the program and objected to his superiors. . . . [He] was ordered to follow directions and agreed that he would do so even though he was still opposed to the program. . . . [He] took the problem to a vice president of the company with whom he was in close contact and as a result of re-evaluation the program was withdrawn. . . .\u201d Findings of Fact of Unemployment Compensation Board, attached to and made a part of the amended complaint as Exhibit \u201cA\u201d. In pursuing this course, Geary exceeded any duty imposed on him under the rule of the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7381: Duty to Give Information, cited in the dissenting opinion. We do not conceive that \u00a7381 bears any relation to the case before us.\nWe see no basis for inferring that Geary\u2019s discharge was a spiteful retaliatory gesture designed to punish him for noticing and calling attention to the asserted defect in the company\u2019s product This is particularly true in view of the fact that the product was withdrawn from the market. It does not follow that, because Geary\u2019s motives were good, the company\u2019s motives in discharging him were bad. In scrutinizing the complaint we are not required to put aside our common sense or attribute to parties a perversity which the facts alleged do not warrant.\nCompare, Petermann v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 174 Cal. App. 2d 184, 344 P.2d 25 (1959), a case relied on by appellant, in which a non-statutory cause of action in an employee dismissed for his refusal to commit perjury was recognized on public policy grounds. More recently, the Supreme Court of Indiana reached a similar result in the ease of an employee who was discharged because she filed a claim against her employer under Indiana\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation statute. Frampton v. Central Indiana Gas Co., 297 N.E.2d 425 (Ind. 1973). The California courts have limited the application of Petermann ,to cases where there has been an explicit declaration of public policy by the legislature. See, Glenn v. Clearman\u2019s Golden Code Inn, Inc., 192 Cal. App. 2d 793, 13 Cal. Rptr. 769 (1961) and Montalvo v. Zamora, 7 Cal. App. 3rd 69, 86 Cal. Rptr. 401 (1970), with which Mallard v. Boring, 182 Cal. App. 2d 390, 6 Cal. Rptr. 171 (1960) and Patterson v. Philco Corp., 252 Cal. App. 2d 63, 60 Cal. Rptr. 110 (1967) should be compared. The Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Frampton was equally narrow: \u201cWe agree with the Court of Appeals that, under ordinary circumstances, an employee at wiU may be discharged without cause. However, when an employee is discharged solely for exercising a statutorily conferred right an exception to the general rule must be recognized.\u201d 297 N.E.2d at 428. It is not necessary to reject the rationale of these decisions in order to defend the result we reach here. In each case where a cause of action was found, the mandates of public policy were clear and compelling; that cannot be said of the instant case.\nCompare, Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525, 93 L.Ed. 212 (1949) with Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161, 52 L.Ed. 436 (1908) and Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, 59 L.Ed. 441 (1915).",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts:\nI cannot accept the view implicit in the majority\u2019s decision that today\u2019s jurisprudence is so lacking in awareness and vitality that our judicial process is incapable of affording relief to a responsible employee for an arbitrary and retaliatory discharge from employment. I dissent.\nFor fourteen years appellant George B. Geary served the United States Steel Corporation as a salesman. Abruptly, on July 13, 1987, he was summarily discharged without cause or notice. The majority now holds \u201cthat where the complaint itself discloses a plausible and legitimate reason for terminating an at-will employment relationship and no clear mandate of public policy is violated thereby, an employee at will has no right of action against his employer for wrongful discharge.\u201d I am unable to agree that this case presents only \u201ca plausible and legitimate reason for terminating\u201d Geary\u2019s employment or that \u201cno clear mandate of public policy\u201d has been violated.\nIn the particular circumstances of this case, appellant\u2019s discharge demonstrates the arbitrary dismissal power exercisable by an employer. The managers of this publicly-held corporation determined that George B. Geary should be dismissed because he called to the attention of his superiors that the steel pipe manufactured by his employer and which Geary was required to sell was a defective and dangerous product. His suggestion that the unsafe steel pipe be withdrawn from the market to protect both the public from danger and his employer from liability was in complete harmony with his employer\u2019s best interest. Nevertheless, Geary was discharged.\nAs a salesman, Geary was required to know intimately the products he was selling. He represented United States Steel and it was expected that he would be alert to protect his employer\u2019s reputation. Likewise, it was natural that he would seek to shield himself and his employer from the consequences of a dangerous product. When he correctly recognized that the defective steel pipe had strong potential for causing injury and damage, he immediately notified his superiors. His reward for loyalty was dismissal. Of course, had Geary not informed his superiors of the defective product, he may well have been discharged for his failure to do so.\nGeary\u2019s assessment of the danger of the steel pipe was correct, since after his notification, the corporation removed the steel pipe from the market. On these pleadings, it is manifestly clear that the employer realized Geary was right and that its interest lay in withdrawing from the market the dangerous product. Despite Geary\u2019s candor in seeking within the corporate family to advance the corporation\u2019s best interest, his employer fired him.\nThere is no doubt that strong public policies of this Commonwealth have been offended by Geary\u2019s discharge. First, the product asserted by appellant to be defective was, after appellant notified his superiors, withdrawn from the market. The manufacture and distribution of defective and potentially dangerous products does not serve either the public\u2019s or the employer\u2019s interest. Our courts have granted relief to those injured by defective merchandise. E.g., Kassab v. Central Soya, 432 Pa. 217, 246 A.2d 848 (1968); Webb v. Zern, 422 Pa. 424, 220 A.2d 853 (1966). See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965). The majority, however, fails to perceive that the prevention of injury is a fundamental and highly desirable objective of our society.\nSecond, appellant as an employee was \u201csubject to a duty to use reasonable efforts to give his [employer] information which is relevant to affairs entrusted to him, and which, as the [employee] has notice, the [employer] would desire to have and which can be communicated without violating a superior duty to a third person.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 381 (1958). Had Geary refrained from notifying his superiors of the defective product, he could have been discharged for violating this duty to come forward with information. No responsible policy is served which permits an employee to be discharged solely for obeying his legal duty to communicate information to his superiors. Indeed, the policy underlying this duty to communicate is frustrated by denying Geary the opportunity to present his case to the court.\nThe majority admits, as it must, that precedents barring a cause of action for wrongful discharge are \u201cscant\u201d and that \u201ceconomic conditions have changed radically\u201d since the date of the only Pennsylvania case on point. Henry v. Pittsburgh & L.E.R.R., 139 Pa. 289, 21 A. 157 (1891). Unlike the majority, I believe tbe time has surely come to afford unorganized employees an opportunity to prove in court a claim for arbitrary and retaliatory discharge.\nThe majority concedes the employment relationship is a proper subject for judicial action. Still, it refuses to afford Geary the opportunity to establish his claim of wrongful discharge. The majority justifies its refusal to act by assuming that to recognize a cause of action on the facts alleged will unleash \u201can increased case load and . . . thorny problems of proof,\u201d and by further assuming that these problems will plague our judicial system. The majority\u2019s thinking is nothing more than an unarticulated fear of the mythological Pandora\u2019s bos. Not only are both assumptions unwarranted, but the majority fails to perceive the realities of twentieth century industrial organization. The reality is that recognizing a cause of action for wrongful discharge in these circumstances will help to check a serious menace in our society, the arbitrary dismissal power of employers.\nThe genius of the common law is that the case-by-case analysis permits opening and closing of the door to the courtroom. \u201c[I]n view of the fact that from the day Magna Charta was signed to the present moment, amendments to the structure of the law have been made with increasing frequency, it is impossible to suppose that they will not continue, and the law be forced to adapt itself to new conditions of society, and, particularly, to the new relations between employers and employes, as they arise.\u201d Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366, 387, 18 S. Ct. 383, 386 (1898). In my judgment, the assertion that appellant should be denied relief because his case represents the opening wedge of a theory which might produce further litigation is an inappropriate judicial consideration. Niederman v. Brodsky, 436 Pa. 401, 412-13, 261 A.2d 84, 89 (1970).\nIt would, however, be misleading to imply that docket considerations alone account for the majority\u2019s reticence. \u201cOf greater concern [to the majority] is the possible impact of such suits on the legitimate interests of employers in hiring and retaining the best personnel available.\u201d The instant case itself illustrates the fallacy of this argument. If the existence of the tort of wrongful discharge in these circumstances (assuming, as we must, the truth of all facts alleged) will keep employees like George Geary on corporate payrolls, both the employer\u2019s and the public\u2019s interest will have been served. Affording relief for arbitrary and retaliatory discharge in no way impinges upon the employer\u2019s right to discharge for cause. That difficult line-drawing may be involved is of no great moment, since courts are daily confronted with the task of separating wheat from chaff.\nAs professor Lawrence E. Blades has noted, \u201c[t]he industrial revolution made an anacronism of the absolute right of discharge by destroying the classical ideal of complete freedom of contract upon which it is based.\u201d Blades, Employment at Will vs. Individual Freedom: On Limiting the Abusive Exercise of Employer Power, 67 Colum. L. Rev. 1404, 1418 (1967). Further, although a single nineteenth-century Pennsylvania case stated that an employer can dismiss an employee with or without cause, it does not necessarily follow that this right is absolute and unrestrained. \u201c[T]he word right is one of the most deceptive of pitfalls; it is so easy to slip from a qualified meaning in the premise to an unqualified one in the conclusion. Most rights are qualified.\u201d American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, 256 U.S. 350, 358, 41 S. Ct. 499, 500 (1921) (Holmes, J.).\nIt is public policy which here qualifies the \u201cright.\u201d See id. at 359, 41 S. Ct. at 501. When a seemingly-absolute right or the conditions of an existing relationship are contrary to public policy then a court is obligated to qualify that right in light of current reality. See Burne v. Franklin Life Insurance Co., 451 Pa. 218, 301 A.2d 799 (1973). Here, the employment relationship, as the majority and Geary\u2019s employer view it, clashes with the public\u2019s interest in keeping dangerous products from being sold and used.\nThe Supreme Court of Indiana has recently provided a discharged employee an opportunity to prove a claim for wrongful and retaliatory discharge. Frampton v. Central Indiana Gas Co., 297 N.E. 2d 425 (Ind. 1973). There, the plaintiff was dismissed after she filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation. The Indiana court observed that \u201c[i]f employers are permitted to penalize employees for filing workmen\u2019s compensation claims, a most important public policy will be undermined.\u201d 297 N.E.2d at 427. A California court similarly recognized a cause of action for wrongful discharge where the employee had been dismissed after he refused to commit perjury. Petermann v. Teamsters Union, 174 Cal. App. 2d 184, 344 P.2d 25 (1959).\nThe principle underlying these decisions should apply to the present case. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, society\u2019s interest in protecting itself from dangerous products manifestly presents a mandate to the court to recognize a cause of action for wrongful discharge. That a loyal and responsible employee should be summarily and without cause or notice discharged for complying with his duty to communicate relevant information to his superiors provides further justification for affording appellant an opportunity to present his claim. That appellant was discharged without cause for doing that which, had he failed to do, he would have been subject to dismissal with cause amply demonstrates the illogic of the majority\u2019s refusal to recognize in these circumstances a cause of action for wrongful discharge\nOur society has long been apprehensive of the arbitrary dismissal power of employers, and has sought through various solutions to remedy the problem. To countervail employers\u2019 dismissal power, unions were created. Congress has sought to safeguard certain classes of employees from wrongful and capricious discharges. And our Legislature has decided that certain state employees must be guarded from the abuses of arbitrary discharge.\nYet, under the majority\u2019s view, unorganized employees remain unprotected. Here, Geary\u2019s discharge is directly contrary to the societal interest in preventing injury due to defectively-manufactured products. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965). Moreover, Geary was dismissed for simply fulfilling his duty to notify his superiors of a potentially dangerous situation. See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 381 (1958). The majority, however, refuses to recognize a cause of action in these particular circumstances. In my view, this Court should take this first step and protect Geary and unorganized employees from arbitrary and retaliatory discharges.\n\u201cThe judiciary has not been reluctant to expand the meaning of constitutional provisions in order to protect the individual from governmental oppression. It is something of a paradox that the courts have so far displayed no similar bent for invention and improvisation when it comes to protecting individuals, particularly in their highly vulnerable status as employees, from the private establishments upon which they are becoming increasingly dependent. Instead, there has been a blind acceptance of the employer\u2019s absolute right of discharge. This outmoded doctrine lias been supported by technical principles of contract law.\u201d Blades, Employment at Will vs. Individual Freedom: On Limiting the Abusive Exercise of Employer Power, 67 Colum. L. Rev. 1404, 1435 (1967).\nCourts are duty-bound to fashion remedies for the changing circumstances of economic and social reality. And it is far too late in the day for this Court to indulge itself by fictionalizing that the doctrine of freedom of contract justifies insulation of an employer\u2019s arbitrary and abusive exercise of his power of discharge.\nThe majority concedes, as it must, that tort law is uniquely suited for judicial action. Further, it cannot be denied that prevention of injuries is a substantial, clear, and compelling objective of our society. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965); cf. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 381 (1958).\nThis Court should, in my view, fulfill its societal role and its responsibility to the public interest by recognizing a cause of action for wrongful discharge where the dismissal offends public policy. George B. Geary has presented just such a case.\nThe orders of the Superior Court and the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County should, in my judgment, be reversed.\nA demurrer to a complaint admits as true all well-pleaded facts and all inferences reasonably deducible from them, but not any conclusions of law. Reardon v. Wilbur, 441 Pa. 551, 554, 272 A.2d 888, 890 (1971) ; Clevenstein v. Rizzuto, 439 Pa. 397, 400-01, 266 A.2d 623, 624-25 (1970) ; Hoffman v. Misericordia Hospital, 439 Pa. 501, 503-04 267 A.2d 867, 868 (1970). Therefore, at this stage of the pleadings this Court is bound to accept as true Geary\u2019s aUegation that the steel pipe was in fact withdrawn from the market by U. S. Steel.\nTo support its argument that the legitimate interests of employers in hiring and retaining the best personnel available would be compromised by granting appellant an opportunity to prove his elaim of wrongful discharge, the majority quotes extensively from Blades, Employment at Wills vs. Individual Freedom : On Limiting the Abusive Exercise of Employer Power, 67 Colum. L. Rev. 1404, 1428-29 (1967). It is true that Professor Blades speaks of the problems of proof and the potential for unjustified suits if a cause of action for wrongful discharge is recognized by the courts. However, Professor Blades unqualifiedly endorses the idea of a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Immediately following that portion of his article quoted by the majority (see note 13 of majority opinion), Professor Blades concludes. \u201cBut this argument [that there should be no judicial review of an employer\u2019s necessarily subjective evaluation of higher-echelon employees], when viewed against the strong interest in protecting the freedom and integrity of all employees, has force only if the sanctity of the normal right of discharge would be seriously impaired by unfounded claims of employer coercion. The problem of proof is not insurmountable, for there are a number of evidentiary techniques available to the courts by which the genuineness of a claim might be reasonably guaranteed and serious infringement of the employer\u2019s normal right of discharge avoided.\u201d Blades, supra at 1429.\nHenry v. Pittsburgh & L.E.R.R., 139 Pa. 289, 21 A. 157 (1891).\nAn analogous situation is presented by recent accomodations to the near-absolute right of landlords to evict tenants. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has held that \u201cwhile the landlord may evict for any legal, reason or for no reason, at all, he is not, we hold, free to evict in retaliation for his tenant\u2019s report of housing code violations to the authorities.\u201d Edwards v. Habib, 397 F.2d 687, 699 (D.C. Cir. 1968).\nThe majority attempts to distinguish Petermann v. Teamsters Union, 174 Cal. App. 2d 184, 344 P.2d 25 (1959), and cases following it by asserting that recovery has been limited to instances in which an explicit declaration of public policy has been made by the legislature. For this proposition, the majority cites Montalvo v. Zamora, 7 Cal. App. 3d 69, 86 Cal. Rptr. 401 (1970) ; Patterson v. Philco Corp., 252 Cal. App. 2d 63, 60 Cal. Rptr. 110 (1967) ; Glenn v. Clearman\u2019s Golden Cock Inn, Inc., 192 Cal. App. 2d 793, 13 Cal. Rptr. 769 (1961) ; Mallard v. Boring, 182 Cal. App. 2d 390, 6 Cal. Rptr. 171 (1960). Though this statement may not be factually inaccurate, it in no way precludes this Court from noticing and acting upon dictates of public policy whether the Legislature has or has not yet acted.\nSee generally Blades, Employment at Will vs. Individual Freedom: On Limiting the Abusive Exercise of Employer Power, 67 Colum. L. Rev. 1404 (1967).\nSee American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U.S. 184, 209, 42 S. Ct. 72, 78 (1921). \u201cA single employee was helpless in dealing with an employer. He was dependent ordinarily on his daily wage for the maintenance of himself and family. If the employer refused to pay him the wages that he thought fair, he was nevertheless unable to leave the employ and to resist arbitrary and unfair treatment Union was essential to give laborers opportunity to deal on equality with their employer.\u201d\nE.g., The Automobile Dealer Franchise Act of 1956, 15 U.S.O. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-25 (1970).\nSee Act of August 27, 1963, P.L. 1257, \u00a7\u00a7 1-31, 71 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 741.3 to .1005 (Supp. 1973), amending Act of August 5, 1941, P.L. 752.\nThe Civil Service Act provides that \u201c[n]o regular employe in the classified service shall be removed except for just cause.\u201d 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.807 (Supp. 1973). A regular employee is one \u201cwho has been appointed to a position in the classified service in accordance with this act after completing his probationary period.\u201d Id. \u00a7 741.3(h). Classified service is defined to include all positions (other than certain managerial-type employees and unskilled laborers, id. \u00a7 741.3(c)) in enumerated departments of the state. Id. \u00a7 741.3(d)(1)-(15).\nThe Civil Service Act further requires that every state employee covered by the Act be given notice of \u201cany personnel action taken with respect to him,\u201d id. \u00a7 741.950, and that he be provided an opportunity to appeal to and appear publicly before the Civil Service Commission. Id. \u00a7 741.951.\nThe Supreme Court of New Hampshire recently limited employers\u2019 arbitrary dismissal power by recognizing a contractual cause of action for a malicious breach of a contract of employment at will. Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., 316 A.2d 549 (N.H. 1974), announced after the filing of this ease, involved a suit by Olga Monge against her employer for breach of an at-will employment contract. Monge claimed her discharge was caused by the harassment of her foreman, whose hostility resulted from her refusal to go out with him. The jury found in her favor and the Supreme Court of New Hampshire affirmed on liability but remanded on damages. In doing so that court reasoned: \u201cIn all employment contracts, whether at will or for a definite term, the employer\u2019s interest in running his business as he sees fit must be balanced against the interest of the employee in maintaining his employment, and the public\u2019s interest in maintaining a proper balance between the two.\u201d 316 A.2d at 551. The holding of the New Hampshire Supreme Court was explicit. \u201cWe hold that a termination by the employer of a contract of employment at will which is motivated by bad faith or malice or based on retaliation is not the best interest of the economic system or the public good and constitutes a breach of the employment contract\u201d",
