Smith testified at his trial in 1964 that on the day the robbery allegedly was committed, he was in New York City working for one of his putative alibi witnesses. At Smith’s PCHA hearing in 1967, the supposed employer testified and corroborated the alibi. Although the PCHA judge did not believe this witness’s testimony, this Court correctly decided that his disbelief was not relevant to whether the testimony would have been believed three years earlier.
