The residence in which the art collection was housed had become dilapidated and expensive to maintain, and income was insufficient to build a new building or to undertake a major renovation of the old one. The petition sought, in terminating the trust, to have the trustee of the testamentary trust take over all the objets d’art of the museum. The trust company opposed the petition, arguing that it was a trustee only of funds totalling $100,000 and that it was not responsible for what might become of the settlor’s art collection. The court refused to declare a termination, but by its order, entered August 16, 1955, authorized the individual trastees of the museum to sell the land and building (this was done, producing $91,300), to transfer the art to a floor of the public library building in Bellevue, Pennsylvania, and to con<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>duct the activities of the museum at that site.

Under §4942(g) (2) of the I.R.C. of 1954, as amended, the Secretary of the Treasury (or his designate) is empowered to authorize a “set-aside” of undistributed income (otherwise taxable under §4942) <em>if </em>the “set-aside” is to be expended on a specific project within 5 years, the project is one associated with the purposes of the foundation, and the project is one better accomplished through accumulation. The project proposed by the individual trustees was the acquisition of suitable land and the construction of a museum building within the next five years. Proposed expenditure for land was $50,000 and for the building was $250,000.

We do not think that the conclusion necessarily follows.

Tbe only evidence, if it can be called that, relied upon by tbe appellee to support tbe finding of failure is a statement in tbe petition of tbe museum trustees <em>in 1955 </em>for leave to terminate tbe trust.

        <em> </em>Section 4942 of the Internal Revenue Code is entitled “Taxes on Failure to Distribute Income.” It applies to a “private foundation” which is defined as an organization <em>generally </em>exempt from income taxation under section 501 of the I.R.C. of 1954, but within the definition of section 509 of the I.R.C. of 1954, added by Pub.

If it is <em>not </em>an “operating foundation”, then under §4942(a), its nondistributed income is subject to a 15% tax, and, if the income <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>so taxed is not distributed by the end of a “correction period” (defined, generally, as three months after receipt of a deficiency notice), the provision of §4942(b) taxes the remainder to the extent of 100%.

At that time it appeared that the persons who were the Settlor’s object to educate into appreciation of artistic values were either devoid of any sense of artistic appreciation, as they did not even visit the Museum, or the objects which were supposed to be the means of arousing that sense of artistic appreciation possessed no inherent qualities of art. Petitioner therefore <em>intended </em>to request your Honorable Court to appoint a Master, under the authority vested in it, who was qualified by education, and experienced in matters of art, to investigate and to make recommendations to your Honorable Court in relation to his examination and investigation. Petitioner realizes, however, that such an examination by a Master appointed in this proceeding, and any determination made herein, would be (aside from the matter of taxation of this Trust) ineffective in relation to the John A. Hermann, Jr. Memorial Art Museum Trust (Deed-Exhibit “B”). In 1955, when the Order of Court (Exhibit “D”) was entered, it was entered by the Court of Common Pleas, an entirely different Court.</p>

        <em>“The Court: </em>What you are asking is that the Court suspend distribution for the present until the Treasury Department acts. <em>Counsel: </em>That is right. . . .” At the second audit hearing, following the favorable tax ruling, the position of the museum trustees, as stated by their counsel, was that the court had before it only a single question: “[I]s the [corporate] trustee correct in [with] holding the payment of income to the Hermann Art Memorial Museum.” Counsel for the corporate trustee did not disagree, although noting that “the subject matter of the Art Museum was dubious.”</p>

The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1967) defines the word as “a building or place where works of art, scientific specimens, and other objects of permanent value are kept and displayed.” If the general public must actually visit with some measurable frequency an artistic or scientific collection, then the tastes of the current generation of society could, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction, result in the destruction of the efforts of settlors of museum trusts to preserve the past in the hopes of enlightening the present and the future. Certainly there are valuable museum collections which, owing to their obscure location or to the obscure nature of the subject matter displayed, are only rarely visited by the general public. It is doubtful that such a fact bears on whether they are or are not “museums”.</p>

And these paintings at that timo were <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>examined by the Curator of the Carnegie Museum.
