Somers and Paul D. Somers (hereinafter collectively referred to as Somers). The shares of stock owned by appellee were pledged as collateral security for Scott’s obligation on two promissory notes, payable to and delivered to Somers. The liquidation followed alleged defaults in payment of the notes.</p>
    <p id="b418-5" data-blocks='[["BL_418.9",418,[190,1027,1156,755]]]'>By these suits in equity, Scott sought to enjoin the corporations from transferring his stock; to ascertain his rights as a minority shareholder in the two companies ; to order an accounting by the corporations and Somers, the majority stockholders; and to appoint a receiver for each corporation. After a consolidated trial of the two cases, the chancellor, in his adjudication, found Somers’ liquidation of Scott’s minority stockholdings to be void and of no effect, and restored to Scott his status as a shareholder in both corporations. Exceptions to the chancellor’s findings of fact and conclusions of law were dismissed by the court <em>en </em>bane, which entered a final decree affirming the decree <em>nisi. </em>Defendants appeal.</p>

If that is the case, Scott was not in default for failure to pay the notes on demand because the corporate assets had not then <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>been sold, and liquidation of the collateral was in violation of the agreement.</p>

Scott testified that it was the understanding of the parties that his obligation to Somers was to become payable only when the real estate which comprised the corporate assets was sold, by deduction from his one-quarter interest in the proceeds of sale. He stated that appellants and their attorney represented to him, at or prior to the time he executed the notes, that the purpose of the notes was merely to insure that his obligation would be paid as described prior to Scott’s receiving any distribution from either corporation. On the basis of that evidence the chancellor found that the demand for payment of the notes violated the agreement of the parties and that Scott was not in default when the collateral, his stock, was liquidated because the corporately held properties had not then been sold.</p>

In <em>Allinger v.

The trial judge granted defendants a continuing objection to such, testimony, reserving a ruling on the objection until his decision of the case. On cross-examination of Mr. Scott the following ensued: Q. Now at the time I presented you with this note on April 23rd will you kindly repeat what I said with respect to the note itself to John Scott? A. Repeat what? Q. What I told you about the note with respect to payment. A. You said that it was to protect the Somers in case something happened to me; you listed a bunch of contingencies, and if one of those contingencies occurred it merely made sure that the money that they had borrowed would be paid off first, before anybody else participated in anything. That was my understanding. Scott now argues that the eliciting of such testimony on cross-examination by appellants’ counsel amounts to an admission by counsel that the note does not contain the full agreement. A reading of the full record of the cross-examination indicates rather that this line of questioning was an attempt by appellants’ counsel to show the unlikelihood that such an agreement was made at all. The cross-examination of Scott continued as follows: Q. Assume these properties had not been sold. How long was this note to be outstanding? A. Until such time as it was agreed to liquidate, sell it off. A. Suppose the Pennsylvania Company had called their notes, the notes they had signed to get this money to go into this <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>venture?
