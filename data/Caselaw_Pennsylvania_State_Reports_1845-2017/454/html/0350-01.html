Appellants’ family initially came to appellee’s attention in the fall of 1965. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to ameliorate conditions in the Sanders home, appellee petitioned the Juvenile Court of Greene County for custody of the children. As of December 1969, six children had been placed in foster care pursuant to court orders and a petition by the appellee for the similar placement of four more children was pending. On December 23, 1969, the court issued an order declaring that indications of improvement in the attitude of the parents and the conditions in the home warranted keeping the four children with their parents but directing appellee to con<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>timie its supervision of the family. Subsequently, the court recanted its prior position and by October 1970 six additional children had been placed in foster homes pursuant to court order. Thus, all twelve children then living had been removed from appellants’ custody and temporarily placed elsewhere.</p>

On August 23, 1971, following hearings on June 21 and June 25, 1971, the petition was granted, subject to the filing of exceptions, which appellants duly filed.

At this point in the hearing, the record shows the following: “By the Court: Q. What does the record show as to the program [sic] made at that time? A. At the time the children were left with their parents and conditions, as I understand, progressed for a very short time and within a three weeks’ period after the last hearing, conditions weren’t better. The parents had been gone overnight and there was no food in the home. [Counsel for the Appellants] : We object to his [sic] unless she knows of this. By the Court: She is only testifying from her records. [Counsel for the Appellants] : Mr. Knight’s and Mrs. Sutton’s. By the Court: Let the record show [counsel for the appellants] objects and the objection is overruled.” The above quoted testimony is classic hearsay. The witness’ first-hand knowledge of some of the facts contained in the report cannot justify the admission of otherwise incompetent hearsay testimony drawn from the same report. This conclusion is mandated by our decision in <em>Jones Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/449/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="449 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1945624" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0543-01">449 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20117" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="297 A.2d 117">297 A. 2d 117</a> (1972), wherein we held that a summary report “permeated with hearsay” could not support a decree of involuntary termination of parental rights.

      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>it failed to do so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Accordingly, we hold that this decree, similar to that in <em>Jones, </em>was based, at least partially, on inadmissible evidence.</p>
    <p id="b467-3" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[165,472,1150,809]]]'>While the contested evidence discussed above constituted only a minor part of appellee’s case, we cannot say that without this evidence the lower court would have reached the same result. Because of the serious impact attending the termination of parental rights, it is important that a judicial decree extinguishing such rights be based solely on competent evidence. In light of appellant’s significant evidence of self-improvement, it is quite possible that the incompetent evidence accepted below provided the “swing factor” in that court’s determination. Appellants are entitled to a hearing and decision free from such taint. Hence, we will remand this matter to the court below for the purpose of conducting a proceeding consistent with this opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

It is entitled “Summary from Child Welfare Service of Greene County to The Honorable Judge Glenn R. Toothman”, and signed by Wilma R. Johnson, Child Welfare Aide, and Rupert Eder, Executive Director of the Agency. The report consists of five pages, and concludes with a recommendation to the court that the best interests and welfare of the six named Sanders children require “that all parental rights be terminated in order that these children can be legally adopted into families where their needs may be met.” This communication to the court was evidently either the basis for the petition for involuntary termination of parental rights, which was also signed by the same two officials of the agency, or prepared for use at the hearing in support of said petition. In either case, it is reasonable to suppose that it was read and considered by Judge Toothman. Whether or not the docu<a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>ment qualified under the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, 28 P.S. 91b, as the majority supposes (see Opinion of the Court, note 7), is not clear to me. The question is not raised by the parties, and I do not consider it important for the Court’s decision.</p>
