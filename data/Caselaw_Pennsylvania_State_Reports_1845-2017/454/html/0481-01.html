Initially, it is argued that Resolution 165 could not be an acceptance because not couched in the offer’s terms and not consistent with the acceptance procedure outlined in the offer. The Authority attempts to take advantage of two hornbook rules of interpretation. First, a reply to an offer which purports to accept, but adds qualifications or makes acceptance conditional, is not an acceptance, but rather a counter-offer. See Restatement of Contracts §60 (1932). Second, when an offer states a manner of acceptance, it becomes the exclusive mode of creating the contract.

That paragraph states: “Acceptance, or rejection, of this proposal shall be made by depositing such acceptance, or rejection, notification in the United States mail addressed to the Proposer at the address set forth below.” Although this provision sets out a manner of acceptance, there is no indication that mailing is the exclusive method of acceptance.
