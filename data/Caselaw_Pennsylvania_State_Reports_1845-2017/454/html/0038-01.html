That section reads in pertinent part: “In the event the person who was fined or whose license was suspended or revoked by the board shall feel aggrieved by the action of the board, he shall have the right to appeal to the court of quarter sessions or the county court of Allegheny County in the same manner as herein provided for appeals from refusals to grant licenses.

The Board argues on the other hand that the court of common pleas may not change or modify the penalty imposed by the Board unless it first finds facts different from those found by the Board; in other words, if the court sustains the findings of the Board, it may not disturb the penalty.

I do not understand this principle, as originally expressed by the Superior Court, to have been that the lower court could not or would not review for “error of law or abuse of discretion”; this would have been to say, in effect, that the Board was free to impose a penalty “ [unduly] harsh . . . under the circumstances of [the] case.” <em>Pacewicz, </em>supra, at 128.</p>

But a close examination of the cases shows that the reality is not nearly so simple. Instead of the two categories of the reviewable and the unreviewable, the cases reveal a large number of categories distinguishable from each other on the basis of scope of review.”</p>
