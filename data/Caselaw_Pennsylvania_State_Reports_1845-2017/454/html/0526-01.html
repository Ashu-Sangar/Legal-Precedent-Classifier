One of those counts is not involved in this appeal. As to the other count, which was count one of the indictment, appellant claims that the trial court erred in sentencing the appellant under two separate statutes—the Armed Robbery statute, Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §705, 18 P.S. §4705, and the Carrying Deadly Weapons statute, Act of February 25, 1972, P. L. 79, No. 27, §1, <em>amending </em>Act of July 30, 1968, No. 227, §1, 18 P.S. §4416. The trial court imposed a sentence of three and a half to seven years for the crime of Armed Bobbery and another sentence of five to ten years for the crime of Carrying Deadly Weapons (frequently called the “Cun Law”). The sentences were to run consecutively. Post-trial motions were denied and the Superior Court affirmed the judgments of sentence <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>in a per curiam order. <em>Commonwealth v.

An indictment by the grand jury charging a statutory offense must do so in the language of the statute. Historically, this requirement was strictly enforced to the extent that the <em>exact </em>language of a statute had to appear in an indictment. The slightest deviation from the exact language of the statute rendered the indictment fatally defective as to that statutory offense. <em>Hamilton v. Com</em>monwealth, <a href="/pen-w/3/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 142" data-case-ids="1827591" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0142-01">3 Pen. &amp; W. 142</a> (Pa. 1831); <em>Respublica v.

Because the <em>exactness </em>requirement was strictly enforced, the legislature in 1860 mitigated the heed for exactness by providing that “[e]very indictment shall be deemed and adjudged sufficient and good in law which charges the crime <em>substantially </em>in the language of the act of the assembly prohibiting the crime, and prescribing the punishment, if any such there be . . . .” Act of March 31, 1860, P.

It only provided that the language of the indictment be <em>substantially </em>rather than <em>exactly </em>in the language of the statute. The <em>substantial </em>language of the statute must still be contained in the indictment however; otherwise, we could not know what statutory offense the grand jury intended to charge. Without such knowledge, a citizen might be tried for an indictable offense that the <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>grand jury did not intend to charge which is prohibited by the Pennsylvania Constitution in article I, section 10.</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.5",641,[162,492,1151,1512]]]'>A citizen’s conduct may involve a violation of two or more statutes. It is for the grand jury to determine under which statutes to indict. The grand jury “has the power to refuse to indict even where a clear violation of law is shown____[It] can reflect the conscience of the community in providing relief where strict application of the law would prove unduly harsh.” 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice ¶6.02[1] (Cipes ed. 1968) (footnotes omitted). “The very purpose of the requirement that a man be indicted by grand jury is to limit his jeopardy to offenses charged by a group of his fellow citizens acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge.” <em>Stirone v. United States, </em><a href="/us/361/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="361 U.S. 212" data-case-ids="6167188" data-case-paths="/us/361/0212-01">361 U.S. 212</a>, 218, <em><a href="/us/361/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="361 U.S. 212" data-case-ids="6167188" data-case-paths="/us/361/0212-01">4 </a></em><a href="/us/361/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="361 U.S. 212" data-case-ids="6167188" data-case-paths="/us/361/0212-01">L.

The requirement that the indictment contain the language of the statute, not only protects a citizen from being tried for an offense which the grand jury deliberately chose to ignore, but it also protects a citizen from being tried for a statutory offense of which the grand jury did not know. A citizen cannot be tried for an indictable offense when the possibility exists that the grand jury had absolutely no knowledge about a particular statute. If we did not require that the substantial language of a statute be contained in an indictment, we would be faced with a guessing game every time the grand jury returned an indictment alleging conduct of a citizen which may be criminal under several statutes.</p>

Count one <em>substantially </em>follows the language of the Armed Bobbery statute which provides: “Whoever, being armed with an offensive weapon or instrument robs or assaults with intent to rob another . . . .” Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §705, 18 P.S. §4705. The above count does not, however, contain any charge in the language of the act of assembly entitled “Carrying Deadly Weapons,” which provides in pertinent part: “Whoever is convicted of committing a crime of violence, which for the purposes of this section means . . . robbery . . . and during the commission thereof had in his possession a firearm shall, in addition to the penalties prescribed by law, be sentenced to undergo imprisonment for not less than five (5) years and not more than ten (10) years.” Since the indictment contains none of the language of the above statute, we do not know whether the grand jury intended to charge a violation or had any knowledge of the statute. Under these circumstances, the appellant could not be tried, convicted, or sentenced under that statute.</p>

He, however, contends that the defective indictment was cured by a notice, attached by him to the indictment, giving information to the appellant that <em>the district attorney considered </em>the appellant’s conduct a violation of the Carrying Deadly Weapons statute. This notice, as the district attorney agrees, may meet the requirements of article I, section 9, of the Pennsylvania Constitution which entitles an accused to be informed of “the nature and cause of the accusation against him . . . .” But, although the district attorney can accuse, the district attorney cannot indict. He has completely overlooked article I, section 10, of the Pennsylvania Constitution which guarantees that: “No person shall, for any indictable offense, be proceeded against criminally by information . . . .” The attachment by the district attorney in this case was at best an information.
