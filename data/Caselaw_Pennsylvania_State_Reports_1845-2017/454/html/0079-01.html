Appellant’s action was motivated by the fact that he had been earlier advised that one Frank Smith, Jr., had been arrested for a series of burglaries, and had, shortly after being taken into custody, implicated appellant in the commission of these crimes. The following day (February 1, 1967) after having been detained and interrogated for over 21 hours, appellant signed a statement admitting his complicity in seven burglaries. Immediately thereafter, appellant was preliminarily arraigned.</p>

On October 2, 1967, appellant proceeded to trial, before a jury, on the second burglary count (No. 7e), and was adjudged guilty. Prior to this trial, a timely filed motion to suppress the confession was denied. (At trial, this challenged confession was, over objection, introduced against appellant). Post-trial motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to serve a term of 23 months imprisonment. On November 1, 1968, appellant pleaded guilty to the five remaining burglary charges then outstanding against bim (Nos. 7a, b, c, d, and 10). Appellant was sentenced on each of these offenses to serve a term of imprisonment of one and one-half to four years, each sentence to run concurrently with those already being served.</p>

R. Crim. P. 116(a) (effective January 1, 1965) ; <em>Dutton, </em>supra. Where this mandate has gone unfulfilled by the Commonwealth, “all evidence obtained during ‘unnecessary delay’ <em>except that which </em>. . . <em>has no reasonable relationship to the delay whatsoever” </em>must be excluded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

However, this argument misses the point—Pa. R. Crim. P. 116(a) (as well as its progeny Pa. R. Crim. P. 118 and 116) requires that all arrestees be preliminarly arraigned “without unnecessary delay.” The Commonwealth has made no suggestion whatsoever that the instant delay was necessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Accordingly, we must conclude that the 24 hour delay between appellant’s arrest <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>and arraignment was “unnecessary,” and hence violative of Rule 116(a). <em>Dutton, </em>supra; <em>Tingle, </em>supra; <em>Futch, </em>supra.</p>

The <em>Futch </em>rule is prophylactic, not remedial. It is designed to ensure that in future all prisoners will be promptly arraigned after arrest. Where a confession is shown to have been coerced, the rule is superfluous. It comes into play in precisely those situations where the confession is voluntary and otherwise free from unconstitutional taint. Thus the admission at trial of a confession in all respects valid but obtained during a period of unnecessary delay detracts not a whit from the fairness of the trial proceedings. Indeed, since the deterrent function of the <em>Futch </em>rule will hardly be advanced by its application to facts occurring five years before its announcement, there is no jurisprudential purpose to be served by extending the benefit of the rule to Wayman, much less any fundamental error in admitting Ms confession.</p>

Our rule of procedure, Pa. R. Crim. P. 319, as amended on March 28, 1973, charges Pennsylvania judges not to accept a guilty plea “unless [the court] determines after inquiry of the defendant that the plea is voluntarily and understandingly tendered.” The commentary to that Rule lists minimum inquiries to be made and information to be given the defendant. In addition, we have obliged trial courts to ascertain that there exists a factual basis for the plea. See <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em><a href="/pa/450/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="450 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1947021" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0417-01">450 Pa. 417</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="299 A.2d 209">299 A. 2d 209</a> (1973).
