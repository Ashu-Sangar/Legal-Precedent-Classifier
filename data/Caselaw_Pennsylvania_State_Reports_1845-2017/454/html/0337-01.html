Appellant, then complaining of stomach cramps and watering eyes, was examined by a police doctor. The doctor made a report in which he found that Moore was “suffering from acute withdrawal symptoms and is a manifestation of narcotic addiction.” The report continued: “However, it is my opinion that he is quite alert and is lucid and fully capable of making <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>a valid statement.” Appellant then completed, read and signed his statement at 7:20 a.m. Two hours later the detectives took appellant to the Philadelphia General Hospital for treatment of the withdrawal symptoms. Upon returning to Police Headquarters at about 11 o’clock, Moore made a second inculpatory statement to another detective.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellant testified that he kept telling the officer he was sick, that he had cramps, that his head was “messed up”, that he needed to go to a hospital; that he was carried to the hospital, where a nurse “gave me a needle and something to drink”; that he lay on the floor of the police vehicle both en route to and back from the hospital, and that following his return to the station house he was still doubled up with cramps and had the same symptoms as before. The police, he said, were insisting on a statement as a condition of further treatment. The police officers, on the other hand, testified that appellant (who had eaten just before questioning began) seemed normal, alert and responsive; that in accordance with the policy of the Homicide Division to have an alleged drug addict examined by a police surgeon, Moore was so examined when he complained of a stomach ache and a running nose, with the result above given; that after returning from the hospital, Moore <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>told the officer that “he was not in pain at this time”, and that he did not then appear to have any withdrawal symptoms.</p>

Here the suppression judge obviously chose to believe the testimony of the two police officers as to appellant’s condition and ability at the time the challenged statements were given, and not that of appellant. His findings of fact were categorical that appellant, in giving his two statements, was not affected by drugs or narcotics, or by withdrawal therefrom; and that they were “freely, intelligently and voluntarily made.” As we observed in <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, supra: </em>“An appellate court does not weigh evidence or pass upon the credibility of witnesses, and there is no basis for us to hold as a matter of law that the court’s finding of voluntariness of the confession was not adequately supported and well within the court’s discretion.”</p>

On this record we are unable to conclude as a matter of law that “defendant’s will was overborne at the time he confessed.” <em>Reck v.

The court then repeated, in essence, its charge as to murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, and voluntary manslaughter, but omitted mention of felony murder. This was called to the court’s attention by the assistant district attorney, and the court then supplied the omission. The appellant does not challenge the accuracy of the additional instruction, but contends that since it went beyond the jury’s request, it amounts to coercion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
