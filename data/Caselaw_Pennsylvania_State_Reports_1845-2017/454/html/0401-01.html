    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.7",516,[188,380,1151,756]]]'>Appellant, James Banks, was tried by jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal División and found guilty of murder in the first degree. He was also convicted on four counts of aggravated robbery and assault and battery. Demurrers were sustained by the court to counts of aggravated assault and battery and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the final count of assault and battery. Arguments were heard before the court en banc on motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment and were denied. Thereafter appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder bill. Sentences on the other bills of indictment were suspended by the lower court. This case is before us on direct appeal.</p>

Appellant and his companions then sold the watch and divided the proceeds of the robbery among themselves. The four then went to a party arriving at approximately 1:00 a.m., December 14, 1969. While there appellant and two of the original group again agreed to engage in additional robberies. One of the group named Ford remained behind and his place was taken by Marshall Jones. Arriving again at 30th Street Station they assaulted Steven Kreloff on the station platform throwing him from the platform to the tracks below and robbing him of his wristwatch and $3 in cash. While appellant and his confederates were robbing Kreloff, the fourth man assaulted and robbed Harry Pollack at the other end of the platform station. Pollack was thrown from the platform to the tracks below as a result of which he fractured six ribs and later died of <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>multiple injuries received from the fall. The group then went to 15th and John F. Kennedy Boulevard where one of the group robbed Annie Thompson of her pocketbook containing $2.80 and in the process broke three bones in her face.</p>

The victim’s death must have been a consequence of a proven robbery. The testimony received from Anne Yancey described the decedent as having said he had been beaten and pushed onto the tracks. The testimony of Earl Gallagher related that the victim had stated that he had been down on the platform waiting for a train when some youth accosted him demanding money from him and when he said he had none pushed him onto the tracks. In addition to this testimony Norman McCray, a co-conspirator, testified that the attack upon the victim was pursuant to an agreed scheme to commit robbery against per<a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>sons that they would come upon. Further, appellant’s own confession verified that one of the group went through the pockets of the victim as he laid helpless on the tracks. The record clearly establishes that there was present felonious intent to take money from the person of Harry Pollack and the accomplishment of that end was by means of violence which resulted in the injuries causing his death. <em>Commonwealth v. Simpson, </em><a href="/pa/436/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="436 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1926116" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0459-01">436 Pa. 459</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20751" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="260 A.2d 751">260 A. 2d 751</a> (1970).

Specifically, he argues that the warMngs given by the police were inadequate to fully inform Mm of his right to request the presence of appointed counsel while undergoing questioMng. A review of the testimony received at the suppression hearing suggests otherwise. Appellant was told at 12:35 p.m. and at 2:00 p.m. that “You have a right to talk to a lawyer of your own choice before we ask you any questions and also to have a lawyer here with you while we ask you questions. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer and you want one, we will see that you have one provided for you free of charge before we ask you any questions.

We believe this contention cannot support a claim of involuntariness. In <em>Culombe v.

The court explained the test as follows: “Is the confession the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker? If it is, if he has willed to confess, it may be used against him. If it is not, if his will has been overborne and his capacity . . . impaired, the use of his confession offends due process.” <a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">Id. at 602</a>.

The testimony at issue is that of Jacob Blank who stated that sometime around 11:50 p.m. on December 13, 1969 he was attacked and robbed in the concourse area of 30 th Street Station by four young black males. The circumstances of the Blank robbery and the three robberies that occurred thereafter indicated a common <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>design and modus operandi relative to all four happenings. The law of the Commonwealth is that evidence of other crimes is admissible when it tends to prove a common scheme, plan or design embracing the commission of two or more crimes and the commission of one tends to prove the commission of the others and the identities of the parties charged with the commission. <em>Commonwealth v.

The fact that one of the original conspirators dropped out after the Blank robbery and was replaced by another does not alter the fact that the robberies were part of a common scheme, plan or design and that the appellant had participated in the conspiracy from the beginning. This was not “a distinct crime” for which evidence could not be given against one who was being tried for another crime. <em>Commonwealth v. Foose, </em><a href="/pa/441/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="441 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1933803" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0173-01">441 Pa. 173</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20452" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="272 A.2d 452">272 A. 2d 452</a> (1971).

No definite time limit, or distance from the site of the crime, has been fixed by the courts in determining what spontaneous utterances are admissible as part of the res gestae.

The length of time which has elapsed between when the declarations were uttered and when the occurrence took place is only one element to be considered in determining their spontaneity.

Eeconstructing the picture as disclosed by the testimony, the conclusion is inevitable that the statements were spontaneously uttered, were directly related to the attack that had been perpetrated upon the decedent, and were not the result of reflection or design. The fact that some of the decedent’s statements were made in response to questions posed to the victim by Yancey and Gallagher does not preclude their being spontaneous. <em>Commonwealth v.

Allen, </em><a href="/pa/448/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="448 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1944732" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0177-01">448 Pa. 177</a>, 181-182, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20373" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="292 A.2d 373">292 A. 2d 373</a>, 375 (1972)). In <em>Clark </em>we stated that a police officer’s statement that the defendant had previously served time “in prison” implied a prior conviction for a serious offense, thus was prejudicial in that it permitted the jury to infer that the defendant had a prior criminal record. To warrant a characterization as prejudicial the testimony must convey to the jury, either expressly or by reasonable implication, the fact of a prior criminal offense. In the case at bar the mere passing reference to the appellant’s confinement did not supply a sufficient basis for a reasonable inference of prior criminal activity in view of the numerous crimes for which he was then on trial. The reference did not either expressly or by reasonable implication convey the fact of a prior criminal offense unrelated to the criminal episode for which he was then on trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Sharpe, supra.</em>

Specifically, appellant objects to the courts defining reasonable doubt as “the kind of doubt that would restrain a reasonable man or woman from acting in a matter of great importance to himself or herself.” We find appellant’s instant assignment devoid of substance. We recommended the very standard and instruction given in the instant case in <em>Commonwealth v. Burns, </em><a href="/pa/409/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="409 Pa. 619" data-case-ids="1883215" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0619-01">409 Pa. 619</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.2d%20552" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="187 A.2d 552">187 A. 2d 552</a> <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>(1963) and reaffirmed the approved instruction as recently as <em>Commonwealth v.

There is no basis for appellant to object.</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.6",524,[176,999,1153,1028]]]'>Appellant argues that the court erred in charging the jury that the accomplice’s testimony should be scrutinized very carefully where not corroborated. He contends that this admonition to the jury removed the necessity to scrutinize the entire testimony of the accomplice with caution. That which the appellant now objects to is in fact the basis of the doctrine. The concern was that a jury should not embrace testimony offered by an accomplice without a full understanding of the unreliability of the source of that evidence. It was recognized that a danger existed where there was no other evidence to support the testimony of the accomplice. It was for this reason that under these circumstances, the jury also would be specifically cautioned. Where, of course, there is corroboration the concern is not as great and the normal rules of creditability obtain. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Elliot, </em><a href="/pa/292/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="292 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1109641" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0016-01">292 Pa. 16</a>, 23, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.%20537" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="140 A. 537">140 Atl. 537</a>, 539 <em>(1928); Commonwealth v.

Rule 1119(b) of the Pa. R. Crim. P. requires that objections to the court’s charge to the jury be made beyond the hearing of the jury. The design of the rule is to prevent the jury from ac<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>tually hearing the content of the specific objection to the charge and the subsequent ruling.
