The applicable provision is Article V, section 15(b), which provides as follows: “(b) A justice or judge elected under section thirteen (a), appointed under section thirteen (d) or retained under this section fifteen (b) may file a declaration of candidacy for retention election with the officer of the Commonwealth who under law shall have supervision over elections on or before the first Monday of January of the year preceding the year in which his term of office expires. If no declaration is filed, a vacancy shall exist upon the expiration of the term of office of such justice or judge, to be filed by election . . . ,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Commonwealth Court, by its opinion and order dated March 28, 1973,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> found that the letter in question was not a “filing” and dismissed appellant’s complaint.

Appellant’s present term as President Judge of the Traffic Court of Philadelphia expires on the first Monday in January 1974.

    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[176,487,1152,809]]]'>We conclude that appellant did not timely file a declaration of candidacy to seek retention election under Article Y, section 15(b), of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The retention election procedure enables an incumbent judge to avoid the burdens of a normal political campaign. However, it is the judge’s responsibility to comply with the filing requirement of section 15(b) if he wishes to avail himself of this convenience. It is apparent that appellant did not meet this responsibility. Not only did he wait until ten days before the deadline prior to taking any action pursuant to qualifying himself for retention election, but he made no follow-up on his initial letter until ten days <em>after </em>the deadline. Under these circumstances, we cannot see how appellant has suffered any injustice.</p>

        <em> </em>During this latter period, appellant did file appropriate forms which he now uses as the basis for an estoppel argument against the Secretary. However, we dismiss this argument summarily and adopt the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning on this point: “. . . the Constitution clearly requires declaration of candidacy for retention election to be filed no later than the prescribed date. Nothing the Secretary of the Commonwealth does or does not do after that date and nothing that the avowed candidate does or attempts to do after that date can overcome this clear constitutional mandate. Nor can plaintiff, as discussed above, shift to the Secretary a responsibility which is placed upon him and thereby create an estoppel.” <a href="/pa-commw/8/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Pa.
