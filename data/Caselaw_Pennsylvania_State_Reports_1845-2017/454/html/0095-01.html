Howsare also disclosed that certain items of evidence, including the death weapon, had been thrown into the Juniata River by appellant. On February 21, 1972, another confidant of the appellant, David Price, told police that appellant similarly disclosed his responsibility for these homicides to Price in a December 9, 1971, conversation and on that occasion revealed that the murder weapon and other inculpating items of evidence had been thrown into the Juniata River.</p>

He was taken into custody by state police at the Meadows Race Track in Washington County at 12:20 p.m. on March 80, 1972, and immediately advised of his constitutional rights. The appellant was taken to his apartment to change his shoes and then transported to the state police barracks in Washington, Pennsylvania, where he was fingerprinted, <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>photographed and fed. Thereafter, he was transferred to a district magistrate in Bedford County for preliminary arraignment and then to the Bedford County state police barracks, where he arrived at about 2:00 p.m. Approximately five and one-half hours after his arrest, at about 5:45 p.m., and immediately subsequent to a second recitation of his constitutional rights by state police, the appellant gave an oral confession which was later reduced to writing and signed by appellant.</p>

When he stood mute before the court, a plea of “not guilty” was entered on his behalf. Appellant was brought before the court again on August 15, 1972, when his attorneys advised the court that he wished to change his plea. On that occasion, although he did not again stand speechless when confronted with the charges against him, the appellant responded “no plea.” “Not guilty” pleas were again entered on his behalf.</p>

    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[175,591,1151,524]]]'>Appellant urges that the twenty-minute interval between his “no plea” and “guilty” plea should have motivated the court to refuse to accept the guilty pleas he finally entered. This argument is unaccompanied by allegations of coercion from any source whatsoever. We are unwilling to find that some undisclosed influence coerced the appellant to shift his position or that the brief time interval within which appellant acted to modify his plea should have prompted the lower court to discount it.</p>

I want you to say to me, <em>did they pressure you in the last few minutes or at any time to enter a plea of guilty? </em>A. No. By the Court: <em>Have they indicated to you at any time in their discussions since their first meeting with you that any bargain had been made with me, the court, or the district attorney, the officers or with any person as to a possible sentence that might be imposed if you entered a plea of guilty? </em>A. No. By the Court: What, if anything, have they or anyone else done to get you to change your plea of not guilty to a plea of guilty? Anything? A. No. By the Court: <em>Have you changed your plea because you were afraid the jury </em>
      <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>
      <em>might find you guilty mid sentence you to death; I would assume that is possible, is that right? </em>A. <em>Yes. </em>By the Court: What did I tell you a few minutes ago? <em>Did you understand when I said if you were tried before me without a jury on a plea of guilty and I would find you were guilty from, all the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, I would find you guilty of murder in the first degree but I would, not impose the death sentence. Is that right? </em>A. <em>Yes. </em>By the Court: <em>I also said to you that is not a good reason for you to change your plea. If you didn’t do it you should never admit to it and I am going to reserve the right to withdraw those pleas if you wish. Are these pleas really made with your own free choice and oivn choosing? </em>A. <em>Yes. </em>By the Court: Do you wish to ask me any questions in connection with the case that you think I might be able to tell you? A. No.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[168,1245,1147,1081]]]'>We are asked in this connection to vacate the appellant’s convictions and sentences on the strength of an affirmative answer to the question of whether it was “possible” that the appellant was changing his plea because he feared the imposition of the death penalty. In a factual setting where police had obtained the appellant’s confession, where appellant twice admitted his culpability in out-of-court statements to confidants and where these statements led police to the location of appellant’s discarded weapon and items of property stolen from the Beechwood Inn, we cannot and will not strain to hold that appellant was <em>motivated </em>to enter a plea of guilty by his fear of the death penalty. The passage from the record on which we are asked to ground a reversal indicates only a possibility that appellant’s guilty plea was impelled by his fear of a death sentence. But <em>cf., Commonwealth v. Floyd, </em><a href="/pa/451/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="451 Pa. 366" data-case-ids="1948577" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0366-01">451 Pa. 366</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20131" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="304 A.2d 131">304 A. 2d 131</a> (1973). It seems most probable that appellant was <em>motivated </em>by the Commonwealth’s overwhelming case against him.</p>
    <p id="b214-3" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[183,322,1151,1026]]]'>
      <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>The appellant argues that his guilty plea was motivated by the lower court’s refusal to suppress physical evidence found in the Juniata River: a .22 caliber revolver determined to be the death weapon by ballistics tests, coins stolen from the Beechwood Inn and two other weapons, one taken from the Beechwood Inn at the time of the subject homicides. Testimony from the suppression hearing indicates that on February 21, 1972, David Price disclosed to state police that George Butler had admitted his responsibility for the Beechwood homicides to Price. On the basis of Price’s disclosures, Officer Tokarczyk of the state police asked Price to approach the appellant for the purpose of determining the location of physical evidence thrown into the Juniata River by appellant. It is appellant’s position that because he was a “prime suspect” at the time police asked Price to obtain information from the appellant, he should have been warned of his constitutional rights by Price.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[184,1360,1150,425]]]'>Appellant cites no authority for the proposition that <em>Miranda v.

Appellant does not address himself to the issue of whether his decision to plead guilty was motivated by the incompetent advice of counsel.

Jackson, </em><a href="/us/390/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="390 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="6174728" data-case-paths="/us/390/0570-01">390 U.S. 570</a>, <a href="/us/390/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="390 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="6174728" data-case-paths="/us/390/0570-01">88 S. Ct. 1209</a> (1968). Confronted with a federal statute which permitted a jury, but not the trial judge, to impose the death penalty, the Supreme Court stated: “[T]he defendant who abandons the right to contest his guilt before a jury is assured that he cannot be executed; the defendant ingenuous enough to seek a jury acquittal stands forewarned that, if the jury finds him guilty and does not wish to spare his life, he will die. ... The inevitable effect of any such provision is, of course, to discourage assertion of the Fifth Amendment right not to plead guilty and to deter exercise of the Sixth Amendment right to demand a jury trial.” <a href="/us/390/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="390 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="6174728" data-case-paths="/us/390/0570-01">Id. at 581</a>, <a href="/us/390/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="390 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="6174728" data-case-paths="/us/390/0570-01">88 S.

      <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>Because here the fear of the death penalty emphasized by the trial court’s comments was the significant factor in appellant’s decision to plead guilty, he is entitled to a new trial.

    <p id="b217-3" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[146,672,1147,700]]]'>Moreover, the plea is constitutionally infirm because by his questioning the trial judge, with his inherently unequal bargaining power, induced appellant’s plea.

The colloquy preceding the entry of the plea indicates most persuasively that the plea could hardly be classified as knowing and voluntary.</p>
