Post-trial motions were filed but later withdrawn, and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. In October, 1965, appellant filed a petition for habeas corpus alleging that his trial had been tainted by the introduction of testimony that he stood mute when confronted at a police station interview by a co-defendant’s statement implicating him in the homicide. The trial court dismissed the petition and an appeal to this .Court followed in which we recognized that the doctrine of tacit admission was in conflict with the protections afforded under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a> (1966).

These members of the Court further concluded that a case on direct appeal was not a final judgment. In <em>Commonwealth v. Little, </em><a href="/pa/432/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="432 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1919678" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0256-01">432 Pa. 256</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%2032" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="248 A.2d 32">248 A. 2d 32</a> (1968) after adopting the view of the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Eagen in <em>Bravees, </em>supra, this Court proceeded to hold a judgment was not final where the right to appeal had been granted nunc pro tunc. Most pertinent to our present inquiry the Court in <em>Little </em>observed: “The Commonwealth argues that Shadd covers the instant case because we there remanded for a Douglas hearing to determine whether Shadd had been denied his right to appeal. The next step in the Commonwealth’s argument is a complete non sequitur, for it states that Shadd makes clear that, should an appeal nunc pro tunc be allowed, the tacit admission question could not be raised. <em>On the contrary, there is not the slightest intimation in Shadd that such was the case. We merely held that the tacit admission could not be collaterally attached. We said nothing at all concerning the using of the tacit admission question on a nunc pro tunc appeal.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>

      <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>There is a serious question as to whether or not the doctrine of the “law of the case” is applicable to criminal cases particularly where the wrong complained of is an alleged violation of a recognized constitutional right. Accepting however, for the purpose of argument, that such a doctrine has some general applicability in this area of the law, it clearly does not apply in the present instance. In our original decision we concluded only that the appellant was not entitled to the benefit of this new protection because of the procedural posture of the case at that time. Thus, even if the doctrine is applicable in this area of the law, it would not come to play under the present factual setting in view of the fact that this Court has never ruled on the issue as to whether the appellant was to be granted relief for this complaint on an appeal nunc pro tunc.</p>

This turn-ahout is justified, in the view of the other opinions, because we now hear Shadd’s case as on direct appeal <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>as distinguished from an appeal in a collateral proceeding (Shadd’s earlier appeal was from denial of habeas corpus).

On the one hand, the appellant was not to be narrowly limited to the law that existed when a timely appeal would have been filed, nor, on the other hand, was he to be accorded the benefit (or detriment) of all the law that had developed between trial and appeal. “We hold”, said the Court in <em>Faison, </em>“that an appellant may press on a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal an issue premised on a constitutional right which was enunciated subsequent to his original judgment of sentence, <em>provided that this right has been given such retroactive effect that it would have been available to appellant had an appeal been timely filed ” </em><a href="/pa/437/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="437 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1927806" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0432-01">437 Pa. at 441</a>. (Emphasis supplied.) The proscription of the use of tacit admissions, like the other new pronouncements, of <em>Miranda, </em>has not been given such retroactive effect as Shadd’s own prior appeal established. But today the Court again ignores its formulation of but three years ago, and allows appellant to assert a rule non-existent at the time of his trial and expressly held non-retrospective. Thus not only is the test adopted in <em>Faison </em>by-passed, but also the careful holding in <em>Shadd, </em>supra.</p>

I repeat, however, that by holdings such as that in <em>Heard </em>and this one, we continue to discriminate invidiously against the well-counselled defendant who took a timely appeal in favor of the defendant who, for one reason or another, was until lately ignorant of his appellate rights; the latter is given a new trial, while the former has no prospect of release from imprisonment. Thus also do we disserve the cause of judicial administration, compelling our over-burdened courts to redo litigation long since ended, with evidence gone stale and with witnesses, if still available, whose memories have dimmed. It is for these reasons that I dissent.</p>

This modification of the cases to which the new rule was applicable in no way affects the case at bar, the trial of which long preceded <em>Malloy.</em>
