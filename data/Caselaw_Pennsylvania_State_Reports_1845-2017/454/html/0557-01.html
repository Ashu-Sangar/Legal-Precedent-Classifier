As we conceive, the statute was intended to enable her to sue for the recovery of her earnings, and also for her effects, if carried off, either by her husband or others. She might have such a property in a bond or promissory note, as would enable her to maintain an action; but unliquidated damages are not “property”, either in common parlance or technical language.

See also <em>Falco v.

In light of the consistent position of this Court on the meaning of the term “separate property,” and the fact that the legislature has failed to change the language of the statute, we must presume that the interpretation given to the pertinent language is consistent with the legislative design.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.6",673,[168,2045,1147,263]],["BL_674.1",674,[207,339,1155,1634]]]'>Moreover, the view that an unliquidated damage claim is not “separate property”, is not only consistent with the legislative design, but it is also valid for two other reasons. First, property may be defined in a number of ways, but one of the more workable definí<a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>tions is: the right of any person to possess, use, enjoy, and dispose of a thing. Cf. <em>Willcox v. Pennsylvania Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/357/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="357 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="472118" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0581-01">357 Pa. 581</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="55 A.2d 521">55 A. 2d 521</a> (1947). An unliquidated damage claim does not enjoy all the attributes of property, however, since it may not be assigned. See <em>Sensenig v. Pennsylvania R. R., </em><a href="/pa/229/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="229 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="971841" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0168-01">229 Pa. 168</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20A.%2091" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="78 A. 91">78 A. 91</a> (1910); <em>Manganiello v. Lewis, </em><a href="/pa-super/122/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="122 Pa. Super. 435" data-case-ids="990167" data-case-paths="/pa-super/122/0435-01">122 Pa.

Hence, an individual may not “dispose” of an unliquidated damage claim in a manner in which he may normally dispose of other objects. Secondly, our legislature did not let the matter of interspousal immunity die with the enactment of the Married Women’s Property Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> which invested the wife with the legal power of owning “every species and description of property, whether consisting of real, personal or mixed which may be owned by or belong to any single woman. . . .” By itself, the effect of the language of this Act may have been to abolish the common law immunity between spouses; however, our legislature went further and preserved some of the common law by enacting the statute herein under discussion. If “separate property” is read in the instant statute as having the same meaning as “every species and description of property” in the Married Women’s Property Act, the interspousal immunity statute would be meaningless, since every suit between spouses would be to protect or recover “separate property.” It is therefore apparent “separate property” as defined in the immunity statute has to be lesser in scope than an all encompassing definition of property.</p>

The statute in this case which deprives a married woman of her right to file a legal claim is unconstitutional. The legislature <em>cannot grcurvt immunity </em>from suit to any person who has wronged another. There is no authority in the Pennsylvania Constitution which permits the legislature to deprive anyone of the opportunity to redress a wrong. In fact, the Declaration of Bights (Pa. Const. art. I, §11) specifically provides that “. . . every man for an injury done him in his lands, conditions, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law. . . .” <em>See Brown v. Common</em>
