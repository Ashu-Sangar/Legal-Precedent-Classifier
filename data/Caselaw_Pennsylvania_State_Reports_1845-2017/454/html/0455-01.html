The voluntary defender was appointed to represent the appellant and, after a counseled hearing in which appellant, through his counsel, restricted his attack to the assertion that the guilty plea had been improperly induced by a coerced confession, the hearing judge dismissed the petition from the bench. Subsequently, appellant requested and was <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>granted the right to file an Amended Post-Conviction Petition and a supplemental brief. The amended petition incorporated the original claims and added an allegation of the use of a co-defendant’s confession in violation of <em>Bruton v.

Although the hearing judge had been moved to vacate the original order of dismissal based on the appellant’s representation that he wished a resolution of the <em>Bruton </em>issue, appellant waived the opportunity for further testimony and in the supplemental brief merely reiterated the original claims which had been pumied during the hearing, completely ignoring the alleged <em>Bruton </em>violation. After consideration of the brief, the court reimposed its original order dismissing the petition and also dismissed the amended petition. We affirmed the action of the hearing court in <em>Commonwealth v. Ligon, </em><a href="/pa/443/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="443 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1937040" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0562-01">443 Pa. 562</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%20150" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="279 A.2d 150">279 A. 2d 150</a> (1971).</p>

District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking habeas corpus relief alleging: (a) the plea of guilty was unlawfully induced; (b) the introduction of coerced confession into evidence and the ineffective assistance of counsel; and (c) the obstruction by state officials of his right to appeal. The District Court, approving the report and recommendation of the U. S. Magistrate, denied appellant’s first two grounds on the merits without a hearing, and denied his alleged denial of appellate rights under <em>Douglas v. California, </em><a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">372 U.S. 353</a> (1963), without prejudice. However, the Court provided that he was to be allowed to resubmit the latter ground in the event that he had not received a state hearing on that issue within 60 days.

The record of the initial guilty plea fails to provide any indication that the appellant was so advised and the Commonwealth failed to produce any other evidence to establish an intelligent and knowing waiver. If the record in this case ended at that point it is clear that the appellant must prevail on this issue. However, when appellant first sought relief under the P.C.H.A. in a pro se petition, he first raised the issue of the <em>Douglas </em>denial and conclusively established that at that point he was aware of the claim and the redress it would afford if successfully pursued. At the hearing upon the petition appellant, through his counsel, failed to assert this ground and was content to rely upon other claims for the relief he sought.</p>

We have noted <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>that where a petition for post-conviction relief contains an assertion of a <em>Douglas </em>right denial, the hearing court should first determine that issue before proceeding to a consideration of the other claims raised.

Here, where concededly the appellant could have prevailed if he had pressed his motion in the original hearing, it is obvious that he had raised all of the issues that he, at that time, chose to rely upon and was concerned with a determination of the merits of those issues rather than receiving the dubious procedural advantage of proceeding on a motion for a new trial. Our view is further supported by his failure to reassert the <em>Douglas </em>claim when the Court vacated the initial denial of the petition and allowed the opportunity for further argument. Equally as significant is the appellant’s failure to raise in the initial petition or the amendment any contention that was barred because of the collateral nature of the procedure. Nor was there any allegation of prejudice resulting from being denied an opportunity for direct appeal.</p>

Further, it is nothing more than another theory attacking the validity of the guilty plea which has been previously litigated.
