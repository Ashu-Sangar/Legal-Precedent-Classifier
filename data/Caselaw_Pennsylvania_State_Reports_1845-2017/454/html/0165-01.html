On May 7, 1968, Kujawa’s widow, the appellant herein, filed a fatal claim petition for an award pursuant to the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act. The referee granted appellee’s motion to dismiss on the ground that there can be no recovery for death occurring more than 800 weeks after an accident. The Workmen’s Compensation Board affirmed this decision. On appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, the court <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>en banc affirmed the decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Board and dismissed the claimant’s appeal.

The theory was that the claim in that case was for a continuation of the compensation payments which had already been awarded for total disability,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and that death was not the <em>basis </em>of the award, but merely an <em>event </em>requiring payment of the balance of the compensation due the decedent.</p>
