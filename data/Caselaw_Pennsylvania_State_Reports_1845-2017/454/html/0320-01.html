One officer testified when Jeffries saw the officers, he “quickened his pace”. Upon seeing him do so, the officer left the police vehicle and started to pursue Jeffries, who then began to run. While giving chase, the officer observed Jeffries throw a cigarette package under an automobile parked along the street. Shortly thereafter, the officer overtook Jeffries and directed him to stand against a wall. At that moment the other officers arrived on the scene and they were told by the officer, who apprehended Jeffries, to “hold him one minute”. The officer then recovered the cigarette package from underneath the parked vehicle, and it was found to contain several foil-wrapped packages of a substance later determined to be heroin.</p>

The Commonwealth counterargues the police had probable cause to pursue and arrest Jeffries, or alternatively, his conduct gave them cause to conduct an investigatory stop, thus the evidence was properly admitted since it was not the fruit of illegal activity. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues the evidence was obtained independent of an arrest or search; hence, the legality of the arrest merits no consideration.

However, flight, in and of itself, is not sufficient to constitute probable cause for otherwise anyone, who does not desire to talk to the police and who either walks or runs away would always be subject to a legal arrest.

Jeffries was simply walking along a public street in Pittsburgh in broad daylight and when he saw a police officer he knew, he “quickened his pace” and started to run when the officer began to chase him. This is not enough to justify a seizure under <em>Terry, </em>as interpreted by this Court, absent some other factor which would give rise to suspicion of criminal conduct.</p>

In such a situation it cannot be said that there was a “voluntary abandonment” of the evidence.

The causative factor in the abandonment presently under consideration was the unlawful and coercive action of the police in chasing Jeffries in order to seize him.

Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

Ct. 992</a> (1968), the United States Supreme Court stated that objects falling in the plain view “of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view” are admissible evidence. In the instant case it cannot be questioned the officer had a right and duty to be on the street, but the only reason he had a “plain view” of the object seized is because of his unlawful act of attempting to seize Jeffries. Thus, the officer had no lawful right to be in the position to have the view. Moreover, inherent in the plain view doctrine is the principle the seized object must not have been put in plain view as a result of unlawful police conduct. Thus, the doctrine does not apply in the instant case to validate the evidence.</p>
