L. 1664, §4(q), 35 P.S. §780-4(q). Following the denial of all post-trial motions filed, each appellant was sentenced to a term of not less than two years nor more than five years imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed the judgments of sentence with two judges dissenting.</p>

Recently this Court had occasion to observe: “The better practice in a multijudge county would be to have the trial conducted by someone other than the judge who presided over the Suppression Proceedings particularly where there is a waiver of jury accepted.” <em>Commonwealth v. Paquette, </em><a href="/pa/451/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="451 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="1948574" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0250-01">451 Pa. 250</a>, 258, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20837" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="301 A.2d 837">301 A. 2d 837</a>, 841 (1973).</p>

We were also aware that in many instances all parties are perfectly agreeable to the same judge presiding even where the trial is non-jury. But our decision not to formulate a prophylactic rule prohibiting a judge from presiding over both pretrial and trial proceedings should not have suggested that we failed to perceive the possible difficulties that could result from such a procedure or as a determination that a timely objection in an appropriate case could not provide a basis for a reversal of a judgment of sentence. While an <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>awareness of the congestion of court calendars appropriately influenced our decision to refrain from prohibiting this practice these considerations are of no moment where a record demonstrates that the procedure in that case resulted in prejudice to the defendant and the objection was properly preserved for appellate review.</p>

If it is established that the information received during the pre-trial proceeding would have been incompetent in the subsequent proceeding and that it was of a sufficiently inflammatory nature to arouse a prejudice against the defendant he need not demonstrate that the information actually influenced the court’s actions. We are impressed with the wisdom of the ABA §1.7 Standards Belating to the Function of the Trial Judge which provides: “The trial judge should recuse himself whenever he has any doubt as to his ability to preside impartially in a criminal ease <em>or whenever he believes his impartiality can be reasonably </em>questioned(Emphasis supplied). We have every confidence that the trial judges of this Commonwealth are sincere in their efforts to avoid consideration of incompetent inflammatory evidence in reaching their judgments but we also are acutely aware that the appearance of bias or prejudice can be as damaging to public confidence in the administration of justice as would be the actual presence of either of these elements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We are equally anxious to avoid the curtailment of the defense in the presentation of testimony in support of pre-trial motions because <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>of the fear that information disclosed therein may adversely affect the outcome of subsequent proceedings. These considerations lead us to conclude that a judge should honor a request for recusation where prejudicial information is received in a pre-trial proceeding that would be otherwise inadmissible during the trial of the cause.</p>

However, we need not discuss this contention in light of the repeal of the Act of 1961 and the passage during the pendency of this appeal of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act of <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>April 14, 1972, P.

    <p id="b475-3" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[162,418,1152,1137]]]'>The pertinent section of the new Act which concerns us is “Pending Proceedings”, 35 P.S. §780-139 (a) which reads as follows: “Prosecution for any violation of law occurring prior to the effective date of this act is not effected or abated by this act. <em>In any case not yet final, if the offense is similar to ones set out in this act, the penalties under this act apply if they are less than those under prior lam.” </em>(Emphasis added.) In light of this section the issue to be resolved is whether or not The Controlled Substance Act was intended to affect the appellants’ sentences. We devised in <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/450/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="450 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1947053" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0548-01">450 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20359" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="301 A.2d 359">301 A. 2d 359</a> (1973), a formula by which we would determine whether the new Act would affect a defendant’s sentence: “Three elements must be present before a pending prosecution can be governed by the new Controlled Substance Act: (1) the original offense charged must be similar to one set out in the new Act; (2) the penalties provided in the new Act must be less than those established by the prior law; and (3) the case must not be finally litigated.” Id. at 555, 301 A. 2d at 364.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[161,1569,1149,757]]]'>In the case at bar we find all three criteria are present. Initially, we note that marijuana is a “controlled substance,” regulated by the Act of 1972, 35 P.S. §780-104(1) (iv). Specifically, appellants were convicted under §780-4 (q) of The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, which prohibits the possession of any dangerous or narcotic drug and sentenced under §780-20(c) which prescribes the penalty therefore. The offense delineated in §780-113(a) (16) of The Controlled Substance Act is “knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled . . . substance. . . .” Marijuana being a “controlled substance” the offense is similar and corresponding. Hence, there is an offense cognizable under the new Act which is similar to the offense under the prior Act.</p>
    <p id="b476-3" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[193,322,1154,1457]]]'>
      <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>The second element requires that the penalties in the new Act be less than those established by the prior Act. The Controlled Substance Act provides in §780-113(b) that a person convicted for the first time under the Act for knowingly and/or intentionally possessing marijuana shall be sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding one year or to pay a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both. The actual sentence given appellants under The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act of 1961 was from two to five years imprisonment. The second requirement is therefore fulfilled. Finally, we must make a determination as to whether or not the appellants’ case was final within the meaning of 35 P.S. §780-139 (a) of The Controlled Substance Act. This Court in <em>Commonwealth v Little, </em><a href="/pa/432/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="432 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1919678" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0256-01">432 Pa. 256</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%2032" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="248 A.2d 32">248 A. 2d 32</a> (1968) adopted the rule on finality enunciated in <em>Linkletter v.

We most recently reaffirmed this proposition in <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, supra </em>at 556, 301 A. 2d at 364 (1973). Since the case at bar is before us on direct appeal, we conclude the judgment in this case is not yet final. Therefore, the appellants in this case are entitled to be resentenced in accord with the provisions of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act of 1972.</p>
