    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[196,823,1153,1028]]]'>Trust A was a “marital deduction trust” designed to take full advantage, through the use of the so-called “formula” approach, of the marital deduction permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, for federal estate tax purposes. The income therefrom was to be paid to the wife during her lifetime; the corpus was subject to the wife’s power to dispose of all or part thereof during her lifetime, or, upon her death, by testamentary power of appointment. Should the wife’s income from all sources be less than $50,000 per annum after taxes, or should payments of principal be required by illness or emergency or to maintain the wife in her accustomed standard of living, then invasion of principal was authorized. Should the testator’s wife predecease him—which proved not to be the case —then the gift to the wife would lapse and the amount which would have funded Trust A would pass to the heirs of the wife in accordance with the intestate laws of Pennsylvania then in force.</p>

The will provided for no gift to the thirteen named income beneficiaries of Trust B (other than to Helen Weiss) should the wife predecease the testator; in such event, the charitable foundation would take the residuary estate immediately. By a codicil dated January 5, 1966, however, the testator made specific pecuniary bequests, should his wife predecease him, to those persons; they range from $2500 to $15,000. By a second codicil dated February 1, 1966, the testator added a specific bequest of $500,000 (but not more than 25% of his adjusted gross estate for federal estate tax purposes) to the Federation of Jewish Agencies of Greater Philadelphia for construction of a facility for care and treatment of the aged.</p>

As this Court recently observed: “[I]t is incontestable that almost every settlor and testator desires to minimize his tax burden to the greatest extent, possible. However, courts cannot be placed in the position of estate planners, charged with the task of reinterpreting deeds of trust and testamentary dispositions so as to generate the most favorable possible tax consequences for the estate. Rather, courts are obliged to construe the settlor’s or testator’s intent as evidenced by the language of the instrument itself, the overall scheme of distribution, and the surrounding circumstances.” <em>Benson Estate, </em><a href="/pa/447/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="447 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1942937" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0062-01">447 Pa. 62</a>, 72-73, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20101" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="285 A.2d 101">285 A. 2d 101</a> (1971).

Bull. 1960-62, at 77, the Commissioner announced that if a trust instrument provides that trust receipts representing capital gains shall or may be treated as income and paid to a life tenant, or if the instrument could be so interpreted <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>under the applicable state law, then it is possible for the trustee in effect to diminish the corpus, thus making the value of the remainder at some future date unascertainable. The interest of the charitable remainder-man would therefore not be severable from that of the noncharitable income beneficiaries, and hence no deduction would be permissible. Although it does not immediately appear how discretion to pay out as income an increment to the trust corpus would <em>deplete </em>corpus, the Commissioner’s theory, as summarized by the Fourth Circuit, would appear rational: “To illustrate how substantial invasion may occur, the government suggests, in regard to the power to invest in any type of property in any proportion, the possibility that the trustees may invest in a wasting asset without making provision for amortization of the asset or other reserve for the return of corpus. In regard to the power to allocate and apportion expenses and receipts, the government contends that this power may be used to divert corpus to the income of the beneficiary if the trustees, in the exercise of their uncontrolled discretion, charge a premium on securities purchased at a premium to corpus, but treat the full return on such securities as income payable to the life beneficiary. The government also suggests that the trustees, in the exercise of their uncontrolled discretion, could elect to allocate stock dividends to the income beneficiary so that, again, a portion of the value of the corpus would be diverted to the noncharitable life income beneficiary. Finally, the government argues that the trustees might even allocate capital gains to income but capital losses to principal since they are vested with ‘uncontrolled discretion’ to make allocations, notwithstanding that both gain and loss on the sale of investment assets would ordinarily be allocable to corpus. . . .” <em>Greer v.
