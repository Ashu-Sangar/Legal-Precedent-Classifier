    <p id="b122-8" data-blocks='[["BL_122.12",122,[200,1440,1157,370]]]'>The appellant, Charles Bynum, was convicted of murder in the first degree, burglary, aggravated robbery, and weapons violations. The convictions resulted from a criminal episode on September 2, 1969, when the Piccadilly Bar in Philadelphia was robbed. The bartender, James West, Sr., was killed from a shotgun blast during the robbery.</p>
    <p id="b122-9" data-blocks='[["BL_122.13",122,[197,1821,1157,370]]]'>Post-trial motions were denied on December 21, 1971. On February 8, 1972, the appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction, ten to twenty years on the aggravated robbery conviction, and five to twenty years on the burglary conviction. All sentences ran concurrently. Sentence was suspended on the weapons violations conviction. This appeal followed.</p>

Because we agree, the judgments of sentence are reversed and a new trial granted.</p>
    <p id="b123-3" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[149,487,1151,1072]]]'>The prosecution sought to prove that the appellant participated in a robbery of the Piccadilly Bar which resulted in the fatal shooting of the bartender by one of the other participants. Harold Williams was called as a witness by the prosecution. At the time of the robbery, Williams was sitting on the outside steps of a building near the Piccadilly Bar talking with friends. In an attempt to place the appellant at the scene of the robbery, Williams was asked on direct examination whether he had seen the appellant on the day of the alleged robbery. Williams answered, “I think so. I’m not sure, really.” When the question was repeated, Williams gave the same answer after which the prosecution pleaded surprise and was permitted to cross-examine the witness. An objection by defense counsel was overruled. During the cross-examination, the prosecution attempted to impeach Williams by confronting Mm with a prior out-of-court statement in which Williams implicated the appellant by placing Mm at the scene of the crime.</p>

This is so for the reason that such an in-court declaration does not harm the calling party nor aid the opposing party. [Citations omitted.] Hence, when a witness claims he does not know or cannot remember, the prior statements should not be introduced because of the danger that the prior statements will be considered as substantive evidence by the jury.” <a href="/pa/443/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="443 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1936904" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0412-01">443 Pa. at 414-15</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=278%20A.2d%20881" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="278 A.2d 881">278 A. 2d at 882-83</a>.</p>
    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[200,1247,1156,423]]]'>While Williams’ testimony may have been disappointing, it was certainly not prejudicial or injurious to the prosecution’s case.

The prosecution introduced a signed alleged confession by the appellant which was vigorously disputed by the appellant on the witness stand during the trial. He testified that he did not confess to the crime, that he was suffering from narcotics withdrawal and that he was coerced into signing the alleged confession. There was no other substantive evidence presented which placed the appellant at the scene of the crime or implicated the appellant as a participant in the crime.
