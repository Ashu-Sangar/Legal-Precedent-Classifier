Slota, are attorneys and members of the Bar of Montgomery County. They brought an action in equity against the Norristown, Pennsylvania law firm of Haws &amp; Burke, a professional corporation, and against Thomas J. Burke, James S. Kilpatrick, Jr. and Ralph L. Hose, the three lawyers practicing in that firm. In their complaint plaintiffs recited that <em>“for </em>some period up until June of 1971, [they] were associated with the individual defendants in the practice of law” and that “plaintiffs are entitled to the possession of all the files, both active and closed, of the clients who have personally retained plaintiffs or either or both of them or who regard either or both of them as their own attorneys.” Consequently, plaintiffs prayed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendants be directed to deliver all files of clients listed <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>in an appendix of tlie complaint.

The appellants thereafter filed a companion<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> suit in which they alleged alternatively (a) that they had been <em>general partners </em>of the firms of Haws &amp; Burke either pursuant to an express oral agreement <em>or </em>pursuant to an agreement to be implied from the conduct of the parties <em>or </em>pursuant to a partnership the existence of which the named individual defendants were estopped to deny; (b) that they had been <em>shareholders </em>in the professional corporation of Haws &amp; Burke; or (c) that they had been <em>mere employees </em>but were entitled under an employment agreement to certain unpaid monies. In the event plaintiffs were to be found general partners or shareholders, they demanded a distribution of the assets of the firm. The two complaints were consolidated for trial.</p>

Like all contracts, partnership contracts may be either express or implied. “The distinction involves, however, no difference in legal effect, but lies merely in the mode of manifesting assent.
