Following a trial without jury, appellants were found guilty of voluntary manslaughter with respect to Legore and of aggravated assault and battery with respect to Paul and Austin Shoemaker.

In the street in front of the bar a commotion took place among members of the Shoemaker group and the defendants in which some shoving and threats were exchanged, the defendants participating in varying degrees. The defendants then went to their automobiles and began to drive away. As the cars <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>passed the Hofbranhans entrance, the Shoemaker brothers kicked at them. Farther ap the street the defendants stopped their cars and alighted, pursued by the Shoemakers. Shots were fired at the Shoemakers as they approached. A fight then occurred in which all six defendants participated, the two appellants playing principal roles. The Shoemaker brothers were knocked down, whereupon Legore entered the affray with a weapon, a mason’s long level, with which he strack Larry Haghes. In the fighting both Shoemakers were felled to the ground, Paul being rendered unconscious; Legore was killed by a blow to the chest from the level. According to their own testimony, both appellants engaged in the straggle with Legore. Appellant Haghes had called to appellant Rife for help when strack by Legore with the level. Rife came to Hughes’ aid and together they fought with Legore. Despite their denials that either one strack the deceased with the level, there was ample testimony from which the trial court could infer that one or the other of the appellants had struck the fatal blow.</p>

As we said in <em>Commonwealth v. Btrantz, supra; </em>“If one aids and abets in the commission of a crime, he is guilty as a principal. One is an aider and abettor in the commission of any crime, i.e. he has ‘joined in its commission’, if he was an active partner in the intent which was the crime’s basic <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>element. . . . ‘The least degree of concert or collusion between the parties to an illegal transaction makes the act of one the act of all.’ No principle of law is more firmly established than that when two or more persons conspire or combine with one another to commit an unlawful act, each is criminally responsible for the acts of his associate or confederate committed in furtherance of the common design.” The evidence was clearly sufficient to support the verdicts of guilty of voluntary manslaughter.</p>

There is no doubt that this injury was, as the trial judge found, “grievous bodily harm”. Austin Shoemaker’s injuries were less serious. A police officer who arrived on the scene after the defendants had departed testified that “[Austin] had cuts that were open on the bridge of his nose, he had a blackened eye, . . . and he had abrasions . . . along the side of his head. . . . His elbow, right at the joint, it had the skin scraped off but it was not bleeding.” Austin Shoemaker himself testified: “I was bruised and I had a blackened eye <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>and I had a large abrasion on the left of my head on one side.” These resulted, apparently, from Austin’s being knocked down by a car, followed by a kicking of his head by one of the defendants before he could get up, and by being hit on the legs by Hughes, who came after him with the mason’s level. While it is arguable that Austin’s injuries do not rise to the category of “grievous” bodily harm, the evidence is sufficient to support the finding of the trial court that he was wounded with a weapon of some sort, whether the automobile, the level, or defendant Poist’s boot. We conclude that as to both appellants the court was fully justified in finding that both Paul and Austin Shoemaker were the victims of an aggravated assault and battery within the meaning of the Penal Code.

Only the Shoemakers were involved in the disturbance with the defendants inside the bar and the shoving, threatening and kicking of cars outside. Moreover the defendants saw the Shoemakers running up the street toward them and fired at them. Legore, on the other hand, surprised appellants, entering the fight at a later stage and with a weapon. Clearly the trial judge could have found from the evidence that appellants acted maliciously with respect to the Shoemakers, but in the heat of passion with respect to Legore.</p>

Malice in the legal sense is not merely a description of an actor’s state of mind. For example, had appellants, with the same state of mind as they had in the instant case, struggled with Legore and struck him with the level, thereby inflicting grievous bodily harm but not killing him, we have little doubt that appellants would properly have been held guilty of aggravated assault and battery upon Legore. Similarly, one who, believing unreasonably that his life is threatened by two others, fires a single shotgun blast at the two, killing one and wounding the other, may be convicted of voluntary manslaughter as to the deceased victim and aggravated assault and battery as to the one wounded. To say in such cases that one crime is committed with malice and the other without refers not to a difference in the defendant’s state of mind, but to the existence of mitigating circumstances which the law recognizes in homicide cases as sufficient to reduce the offense from <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>murder to voluntary manslaughter, <em>Commonwealth v.

Such a state of mind is not, however “recognized mitigation” as to the crime of aggravated assault and battery. Since the element of actual intent or reckless and wanton conduct was present, appellants could be said to have acted “maliciously” as to that crime.
