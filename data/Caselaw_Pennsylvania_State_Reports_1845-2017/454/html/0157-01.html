This was recognized in Welch v.

The first is the paramount state interest in obtaining adequate revenues which lends every tax statute a presumption of validity. See generally, <em>Commonwealth v. Phila.

The second is that taxation is not in the nature of a penalty or a contractual obligation, but rather a means of apportioning the costs of government among those who benefit from it. See, <em>Welch v. Henry, </em><a href="/us/305/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="305 U.S. 134" data-case-ids="6139102" data-case-paths="/us/305/0134-01">305 U.S. 134</a>, 146 (1938); <em>Philip Wagner Inc. v.

For example, where at the time of the transaction in dispute the taxpayer could not reasonably have foreseen that a tax would be imposed, and, where he would have been likely to alter his conduct to avoid the tax had he foreseen it, the United States Supreme Court has granted relief based on the Due Process Clauses. See, <em>e.g., Untermyer v.

Such a rationale is particularly applicable to gift and estate taxes because the donor’s intent is frequently guided by tax considerations.

      <em>Life Assurance, </em>like the instant case, involved a constitutional attack on the very statute at issue here, the <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>act of February 21, 1961.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> As part of that challenge this Court construed the Act of 1961. In doing so we stated: “[T]he receipt of renewal premiums in practical effect amounts to no more than the resale of insurance coverage for an additional period of time. As the court below noted, ‘[an insurance company’s] business is broader than just selling policies; it also extends to the collection of premiums whether in the year in which the policy is sold initially or in subsequent years on the renewal of the policy.’ ” Id. at 390, <a href="/citations/?q=214%20A.2d%20221" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="214 A.2d 221">214 A. 2d 221</a> (footnote omitted). The plain meaning of our holding in <em>Life Assurance </em>is that the Act of 1961 does not impose a retroactive tax. Although it is true that the contracts in question were written before 1961, it is the receipt of revenue during each tax year, not the writing of contracts, that produces the taxable event.</p>

The tax was not predicated on the taxpayer’s earnings or ability to pay and was due regardless of whether the taxpayer’s business generated income or profits during the tax year.
