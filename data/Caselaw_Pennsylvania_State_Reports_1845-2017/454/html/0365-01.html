After trial by jury, in which appellant contended that he was intoxicated and/or insane at the time of the killings, a verdict of murder in the first degree on both indictments was returned. The court en banc dismissed motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment and a life sentence on each indictment was imposed to run concurrently. Appellant how appeals to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.8",478,[193,911,1151,754]]]'>During the course of the trial appellant took the stand and on cross-examination was questioned as follows by the prosecutor: “Q. Besides that gun, have you ever made it a practice to carry any other kind of weapon? Me. Perillo: Objection, Your Honor. It has not been established he carried this weapon. The Couet: Overruled. The Witness: No, sir. Q. Did you ever carry a straight razor? A. What was the question? Q. Did you ever carry a straight razor? A. Not as I remember. Q. Do you recall one day when a razor dropped out of your pocket when you were visiting Jacqueline, and she asked you what you had it for? Me. Perillo : Objection. The Court : Overruled. The Witness : I do not recall such a thing.”</p>

The Act specifically provides that the intent may be inferred from the fact that the weapon was being carried. See Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §416, as amended July 30, 1968, P. L. 689, No. 227, §1, 18 P.S. 4416(a); <em>Commonwealth v. Townsend, </em><a href="/pa-super/211/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="211 Pa.

From the questioning by the prosecutor the jury could infer criminal conduct by the appellant on a prior occasion “tending to show that he has committed” an offense other than the crimes charged and the indictments for which he was being tried. As we have consistently held, the Act of 1911 must be adhered to “to the letter”. See <em>Commonwealth v. Barron, supra </em>at p. 261; <em>Commonwealth v. Davis, supra. </em>Restated, “a juror could reasonably infer . . . that the accused had engaged in prior criminal activity.” <em>Commonwealth v.

We cannot agree with this contention. <em>Commonwealth v.

See also 3A Wigmore on Evidence, §980a (Rev. Third Ed., 1970) and American Law Institute, Model Code of Evidence, Rule 306 (1942). We, therefore, must reverse the judgment of sentence and award a new trial.
