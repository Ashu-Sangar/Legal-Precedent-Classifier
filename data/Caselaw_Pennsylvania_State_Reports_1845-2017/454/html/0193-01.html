Ottenstedn, two of the appellees, negotiated an agreement with the United States Government, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, in which the Tower Corporation conveyed certain land to the government and agreed to abandon construction of an observation tower near the Gettysburg Battlefield, at an area found objectionable to the Park Service, in exchange for the government’s cooperation and permission to build the tower in another area near the battlefield. The Tower Corporation also agreed to es-ta,Wish a charitable foundation to support the Park Service’s activities at Gettysburg and at the Eisenhower Farm Historical Sight, and to construct the tower in accordance with certain specifications, with the height of the tower to be limited to 307 feet. The Park Service also conveyed a right of way for limited access to the proposed observation tower sight.</p>

On July 20, 1971, the Commonwealth brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Adams County, to enjoin construction of the proposed 307-feet tower, alleging that the proposed construction was a “despoliation of the natural and historic environment,” because, in the words of one critic: “The tower as proposed . . . would disrupt the skyline, dominate the setting from many angles, and still further erode the natural beauty and setting which <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>once was marked by the awful conflict of a brother’s war.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellees, on the other hand, produced experts who found the geometric form of the tower to be aesthetically pleasing and its design, while unobtrusive, to be of great educational value because it would provide “the full sweep or overview of a landscape where a significant event in American history took place,”</p>

In order to reach the ultimate issue, the chancellor first found to be without merit the defense interposed by appellees that Article 1, §27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution—upon which the Commonwealth relied for the authority of the Attorney General to bring this suit—was not self-executing and, therefore, legislative authority was required before the suit could be brought.</p>

However, President Judge Bowman filed a concurring opinion in which he stated he believed that it was not necessary to reach the difficult question of whether <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>the amendment was self-executing and Judge Men gee filed a concurring and dissenting opinion in which he dissented from the majority’s holding that Article 1, §27 was self-executing.

The plans for the tower have, however, been approved for safety by the Department of Labor and Industry of the Commonwealth. By familiar principles, the appellees, as the owners of the site, may use their property as they please, provided they do not interfere with their neighbors’ reasonable enjoyment of their properties and subject to reasonable regulations for the public good imposed under the police power of the State, of which there are none here. This right derives from Article I, Sections 1 and 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.”</p>

Rather, authority for the Commonwealth’s suit is allegedly based entirely upon Article 1, §27 of the State Constitution, ratified by the voters of Pennsylvania on May 18, 1971, which reads as follows: “The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania’s public natural resources are the common <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>property of all the people, including generations yet to come.

'A Constitution is primarily a declaration of principles of the fundamental law. Its provisions are usually only commands to the legislature to enact laAvs to carry out the purposes of the framers of the Constitution, or mere restrictions upon the power of the legislature to pass laws, yet it is entirely within the power of those who establish and adopt the Constitution to make any of its provisions self-executing.’ 6 R.C.L., section 52, p. 57.</p>

The reason is that, while the purpose may be to establish rights or to impose duties, they do not in and of themselves constitute a sufficient rule by means of which such right <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>may be protected or such duty enforced. In such cases, before the constitutional provision can be made effectual, supplemental legislation must be had; and the provision may be in its nature mandatory to the legislature to enact the needful legislation, though back of it there lies no authority to enforce the command. Sometimes the constitution in terms requires the legislature to enact laws on a particular subject; and here it is obvious that the requirement has only a moral force: the legislature ought to obey it; but the right intended to be given is only assured when the legislation is voluntarily enacted.’</p>

    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[195,931,1151,647]]]'>Unlike the first twenty-six sections of Article 1, §27, the one which concerns us in the instant case, does not merely contain a limitation on the powers of government. True, the first sentence of §27, which states: “The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment,” can be read as limiting the right of government to interfere with the people’s right to “clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the environment.” As such, the first part of §27, if read alone, could be read to be self-executing.</p>

These provisions declare that the Commonwealth is the “trustee” of Pennsylvania’s “public natural resources” and they give the Commonwealth the power to act to “conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all people.” Insofar as the Commonwealth always had a recognized police power to regulate the use of land, and thus could establish standards for clean air and clean water consistent with the requirements of public health, §27 is merely a general reaffirmation of past law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It must be recognized, however, that up until <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>now, aesthetic or historical considerations, by themselves, have not been considered sufficient to constitute a basis for the Commonwealth’s exercise of its police power.

Could you describe what you think the impact will be? A. Well, I think you have got to look at what is the battle of Gettysburg, and this is the high point of the Confederacy. It was a battle of human scale. It was not a cataclysmic type of Army or what you have today, so it is a human scale battle that a visitor can become involved in, and through the involvement can understand the tragedy and the pathos and the death and destruction that took place there. To put a tower 320 feet into this pastoral scene of human scale, a historical event, is just simply to destroy any relationship between the human dimension of this battlefield and this technological achievement of a tower. Q. Would it, in your opinion, be possible to measure the damage that would occur to this historic site if that tower were erected? A. Well, I don’t think that you can measure these things in a normal system of values that we articulate in terms of dollars and cents. You measure them more in terms of matters of integrity and understanding and inspiration and involvement. And from this standpoint I think a monstrous intrusion such as this tower is, into the historical, pastoral scene of that battlefield park and Eisenhower National Site and the National Cemetery and the place where Lincoln spoke, is just destructive of <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>the integrity of its historical value. Q. And you are saying you can’t put a price tag on those values? A. No, you can’t. There is one Yorktown and there is one Gettysburg, and these battlefields have great significance and to intrude this kind of monstrous structure into it is to destroy the whole environment of it.”</p>
