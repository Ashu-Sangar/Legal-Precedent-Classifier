Miller, pleaded guilty to murder generally, for the shooting death of Arthur James Ruth on the evening of October 16, 1948. The record is silent concerning the circumstances surrounding that plea. After a degree of guilt hearing before a three judge court, appellant was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. At the time of his plea and throughout the proceedings, Miller was represented by court-appointed counsel. No direct appeal was taken from the judgment of sentence.</p>

After an evidentiary hearing, Miller was granted the right to file post-trial motions nunc pro tunc, but the PCHA petition was denied in all other respects. The motion for a new trial was argued and was denied, but the PCHA petition was ordered listed for a new evidentiary hearing because the judge presiding at the first hearing died without making any findings. On November 9, 1972, a second hearing was held and the petition was denied.</p>

    <p id="b183-3" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[164,435,1149,534]]]'>Appellant argues that a defendant who enters a guilty plea in a pre-1968 silent record case is in a position similar to that of the defendant in <em>Anderson, </em>and that his appeal will likewise be meaningless without a record of the lower court proceedings. He contends, therefore, that the burden of proving the intelligence and voluntariness of a pre-1968 silent record guilty plea should lie with the Commonwealth, or alternatively that the Commonwealth should construct an equivalent picture of the proceedings below.

The overwhelming majority of all convictions result from guilty pleas. In a great many of these cases, inadequate on-the-record examinations were conducted. This would mean that countless cases would have to be retried if Boykin were applied retrospectively. We can only underscore the statement of Mr. Justice Stewart in Teban v. Shott: ‘To require all these States [which still permitted comment on the accused’s failure to take the stand when Griffin was decided] now to void the conviction of every person who did not testify at his trial would have an impact upon the administration of their criminal law so devastating as to need no elaboration.’ (382 U.S. at 419). We hold, therefore, that Boykin is to be applied only to cases tried after June 2, 1969.” Our reasoning in <em>West, Cushnie, McBride </em>and <em>Godfrey, supra, </em>was not undermined by <em>Anderson </em>and <em>DeSimone. See Commonwealth v. Woolcutt, </em><a href="/pa-super/221/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="221 Pa.

In <em>Anderson </em>and <em>DeSimone, </em>we focused on the acute problems involved in attempting <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>to reconstruct errors which might have occurred during the course of trial without notes of testimony. To require a defendant to base his appeal upon unrecorded trial errors is so great a burden as to virtually preclude a meaningful appeal. Accordingly, this Court saw fit to grant retroactive application.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We cannot say, however, that placing the burden of proof on appellant in this silent record pre-1968 guilty plea situation would deny him a meaningful appeal. The record indicates that when he acquired counsel, appellant changed his plea from not guilty to guilty. The intelligence and voluntariness of this silent record guilty plea involves questions which are peculiarly within the knowledge of appellant and his counsel, and which can only be reconstructed by them.</p>
