Due to their excessive consumption of alcohol, a minor altercation occurred and Payne left the premises. Shortly thereafter, appellant and a friend left for home, at which time they were confronted by Payne. Appellant was intimidated by Payne’s verbal threats and, hence, when Payne ultimately reached for a cooking fork, appellant retreated. At the same time, however, he grabbed a metal lug wrench or tire iron. Payne fled but appellant, with designs of his own, took to the offensive. He chased Payne 450 to 475 feet before overtaking bim and striking him several times on and about the skull with the tire iron. He succeeded in fracturing Payne’s skull, from which injuries Payne died.</p>
    <p id="b369-8" data-blocks='[["BL_369.12",369,[184,1985,1146,320]]]'>Appellant was indicted on counts of murder and voluntary manslaughter. On June 12, 1972, in open court while represented by counsel, appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally. The court heard testimony to determine the degree of guilt and concluded that appellant was guilty of second-degree murder.</p>

One week later, appellant was sentenced to a term of five to fifteen years’ imprisonment. A direct appeal was taken to this Court and the Public Defender of Allegheny County was appointed counsel for defendant. On August 29, 1972, the lower court rendered an opinion in which it considered the validity of appellant’s guilty plea, concluding that the plea was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently entered.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[187,865,1152,593]]]'>On October 3, 1972, we remanded appellant’s case to the lower court, ordering an evidentiary hearing to determine the voluntariness of the guilty plea, the waiver of post-trial motions and other matters relevant in this appeal. On November 2, 1972, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> alleging numerous infirmities in his conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The evidentiary hearing on the direct appeal was consolidated with the Post Conviction Hearing petition on appellant’s motion and a hearing was held on May 18, 1973.

He urges that he is now entitled either to withdraw that plea or to receive a sentence reduced to the terms of the bargain because the prosecutor’s promise was not kept. Appellant further maintains that this plea bargain had been withheld from the court in opposition to our directions in <em>Commonwealth v. Alvarado, </em><a href="/pa/442/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="442 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1935419" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0516-01">442 Pa. 516</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=276%20A.2d%20526" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="276 A.2d 526">276 A. 2d 526</a> (1971).</p>

Dickerson, </em><a href="/pa/449/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="449 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="1945620" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0070-01">449 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=295%20A.2d%20282" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="295 A.2d 282">295 A. 2d 282</a> (1972); <em>Commonwealth v.

No promise was made by the District Attorney and, in fact, Ms recommendation was for a greater sentence. While appellant argues that his guilty plea was induced by a belief that he would receive a sentence of two to ten years, he im<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>peached himself on this point by later asserting that the plea was motivated by a fear of spending the rest of his life in jail. And, finally, appellant unequivocally denied the existence of a promise by counsel or by the District Attorney when the lower court questioned him on his understanding of the significance and import of his plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[184,711,1153,1031]]]'>Appellant also argues that his guilty plea was not voluntarily entered when his testimony raised an issue of self-defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This argument is meritless. Assuming that appellant did raise a plausible self-defense claim, the testimony giving rise to that claim was not made contemporaneously with the entry of the guilty plea. <em>Commonwealth v.

We repeat what we said in <em>Thomas: </em>“The only statements which can be considered by the trial judge in determining whether to accept a guilty plea are those made at the time the plea is entered.” <a href="/pa/450/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="450 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1947053" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0548-01">450 Pa. at 553</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20359" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="301 A.2d 359">301 A. 2d at 363</a>. The statements which appellant urges establish self-defense were made at the degree-of-guilt hearing subsequent to the entry of his plea. Furthermore, when the sentencing judge asked if appellant was claiming self-defense at that point, he was assured by counsel that the questioned testimony was introduced only to mitigate the offense.</p>
