This appeal arises from an order of the Commonwealth Court sustaining the Commonwealth’s preliminary objections based on constitutional immunity, as found in Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and dismissing appellants’ complaint. We now affirm.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.8",146,[199,951,1155,490]]]'>Appellants make three contentions: the doctrine of sovereign immunity in Pennsylvania is judicially, and not constitutionally established; Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania constitutes a waiver of the Commonwealth’s immunity from tort liability; and the enactment of legislation authorizing the Department of Property and Supplies to purchase liability insurance constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity and consent to suit for tort liability.</p>

Thus, this is clearly an action against the Commonwealth. <em>See Biello v.

Likewise, here, the Department of Property and Supplies is, by statute, required to purchase liability insurance. As I emphasized in <em>Brown, </em>“there is no rational reason why the majority could not and should not now judicially abrogate the doctrine of sovereign immunity in toto, or at the least, refuse to apply it, where, as here, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth has obtained liability insurance (at the command of the Legislature) to compensate those injured through the fault of its agents.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

      <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>I also take this opportunity to note that another state supreme court has acted to abolish the antiquated doctrine of sovereign immunity. In <em>Board of Commissioners v. Splendour Shipping &amp; Enterprises Co., <a href="/so2d/273/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="273 So. 2d 19" data-case-ids="9725337" data-case-paths="/so2d/273/0019-01">273 </a></em><a href="/so2d/273/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="273 So. 2d 19" data-case-ids="9725337" data-case-paths="/so2d/273/0019-01">So. 2d 19</a> (La. 1973), the Supreme Court of Louisiana judicially abrogated that state’s long-standing rule of sovereign immunity for state agencies. That case is particularly relevant to the majority’s theory that “ ‘Article I, Section 11 of our Constitution compels the conclusion that this Commonwealth’s immunity is constitutionally, not judicially mandated for the Louisiana court acted in the face of a constitutional provision substantially identical to our own.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

Const. art. I, §6. Having thus found the state constitution inconclusive, that court continued: “Considering the source of the doctrine in its history, there are three reasons which move us to withdraw from the Board the immunity with which the court has previously insulated it from tort suits. It is unfair. It tends toward governmental irresponsibility. It is an unnecessary exception to the policy of the State of Louisiana as expressed in . . . our Constitution.” <a href="/so2d/273/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="273 So. 2d 19" data-case-ids="9725337" data-case-paths="/so2d/273/0019-01">273 So. 2d at 25</a>.</p>
    <p id="b149-3" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[171,864,1146,202]]]'>The same analysis applies to our own constitution. Article I, Section 11 considered in its entirety presents an inconsistency remarkably similar to that in the Louisiana Constitution.</p>
