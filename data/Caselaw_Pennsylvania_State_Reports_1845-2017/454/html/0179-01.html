Further, I believe that the language of the Constitution itself fails to provide any basis for the majority’s assumption that in Pennsylvania this immunity is constitutionally mandated. Neither within the present Constitution of this Commonwealth nor any of its predecessors can there be found an expressed grant of immunity from suit. To the contrary, Article I, Section 11 merely sets forth the mechanism by which the State may waive <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>this power.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> It provides that: “Suits may be brought against the Commonwealth in such manner in such courts and in such cases as the legislature may by law direct.” The Constitution is therefore neutral—it neither requires nor prohibits sovereign immunity. It merely provides that the presence or absence of sovereign immunity shall be decided in a non-constitutional manner.

In my judgment it is an u/nwa/rranted conclusion to assume from the grant of the power of consent to the legislative branch that this was implicitly an abrogation of the court’s traditional powers to abolish common law principles when they no longer meet the needs of the time.</em>
