On November 5, a Detective Barbush of the city police interviewed the appellant at the school which <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>employed Ms mother and appellant maintained that he had left Miss Heifer in front of her apartment early on the morning of November A He expressed a desire to aid the investigation to discover her whereabouts.</p>

At about 12:30 p.m. that afternoon, Detective Barbush, accompanied by two Pennsylvania State Troopers, went to appellant’s residence. They advised him that he had a right to obtain counsel and to have counsel present and that he did not have to make any statements, as such statements could later be used against him. They requested appellant to follow them to City Hall in his car, and appellant did so, accompanied by one of the State Troopers. They arrived at City Hall about 1:10 p.m. and, after brief interviews at wMch appellant was again given the warnings noted above, it was determined that he should take a polygraph test. At 2:35 p.m., the appellant accompanied by two city detectives and two State Troopers, went to the State Police office in Harrisburg so that a State Police polygraph expert, Lieutenant Murray, could administer that test.</p>

At this time, appellant steadfastly maintained that: He had driven to the lake with the deceased and an argument had developed; the deceased had left the car, and appellant, being unable to find her, had driven back to Harrisburg. Subsequently, he became concerned and returned to the lake where he had discovered her body.</p>

      <em>Miranda </em>clearly holds that, before an accused is subjected to custodial interrogation: “In order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent of Ms rights <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>under this system then, it is necessary to warn him not only that he has the right to consult with an attorney, but also that if he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.” 384 U.S. at 473.</p>

[T]he custody requirement of Miranda does not depend on the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer-interrogator, but upon whether the suspect is physically deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way or is <em>placed, m a situation in which he rear sonably believes that his freedom of action or movement is restricted by such interrogation. . </em>.’ ”. After four hours of interrogation afc the police station, appellant could not reasonably have believed that his freedom remained unfettered. Under the circumstances of this case we must conclude that a reasonable man in appellant’s situation would have clearly perceived the restraint upon his freedom. It is equally as clear that at this point in time the police investigation had focused upon appellant. See, <em>Commonwealth v. D’Nicuola, </em><a href="/pa/448/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="448 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1944721" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0054-01">448 Pa. 54</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20333" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="292 A.2d 333">292 A. 2d 333</a> (1972).

It was known that he was having an affair with Miss Keifer, and that he feared that she was pregnant. Moreover, on a previous occasion appellant had stabbed his wife in a fit of rage. These facts, taken together with the fact that appellant was the last person known to have seen the victim alive supplied more than sufficient reason to cause the police to focus their attention upon the appellant.</p>

      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>The Commonwealth argues, alternatively, that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation indicates that the omitted warning was unnecessary. As this Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Yount, </em><a href="/pa/435/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="435 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1924349" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0276-01">435 Pa. 276</a>, 280, <a href="/citations/?q=256%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="256 A.2d 469">256 A. 2d 469</a> (1969), cert. denied, <a href="/us/397/0925-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="397 U.S. 925" data-case-ids="12070369,12070440,12070536,12070625,12070729" data-case-paths="/us/397/0925-01,/us/397/0925-02,/us/397/0925-03,/us/397/0925-04,/us/397/0925-05">397 U.S. 925</a>: “While a warning that the indigent may have counsel appointed need not be given to the person who is known to have an attorney or is known to have ample funds to secure one, <em>the expedient of giving a warning is too simple and the rights involved too important to engage in ex post facto inquiries into financial ability when there is any doubt at all on that score. </em>384 U.S. at 473, n. 43, 86 S. Ct. at 1627, n. 43. We recently held in Commonwealth v. Dixon and Kontos, supra, that this loophole is a narrow one which can be utilized only in the clearest of cases. 432 Pa. at 426-27, 248 A. 2d at 233.” (Emphasis in text) See also, <em>Commonwealth v. Sites, </em>supra. This case does not fall within that “narrow loophole”. The appellant at the time of the interrogation was twenty years old and was unemployed. He had previously held sporadic employment as a gas station attendant. It is true that appellant’s parents had provided legal services when he faced other criminal charges, however, absent an affirmative indication that appellant was confident of such resources at the time of this interrogation, we cannot say with any degree of certainty that the fourth warning was unnecessary.</p>

The Commonwealth has referred to several statements made by the appellant during the time of the interrogation to support their argument of waiver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The decisive is<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>sue in this area is not a question of a waiver of the warnings hut whether or not the prisoner possessed sufficient knowledge which would enable him to voluntarily and intelligently waive his rights to counsel and his rights against self-incrimination. Thus <em>Miranda </em>announced a prophylactic rule to assure the quantum of knowledge necessary before a valid waiver can take place. Where the <em>Miranda </em>warnings are admittedly inadequate a waiver is necessarily ineffective unless the record is eminently clear that the information was known to the prisoner from some other source. No concept of a waiver of warnings can supply the deficiency, nor are we willing to accept braggadocio as a substitute for an actual finding of an awareness of the elements necessary to make a legally effective waiver.</p>
