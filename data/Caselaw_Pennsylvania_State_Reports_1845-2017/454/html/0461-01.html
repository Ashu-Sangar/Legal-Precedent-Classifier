Porter <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>and Katherine E. Porter, his wife [condemnees], for the taking of property located in Butler County. On March 11, 1963 the Commonwealth of Pa., Dept, of Highways [now Dept, of Transportation] condemned, for the construction of a limited access highway, approximately 11 acres of a 46 acre tract owned by the Porters. Five months before the condemnation, on October 13, 1962, appellant entered into a mineral lease with the Porters, giving him the right to remove and process all of the limestone, coal and clay under the Porter property for a term of 5 years—renewable for another five years if the Porters agreed. The lease required, among other things, that appellant pay the Porters $25.00 per month from the date of execution, $10,000 before entry on the land, $.05 per ton for all limestone removed and $.01 per ton for the right to haul across the Porter property. Appellant also owned leased mineral interests in four contiguous tracts owned by different persons and also condemned. On one of these adjacent tracts appellant operated a limestone processing plant. These five mineral interests—created by separate leases—were used by appellant in the integrated operations of mining, processing and marketing limestone. Appellant’s operation began in 1953.</p>

A viewer’s hearing was held and their report was filed June 29, 1964. The viewers determined that the property had been damaged to the extent of $16,000 including compensation for delay in payment: $14,000 to the Porters and $2,000 to appellant. Appellant in his appeal from the viewer’s determination sought to consolidate, in the eminent domain proceeding which involved only the Porter property, the claims for damages to his interests in all of the five condemned properties. The lower court rejected this approach. In affirming the lower court’s decision we held that it was not a denial of due process to refuse to <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>consolidate appellant’s claims in one condemnation action since lie might attempt to prove in each view proceeding the value of his interest in the property by showing the value resulting from the integrated use. <em>Porter v.

The conflicting testimony with respect to damages was as follows: the testimony of Mr. Porter and his two witnesses ranged between $67,000 to $143,000 as to his damages; appellant’s witness testified that appellant’s damages were $112,000; and the Commonwealth’s two witnesses ranged between $6,000 to $7,400 in damages for both interests combined. A verdict in favor of the condemnees was rendered in the amount of $34,000 without delay compensation: $27,000 to the Porters, and $7,000 to appellant. The trial court molded the verdict in favor of appellant by awarding delay compensation in the sum of $1,773.31. Motions for a new trial were filed by all parties but denied by the lower court.

In order to be admissible the trial court must decide whether the sale is “judicially comparable.” <em>Commonwealth v. 108.3 Acres of Land, </em><a href="/pa/431/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="431 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1917420" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0341-01">431 Pa. 341</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20124" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="244 A.2d 124">244 A. 2d 124</a> (1968).

Even though some of these sales resulted in the properties becoming part of an integrated limestone operation they stood alone at the time of their sale. In comparison to the Porter tract not one of them was part of an assemblage of tracts, all of which were known to have substantial marketable limestone deposits and accessible, through <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>hauling rights, to a contiguous tract on which an operating limestone crushing plant was located. Thus, the value of the properties which were the subject of the Commonwealth’s comparable sales could not have been enhanced from being part of an integrated operation.</p>
    <p id="b579-3" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[167,545,1150,809]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that it is impossible to find a sufficient number of sales of property which were part of an integrated operation at the time of their sale to serve as a comparable guideline since an owner of an integrated operation would not sell one of his tracts unless it was no longer crucial to the operation. It concludes that its alleged comparable sales were the only rational approach to value in this case. We disagree. Even assuming that there are no comparable sales available, the market value might be established by the testimony of persons acquainted with the lands, and whose knowledge and experience qualifies them to form an intelligent judgment as to its proper valuation. <em>See Glen Alden Coal Co. v.

When asked whether he knew if there was limestone underneath a particular property one of the Commonwealth’s valuation witnesses stated, “It’s generally known in this particular area there is limestone in this general area.” The same witness admitted that as to one of the other properties he did not know whether at the time of the sale the seller knew whether or not there was limestone under the property. Neither of the Commonwealth’s valuation witnesses testified as to what part of the allegedly comparable properties contained limestone nor compared the quality recoverable from these properties to that recoverable from the Porter tract.

In our view a foundation of comparability “is especially important in a case such as this where valuable mineral rights are included in the land condemned.” Id. at 293, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20444" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="247 A.2d 444">247 A. 2d at 451</a>.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[195,877,1156,1071]]]'>Appellant’s second argument is that it was error for the trial court to allow the Commonwealth’s geologist to testify that the total amount of limestone, of a thickness in excess of 15 feet, in Butler County was 13,300,-000,000 tons. We are not persuaded by the Commonwealth’s contention that these figures were admissible to support its allegedly comparable sales prices and to show that appellant’s mineral lease agreement was not unique. This evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial since much of the reserves could not be integrated into a limestone operation. The record discloses that this figure included all of the limestone in the county of that thickness, whether it had one foot or 120 feet or more of overburden. It also included all the limestone under the City of Butler and towns in Butler County, and under all roads, buildings, houses, railroads, and factories in the County. Moreover, there was no evidence as to how far from the assemblage the limestone was located and whether any of it was under other contiguous tracts.</p>

This evidence was offered in response to the Commonwealth’s valuation witnesses’ <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>testimony that the mineral lease was worth $50.00 to the Porters and worth almost nothing to appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The lower court erred in denying appellant’s motions to admit this rebuttal evidence to show that there was some value in the property interests of both the Porters and appellant and to impeach the testimony of the Commonwealth’s witnesses. Since the latters’ testimony was an attempt to totally discredit appellant’s case, appellant had a right to introduce evidence to meet it. <em>Schoen v.

Any error in not requiring the Commonwealth’s witnesses to testify separately as to any value assigned to appellant’s interest was cured when appellant, on cross-examination of these witnesses, elicited testimony that in their opinion his interest had no value. We need not determine whether the “bonus value” approach is applicable in this type of situation since the record fails to disclose whether the Commonwealth’s witnesses relied on this theory to arrive at their damage figure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The testimony as to sales of properties comparable to the Porter property was relevant to both of these issues and therefore clearly admissible in this trial.” <em>Sechan Limestone v.
