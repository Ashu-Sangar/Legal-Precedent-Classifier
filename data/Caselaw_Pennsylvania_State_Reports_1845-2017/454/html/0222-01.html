Following a degree of guilt hearing, he was convicted of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to life imprisonment. No post-trial motions were filed and no appeal was taken. In 1968, the appellant filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition. Relief was denied on June 26, 1969. On appeal to this Court, the case was remanded pursuant to a per curiam order dated April 22, 1970, and the appellant was granted the opportunity to file post-trial <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>motions. Post-trial motions were denied and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[186,431,1155,1079]]]'>In this appeal, the appellant claims that: (1) Ms guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently made because it was based (a) on an illegally obtained confession and (b) on the improper advice of counsel. (2) he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during Ms degree of guilt hearing. We have reviewed the appellant’s claims and conclude they are without merit. Appellant’s guilty plea was entered knowingly and intelligently. <em>Commonwealth v.

We have considered the totality of the circumstances surrounding the appellant’s confession and conclude that the confession was made voluntarily. <em>Commonwealth v.
