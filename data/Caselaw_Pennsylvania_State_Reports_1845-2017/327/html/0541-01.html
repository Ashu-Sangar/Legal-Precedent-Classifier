Seminuk and his wife Mary lived in Warren County, Pa. He operated a filling station called the “Air Port Inn” on United States Highway Route No. 6, between Youngsville and Pittsfield and he also conducted there a small grocery store, and sold tobacco and beverages and maintained a room for dancing. About 12:15 a. m. on March 27, 1936, Seminuk, while standing on the driveway beside his gasoline pump, was shot through the heart, dying almost instantly. He was shot four times. On March 31, 1936, <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>Senauskas was arrested by the State Police. At the barracks he admitted complicity in the shooting and showed the officers where the revolver was hidden. On April 5, 1936, he made a complete confession in writing. His fingerprints were found on glasses and beer bottles used by him shortly before the shooting at the Air Port Inn. At the time of the homicide his age was 18 years, four months and six days.</p>

A little later Polens told him whom he wanted killed and why. Polens said he wanted the man killed because he, Polens, had lost possession of a farm through this man, and also because he had “defamed him and put the needles to him,” as a result of which Polens, so he claimed, was unable to get a job.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A few days later Polens came to see appellant and the latter told him that he had already gotten in touch with the men in Cleveland and that “they would come and do it” but that they wanted part payment first. Polens then gave appellant $50, but, before doing so, he took him to the Air Port Inn and pointed out Seminuk. On March 26, 1936, Polens drove the defendant to Corry to take an automobile operator’s test for a license. Polens then suggested to Senauskas that they get a car for the latter “to do the job.” They went to Buffalo and rented an automobile. On their return they stopped near Youngsville and Po-lens produced a revolver and they each “shot into the woods just to see how the gun worked.” They then went to Youngsville where Polens bought a half pint of whis<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>key and gave it to Senauskas. He also gave appellant seventeen dollars “to take the car back with and pay for the use of the car” after the designated victim at the Air Port Inn had been killed. Senauskas said that Po-lens told him “to give him about an hour’s time” to get far enough away so that he could have an alibi. Senauskas states that he finished his half pint of whiskey and then went to the Air Port Inn and asked for “John” which was the name by which Polens had designated Seminuk. He was told that “John” was not there. He then left and went to Corry Avhere he drank whiskey and beer. Defendant later went to the Garland Inn and reported to Polens that he had been to the Air Port Inn and that the fellOAV was not there. Polens told him to “hang around” as the man would be there. He said he drove past the Air Port Inn and then turned around. He stated that the next thing he remembered was when he awoke about 9 a. m., on March 27, 1936. He got into the automobile and went to Garland and made inquiries at Garland as to where Polens lived. The man to whom he made inquiries asked if he, the defendant, was from Warren, remarking that he thought perhaps he had come down to tell Polens “about the shooting they had at the Air Port Inn.” This man said that someone had shot a man by the name of Metro. Then defendant stated in his confession: “I got scared and figured I shot the wrong man as the man I was to shoot I knew him as John.” He later met Polens, who gave him $30, and assured him that “Metro and John were the same.” Po-lens later handed Senauskas $120 and told him to leave this part of the country.</p>

He entered a plea of “not guilty.” He was represented by Attorney Earle V. MacDonald, now deceased, who had been appointed counsel by the court. On June 2 five jurors had been selected and on the following morning the defendant in open court asked leave to withdraw his plea of “not guilty” and enter a plea of “guilty.” This <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>was granted and tlie plea entered.

    <p id="b597-3" data-blocks='[["BL_597.4",597,[128,501,1152,1078]]]'>A hearing was held on June 10th. Defendant’s confession and other evidence were received. The presence of Senauskas at the place of the homicide on March 26, 1936, was established by a witness who had talked with him at that place and had left at about 12 o’clock p. m. When the witness reached a point about 150 feet from the Inn, he saw the deceased and Senauskas come out of the door and walk around back of the car. He said the defendant got into the car and that he heard the deceased say, “She is full now,” and then he saw him take the gasoline hose, walk behind the car, and hang it up on the pump. The deceased then walked to the left-hand side of the car, and immediately the witness heard “three or four shots in rapid succession and a scream at the same time.” Immediately “the car started out very fast, traveling west without any lights.” The witness ran back to the Inn and saw Seminuk lying alongside the driveway. He said: “He looked as though he was dead.” Another witness also saw the defendant at the Air Port Inn.</p>

No reason of any kind was assigned to support this request. On June 26, 1936, the day before this motion was presented to Judge Arird, Attorney MacDonald presented a petition in the Supreme Court asking leave to withdraw the plea of guilty and for the appointment of another judge to hear the motion for a “new trial.” This petition was supported <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>by affidavits to the effect that the guilty plea had been “coerced” in that it was made in response to a promise by Judge Arird that the death penalty would not be imposed. The filing of this petition and the allegations it contained were not made known to Judge Arird, but he learned of it later from the public press.</p>

On August 28, 1936, Attorney MacDonald died, and, on October 6 next, Judge Brownson appointed Attorney Harold S. Hampson counsel for Senauskas.</p>

I have also talked with the Sheriff and the Warden. Nothing wrong with Senauskas except he was a little nervous.” It is important to note that the conversations the judge had with these men related <em>to the mental condition </em>of Senauskas, a matter not then nor theretofore raised by appellant or his counsel. The judge’s talk with these officers was on a fact not in issue. Therefore, the judgment of guilty of murder in the first degree could not have been based in any measure on any such conversations. The second assignment of error is therefore without merit and is overruled.</p>

At the outset he cites the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 759, providing, inter alia, as follows: . .In cases of pleas of guilty, the court, where it determines the crime to be murder of the first degree, shall, at its discretion, impose sentence of death or imprisonment for life.” The court then proceeded to review the facts of this case as revealed by defendant’s confession and by witnesses. In the course of his opinion, the Judge said: “Senauskas used a deadly weapon against a vital part of the body, i. e., a shot passed through the heart of Semi<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>nuk. Under such circumstances we have a right to presume that malice and intention existed. Senauskas not only had ample time while sitting in this Inn to deliberate and premeditate, but under his own statements the arrangements between him and Polens had been going on for several days, if not weeks.” The conclusion of the court states that “after the examination of witnesses and hearing had in due form of law . . . it is adjudged and determined that the crime and the degree of the crime whereof the said Joe Senauskas ... is convicted by his own plea of guilty and his confession and testimony taken, is murder in the first degree.” The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>

In that case the Supreme Court, in an opinion by <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>Chief Justice Paxson, said: “As no sentence was possible but that of death we think there was no omission.” It is true that now when a man is adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree, there remains a choice of <em>two possible </em>sentences to be imposed, these being either death or life imprisonment. However, even under the law as it <em>now </em>stands, we think that when a defendant convicted of murder in the first degree is addressed as was the prisoner in the case at bar, the omission of the words “of death” does not constitute reversible error.</p>
    <p id="b601-3" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[158,922,1152,1304]]]'>The rule of the common law as to the right of the prisoner to be asked whether he had anything to say why judgment should not be awarded against him or, to put it another way, why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him, does not now possess the inflexibility it did in an earlier day. At common law the rule served a purpose that could not be served in any other way. It gave a prisoner in a capital case “an opportunity to allege any ground of arrest, or to plead a pardon, if he had obtained one, or to urge any other legal objection to further proceedings against him”: <em>Schwab v. Berggren, </em><a href="/us/143/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="143 U.S. 442" data-case-ids="6140185" data-case-paths="/us/143/0442-01">143 U. S. 442</a>, 446. Putting this question to the prisoner gave him his last opportunity to speak to some one with power to save him from his impending doom. To deprive him of this last opportunity was a serious invasion of his rights, for at common law the defendant in cases of felony was not accorded the privilege of counsel nor could he take any appeal to a higher court. A sentence of death in Pennsylvania has no such irrevocability about it as it had at common law. Anything Senauskas could have said before sentence was imposed, he could by himself or his counsel have said since with equal effect, either to Judge Arird, Judge Brown-son, or to this court.</p>

It originated at a time when prisoners were not allowed the benefit of counsel, and when the court was counsel for the prisoner, so far as to see that he was deprived of no legal right. Besides, the benefit of clergy was also allowed; and at this stage it was claimed.” The ruling in that case was upheld in <em>Steel v.

In the instant case, as President Judge Brownson found, the evidence negatives the existence of any improper conduct on the part of the presiding judge. A host of witnesses supported Judge Ariro’s assertion that no promise had been made. Indeed, defendant had indicated before the trial that he intended to plead guilty and trust to the leniency of the court. ... If defendant is aggrieved by the action of the Court . . ., the imposition of the death penalty, the overruling of the motion for a new trial or any other matter, order, decree or judgment, he may take an appeal to this court, the only procedure by which this entire record may be removed here and considered.

Will you give me the same consideration as you do Mr. MacDonald?” The judge replied, according to Mr. Cohen: “I will give you every consideration; of course, I will give you the consideration I will give Mr. MacDonald or anybody else that comes into this court.” Attorney Cohen admitted on cross-examination that Judge Arird made him no promises.</p>

L. Cohen, Esq., who represented John G. Polens.”</p>

The attorney stated that he Avas nervous and wanted the judge to tell him how to proceed with the case. This the judge refused to do. The attorney then said that his client was “clearly guilty” and that he intended to advise him to plead guilty. To this Judge Arird replied that Mr. MacDonald should use his own judgment. “There was no other discussion of any kind.” Nothing was said as' to the sentence to be imposed. Court was then opened and defendant and his counsel came to the bar. Leave was asked to withdraw the plea of not guilty and to enter a <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>plea of guilty. The court asked the appellant if he desired to withdraw his plea and enter a plea of guilty “and the defendant himself replied in the affirmative.”</p>

    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[252,793,1146,207]]]'>The eighth assignment is based upon the alleged error of Judge Brownson in receiving testimony that the defendant, previous to trial, had expressed an intention to plead guilty. This assignment is overruled.</p>
    <p id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[250,1011,1147,207]]]'>The ninth assignment of error is based on the alleged error of the court below in approving the appointment of L. B. Schofield, Esq., as Assistant District Attorney. This assignment requires no discussion and is overruled.</p>

That official expressed his opinion as follows: “If such an objection was raised it would be brushed aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal because manifestly any substantial point which could be put by a prisoner in the Court of the first instance, could also be put by him on appeal, but of course I speak under correction.”</p>
