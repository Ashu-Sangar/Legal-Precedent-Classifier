The original lease agreement, executed on May 17, 1899, was between the Hazleton Coal Company as lessor and the Cross Creek Coal Company as lessee. This lease supplanted an earlier one made in 1882, containing a clause relating to taxes identical with that forming part of the lease in suit. By the lease of 1899, which here concerns us, the Hazleton Company demised to the Cross Creek Company all the coal in veins beneath property known as the Beaver Meadow Lands, together with the right to mine and market the same until “all the merchantable and minable coal is exhausted.” Certain surface rights were also conveyed to the lessee; others were retained by the lessor. The lease provided further that the lessee should pay in addition to royalties all taxes and assessments on the fixtures and improvements erected <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>on the premises and used by the lessee, on the personal property connected therewith, and on the product of the mines.

The clause in the lease dealing with payment of royalties reads: “The tonnage mined from the lands of the Lessor shall bear the same proportion to the tonnage mined from the lands of the Tench Coxe Estate which are worked in common with this property, as the coal contents of the respective properties bear to each other, and for the purposes of this lease, it is hereby agreed that the said proportion shall be as three tons of coal of the Hazleton Coal Company to two tons of coal of the Cross Creek Coal Company, upon which basis the said Lessee hereby agrees to pay, whether the proportion as herein fixed or as hereafter adjusted shall be actually mined out and removed or not, whenever and as long as coal is being mined from lands of the Tench Coxe Estate worked in common with the demised premises; and it is distinctly agreed by and between the parties hereto that the said proportion shall be adjusted from time to time to meet <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>the actual circumstances of the case, if either party to this lease shall request such adjustment.

As pointed out above, from 1906, the year following the establishment of common control over both companies, the taxes were paid by plaintiff and it was reimbursed for the same each year until 1930, a period of nearly a quarter of a century. During this period, and in 1930 and 1931, no complaint as to this practice was filed by defendant with plaintiff and no request for a change in the method of assessment was made.

The only reservation in respect to the quantity to be mined was a stipulation that the lessor reserved the right to direct how much coal should remain under the surface for the support thereof and the manner of mining thereunder — necessary measures of safety for the protection of surface rights, which under the lease the lessor retained, and negligible for determination of the question of whether the parties contemplated a sale of the coal. Under the conveyance, denominated a lease, a severance of the respective interests in the land conveyed and retained was effected, and the obligation to pay taxes on the unmined coal, which was the subject of the conveyance, became prima facie that of the lessee as a matter of law: <em>Millard, Exr., et al. v.

It is said there was no request for payment and no endeavor on plaintiff’s part to have the taxes assessed in defendant’s name, in order that a reduction in amount or some adjustment could be procured. Our decision in <em>Millard, Exr., et al. v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>supra, is cited as authority against the liability for reimbursement sought to be imposed here. We think the facts in the instant case make that case inapplicable here. For nearly a quarter of a century there was complete ac<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>quiescence by defendant in the tax liability averred by plaintiff. A practice with respect to discharge of this liability grew up between the parties, sanctioned by a long course of dealing which dispensed with notice to defendant and a request for payment. This is not to be minimized because another corporation controlled them both during this period, for it cannot be presumed, nor was it shown, that the parent company interfered in any manner with the rights <em>inter se </em>of the two subsidiaries. Common control indicates nothing, one way or another, as to the duty of plaintiff to give notice or request payment, but it does not detract from the effect of the course of dealing between the parties, from which may be inferred only that both of them acquiesced in and consented to the way in which taxes were paid under the lease agreement. Nor was it shown that payment under protest, if it could have been made, or notice to and demand on defendant would have resulted in any advantage to it.</p>

Also, the fact that lessors had, without objection, paid the taxes on the coal underlying for many years, does not justify the court in construing the lease contrary to its clear and unequivocal terms. . . .

But in the case at bar lessor paid them in tbe first instance; lessee owed them. Lessee reimbursed lessor. Thus custom followed for years the law in tbe case at bar. Tbe action here is between tbe party paying and tbe party owing. By tbe paying of tbe taxes tbe interests of both were protected. Tbe doing of that for tbe years 1930 and 1931, in tbe same manner as bad been done theretofore, made lessor no more responsible for protest than lessee, and lessee cannot be held to be a volunteer. . . . Where payment is made under compulsion, it is not voluntary. However, there is no need of compulsion where there is acquiescence. How can one be held to compel another to do something which be willingly does and which it is bis legal obligation to do? Tbe Lehigh Valley Coal Company, lessor in this case, did so in behalf of tbe lessee, with tbe knowledge of tbe lessee, thus recognizing upon tbe part of both the legal responsibility for tbe payment of tbe taxes thereof done through tbe agency of tbe lessor.”</p>

Tbe evidence showed that in 1899, when tbe lease took effect, tbe minable coal in tbe lands demised was approximately 6,300,000 tons and that in lands already operated by defendant about 4,500,000 tons. Hence, although tbe lease required a mining ratio of three-to-two, it was never quite practicable to maintain this ratio in coal production from tbe two tracts. Tbe claim for de<a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>ficieney is for the years from 1924 to 1930, inclusive, during none of which was the three-to-two mining ratio preserved; since 1924, in no year has as much coal been mined from the Lehigh Yalley lands, covered by the lease, as from the Coxe Estate lands, and in some years the former has been less than half the latter. To offset this, it was shown that in the majority of years from 1899 to 1930 the quantity mined from the Lehigh Valley lands was greatly in excess of the required ratio; in some years it was five times as much. If the aggregate tonnage mined from each tract is cumulated over the entire period from the beginning of the lease, we find that since 1900 the total amount of coal mined from the Lehigh Valley lands has always exceeded the ratio required by the lease. At the end of 1914 the ratio was 6.15 to 2. Since then it has gradually declined, so that at the end of 1930, even excluding the coal mined from the lands subleased to a third party, the ratio of total coal mined was 3.88 to 2; including the coal mined under the sublease, the ratio was 4.13 to 2. It was shown, and the learned trial judge found as a fact, that it was not commercially possible, as an operating problem, to mine three tons of coal from the Lehigh Yalley lands to every two taken from those of the Coxe Estate. As of the end of 1930, the total minable coal remaining in the former was only 1,344,000 tons, as against 2,248,000 in the latter.</p>
    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[260,1810,1150,578]]]'>It may be pointed out that the question of the alleged deficiency in tonnage mined from the leased lands was called to the attention of plaintiff’s president in 1926 by an official who was then comptroller of both parties to this suit. The former replied that while the rate of mining appeared not to have been in accordance with the lease, changed conditions would require a modification of its applicable provisions, upon request of either party, as stipulated in the lease. No adjustment of the ratio was made at that time, however, nor has since been made.</p>
    <p id="b85-2" data-blocks='[["BL_85.3",85,[148,355,1159,2058]]]'>
      <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>Plaintiff contends that the royalty provision in the lease meant that the mining ratio of three to two should apply to each separate annual period, since settlement in this respect, if required, was to be made every January. We do not so construe it. Nothing in the clause quoted requires such an interpretation, and to adopt it might work a substantial hardship to defendant. A time might be reached when defendant, having largely exceeded the required ratio in prior years, would find it impossible to mine in one year three tons of coal from the Lehigh Valley lands for every two taken from its other properties, and not having requested and obtained an adjustment, would be compelled to pay for coal which it could never thereafter profitably mine and thus be reimbursed for. Its only escape from such a dilemma would then be to curtail its operations on the Coxe Estate lands to the dimensions necessary to keep within the three-to-two ratio, and thus it might sustain a severe loss. The meaning contended for by defendant seems more in harmony with the intention of the parties and the practical situation with which they dealt in entering upon the lease. By this plaintiff loses nothing, for it has been paid annually for all the coal mined from its lands. In fact, since the required ratio has been exceeded in the aggregate down to the present, it has been paid even more rapidly than the parties contemplated would be the case. From the practical standpoint, all that the lessor was interested in securing was assurance that defendant would not mine its own lands to the prejudice of what the lessor might normally expect to receive as income from its own. This assurance it obtains by the construction which we here adopt. The provision for January settlements has no bearing, for this would be applicable to either of the two possible interpretations. Nor has the right to request adjustments from time to time any significance, for such adjustments might be necessitated by other considerations than the amount of minable coal remaining in either tract.</p>

      <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>The learned trial judge held an alternative view which is equally tenable. He held that, assuming the annual ratio to apply, the sublease, made in 1921 and subsequently assigned to plaintiff in 1925, whereby one-quarter of the minable coal in the leased lands was in effect retransferred to plaintiff as of the latter date, effected a waiver by plaintiff of the condition that, as to subsequent years, the three-to-two ratio should be preserved, and that thereafter defendant was excused from performance of this condition. This was clearly correct, if plaintiff’s interpretation of the ratio clause in the lease be granted. The intention of the original parties to the lease was, as it expressly states, to “preserve the proportions between the Hazleton Coal Company Coal and the Cross Creek Coal Company Coal,” which was designated for the purpose of the lease as that of three to two. This condition, upon which payment of royalties was based, could be excused by a new agreement between the parties impliedly dispensing with the condition: A. L. E. Eestatement of Contracts, see. 296. It obviously became impractical, as a commercial proposition, after defendant disposed of its mining rights over one-quarter of the leased coal, to continue to apply an annual ratio of three tons to two. This resulted from new contractual dealings between the parties to the lease.
