At the trial the facts were stipulated. The learned court below held that plaintiff was entitled to priority. Defendants appeal.</p>

It does not appear what the company was incorporated to do. It transacted some business in New York in circumstances in which it was required to comply with the Workmen’s Liability Insurance Law of that state. A part of plaintiff’s claim is for premiums on policies of insurance insuring the Easton company against liability to its workmen under the workmen’s <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>liability insurance laws of New York; on October 11, 1933, when reduced to judgment in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, that item was $5,984.69. The Easton company also transacted business in Pennsylvania and on another policy of Workmen’s Compensation Insurance, issued on Pennsylvania business, owes the plaintiff $179.85. The New York judgment included not only the premiums mentioned, but costs, and the sum of $142.63 owing on another account, making a total of $6,934.51. An exemplification of the judgment was entered in the Common Pleas of Northampton County to No. 345, July Term, 1935. No execution was issued.</p>
    <p id="b295-3" data-blocks='[["BL_295.4",295,[146,1060,1153,1077]]]'>By the New York Workmen’s Compensation Act, effective April 20, 1931, the premiums on the policies insuring New York workmen are preferred claims, the stipulation of facts including section 130 of that Act as follows : <em>“Section ISO. Workmen’s Compensation premiums shall he deemed preferred claims. </em>All premiums and interest charges on account of policies insuring employers against liability under this chapter which may be due to the state insurance fund, or any stock corporation or mutual association authorized to transact the business of insurance in this state, and all judgments recovered by the state insurance fund or any such insurance corporation or association against any employer on actions brought under any such policy, shall be deemed preferred claims in all insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, trustee proceedings for administration of estates and receiverships involving the employer liable therefor or the property of such employer, provided, however, that claims for wages shall receive prior preference in all such proceedings.”</p>

Thereafter the Easton company, by the parties named as defendants, “liquidated its assets and wound up its affairs, realizing a net balance of $45,026.59. . . . certain secured creditors and certain small unsecured creditors [were paid] in full [leaving] ... a balance sufficient to pay to the remaining general creditors a dividend of 9%% of the principal amount of their respective claims, with interest thereon to June 30,1934.” We understand that all the trust property was in this state, <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>that if the Easton company had any property in any other state it was brought here for the purposes of the trust.

By the deed of assignment the equitable ownership of the assigned property passes to the creditors. Each creditor owns such a proportional part of the whole as the debt due him bears to the aggregate of the indebtedness. The extent of the interest of a creditor is fixed by the deed of trust which also fixes the time to which the several claims must be referred for adjustment and not the date of the decree of distribution. The creditor having thus a fixed and vested interest as of the date of the assignment, it cannot be reduced to his prejudice by subsequent legislation, or otherwise, without interfering with a vested legal right. ...”</p>

Distribution must be made according to the law of this state. The New York statute providing that the insurance premiums “shall be deemed preferred claims” in the classes of proceedings specified is part of the remedial and not of the substantive law of that state. See <em>In re Inland Dredging Corp., </em><a href="/f2d/61/0765-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="61 F.2d 765" data-case-ids="911405" data-case-paths="/f2d/61/0765-01">61 F.

The mere fact that judgment was recovered in New York and in 1935 brought into this state after the distribution was made does not, for anything that appears in the record, affect the distribution. The New York statute, therefore, gives no right to priority in this proceeding.</p>
