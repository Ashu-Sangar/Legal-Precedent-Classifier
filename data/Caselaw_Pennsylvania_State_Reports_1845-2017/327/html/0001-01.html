      <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>Just what took place when the settlement was made was thus told by Mrs. Burgess. She testified that a representative of the insurance company named Watkins called to see her and told her that Cregar had asked him to come to see whether she would settle the case. She said that Watkins did not give his true name. She informed him that she could not settle the case as she had engaged Mr. Klauder as her attorney. To this Watkins replied, “That is what is wrong with you people, you run and get a lawyer before you stop to see Mr. Cregar.” She informed him that she had signed a power of attorney to Mr. Klauder and that he was to get half of what she would receive from the suit. At this interview she added she would not settle without seeing her attorney. Subsequently Watkins called again at her home and inquired whether she would accept a settlement. She told him she would not, as she had engaged Mr. Klauder as her attorney and signed a power of attorney to him. Watkins then stated to her that if she would settle out of court, the power of attorney she had signed with Mr. Klauder was not any good, “That I would not have to pay him if I would settle out of court.” After this statement, she told Watkins she would have to talk the matter over with her brother. This she did. Watkins, accompanied by another representative of the insurance company named Gunnigan, called upon her a third time, asked if she would make settlement and was told that she did not know what to do. They offered her $4,500 and her brother, who was present, replied, “Make it $5,000 and she will take it.” She acquiesced in this. To her inquiry as to what should be done about Mr. Klauder, they told her that she did not have to pay him if she settled out of court. She then particularly inquired of Gunnigan as to what she should do about Mr. Klauder and he said, “Never mind, we will take care of that.” She was also told by Watkins that she did not have to let Klauder know about the settlement and she did not inform him that it had been made. Previously she had <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>told Mm that there had been an offer of settlement. The settlement was effected by the insurance company drawing its check to Cregar and he drawing his check to plaintiff. Mrs. Burgess said she did not pay Mr. Klauder because she was told by the representative of the insurance company that she did not have to pay him.</p>
    <p id="b58-4" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[243,678,1158,1502]]]'>' It is argued by appellee that although the statement of claim avers that defendants had made settlement with the client for $5,000, there is no averment or proof that defendants had prevented her from paying or induced or persuaded her not to pay one-half of that sum to plaintiff, nor is any claim for one-half that sum made in the statement. While it is true it was not shown that defendants had prevented or directly induced Mrs. Burgess not to pay her attorney, the insurance company’s representatives effectively brought about this result, after being informed by her that she had agreed to pay him one-half of the recovery, by stating to her that the power of attorney was not any good and that she would not have to pay him if she settled out of court and that they would take care of him and that she did not have to inform him of the settlement. There can be no question that these statements brought about the breach of her contract with Mr. Klauder and resulted in his not being paid. While it is true there is no specific claim in the statement for the $2,500, there is a claim for the value of the contract to plaintiff and while that is fixed at an extravagant figure we think it sufficiently covers the sum which he was entitled to receive, one-half of the settlement: <em>Scranton Axle &amp; Spring Co. v.

      <em>Lurie v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>supra, where recovery was allowed, is very similar to the case at bar. There the suit was by an attorney-at-law against an insurance company for having wrongfully caused his client to repudiate his retainer. In the course of the opinion, it was said (p. 381) : “This attorney complains, not because his client cancelled his retainer, a right inherent in the contract and not constituting a breach, but because the client, falsely denying the existence of the contract, repudiated it and assumed that position by reason of the wrongful instigation of these defendants.” So we think it may be said on this record, that the client took the position that she would not pay plaintiff by reason of the wrongful instigation of the agents of the insurance company. This was done in order to effectuate the settlement which could not have been made at the figure it was, unless the lawyer’s fee was left out of account and therefore for the purpose of saving money for <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>the insurance company. <em>Hogue v.
