This requires a close scrutiny of the plaintiff’s conduct and a careful examination of the circumstances upon which the forfeiture is based. While it is true, as it was said in <em>Helme v. Phila. Life Ins.

In 1932 its treasurer informed Mrs. Proctor that as the mill was not in operation, the company <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>would have difficulty paying its rent on the due dates, but that it would pay as much as it could. He requested her indulgence, stating that when the property was rented the balance would be paid in full. Plaintiff avers that Mrs. Proctor assented to this proposal, stating it was “perfectly satisfactory” and “they would pay when they could.” However, the individual defendants deny that they assented to any changes in the provisions of the lease concerning the payment of the rent. They testified that the officers of plaintiff informed them that the company was without funds to pay future rentals, and threatened that the company might be forced to liquidate and to surrender the lease.</p>
    <p id="b481-3" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[158,1070,1154,1026]]]'>It appears from the record that the plaintiff for its own purposes, and for the benefit of its other creditors, deliberately permitted its default to continue, when it either had on deposit, or could have obtained, sufficient funds to pay the rent in full. It preferred to ignore the terms of the lease and to have the burden of carrying the property imposed upon these two elderly widows of modest means. Plaintiff not only paid as little rent as possible, but by appeals to friendship, as well as by misrepresentation of its cash position, endeavored to persuade the lessors to accept still less than it actually paid. Despite its pleas for leniency so made, the plaintiff now urges its ability to pay the rent at any time it was demanded in support of its contention that the forfeiture be set aside. While equity in a proper case will intervene to set aside the cancellation of a lease terminated for the non-payment of rent on the due date, relief against a forfeiture will not be decreed where the default was deliberately created.</p>

With this purpose in view they called upon <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>Mrs. Proctor during the summer of 1934 and discussed with her the advantage of selling jointly the premises to the Power Company discharged of the ninety-nine year lease, and the electric rights of the mill. It was suggested that a price of $46,000 he demanded. This sum had no relation to the value of the property, but it was the amount necessary to be raised by plaintiff to pay the $6,000 option price provided by the lease, and to settle the claims of its creditors. Mrs. Proctor, without accepting or rejecting the proposal, promised to confer with her sister. However, the plaintiff immediately informed the Power Company that it represented the “ownership and control of the property,” and the lease was about to be forfeited, and that the lowest price at which the property could be purchased was $46,000. The Power Company did not accept the offer, and negotiations between it and the plaintiff were protracted from July to September, 1934, when the conveyance of the property was made.</p>
    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[259,1371,1148,207]]]'>These instances, and others of the same character, are typical of the conduct of the plaintiff, which, in our opinion, was so inconsistent with good faith and fair dealing, as to preclude the equitable relief it now seeks.</p>
    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[253,1591,1152,807]],["BL_483.1",483,[133,343,1150,318]]]'>The plaintiff has failed to produce proofs to sustain its allegations that the lease was forfeited as a result of connivance among the defendants. There is nothing in the record to show that the plaintiff was lulled into a false security in order that a forfeiture of the lease might be made. On the contrary, as we have shown, the delinquency was created by the act of plaintiff alone, and had for its ulterior purpose the consummation of its plan to dispose of the property to the Power Company at an exorbitant price. When the property was conveyed to the Power Company, it was done, Mrs. Proctor testified, upon the exercise of the option held by it, and in accordance with the advice of her attorney and Mrs. Loomis’ son, whom she had consulted, after her last discussion with the officers of the plaintiff company. It <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>seems to us that the defendants proceeded strictly within the provisions of the lease in the declaration of the forfeiture. The lease is the measure of the rights of the parties, and the termination thereof for non-payment of rent is one of the provisions which the defendants had the legal right to enforce.</p>
    <p id="b483-3" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[132,673,1151,972]]]'>The plaintiff stresses the point that Mrs. Proctor was her sister’s agent in the negotiations with the treasurer of the company concerning the waiver of the prompt payment of rent, and is hound by the arrangement alleged to have been made. It is unnecessary for us to consider whether Mrs. Proctor was Mrs. Loomis’ agent, because the plaintiff has failed to establish that such provision of the lease was in fact waived. Not only did Mrs. Proctor testify that she never so agreed, but the chancellor has found “. . . that neither Mrs. Proctor nor Mrs. Loomis agreed that the plaintiff company might pay one-half of the rent as it fell due, but Mrs. Proctor did agree on one occasion that the next payment only might be so made.” Even though such agreement had been made, the plaintiff would still be in default, as the record indicates that it actually paid less than one-half of the rent that had accrued subsequent to July of 1932, the time of the alleged agreement with Mrs. Proctor.</p>
    <p id="b483-4" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[133,1658,1149,643]]]'>Nevertheless the court below found that the defendants by accepting deferred payments of. rent had lulled plaintiff into a sense of security so that a forfeiture could not be declared without demand upon or notice to the plaintiff. This conclusion was not warranted by the facts found by the chancellor, and cannot be supported. It is well settled that mere indulgence without more is not a waiver of forfeiture, although a lessor by his past course of dealing may be precluded from exercising that right, without first giving prior notice to the lessee of his intention to do so. The delay of a creditor or his neglect to exact money due is not evidence of waiver.</p>
