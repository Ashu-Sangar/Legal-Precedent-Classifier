The defense to the judgment was appellee’s alleged fraud, sought to be made out by averments that when appellant in March, 1930, bought the property, for which the bond on which judgment was entered was part of the price, appellee represented she had been offered $5,000 for a part of it, that the representation was false, and that the whole property at the time was not worth that amount.</p>
    <p id="b348-7" data-blocks='[["BL_348.9",348,[263,1647,1150,639]]]'>For three years after her purchase appellant paid interest but then began insolvency proceedings in a United States District Court. When, on October 3, 1934, the judgment here involved was entered and a <em>fieri facias </em>issued, execution was restrained by the District Court. Execution under an <em>alias </em>writ of July 25,1935, was similarly obstructed. Finally, on January 7, 1936, the District Court order was vacated and a <em>pluries fieri facias </em>issued from the court below the same day. The sheriff’s sale took place on January 31, 1936. Not until February 4, 1936, did appellant present her petition charging fraud.</p>

    <p id="b349-3" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[138,838,1154,1349]]]'>The doctrine of laches has been held applicable to petitions to open judgments by confession as it is to other equitable proceedings: <em>O’Connor v. Flick, </em><a href="/pa/271/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="271 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="295655" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0249-01">271 Pa. 249</a>; <em>German v.

Although the delay in those cases was longer than that here, a delay short of the period of limitation at law may call for the application of the doctrine: <em>Pitcairn v. Stuart, </em><a href="/pa/302/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="302 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="1129108" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0499-01">302 Pa. 499</a>; <em>Hilliard v.

And since each case is singular as to the lapse of time and circumstances that preclude equitable aid <em>(Youse v.

Superior Ct. 306</a>) we need no citation of authority to convince us the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The misrepresentation here alleged was made, if at all, in 1930. The petition avers neither failure nor inability to discover its falsity then. Notwithstanding, appellant paid interest without protest until 1933, and even then took no steps for relief from an obligation fraudulently induced, but rather began insolvency proceedings. Not until they were unavailing, except to hinder appellee, to increase costs of foreclosure, and to create a larger arrearage of rent and taxes, did she finally in 1936, after sale by the sheriff, present her petition making the claim of fraud. It was very properly dismissed.</p>
