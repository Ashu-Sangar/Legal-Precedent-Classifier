L. 939, and applying to counties of the third class, to wit: Luzerne, Lackawanna, Westmoreland, Delaware and Montgomery. In section 1 it purports to create “a board to be known as the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes which shall be composed of three members resident of the county for which appointed. The members of said board shall be appointed by the Auditor General of the Commonwealth to serve for terms of four years each. Vacancies happening in said office shall be filled by appointment by the Auditor General for the unexpired terms. The boards so appointed shall have all the powers and perform all the duties vested in and imposed upon the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes in counties of the third class by the act [of June 26,1931, P. L. 1379] to which this is a supplement. The salary of the members of said board shall be fixed by the salary board of the county. Whenever the salary board shall be convened for the purpose of fixing salaries under this act or the act to which this is an amendment, the members of the board for the assessment and revision of taxes shall become members of the salary board of the county, with the same power as now conferred by law on the other members of the salary board of the county.” Section 2 of the act provides that “Upon the effective date of this act, the terms of the members of the board of revision of taxes in counties of the third class shall cease and terminate, and the members appointed by the Auditor General shall take office for the term for which appointed. They shall be entitled to the compensation theretofore fixed by the salary board for members of the board of revision of taxes, until changed or altered under the provisions of this act. All other appointees and employees of such boards shall continue to hold their respective positions and be entitled to receive the same <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>compensation as now fixed by tbe salary board, subject to removal by tbe board of revision provided for by this act, and tbe fixing of their compensation by tbe salary board as provided in tbis act.” Section 3 contains a severability clause. Section 4 repeals section 1 of tbe Act of June 26, 1931, creating in third class counties “a board for tbe assessment and revision of taxes, providing for the appointment of tbe members of such board by tbe county commissioners,” etc.</p>

In many states, notably New York, the principle of “home rule” as operative in the selection by the local electorate or by such electorate’s chosen officials of public servants to administer matters of local concern, is expressly safeguarded by constitutional provisions. In other states, notably Michigan, the principle of “home rule” is declared by the highest courts of these states to be implicit in the constitution. Some of the most eminent juristic authorities uphold the latter view.</p>

In contradistinction to those governments where power is concentrated in one man, or one or more bodies of men, whose supervision and active control extends to all the objects of government within the territorial limits of the State, the American system is one of complete decentralization, the primary and vital idea of which is, that local affairs shall be managed by local authorities, and general affairs only by the central authority. . . . The system is one which almost seems a part of the very nature of the race to which we belong. A similar subdivision of the realm for the purposes of municipal gov<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>ernment has existed in England from the earliest ages, and in America, the first settlers, as if instinctively, adopted it in their frame of government, and no other has ever supplanted it, or even found advocates. In most of the colonies the central power creáted and provided for the organization of the towns; in one at least the towns preceded and created the central authority; but in all, the final result was substantially the same, that towns, villages, boroughs, cities, and counties exercised the powers of local government, and the Colony or State the powers of a more general nature. The several State constitutions have been framed with this system in view, and the delegations of power which they make, and the express and implied restraints which they impose thereupon, can only be correctly understood and construed by keeping in view its present existence and anticipated continuance. There are few of the general rules of constitutional law that are not more or less affected by the fact that the powers of government, instead of being concentrated in one body of men, are carefully distributed, with a view to being exercised with intelligence, economy, and facility, and as far as possible by the persons most directly and immediately interested.” De Tocqueville in his “Democracy in America,” c. 5, says: “The townships . . . are independent in all that concerns themselves, and among the inhabitants of New England I believe that not a man is to be found who would acknowledge that the state has any right to interfere in their local interests. The towns of New England buy and sell, prosecute or are indicted, <em>augment or diminish their rates, without the slightest opposition on the part of the administrative authority of the State </em>[italics supplied].”</p>

It means the right to choose their local officers, in all its reality, or it means nothing. . . . This right of self-government lies at the foundation of our institutions and cannot be disturbed or interfered with, even in respect to the smallest of the divisions into which the state is divided for governmental purposes, without weakening the entire foundation; and hence it is a right not only to be carefully guarded by every department of the government, but every infraction or evasion of it to be promptly met and condemned.”</p>

We have taken great pains to surround the life, liberty, and property of the individual with guaranties, but we have not, as a general thing, guarded local government with similar protections. We must assume either an intention that the legislative control should be constant and absolute, or, on the other hand, that there are certain fundamental principles in our general framework of government, which are within the contemplation of the people when they agree upon the written charter, subject to which the delegations of authority to the several departments of government have been made. That this last is the case, appears to me too plain for serious controversy. . . . The circumstances from which these <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>implications arise are: First, that the Constitution has been adopted in view of a system of local government, well understood and tolerably uniform in character, existing from the very earliest settlement of the country, never for a moment suspended or displaced, and the continued existence of which is assumed; and, second, that the liberties of the people have generally been supposed to spring from, and be dependent upon, that system.”</p>

To give local government without this would be little better than a mockery. If any state has the power to withhold it, the exercise of such a power would justly be regarded as tyranny. Indeed, local taxation is so inseparable an incident to republican institutions that to abolish it would be nothing short of a revolution.”</p>

On January 30, 1768, Samuel Adams wrote to Dennys Deberdt, the Massachusetts colonial agent in London, as follows: “You will observe that the House still insist upon that inestimable right of nature and the Constitution of being taxed only by representatives of their own free election ; which they think is infringed by the late acts for establishing a revenue in America.”</p>

If, as Cooley says, “the American system is one of complete decentralization, the primary and vital idea of which is that local affairs shall be managed by local authorities,” this act giving control to a state official, through the power of appointment by him of county assessors of “persons, property, and occupations,” is an application of an alien ideology of government which has not hitherto found legislative favor in this Commonwealth.</p>

In counties of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th classes, totalling sixty of the sixty-seven counties of the State, the power of assessing property is in the hands of county commissioners. In Allegheny County, a county of the 2nd class, assessments are made by a board appointed by the county commissioners. In Philadelphia County, a county of the first class, the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes has heretofore been appointed by a board consisting of the Common Pleas Judges of that county. Under the legislation enacted in the spring of 1937 (and this day passed upon by this Court), it is provided that there the appointment of four members shall be by the City Controller, who is elected by the electorate of the county (the county and city being co-terminous), and the remaining three members shall be appointed by the City Treasurer, who is elected by the same electorate.</p>

It provides that the salary of the members of the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes shall be fixed by the Salary Board and it then makes the members of the former board members of the latter. In other words, the assessors act upon the fixing of their own salaries. It is true that there are four other members of the Salary Board, to wit, the three County Commissioners and the County Controller, but if the three members of the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes can secure the vote of any one of these other four officials, they can fix their own salaries without limit. All the members of the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes may belong to the same political party and as at least one of the county commissioners will belong to the same party, it follows that four officials belonging to the same party are clothed by this act with the power to fix the salaries of three of these officials, those three being the members of the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes. They are expressly clothed by this law with 75% of the power necessary to fix their own salaries (four being a majority of the Salary Board). No such power has ever heretofore been given to any public official in the State of Pennsylvania. That such a grant of power even to members of the highest law-making body of the State is offensive to the people’s conception of official propriety is evidenced by the Constitution which the people of this Commonwealth ordained and established. Article II, section 8 of the Constitution specifically provides that “no member of either House shall, during the term for which he may have been elected, receive any increase of salary, or mileage, under any law passed during such term.” Section 33 of Article III, provides that “a member who has a personal or private interest in any measure or bill proposed or <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>pending before the General Assembly shall disclose the fact to the House of which he is a member, and shall not vote thereon.” To make any one “the arbiter in his controversies” has been characterized as “the creation of an arbitrary and irresponsible authority, neither legislative, executive, nor judicial, and wholly unknown to constitutional government”: Cooley’s “Constitutional Limitations” (8th ed.), Vol. 1, page 356. The act now challenged makes the members of the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes <em>the arbiters </em>in the question that must inevitably arise as to the amount of salaries they shall receive.</p>

It leaves the office, both in name and functions, undisturbed and unaffected, but it does attempt to replace the incumbents with selections of the Auditor General. As the legislature did not appoint the incumbents, it cannot remove them. Their titles to office did not come from the legislature. What under our system of government the legislature does not create it cannot destroy.</p>

Whenever any act conflicts with <em>any </em>section of the fundamental law, it is entitled to no further consideration, for whenever the will of the legislature as declared in a statute is opposed to the will of the people as declared in the Constitution, the former must yield and the latter prevail.</p>
