The acts considered together, as they must be, make it plain that the intention was to oust the commissioners elected by the city council and put in their places commissioners appointed by the mayor, the controller, and their appointees. There was no intention to abolish the office; language in the Act of May 19, 1937, supra, that it is abolished is mere subterfuge. The intention to the contrary is too obvious. The best that can be said is that the legislature attempted to abolish and continue the office at one and the same time, an impossible thing. Such a device cannot succeed, and while the question is a new one for this court, various other courts have so declared. <em>State ex rel. v. Baldwin, </em><a href="/conn/45/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="45 Conn. 134" data-case-ids="752035" data-case-paths="/conn/45/0134-01">45 Conn. 134</a>, is very similar to the instant case. It involved the validity of a statute which, at one and the same time, purported to <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>abolish the board of county commissioners of New Haven County and to create a new board, to be appointed by the legislature. The statute was held invalid, the court saying, at pages 142 ff: “If the law under which the relators were appointed was in fact repealed and the office actually abolished, then the relators could not successfully claim that they were county commissioners, for, as we have already seen, the legislature may repeal any law, with the exception before stated [not here relevant], passed by its predecessors, and may abolish any office created by legislative enactment. But has the legislature by the passage of this act accomplished either of the above results? We have then this condition of things — an act of the legislature repeals by its terms a certain section of the General Statutes and abolishes a board of officers appointed under it, and the same act creates precisely the same board and clothes them with the same powers and duties enumerated in the section repealed. Can this be done? We think not. The act in question contains the elements of its own destruction. It attempts to kill and make alive at the same instant, an impossibility.” See also: <em>McChesney v. Trenton, </em><a href="/njl/50/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="50 N.J.L. 338" data-case-ids="335776" data-case-paths="/njl/50/0338-01">50 N. J. L. 338</a>; <em>Hunziker v.

An early case in point is <em>Case of Gibbes, </em>1 Desaussure’s Eq. Reports 587 (S. C.). Under the constitution of that state the only method of removing a “master in equity” was by impeachment. The legislature passed a new judiciary law, substituting a “commissioner and register in equity” for a “master in equity.” The court in declaring the act unconstitutional, said, at page 588, “If the bare changing of the name, and not the duty of the officer was sufficient to deprive him of his office, the legislature might thus get rid of any officer, and thereby render the clause in the Constitution respecting impeachments a mere nullity.”</p>

It does not follow, however, that the legislature can, by direct or indirect means, continue the office and remove an incumbent whom it has not appointed. And it may not, for such purpose, change the appointing power, thereby shifting the power of removal. The right to remove “appointed officers” (and civil service commissioners “elected” by city council fall within that classification: see <em>Com. ex rel. v.
