    <p id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[115,888,1154,1356]]]'>“It is apparent that what the lower court did in this case was to overrule the board on a question of fact and to substitute its own finding therefor. It has frequently been stated that the court has no power to do this; and a situation similar to the present case may be found in <em>Stahl v. Watson Coal Co. et al., </em><a href="/pa/268/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="268 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="1061575" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0452-01">268 Pa. 452</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%2014" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="112 A. 14">112 A. 14</a>. The workmen’s compensation board is the final fact-finding body in compensation cases.

Neither the lower court nor an appellate court can say that the board must find one way or another. Although it may feel that the weight of the evidence, as a whole, is against the finding of fact so made, it may not disturb that finding if it is supported by sufficient legally competent evidence: <em>Hanlon v. Gulf Refining Co. et al., </em><a href="/pa-super/115/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="115 Pa. Super. 315" data-case-ids="977487" data-case-paths="/pa-super/115/0315-01">115 Pa.

There can be no interference by the courts with such findings, whether they be based on proved facts or inferences therefrom: <em>Flucker v.
