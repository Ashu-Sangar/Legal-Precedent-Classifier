Accordingly, the Commonwealth, at the relation of the District Attorney of Philadelphia, instituted this proceeding in quo warranto alleging that both the judges of the Municipal Court and the judges of the Family Court claimed “to have exclusive jurisdiction in such vast fields of litigation as Domestic Relation cases, Juvenile cases, Morals Court cases, and similar matters. . . . ” In response to the writ, the judges of the Municipal Court appeared by counsel and answered. The Attorney General intervened, also on the part of the Commonwealth, and set forth “that by reason of the Acts aforesaid [to be referred to], the Municipal Court of the County of Philadelphia has been abolished, its rights, powers, duties, authority, jurisdiction, immunities and emoluments have been divested and transferred to other tribunals.”</p>

This Act also contained a provision transferring to the Municipal Court from the Quarter Sessions desertion and nonsupport proceedings instituted in that court, pending and undisposed of, with authority in the Municipal Court to complete them and to enforce the judgments entered, though this transfer was mere reenactment of the prior law: see <em>Com. ex rel. v. </em>Shecter, <a href="/pa/250/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="250 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1016954" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0282-01">250 Pa. 282</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20468" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="95 A. 468">95 A. 468</a>, and the subsequent Act of July 17, 1917, P.

This jurisdiction was intended to be vested in the Family Court. We have, however, been required to hold that the Family Court Act is invalid.

If, for the moment, we should assume that the legislature would have passed the Act abolishing the Municipal Court and made such changes of jurisdiction as could be put into effect without the Family Court, a constitutional objection to such action would immediately present itself. The legislation would then be invalid for want of due process under the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution and in conflict with the prohibitions against the impairment of the obligation of contracts in the state and in the federal constitutions, because provision was not made protecting rights vested in and by the pending litigation.</p>
