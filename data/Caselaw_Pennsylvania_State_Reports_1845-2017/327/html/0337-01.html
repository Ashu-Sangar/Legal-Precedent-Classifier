While no new court was created by that Act, it is now settled that the Constitution does not prohibit the creation of a court to deal with the subject. But the power to create a Juvenile Court is not involved in the record before us; the question is not whether the legislature may create such a court, but whether, in attempting to confer such jurisdiction and power on the Family Court together with certain powers on the judges thereof, so much more was added to what the legislature would have been competent to enact for that limited purpose that, by these additions, the Act now conflicts with the Constitution. Anyone studying the subject will find in the Philadelphia Bar Association library a draft of a Standard Juvenile Court Law prepared and published by the Committee on Standard Juvenile Court Laws of the National Probation Association in 1933. A comparison of that draft with the Family Court Act shows that in all probability it was before the draftsman of the Family Court Act, and that, while he found some provisions acceptable, he rejected many and added others not immediately related to the subject and not contained in the.Standard draft. It was of course within the province of the <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>legislature to reject the proposed Standard Act in whole or in part and to make such additions as it considered proper, subject only to constitutional limitations.</p>

It is now the duty of this court to determine whether the leg<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>islation complies with the conditions. Some of them, important in this case, appear in section 26 of the fifth article which provides: “All laws relating to courts shall he general and of uniform operation, and the organization, jurisdiction and powers of all courts of the same class or grade, so far as regulated by law, and the force and effect of the process and judgments of such courts, shall be uniform; and the General Assembly is hereby prohibited from creating other courts to exercise the powers vested by this Constitution in the judges of the courts of common pleas and orphans’ courts.” The words “class or grade” are used as meaning the same thing and are to be given their ordinary and not a technical meaning.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[145,1111,1153,848]]]'>On behalf of the Relator it is contended that the Act creating the Family Court is in conflict with section 26; the contention is that not only has the legislature done what it was not authorized to do, but that it has done what it was prohibited from doing. The argument is that the Family Court is “of the same class or grade” as the courts of common pleas, but that required uniformity is lacking; for example, the Family Court has four judges whereas the Constitution limits a court of common pleas in Philadelphia to three judges: <em>Com. v. Hyneman, </em><a href="/pa/242/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="242 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="998849" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0244-01">242 Pa. 244</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%201015" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="88 A. 1015">88 A. 1015</a>.

Reference is made, in the brief of respondents, to “the corresponding clause of the Municipal Court Act” perhaps to minimize the comparative effect of this section. Section 16 of the Municipal Court Act (1913, P. L. 711, 718, 17 PS section 699) is more limited by its text: “The said municipal court shall have full power to make rules regulating the practice and procedure therein and the keeping of its records, and, subject to the provisions of this act, shall have all the powers of a court of record possessed by the courts of common pleas and of quarter sessions of the peace and oyer and terminer in the county of Philadelphia.”</p>

The section continues — “Any judge or judges of the Family Court, when called upon by the president judge of any of the courts of common pleas of the first judicial district, but without interference with the proper conduct of the business of the Family Court, shall have power to hear and to determine upon the <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>certification, hereinafter provided for, of pleas, actions, causes, civil or criminal issues, and all issues and other matters in equity in the courts of common pleas, courts of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery, and courts of quarter sessions of the peace for said judicial district so fully and effectually and to dispose thereof in the same manner as may be done by the judges of the courts of common pleas of the said judicial district. Whenever the proper disposition of business requires it, an arrangement can be made with the judge or judges of the said Family Court for such services, and the president judge, or in his absence or disability, any additional law judge of any of the courts of common pleas or [?] said judicial districts, may certify matters or issues to be heard and determined by such judge of the Family Court specially presiding, as aforesaid.” The Act qualifies a Family Court judge to sit as a judge of the common pleas; the judges of both courts must possess the same qualifications. Section 3, therefore, qualifying and authorizing the judges to sit in the common pleas and dispose “of pleas, actions, causes, civil or criminal issues, and all issues and other matters in equity in the courts of common pleas, courts of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery, and courts of quarter sessions of the peace for said judicial district, so fully and effectually and to dispose thereof in the same manner as may be done by the judges of the courts of common pleas of the said judiciál district”, constitutes a legislative declaration that the Family Court is of the same class or grade as the common pleas. Why should a court whose powers as a court of record are the same, whose judges receive the same compensation and must possess the necessary qualifications to take their places in the common pleas for the exercise of any or all of the jurisdiction conferred on that court by both constitution and statute, including criminal jurisdiction to be exercised as common pleas judges, not be regarded as of the same class or grade as the common pleas? To that question <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>respondents have furnished no answer that this court can consider adequate. That the Family Court has jurisdiction in family relation and juvenile matters, in addition to the powers conferred on the judges in section 3, is not sufficient to exclude it from the same class or grade. The powers conferred in section 3 were not necessary to the exercise of jurisdiction in the family relation or juvenile matters, hut they were necessary to bring the standard of the judges to that required for the work of the common pleas. If a family court judge sat in the common pleas he would not be a common pleas judge but he would be a family court judge assigned to hold, and holding, a session of the common pleas. Earlier cases spoke of a court presided over by an outside judge as a “new court for special purposes”: Mitchell, C. J., in <em>Morgan v. Reel, </em><a href="/pa/213/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="213 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="943457" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0081-01">213 Pa. 81</a>, 88, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.%20253" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="62 A. 253">62 A. 253</a>, quoting Agnew, J. In his dissenting opinion in the same case, Brown, J., said, at page 92, “and into the court outside of his district the invited judge takes with him all the powers which he possesses in his own court.” In <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/236/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="236 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="986627" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0412-01">236 Pa. 412</a>, 416, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20824" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="84 A. 824">84 A. 824</a>, Elkin, J., said: “When the responding judge reports for duty in the district to which he is assigned, he is clothed with all the powers of a common pleas judge in the court to which he is called. It is so provided in the Act of 1911, but independently of the act, this has been the settled law of the Commonwealth for more than fifty years.” Indeed, section 3, supra, speaks of the Family Court judge as “specially presiding,” an expression going back to the idea reflected in the words quoted by Mitchell, C. J., and continued in the manner in which judges still sign orders made when presiding in courts other than that to which they were elected. Compare <em>Craig v. Hecht, </em><a href="/us/263/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="263 U.S. 255" data-case-ids="6141188" data-case-paths="/us/263/0255-01">263 U. S. 255</a>, 274.</p>

Section 3 authorizes the judges of the Family Court, on the call of the president judge of any court of common pleas in Philadelphia, to preside in the oyer and terminer as common pleas judges may do. But that is not all. Section 14 provides “Jurisdiction of Family Court. The Family Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in the following actions and proceedings, except where specifically otherwise provided: . . .

L. 460, creating a court of record to be known as the Family Court, is unconstitutional. I concur in the opinion of this Court invalidating the Act, not only because it is faulty and defective as drawn, but for the further reason that it disregards clearly expressed limitations upon legislative power contained in the Judiciary Article of the Constitution. I am convinced, after careful study of its provisions, that, if it were attempted to put the Act in force, such uncertainty and confusion would result as to become destructive of the orderly administration of justice.</p>

This intention clearly appears from the title, and the statement of the “purposes and basic principles” as set forth in Section 1<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> of the Act. These worthy purposes might have been realized in a constitutional manner had the act included only such provisions as would have been appropriate to the principles so expressed. Apparently the object in view was to create a court of' family relations based upon the “standard juvenile court law,” which is published by the <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>Committee on Standard Juvenile Court laws of the National Probation Association. It would seem that provisions of that standard form were not acceptable to the draftsman of the present Act, and, rejecting these, he substituted others unrelated to juvenile delinquency. This departure was an unfortunate one, and has resulted in the attempt to create an anomalous court with powers foreign to those possessed by juvenile courts in other jurisdictions. A model juvenile court for Philadelphia is both desirable and necessary and, if it were possible, under the Severability Clause of the Act, to salvage from the legislation before us the valid provisions relating to such a Family Court, I feel sure this Court would strive to accomplish that result.</p>

Accordingly, for reasons more fully discussed in the opinion of Mr. Justice Linn, speaking for this Court, it has failed to establish a court within the limitations imposed by Article Y Section 26 of the Constitution because the organization, jurisdiction and powers so conferred upon the Family Court are not uniform with those possessed by Courts of Common Pleas.</p>

      <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>It is not my purpose to consider constitutional provisions dealing with the creation of courts of the Commonwealth. I confine this expression of my views, which made imperative my concurrence in the decree invalidating this legislation, to directing attention to several sections of the Act which are in contravention of the Constitution. This is done with the earnest thought that if, at some future time, the General Assembly, in its discretion, shall see fit to exercise the unquestioned powers which it possesses to create “other courts” such, for example, as a family court, it may be helpful to point out at this time certain provisions which proved fatal to the present Act, or which might be deemed questionable in conferring jurisdiction and powers upon such new courts. I refer now to the following objections to the present Act:</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[161,1227,1154,1195]],["BL_404.1",404,[245,345,1152,961]]]'>The greatest departure, in my opinion, made by this statute from earlier acts of assembly creating courts not enumerated in the Constitution, arises from the attempt to confer an almost exclusive criminal jurisdiction upon the Family Court, in all cases where the accused is a minor. In Section 14(m) of the Act, it is provided that in the prosecution of a minor for “any criminal offense under the laws of this Commonwealth” exclusive jurisdiction shall be in the Family Court, but that if the offender is over sixteen but less than twenty-one years of age, the Family Court “may certify such case” to the Quarter Sessions or the Oyer and Terminer courts, as the case may require. The right to certify is discretionary with the Family Court, and it cannot be compelled to certify if it does not elect to do so. Nowhere in the Act is “criminal offense” defined, hence it necessarily includes murder and other high felonies committed by minors, triable only in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, or before one of the Justices of the Supreme Court sitting as a judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, in which tribunals this jurisdiction was exclusively vested by law at the time our Constitution was <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>adopted. It cannot be doubted that adequate protection of the fundamental rights of the accused requires that he shall not be deprived of life, nor sentenced to imprisonment for a term of years, save by a court of the highest grade among courts of first instance. This attempt to transfer exclusive jurisdiction, over such felonies as may be committed by minors, from the Court of Oyer and Terminer to an inferior tribunal constitutes an invasion of rights protected by the Constitution. If this exclusive jurisdiction be denied the Family Court, as unquestionably it must be because it would be contrary to our organic law, the effect then is to subject minors to the subversive influences of the criminal courts, the very evil against which the juvenile court is intended to protect. Therefore, to cure this jurisdictional flaw, it would become necessary to rewrite this subsection, the power to do which rests alone with the legislature. It must be held to be in contravention of the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[238,1326,1156,1078]],["BL_405.1",405,[143,345,1151,482]]]'>The provisions of Section 14(b) of the act give rise to serious objections. Therein <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction is given to the Family Court of “all actions and proceedings concerning, or trials of persons, including adults,” contributing to the delinquency, neglect, or dependency of any child under 16 years of age, or charged with any offense with respect to such child. Whatever the meaning of the term “actions and proceedings” may be in that context it is evident from the language used that the jurisdiction over such subject matters now belongs in the Court of Quarter Sessions, which exercises it concurrently with the Municipal Court. The provisions in question go further than the powers granted to the County Court of Allegheny (Act of May 5, 1911, P. L. 198) or to the Municipal Court of Philadelphia. (Act of July 12, 1913, P. L. 711.) It entirely deprives the Quarter Sessions Court, as a court ordained by the Constitution, of part of its jurisdiction. In the past it was doubtful whether the legislature could deprive a constitutional court <em>of any part </em>of its jurisdiction, and confer <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>it upon other courts established from time to time. We resolved that question in favor of the power of the legislature to create courts of a different class from those enumerated in the judiciary article, and to grant them <em>a limited or concurrent </em>jurisdiction with constitutional courts: <em>Gerlach v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/243/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="243 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="1001618" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0603-01">243 Pa. 603</a>, 609. But such an infringement as now proposed under the provisions of this subsection cannot survive the test of constitutionality.</p>

This subsection gives the Family Court exclusive jurisdiction in “all actions and proceedings brought against any husband or father, wherein it is charged that he has without reasonable cause separated himself from his wife or children. ...” The section is primarily concerned with actions for support, but the language employed is so broad and inclusive as to confer upon the Family Court exclusive jurisdiction in all actions for separation, even though the action be one of divorce upon the ground of desertion. Divorce proceedings have long been embraced within the jurisdiction of the common pleas courts of this Commonwealth. Desertion is but one of the grounds upon which an action for divorce may be based. To separate this jurisdiction so that one cause of action for divorce shall be brought in the Family Court, and others in Common Pleas court, is a classification that cannot be sustained as constitutional. This Court is without power tO' supply the words required to indicate that this section <em>has no application </em>to actions for divorce because of desertion.</p>

No distinction is drawn between service of such nature upon resident or nonresident parties. The section further continues: “If any person so served with an order or process shall fail to appear he may be proceeded against for contempt of court.” That this provision is without precedent in the law, and, if sustained, would lead to the denial of rights guaranteed by the Constitution, needs no discussion.</p>

The Act here in question has not provided the required protection. The circumstances under which the reference shall be made, the extent of the judicial review thereof, the class of offenses that may be referred, are undefined. Nor is it necessary that the referee be learned in the law. As the offenses so referred may include felonies and other crimes properly triable before a jury, the uneonstitutionality of the “reference” authorized by this section is manifest. A desire to create a model family court, no matter how laudable, cannot justify the denial to the accused of a trial by jury. The objectionable features of this Section are not entirely cured by the “jury trial” provided for by Section 24, and the right to appeal to the court en banc granted by Section 26 of the present Act.</p>
