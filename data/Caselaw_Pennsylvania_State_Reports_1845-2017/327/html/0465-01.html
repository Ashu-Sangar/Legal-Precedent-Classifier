It is manifest that to permit the witnesses to answer the questions, and to tell the whole truth about the transaction, as they under their oaths were required to do, would be to lay before the jury the fact that defendant was protected by insurance, something which we have said must not be brought out upon the trial: <em>Hollis v.

That the attempt to get this information before the jury was by questions which were adroit, and not in themselves revealing of the forbidden fact, can make no difference so far as the propriety of the court’s ruling is concerned.

J. 813, sec. 1020: “As bearing on his credibility, a witness may be cross-examined as to inconsistent acts or conduct generally, acts or conduct inconsistent with his testimony, or omissions on his part which tend to discredit him.” But we think in the proper administration of justice it would not be proper under the cover of this <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>principle to permit the vehicle of cross-examination to be used to convey to the jury a circumstance highly prejudicial to one of the parties which could not directly be placed before the triers of fact. Such an impropriety in the use of cross-examination should be within the control of the trial judge in the exercise of his impartial judicial discretion. We do not regard any of our cases cited by appellants, such as <em>Irish v. Smith, </em>8 S. &amp; R. 573; <em>Ott v. Houghton, </em><a href="/pa/30/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="30 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="415586" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0451-01">30 Pa. 451</a>; <em>Mullen v.

S. 687</a>, covers what is before us. There, the court held that a <em>reasonable </em>latitude must be given the cross-examiner. If reasonable latitude means in a proper and not unfairly prejudicial mode we think it cannot be said that the intended cross-examination meets the test of reasonableness. In that case the questions ruled out by the lower courts were asked by counsel for defendant in a criminal case to elicit information about where a witness for the government lived in order to extract information as to his surroundings and environment, particularly that he was in the custody of the Federal authorities. We can readily understand why under certain circumstances, as for instance to indicate that his testimony was affected by fear or by a desire to curry favor, such questions would be proper. As the Supreme Court said: “Prejudice [to defendant’s case] ensues from a denial of the opportunity to place the witness in his proper setting.” That was not the endeavor here; the ultimate purpose was to develop something improperly prejudicial.</p>

The rulings of these cases will be strictly adhered to and rigidly enforced, and no evasion or circumvention of them by indirection will be tolerated.” The opinion goes on to point out that it is always the right of the party against whom a witness is called to show by cross-examination “that he has an interest direct or collateral in the result of the trial or that he has a relation to the party from which bias would <em>naturally arise.” </em>(Italics supplied.) As the opinion points out, cross-examination is proper only “as long as it [is] conducted in good faith <em>for a legitimate purpose.” </em>(Italics supplied. ) Here, it is obvious that it was to be carried on to inject something into the case which our decisions bar. In that action, the defendant in an accident case called its own attorney to discredit one of plaintiff’s witnesses. On direct examination he had testified that he was attorney for defendant. On cross-examination counsel for plaintiff was permitted to ask him whether he was not also the attorney for the employers’ indemnity company which had insured defendant against liability for accidents to employees, in order to show his further interest in the suit. It is not pretended in this case that the witnesses to whom the questions were to be presented had any interest in the suit.</p>

All testimony must be subjected to the test of cross-examination by the party against whom it is adduced.

Thayer in “A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law” declares, page 530, “two <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>leading principles” of evidence to be “(1) that nothing is to be received which is not logically probative of some matter requiring to be proved; and (2) that everything which is thus probative should come in unless a clear ground of policy or law excludes it.” Wigmore on Evidence, Yol. 3, (2nd ed.) sec. 1368, aptly says: “A witness, on his direct examination, discloses but a part of the necessary facts. That which remains suppressed or undeveloped may be of two sorts, (a) the remaining and qualifying circumstances of the subject of testimony, as known to the witness, and (b) the facts which diminish and impeach the personal trustworthiness of the witness.” In <em>Quigley v.

That they claimed damages from the defendant for conduct of his which on the witness stand they declared blameless logically tended to contradict their sworn testimony and to impeach their credibility. The settlement which the cross-examination tended to bring to light certainly tended to destroy the effect of the testimony in chief. Wigmore in sec. 1017 of his second edition of Evidence points out that “an approved method of demonstrating a witness’s error and discrediting him is the process of using a prior self-contradiction.” He quotes from Chief Baron Gilbert on Evidence, 147, 150, as follows: <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>“Things totally opposite cannot receive belief from the attestation of any man. . . . Contraries cannot be true.” Wigmore says (sec. 1040) : “The form of the supposed contradictory assertion is immaterial. . . . The inconsistency may be found expressed, not in words, but in conduct indicating a different belief.” Deeply imbedded in human nature is the recognition of the probative force of conduct; this recognition finds expression in the time-honored and commonplace maxim that “actions speak louder than words.” That an apparent inconsistency between a witness’s conduct and his testimony may possibly be cleared up or minimized by explanation does not affect the admissibility of testimony of such conduct.</p>

To show by cross-examination that a witness previously had said or done something inconsistent with the relevant fact he testified to, is a litigant’s absolute right. Protection of a litigant’s trial rights is a judicial duty; denial of these rights cannot properly be characterized as a mere “exercise of judicial discretion.” The denial of the right of a litigant to cross-examine an adverse witness on a relevant fact is far different from a mere limitation of the extent of a cross-examination. Even such a limitation may so prejudice a party’s interest as to amount to an abuse of judicial discretion. The cross-examination of a witness to show bias, or corruption, or inability or lack of opportunity to observe the thing he describes might take an impracticable range unless restrained by the trial judge by a proper exercise of discretion. Wigmore in Vol. 2 (2nd ed.) of Evidence, makes a distinction between contradicting a witness by (1) “facts relevant to some issue in the case” and (2) “facts [merely] relevant to the discrediting of a witness.” In the instant case the facts appellant expected to elicit on cross-examination were facts relevant to the issue in the case. They would also tend incidentally to the discrediting of the witnesses. The questions should have been allowed.</p>

If it was in fact an insurance company that paid, the witnesses would have answered in the negative, and the matter would have been closed without any mention of the company. Instead of being adroitly phrased to invite mention of insurance it seems to me the question was drawn with care to avoid it. It was defendant’s counsel who said if the questions were allowed he would so examine that it would be revealed to the jury that defendant was protected by insurance. He could introduce his company or not, as he pleased. That was his business. It was not being done by plaintiffs; they should not have been denied their right of cross-examination in such an important matter because defendant’s counsel thought he might have to do something which would prejudice his case in the eyes of the jury. The very fact he thought he would have to explain the conduct of his principal witnesses, even at the risk of introducing an insurance carrier, shows how important it was to plaintiffs-to have all the facts presented to the jury. If the witnesses made claims and received compensation for settlements they were inconsistent at trial in exculpating defendant from all liability no matter whose money they took; if they received the money as a gratuity without having pressed a claim the likelihood of bias is present nevertheless.

I can detect no bad faith in this case; nor is bad faith to be readily presumed or founded on suspicion only: <em>Fletcher v.

    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[263,772,1148,965]]]'>In my opinion the majority also fall into error in not differentiating between “limiting” and “excluding” cross-examination. The opinion of the learned court below indicates it too confused the right of a trial judge to limit the extent of cross-examination with the exclusion of all cross-examination. It is a duty of a trial judge to limit or put an end to cross-examination when it has fully answered its purpose. But to prevent all cross-examination on a relevant and material matter, as was done here, is improper. It is a matter of right. Its permissible purpose is to bring out facts tending to discredit the witness by showing that his testimony in chief was untrue or biased. As said in <em>Alford v. United States, </em><a href="/us/282/0687-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="282 U.S. 687" data-case-ids="6933273" data-case-paths="/us/282/0687-01">282 U.

In <em>Fischer v. Commercial National Bank, </em><a href="/pa/321/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="321 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1165845" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0200-01">321 Pa. 200</a>, it was held that after an extensive cross-examination had been conducted, it was in the trial court’s discretion to refuse to hear more. In <em>Pusey’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/321/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="321 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1165897" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0248-01">321 Pa. 248</a>, the complaint was that too much cross-examination was allowed. It was held the extent of it was a matter in which the trial court had a wide discretion. In <em>Thompson v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em><a href="/pa/317/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="317 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="8845078" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0007-01">317 Pa. 7</a>, there was also extensive examination, and again we held it was proper for the judge at trial to exclude more. <em>Maloy v.

Phila. R. T. Co., </em><a href="/pa/248/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="248 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1011479" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0304-01">248 Pa. 304</a>, merely holds that a plaintiff may not establish his own case by cross-examination as to matters on which there is no testimony in chief, and states the general rule that “the range of cross-examination, to a very great extent, must be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.” In my opinion none of these cases support what was done here. Not one of them is concerned with the total exclusion of all cross-examination on a pertinent, relevant matter.</p>
    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[136,1283,1153,1017]]]'>The consequences of the ruling of the majority are easy to conjecture. In most litigated accident cases the defendant is insured and the insurer the real defendant —the one who pays the verdict. Such is true here. In the future “in such cases” the decision “here” will be a bar to the jury’s knowing that witnesses who made claims and accepted money in settlement of them are actually denying under oath that there was any liability for the accident on the part of the defendant for the very happening for which they claimed damages and received compensation. Such information should' not be kept from the jury. It most definitely indicates interest, bias, or inconsistency, and should be given to the jury to determine the credibility of the witness. The insurance carrier placed defendant’s counsel in the embarrassing position of which he complained, not the plaintiffs. Under such circumstances, surely plaintiffs should not be compelled to protect defendant’s case at the cost of their own.</p>
