She made a bequest “to the Woman’s Hospital, to found a room for the free treatment of sick Phila. Public school teachers.” There were no attesting witnesses, though the law in force in 1931 required them. For want of such witnesses the bequest was held void and the property was awarded to cousins, next of kin. The Hospital appeals and contends that the amendment of July 2, 1935, P. L. 573, to section 6 of the Wills Act of 1917, P. L. 103, 20 PS section 195, abolished the requirement of subscribing witnesses, that it applied to this will, and that the decree was therefore wrong. The learned court below was of opinion that the amendment was prospective only, and that, as her will was made before it was passed, the validity of the bequest must be determined by the law existing when the will was executed.</p>

L. 403, 412, is as follows: “This act shall take effect on the thirty-first day of December, one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, and shall apply to the wills of all persons dying on or after said day. As to the wills of all persons dying before that day, the existing laws shall remain in full force and effect.” The section provides for two things: <em>first, </em>an effective date for all the provisions of the act; <em>second, </em>that it shall apply to the wills of all <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>persons dying after it shall come into operation. If, therefore, the first provision is changed as to any subject matter with which the amendment deals, the whole act is changed in that respect, but as the amendment made no change in the second provision, it remains the law as originally drawn and applies to the wills of all persons dying after the effective date of the act as amended. There is no difficulty so to apply the act; if a testator died between 1917 and July 2, 1935, the act applies as it was prior to amendment; ■ if he dies after July 2, 1935, his will is still subject to all the provisions of the act except as the amendment changed section 6, which then became part of the Wills Act.

Some of the hardships resulting from the application of that rule were corrected by the Wills Act of 1833; among them,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for example, that a will may dispose of after-acquired property. Section 18 of that Act, 1833, P.

L. 88, a change in legislative policy appeared; section 4 of this supplement provided “This act shall operate upon and go into effect as to the wills of all persons who shall die after the date of the act.” The difference, if any, between section 4 of that act and section. 26 of the Wills Act is in the difference in effect of the words “This act shall operate upon” and the words “This act . . . shall apply to” the wills of persons dying after the act became effective. In <em>Aubert’s </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="109 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="542305" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0447-01">109 Pa. 447</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.%20336" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 A. 336">1 A. 336</a>, the question was whether a will made in 1876 which made no reference to a general power of appointment (created by another’s will admitted to probate in 1873) executed the power. This court held that the words of sections 3 and 4 applied to the will made in 1876 because testatrix died after the Act of 1879 went into effect. The court said: “The Act of 1879, as we have seen, operates upon the wills of all persons who shall die after the date of the act. It is not confined to wills which are executed after the date of the act. The reason of this is plain. The act is based upon the fact that testators in many instances are either ignorant of the law or neglect to comply with it. In order that their intent may not by such means be defeated, it declares that under certain circumstances a general will shall execute a power. We are of opinion that this will comes within the Act of 1879.” In <em>Penna. Co. for Ins. on L. &amp; G. A. </em>Account, <a href="/pa/264/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="264 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1048573" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0433-01">264 Pa. 433</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20840" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="107 A. 840">107 A. 840</a>, the same act was applied and it Avas held that a will made in 1890 executed a general poAver of appointment not created until 1908.</p>

Unless this construction is adopted we should be attributing to the legislature an intention which is not expressed, that in addition to eliminating the necessity of' subscribing witnesses the amendment by implication repealed that part of section 26 stating that the Wills Act should apply to the wills of persons dying after it became effective. There is nothing to support the idea of implied repeal.

Lewis </em>[1893] 1 Ch. 44, affirmed on appeal [1894] 1 Ch. 297, and followed since. Bridger’s will was dated June 29, 1891; after a life estate, he gave his property “In trust to pay such part of my said residuary trust estate which may by law be given for charitable purposes unto the <em>Brompton Hospital for Consumption, </em>and as to the rest and remainder of the said residuary trust estate upon trust for <em>Elizabeth Williams </em>absolutely.” At that time only personalty could be given for such charitable use. Testator died February 20, 1892. In the meantime on August 5, 1891, a statute was passed which increased the kinds of property which could be left to such <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>charity, which, if applied to the will, would carry the entire residue to the hospital and leave nothing for the residuary legatee, Williams. The effect of section 9 of the statute<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> providing “This act shall only apply to the will of a testator dying after the passing of this act” was the point for decision. In the Court of Appeal, Lindley, L. J., after referring to section 24 of the English Wills Act (apparently similar to section 9 of our Wills Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> requiring that every will shall be construed with reference to the property comprised in it and speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will) said that “This section, however, does not by itself quite cover this case, for, although it enables a testator to dispose of property which he has not got when he makes his will, the section does not of itself enlarge his power of disposing of what he then has. This power, however, is, I think,, conferred by sec. 9 of the <em>Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act, </em>1891. That section is so worded as to shew that the Legislature intended that the act should apply to wills made before this date, provided they came into operation afterwards. Combining this section with sec. 24 of the <em>Wills Act, </em>the result appears to me to be that, if a testator devises or bequeaths to a charity all the property which he can by law so devise or bequeath, the charity will take whatever property answers this description at the testator’s death, and not only that which answered the description when he made his will. Such a devise or bequest would, I apprehend, clearly include property which a testator acquired a right to dispose of under a general power conferred upon him after he made his will.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> An exten<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>sion, whether by a statute or otherwise, of a testator’s power of disposition in the interval between the making of his will and of his death does not alter the meaning of his language, although such extension will necessarily enlarge the legal effect of that language by making it apply to more objects than it previously would have applied to.” Also compare <em>Langley v.

Speaking for the court in that case, Mr. Justice Shakswood said: ‘When a testator makes a will, formally executed according to the requirements of the law existing at the time of its execution, it would unjustly disappoint his lawful right of disposition to apply to it a rule subsequently enacted though before his death. While it is true that everyone is presumed to know the law, the maxim in fact is inapplicable to such case; for he would have an equal right to presume that no new law would affect his past act, and rest satisfied in security on that presumption.’ ”</p>

The true rule, as laid down by Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, section 294, is as follows: “A statute which is amended is thereafter, and as to <em>all acts subsequently done </em>[italics supplied], to be construed as if the amendment has always been there. ...” This rule was ex<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>pressly approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blair v.

In a moral or political aspect, an invasion of the right of property is as unjust as an invasion of the right of personal security. But retroactive legislation began and has been continued, because the judiciary has thought itself too weak to withstand. . . .Yet, had it taken its stand on the rampart of the Constitution at the onset, there is some little reason to think it might have held its ground. Instead of that, it pursued a temporizing course till the mischief had become intolerable, and till it was compelled, in <em>Norman v. Heist </em>and <em>Bolton v. Johns, </em>to invalidate certain acts of legislation, or rather to reverse certain legislative decrees.” In that case this court held that the Act of January 27, 1848, supplementary to an act relating to last wills and testaments, passed April 8, 1833, was exclusively prospective and was destitute of retroactive force.</p>

That case did not involve any question of the validity of the execution of a will or of any bequest in a will. As Mr. Justice Paxson, in delivering the opinion of this court, said (page 459) : “The will . . . purports only to pass the estate of Mrs. Aubert; the fund in question is a part of the estate of George P. DeSilver, over which he gave his wife a power of appointment. It is very clear that by the law of Pennsylvania as it existed at the time this will was written, the will would not have been an execution of the power. But after the date of the will and before the death of Mrs. Aubert, the Act of 4th June, 1879, P. L. 88, was passed by the legislature of this state, the third section of which provides inter alia that ‘a bequest of the personal estate of the testator, or any bequest of personal property described in a general manner, shall be construed to include any personal estate, or any personal estate to which such description shall extend, as the case may be, which he may have power to appoint in any manner he may think proper, and shall operate as an execution of such power, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.’ And the fourth section enacts that ‘this Act shall operate and go into effect as to the wills of all persons who shall die after the date of the Act.’ ” It is obvious that the Act of 1879 referred to is simply an act which regulated the construction of certain provisions of a will. It did not in any degree change the method of drafting and executing a will. It provided simply a new rule of construction which should operate on all wills whenever they should thereafter be brought before the court for construction. The case of <em>Packer v. </em>Packer, already cited in this opinion, was decided twelve years after the case of <em>Aubert’s Appeal. </em>Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett who wrote the opinion in the <em>Packer </em>case was a member of the court that decided <em>Aubert’s Appeal. </em>In deciding as the court did in the <em>Packer </em>case that the legality of the execution of a will <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>“must be. judged of by tbe law as it stood at tbe time of its execution and not at the time of tbe death of tbe testator/7 tbe Supreme Court did not think it necessary to overrule its decision in <em>Aubert’s Appeal. </em>This is persuasive proof that nothing was laid down in <em>Aubert’s Appeal </em>that was contrary to tbe clear decision in <em>Packer v. Packer </em>banded down in 1897. Also, in tbe <em>Packer </em>case counsel on neither side regarded tbe decision in <em>Aubert’s Appeal </em>sufficiently pertinent to tbe issue involved in tbe <em>Packer </em>case to even refer to it in their briefs.</p>

Lewis, </em>1 Ch. 44, does not contravene tbe principle that tbe validity of a will is to be tested by tbe law in force at tbe time of its execution. It simply bolds that if a testator devises or bequeaths to a charity all the property which be can by law so devise or bequeath, tbe charity will take whatever property answers this description at tbe testator’s death, and not only that which answered tbe description when be made bis will. There is an obvious difference between testing tbe validity of a will by tbe law in existence at tbe time tbe will was made and determining what property the will will affect by a law which was passed after tbe will was made. In tbe instant ease, we are concerned only with tbe validity of a charitable bequest made in a will dated February 6, 1934. As a bequest that was either a valid or invalid bequest according to tbe law existing at tbe time tbe will was executed. Tested by tbe law of that time, it was an invalid bequest. For us to bold that a subsequent act of legislation can convert an invalid bequest into a valid bequest or a valid bequest into an invalid bequest, would be contrary to tbe established law of this State and would lead to uncertainty, confusion and injustice. For example, under tbe Act of July 2, 1935, P. L. 573, attesting witnesses to a will containing <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>a charitable bequest are not required, and A today executes a will unattested by witnesses and bequeathing f100,000 to a worthy charity; some years hence just before A dies the law again may be amended and two or more attesting witnesses be required to make a charitable bequest valid. A may not know of this change made in the law just before his death or he may be physically or mentally so ill as not to be able to make a new will or to call in witnesses to attest his old will. According to the majority opinion, his earlier bequest to charity, though made in a will which fully met all the requirements under the then existing law, falls. This illustrates the injustice that results from retroactive laws and indicates why retroactive statutes or amendments are not favored by the law and why no statute or amendment should ever be construed as retroactive unless the lawmakers expressly made it so. Retroactive laws are manifestly unjust. When a person squares his acts each day to the law existing on that day, those acts should never afterwards be adjudged to be unlawful. When a testator makes a will valid in accordance with the law at the time the will was made, he has a right to assume that it will be valid at the time of his death.</p>

It is clear to me that it does not become retroactive by being an amendment to the Act of 1917.
