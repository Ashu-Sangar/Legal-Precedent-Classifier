It is at that time and in that proceeding that the discretion exercised by him will be scrutinized in the light of the will and of the Fiduciaries Act. The primary inquiry will be whether he has performed according to the recognized standard applied to the facts that existed at the time of the investment. In considering the matter, a subordinate question may in some cases be involved, whether (as petitioners claim here) the will shows that the testator enlarged the field of investment and to that extent relieved his trustees from the restrictions imposed by the statute. But it is when the court deals with the principal question that the subordinate one will be decided. Petitioners now desire a decision of what in some future proceeding may or may not be a subordinate question. It is easy to see that in some circumstances such a question cannot arise, and that in others in which it may arise, the facts on which it may then be presented cannot be anticipated. The contingent character of the circumstances presented by petitioners takes the case out of the class in which the court will enter declaratory judgments. The court is not vested with jurisdiction to give advice merely: <em>Cryan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/301/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="301 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1126421" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0386-01">301 Pa. 386</a>, 391, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%20675" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="152 A. 675">152 A. 675</a>. In <em>Kariher’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/284/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="284 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1092095" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0455-01">284 Pa. 455</a>, at p. 471, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20265" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="131 A. 265">131 A. 265</a>, it is said: . .in all jurisdictions where declaratory-judgment practice obtains, the rule is established that it is a matter of judicial discretion whether or not jurisdiction will <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>be taken of any particular case.” Section 6 of the Act, as amended April 25,1935, P. L. 72, says that a declaration <em>may </em>be made: “Relief by declaratory judgment or decree may be granted in all civil cases where an actual controversy exists between contending parties, or where the court is satisfied that antagonistic claims are present between the parties involved which indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or where in any such case the court is satisfied that a party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege in which he has a concrete interest and that there is a challenge or denial of such asserted relation, status, right, or privilege by an adversary party who also has or asserts a concrete interest therein, and the court is satisfied also that a declaratory judgment or decree will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.” Before granting a petition the court must be satisfied, that is, must reach a conclusion in the exercise of judicial discretion. We think there is nothing on this record to sustain a declaration; there is no actual controversy; there may be one some day if the trustees fail in the measure of their duty with resulting loss; but the circumstances cannot be anticipated, and without them there is no “actual controversy” on the point; the record does not present antagonistic claims indicating “imminent and inevitable litigation.” The parties may differ on what the will means, but that is not enough to support the declaration made. The contingent character of what is proposed by the trustees appears in their petition. Paragraph 4, quoted above, shows they have not made up their minds that such investments are necessary or desirable or that they would be made if the declaration were granted; their averment that “it is the desire and intent of your petitioners from time to time as occasion may warrant, and out of funds properly available for the purpose, to invest a portion of the corpus of the estate in such high grade stocks either common or preferred of sound corporations as they may <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>deem proper” contain several contingencies,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> any one of which, happening might reduce the decree, if granted, to mere advice; they may never find the shares of stock in which they would invest, or, if they find them, may not then have the funds available. Moreover, if the desired declaration were made and acted on and the investment were subsequently challenged for resulting loss, the trustees would still be required to justify the wisdom and propriety of their selection.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Generally a cause of action may not be split into parts; until a trustee has acted, has exercised his powers by investing, the court has nothing from which to determine whether his act as a whole shall be confirmed or whether he must bear the loss; there must be a real controversy.
