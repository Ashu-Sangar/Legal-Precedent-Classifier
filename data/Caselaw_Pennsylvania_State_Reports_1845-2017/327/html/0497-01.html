The writ was issued at the relation of and on a Suggestion filed by the attorney general. The charge is that by lease and stock ownership respondents unlawfully conspired to avoid performing corporate duties, with resulting damage to the public. The extent of the conspiracy, in point of time, and its character, as respects overt acts, may be understood by keeping in mind that many of the respondents were incorporated by special acts of assembly prior<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to the adoption of the Constitution of 1873 and many of them under general acts passed since<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>; that many leases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> contracts, enabling <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>acts and city ordinances passed long ago are involved; that the last lease made by any respondent was made in 1902 by Union Traction Company to Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (not a party to this suit).

Before the accession of Lord Mansfield to the chiefship of the King’s Bench, it was the practice to file almost of course; but in <em>Rex v. Wardroper, </em>4 Burr. 1964, he put his hand on it, saying that The Stat. 9 Ann. c. 20, had a view to the speedy justice to be done against the usurpers of offices in corporations, as well as to quiet the possession of those who had right; and that act,’ he said, 'does not leave it to the discretion of the officer (the master of the crown office), as it was before, but puts it in the discretion of the Court; therefore the Court must exercise a discretion. It would be very grievous if the information should go of course, and it would be a breach of trust in the Court to grant it as of course.’ In <em>Rex v. Dawes, </em>Ib. 2022, the same Avas said in substance; and in <em>Rex v. Sargent, </em>5 T. R. 457, Lord Kenyon approved of it. There are several cases in which leave to file was refused, though there was a clear defect in the incumbent’s title. Thus, in <em>Rex v. Parry, </em>6 Ad. &amp; Ell. 810, where no answer was given to an objection to it, the Court refused even a rule, because no fraud was imputed; because no mischief appeared to have been done, and because the object of the relators appeared to be a dissolution of the corporation. In <em>Rex v. Bond, </em>2 T. R. 767, as well as in <em>Rex v. Trevanen, 2 </em>B. &amp; A. 479, it was said that leave will not be given when the circumstances induce a suspicion of the relator’s motive: R<em>ex v. Trelawney, </em>3 Burr, 615; <em>Rex v.

The bank moved to quash on the ground that the writ was issued <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>at the instance of a private relator instead of the attorney general; that the relator was not a stockholder or creditor of the hank and claimed no office or other private right in it. The court said that the question “depends on the construction of the Act of 14th June, 1836, for, independently of that Act, it is beyond dispute that the Commonwealth only could have <em>quo warranto </em>for the purposes of the present proceeding.” It was held that as the relator had “shown no right or title to maintain the information in the name of the Commonwealth” the writ must be quashed. The court pointed out that the Act of 1836 “grants no powers to, imposes no limitations on, and prescribes no rules for the Supreme Court whatever”; that “all the provisions that follow in this section [the second section] are limited to the Common Pleas, and have no reference to the Supreme Court. They are provisions to regulate the new jurisdiction bestowed on the Common Pleas, and do not touch the old jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. . . . The statute of Anne was enacted in 1710, and gave jurisdiction in <em>Quo Warranto </em>to the Queen’s Bench. In 1722 our Supreme Court was authorized to issue <em>habeas corpus, certiorari, </em>writs of error, and all remedial writs, and were clothed with the same jurisdictions and powers as the Justices of the Court of King’s Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer, at Westminster. This was a sufficient warrant for this Court to adopt in practice a rule prescribed in the statute of Anne, and justifies the remark of Judge Gibson in <em>Burrell’s Case, </em>[<a href="/pa/7/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="957770" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0034-01">7 Pa. 34</a>] that the substance of that statute had been adopted before our revolution as part of our common law.” At the close of the opinion, Woodward, J., said: “Another question is made here which deserves to be noticed, because it touches the practice in cases like the present. It is said the writ can be issued only after a rule to show cause: and for that, <em>Jones’ case </em>[<a href="/pa/12/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="12 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="963758" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0365-01">12 Pa. 365</a>] in 2d <em>Jones </em>is an undoubted authority. The statute of Anne has the words by the leave of the Court, and the fifth section of the Act <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>of 1836, applicable alike to the Supreme Court and the Common Pleas, provides that the writ may issue with the leave of the Court in term time, or of a judge in vacation. This is sufficiently complied with by the motion which is made, and the allowance of the writ without a hearing. But all analogy and principle show that the party respondent must have a hearing before he is put to answer. <em>This we allow him in a motion to quash the writ. </em>[Italics supplied.] And notwithstanding what was said in the <em>Jones' case, </em>we are inclined to sustain this practice, and dispense with the preliminary rule. It is a matter of form and not of substance; so that the respondent is secure of his preliminary hearing, it matters little whether it be on a rule to show cause, or the less cumbrous motion to quash” (p. 420).</p>

The court considered the suggestion insufficient in substance and refused the writ. Strong, J., said: “A writ of quo warranto is not a writ of right. Even our Act of Assembly of June 14th 1836, recognizes this. It enacts that such writ <em>mwy </em>be issued by the Supreme Court in all cases in which the writ of quo warranto at common law may have been issued, and in which the said court had, before the passage of the act, possessed the power of granting informations in the nature of such writ. . . . Under the British statute it was always held to be within the discretion of the court whether to grant or withhold an information in the nature of a quo warranto, and the court acknowledged themselves bound to exercise a sound discretion upon consideration of the particular circumstances of each case. This was said by Lord Mansfield . . . and there are cases in which courts have refused leave to file an information at the suggestion of a private relator, even when a valid objection to the defendant’s title has been shown: <em>Rex v. </em>Parry, 6 Ad. &amp; E. 810; 2 N. &amp; P. 414. Nor has this court <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>since the Act of 1836, adopted any other rule. In <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>12 Penn. St. Rep. 365, the British practice was recognized as the rule with us, and though it has since been decided that it is not indispensable a rule to show cause should be obtained before the writ can issue, <em>no decision has been made that this court is obliged to entertain such writ, if in their opinion it was improvidently issued.

It is not to be presumed that the law officer of the Commonwealth would apply for this high prerogative writ for personal or private ends. He is supposed to be impartial, and to seek only the vindication of the rights of the state. It is not so in the case of a private relator, who is usually put to his rule to show cause. It might not be so where the attorney-general merely allows private counsel to use his name, as is sometimes done to procure the writ. But when the attorney-general or his recognized deputy assumes the responsibility the writ should issue in the first instance.” The point decided was that the writ would lie without a prior conviction on an indictment charging bribery and that the violation of the constitutional provision and the resulting disqualification to hold office could be tried in the quo warranto.</p>

These transactions were public during all the intervening periods. Many of them were the subject of, or result of, enabling legislation passed with the facts in full view: see for example, the Act of April 15, 1907, P.

Whether by virtue of its own powers or by those of its lessor, was of no moment to the public interests, for, as already said, all the powers of both were in the same hands. But the street railway companies, though they had parted with the present control of all their powers except the reserved franchise to be a corporation, were nevertheless the owners not only of all the franchises but of all the plant, or property necessary for the use of such franchises. To them by virtue of their reversionary interests, it would all finally come upon the termination of the lease, whether by its own limitations, or by surrender, for forfeiture or new contract.”</p>

Believing that combination would be more profitable, favorable legislation was obtained, one road would lease others, and those owned and leased would be run as a single system.

This latter lease is the only one to which the last-named company is a party; bnt thereby, as by all the other leases, it was provided that the lessee company should carry out the terms and conditions of the preceding leases, for which its lessors were responsible. Those contracts provided for specified rentals, to be paid by the lessee to the lessor, sufficient to cover the fixed charges of the latter and a stated dividend to its stockhholders; and, since the leases included the franchises of the original companies, the latter were denuded of everything except their mere corporate existence. All this occurred long before the Public Service Company Law of July 26, 1913, P.

L. 1374, 66 PS section 1, et seq. Section 6 of Article IV of the Act (1913, P. L. 1398), provided, “The Attorney General shall ex officio be the general counsel of the commission. He shall appoint two attorneys, who shall be learned in the law, as counsel and assistant counsel, respectively, for the commission. . . . Said counsel and assistant counsel shall also assist the Attorney General in conducting all mandamus, injunction, and quo warranto proceedings, at law or in equity, instituted by him for the enforcement of the determinations, rulings, and orders of the commission, and shall perform such other professional duties as may be required of them, or either of them, by the commission.” In view of a contention made by the attorney general that certain of respondents leased their secondary franchises before constructing any railway, it is not without interest to note that this method of enlarging the street railway system of Philadelphia, though complained of by the attorney general in this case, was continued with the approval of the Public Service Commission after the lease by which the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company in 1902 became the operating company. An example appears in Vol. 6, Penna. Pub. Ser. Com. Reports, p. 527, Application of Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co. The Commission in making orders approving five similar applications, said: “The Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company is a motor <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>power company incorporated under the Act of March 22, 1887, (P. L. 8), without corporate power to construct or own street railway facilities. Therefore, it operates its system in Philadelphia under leases. Since the unification of the electric railway system in Philadelphia, all necessary changes in routing and operation that have involved new construction have been effected through the medium of incorporating new companies whose stock is owned entirely by the Rapid Transit Company, and then leasing the newly incorporated companies to the Rapid Transit Company. ...<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> The practical application of the situation is that the Rapid Transit Company, in the present instance, expends through an incorporated subsidiary $28,500 for the improvement of facilities made necessary in the public interest, upon which capital expenditure there will be an annual interest charge of 6 per cent. The property created by this expenditure as well as all the other rights upon which it is based will pass into the ownership of the city when the latter elects to exercise its option. Undoubtedly, the public service is benefited by the improvement, the capital expenditure is a justifiable one, and the rights of the city under its contract are fully asserted and preserved.”</p>

R. T. The object it hopes to obtain by this proceeding, as stated at the argument, is to force a reduction in the rentals paid by P. R.

Specifically it is alleged that by acts of usurpation, misuser and nonuser of corporate franchises defendants have forfeited their right to live. Its charges, in brief, are that about 1895 the owners of three or four of the then operating systems, by an illegal agreement, conspired to bring all of the trolley lines of Philadelphia into one system, operated by the Union Traction Company; that the purpose and object of this conspiracy was the fraudulent issuance of illegal securities on inflated values to the investing public, and the illegal leasing for a long period of time of the franchises and property at exorbitant rentals based upon inflated values, which rentals have a prejudicial influence on the service rendered by the operating lessee and the car riders of Philadelphia; that many of the lessor defendants were without lines of railway, or property, the lease neverthless requiring a large rental to be paid for the use of the franchises only, which transactions were contrary to <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>law, these companies or the lessees never having constructed any roads in accordance with the requirements of their charters; that many of the defendants have duplicating lines and franchises on each of which the same value has been placed and securities fraudulently issued. Other acts complained of are the illegal issuance of bonds and other securities in violation of the law and without adequate security, and the disposition of property without provisions for the retirement of the bonds issued thereon. It is also urged that the only business and function of the principal defendants, those who leased directly to the Union Traction Company, though chartered only as operating railways, was that of holding companies dealing in the securities of other corporations, thereby usurping an authority of law never granted; that these defendants conspired to charge excessive rates and to defraud the investing public and taxpayers by means of the illegal agreements heretofore mentioned procured through a system of interlocking directorates of the parties to the agreement; that part of the consideration for some of the leases was dividends fixed on fictitious values; that defendants inflated the market value of securities to the prejudice of the public, paid dividends from capital, made inflated values of properties part of the rate base on which rates are now charged, and to mislead the State, filed false reports with the Commonwealth’s officers as to values, the amount of the securities that had been issued thereon, the financial condition of the companies and their corporate activities, which reports were issued and filed for the purpose of inducing innocent investors to part with their money and to defraud the investing public generally, as well as to deceive the Commonwealth’s officers as to the defendants’ actual standing.</p>

After a hearing before the court below, the writ was quashed; the reasons therefor were that there had been a misjoinder of parties, a nonjoinder of parties affected by the action, and that the Commonwealth was barred by law from attacking defendants’ charters and franchises. It was conceded that the suggestion disclosed possible grounds for forfeiture of the charters of many of the defendant companies, but it was contended that in a suit brought against all, only matters which are common to all could be considered. This appeal followed, and the majority opinion sustains the action of the court below holding that the State is estopped from claiming forfeiture.</p>

The same discre<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>tionary power must be exercised by the court in quashing a writ as in granting it, but in both instances the exercise of discretion is reviewable by the appellate court.</p>

Discretion in quashing the writ must be limited to these matters. To undertake to pass on the merits upon a motion to quash is a clear abuse of discretion. Where doubt exists as to the right to forfeit, the companies cannot avoid the burden of coming forward with facts in answer to the Commonwealth’s charge. The nature of a motion to quash was early set forth in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Palmer, Atty. Genl., v. Steelton Mut. Relief Ass’n, 2 </em>Dauph. 200, where the court stated: “ [A motion to quash a writ of quo warranto] is equivalent to a rule to show cause why the writ should not issue and will be sustained only for some defect in the suggestion, which goes to the foundation of the proceeding, as want of jurisdiction in the court, or right in the relator.”</p>

As stated in <em>Com. ex rel. Gordon v.

Commercial Bank of Pa., </em>supra, the ground for forfeiture was that the bank had unlawfully discounted notes at usurious rates and the court overruled the motion to quash, holding this was a valid ground. In both cases the motions were overruled and the writs were not quashed; the charges were legally sufficient to sustain the granting of the writ. They cannot be considered as authority for the proposition that the motion to quash raises broad issues, the determination of which necessarily depends on the proof of facts that are not before the court on such a motion as here involved.</p>

While the scope of a motion to quash was not discussed, the case goes no further than to determine whether the Commonwealth had presented any legal ground for ouster. But where the State’s highest law officer makes a positive allegation of wilful usurpation of a franchise right, or nonuser, or misuser, which without question constitutes a basis for forfeiture, the court should not quash the proceeding. If any doubt exists as to whether any valid ground for ouster has been presented, the court should not undertake to decide the case on its merits and hold that the public interest does not require an ouster, but should postpone such determination until all the evidence is presented.</p>

The court below, in spite of the gravity and explicitness of some of the charges, held on the bare pleading alone that laches would bar the State. In other words, the State’s delay in bringing action prevents it not only from ousting but from stopping the usurpation of powers by a corporation and causes a title without any pretext of right to ripen into a perfect one; laches prevents the State from ending abuses by a corporation, and where there has been nonuser of powers, the corporation cannot be stopped from a sudden revival of their exercise though the corporation has been dormant for fifty years. Laches does not estop the State in all cases where it would an individual.

We held that after five years had elapsed before the proceeding was instituted, and the company had functioned continuously as a lawful body, it was too late to attack such formal defects of incorporation. The writ was quashed as the suggestion charged matters of minor importance; failure of a sufficient number of pre-incorporation subscribers was not a defect of sufficient gravity to warrant the severe penalty of forfeiture. This case falls directly within the exception pointed out above. In <em>Com. v. Bala &amp; Bryn Mawr Turnpike Co., </em>supra, the turnpike company, in reliance on an amendment to its charter granted by the common pleas court, extended its road. Five years later the Commonwealth, at the instance of private citizens, brought quo warranto proceedings to declare void the amendment as being beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and to prohibit the operation of the extended road. The company was acting under color of authority.

Furthermore, a careful analysis of their facts reveals that for other reasons they fail to sustain appellees’ contention. In <em>Pittsburgh v. Pittsburgh &amp; West Va. Ry., </em>supra, not only was the suit brought by a municipality but, furthermore, the attack made was not based upon an improper user of the valid authority but upon the validity of the authority itself. Likewise in <em>Pittsburgh Rys. Co. v. Borough of Carrick, </em><a href="/pa/259/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="259 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1038371" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0333-01">supra,</a> a borough was not permitted to enjoin the occupation of a road which had been opened pursuant to the authority of township supervisors with the acquiescence of borough authorities for a period of 26 years. Here again the same two distinguishing elements are present. The last case, <em>Bradford v. New York &amp; Pa. T. &amp; T. Co., </em>supra, again involves a suit by a political subdivision, a county, to compel the taking up of telegraph poles erected by the defendant, and the court found that the county had by acquiescence ratified the installation of these poles, although reference is made to laches.</p>

The general statements loosely made in them cannot rise to the dignity of foreclosing the Commonwealth and estopping it in one of its most vital attributes of government. Public policy strongly militates against the rule permit<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>ting the assertion of laches against a sovereign State. To hold as the majority and the court below do makes possible the continuance of unlawful acts to the prejudice of the public at large, without any possibility of relief at the instance of the State or anyone else. Where there is a conflict between the rights of private individuals as against the welfare and public interest of the citizens at large, the interests of the public must be valued above all else. The public must not be penalized for the failings or mistakes of their governmental officials. The State must have unrestrained freedom in making inquiry into the manner in which the corporation exercises its powers. It must be kept in mind that the remedy of quo warranto when used to forfeit a corporate charter lies only where there has been injury to the public and this must appear through evidence. The plain answer is that in all cases where the basis of forfeiture is nonuser, misuser or other abuse of the corporate franchise, the right of the State to challenge the continued existence of the corporation cannot be barred by laches unless it appear that the State has committed itself to the acts so that it can be said to have ratified and approved them. This is an evidential matter.</p>

It is fundamental that lapse of time alone does not control laches. Even in an equity action instituted by a private individual, laches depends not merely on lapse of time, but on all the circumstances of the case. Laches considers as well the position of the parties involved, the opportunity afforded them to act, their acquiescence, or change in position, the availability of evidence, rights of intervening third parties, the character of the claim, and of the parties enforcing it, the relief sought and, in general, any other matters bearing <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>on the equities of the case: See <em>Cohen v.

As stated, if the word “usurpation” is not used, the failure to employ it is certainly unobjectionable. If the companies as alleged are operating under illegal leases they of course have been usurping powers not granted by the State. Other acts of usurpation are charged which, with the allegations of misuser and nonuser if shown to exist by testimony, certainly give the State the right to halt these efforts forthwith and, where the conduct constitutes a flagrant abuse of corporate powers, the charters of those guilty should be forfeited. It is charged that <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>some of the defendant companies have been guilty of duplication of routes, and that the duplicating companies have listed the same items of value, issuing corporate securities fraudulently thereon. If this is true, which only a hearing can develop, under the majority rule such pyramiding of assets cannot be prevented. It has been established in this State that, where a corporation is given an exclusive franchise and has done nothing to cause its loss or forfeiture, a similar franchise conferred upon another company is invalid and may be forfeited in quo warranto proceedings: <em>Commonwealth v.
