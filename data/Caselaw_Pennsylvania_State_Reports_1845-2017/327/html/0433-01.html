They challenge the vaunted genius of the law to adapt itself to new social and industrial conditions and to the progress of science and invention. For the first time in history human action can be photographed and visually re-portrayed by the motion picture. Sound can now be mechanically captured and reproduced not only by means of the phonograph for an audience physically present, but, through broadcasting, for practically all the world as simultaneous auditors. Just as the birth of the printing press made it necessary for equity to inaugurate a protection for literary and intellectual property, so these latter-day inventions make demands upon the creative and ever-evolving energy of equity to extend that protection so as adequately to do justice under current conditions of life.</p>

The orchestra consists of about twenty-five musicians; it has achieved an outstanding reputation in the musical world for artistic rendition of popular music. Originally it confined its performances to dance halls and the vaudeville stage; later it began to play over the radio, and entered into a contract with the Ford Motor Company to broadcast on one night of each week for the sum of $13,500 for each performance.</p>
    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[283,1108,1148,966]]]'>Some years ago the orchestra started to make phonograph records for the Victor Talking Machine Company. The two which are the subject of the present controversy were manufactured in 1932; they consisted of two songs, the publishers of the songs, who owned the copyright, licensing the Talking Machine Company to use them for ¡making records, but not for public performance for profit. The Talking Machine Company paid the orchestra $250 for each recording. Plaintiff, foreseeing the likelihood of the records being used by broadcasting companies for reproduction over the radio, discussed the matter with the Talking Machine Company, and, as a result, it was agreed between them that a label should be placed upon the records reading: “Not licensed for radio broadcast^’<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> They were then sold in~the ordinary course of business to the Talking Machine Company’s dealers, and by the latter to individual purchasers, the retail price being seventy-five cents apiece.</p>

The playing of the records was accompanied by the customary announcement over the radio that they were mechanical reproductions of the orchestra’s renditions. Plaintiff filed a bill in equity to enjoin defendant from broadcasting the records. The court below granted the injunction prayed for, from which decree defendant has taken the present appeal.</p>

The creator of such a work may protect his property rights therein, but the statute does not recognize any right of a <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>performing artist in Ms interpretative rendition of a musical composition, or in tbe acting of a play, composed by another.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is to the common law, therefore, that the performer must turn, and the question arises whether an actor or a musician has any property rights at common law in his performance. This problem is presented now foy the first time because, until the invention of the motion picture and the sound films, an actor’s interpretation of a play was necessarily evanescent and ephemeral. It might be made the subject of mimicry,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>but the actual performance itself, the postures, gestures, voices and motions, could not be identically reproduced. So also in the case of music, an instrumental or vocal performance by a soloist or an orchestra, once rendered, was lost forever except as repeated by the artist himself, until the advent of sound-recording devices permitted the fixation of the performance upon a disc or record which could be played and re-played, and even broadcast, at will, with the result that a single performance by the artist is now sufficient, generally speaking, to allow the rendition to be heard over and over again through an indefinite course of years. Under such circumstances it naturally has become important for the artist — in the present case we are concerned more particularly with the musician — to guard against his field of lucrative return being thus drastically narrowed, and to protect his artistic product against its indiscriminate reproduction, especially by those who, in a commercial sense, are in the nature of competitors.</p>

      <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>Does the performers’ interpretation of a musical composition constitute a product of such novel and artistic creation as to invest him with a property right therein?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5a</a> It may he said that the ordinary musician does nothing more than render articulate the silent composition of the author. But it must be clear that such actors, for example, as David Garrick, Mrs. Siddons, Rachel, Booth, Goquelin, Sarah Bernhardt and Sir Henry Irving, or such vocal and instrumental artists as Jenny Lind, Melba, Caruso, Paderewski, Kreisler and Toscanini, by their interpretations definitely added something to the work of authors and composers which not only gained for themselves enduring fame but enabled them to enjoy financial rewards from the public in recognition of their unique genius;, indeed, the large compensation frequently paid to such artists is testimony in itself of the distinctive and creative nature of their performances. The law has never considered it necessary for the establishment of property rights in in<a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>tellectual or artistic productions that the entire ultimate product should he the work of a single creator; such rights may be acquired by one who perfects the original work or substantially adds to it in some manner. Thus, in <em>Wood v. Boosey, </em>2 L. R. Q. B. 340, it was held that a person who arranged the score of an opera for the pianoforte thereby created an independent musical composition in which he had a right of property apart from that of the composer of the opera itself In <em>Walter v. Lane, </em>A. C. (1900) 539, it was held that one who reported for the <em>Times </em>a public address, together with a description of the meeting at which it was delivered, had property rights therein distinct from and additional to those of the speaker. ^Tlie translation of a novel, or its dramatization, vests a distinct property right which is entitled to the same protection as is extended to the original: <em>Fleron v. Lackaye, </em><a href="/nys/14/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="14 N.Y.S. 292" data-case-ids="4293768" data-case-paths="/nys/14/0292-01">14 N. Y. Supp. 292</a>. A dramatic work, even though composed of selections from literary compositions which are public property, may possess such originality in its construction, or be so unique in its dramatic effect, as to be the proper subject of protected ownership: <em>Aronson v. Baker, </em><a href="/nj-eq/43/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="43 N.J. Eq. 365" data-case-ids="807157" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/43/0365-01">43 N. J. Eq. 365</a>, 371. A musical composition in itself is an incomplete work; the written page evidences only one of the creative acts which are necessary for its enjoyment ; it is the performer who must consummate the work by transforming it into sound. If, in so doing, he contributes by his interpretation something of novel intellectual or artistic value, he has undoubtedly participated in the creation of a product in which he is entitled to a right of property, which in no way overlaps or duplicates that of the author in the musical composition. All that need now be decided is that such a property right inheres in the case of those artists who elevate interpretations the realm of independent works of art.</p>

A number of witnesses, themselves of fame in the musical <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>world, testified, and the learned chancellor found, that “Waring’s Pennsylvanians” were nationally and even internationally acclaimed as unique in their artistry. Indeed, as already stated, the fact that they receive from the Ford Motor Company $13,500 for a radio performance, is striking testimony to that effect. That their performances lie in the field of popular rather than classical music has no bearing upon the question of the existence of a property right in their productions.</p>

He and all of the players alike contribute their respective parts, and none of them can claim an individual property right in the composite production. It is the corporation, the orchestra organization, which alone is entitled to assert and enforce the right of property in its renditions. Ordinarily, therefore, plaintiff individually would have no right of action. It appears, however, that he is in fact the sole owner of the corporation, being the holder of all of its stock save two shares which are in the names of others only for purposes of corporate administration. Under such circumstances, while undoubtedly the corporation should have been named as party plaintiff, equity, which penetrates through forms to realities, will regard plaintiff and the corporation as so far identical as to recognize him as the true party in interest.</p>

It is true that in addition to the question of public policy other factors may weigh against the imposition of such restrictions in many, perhaps most, instances. Thus an attempted restriction, instead of being aimed at the accomplishment of a useful commercial, industrial or social purpose, may be merely capricious and serve only to clog the free and untrammeled circulation of personal property. Again, in the case of some restrictive covenants limiting the use of chattels, it might be difficult, if not impossible, to detect breaches so as to make legal enforcement practical. There is no reason, however, why an ancient generalization of law should be held invariably to apply to cases in which modern conditions of commerce and industry and the <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>nature of new scientific inventions make restrictions highly desirable.

It was intended to effect a legitimate purpose; indeed, unless such a restriction can be imposed and enforced, it will be impossible for distinguished musicians to commit their renditions to phonograph records — except possibly for a prohibitive financial compensation— without subjecting themselves to the disadvantages and losses which they would inevitably suffer from the use of the records for broadcasting. Such a restriction, therefore, works for the encouragement of art and artists. Moreover, it does not limit the use of the records in private homes or even public halls where a breach could not readily be detected or enjoined; the employ<a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>ment of tlie records for radio broadcasting would immediately become a matter of general knowledge.

It may, indeed, be said, in conclusion upon this point, that in a sense plaintiff was not imposing a restriction in connection with a sale by him of a chattel. The chattel here consisted of the phonograph record. This the plaintiff never owned. What he granted was merely the incorporeal privilege of reproducing the rendition of the song indented upon the chattel sold by the Talking Machine Co. The reservation or restriction imposed by him was to limit the extent of this privilege. The title to the physical substance and the right to the use of literary or artistic property which may be printed upon or embodied in it are entirely distinct and independent of each other: <em>Werckmeister v.

Associated Pr</em>ess, <a href="/us/248/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="248 U.S. 215" data-case-ids="3690126" data-case-paths="/us/248/0215-01">248 U. S. 215</a>. The Associated Press, at a great expenditure of labor and capital, gathered and distributed the news among its members. The International News Service, a rival organization, “pirated” the news thus accumulated. The Associated claimed that this was accomplished partly by inducing some of its employes surreptitiously to furnish the news to the International, partly by persuading some of the members of the Associated to turn over the news to the International before publication, and partly by the International itself copying the news from bulletin boards and the early editions of the newspapers of Associated members and embodying it in the newspapers of its own members in competition with those, of the Associated. In so far as the case deals with the obtaining of the news by the International’s inducing employees and members of the Associated to breach their contractual obligations by furnishing the news to a competitor, we are not here Concerned with it. In that respect it is similar to a multitude of others which hold that such a fraudulent and dishonest acquisition of the fruits of another’s labor, or trespass upon a “trade secret,” will be enjoined in equity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">10</a> But it was ruled in the <em>Associated Press Case </em>
      <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>that, even apart from any fraud or the inducing of the breach of a contract or moral obligation, the Associated could enjoin the International from publishing in its own newspapers the news which had been gathered by the Associated and which appeared on the bulletin boards and in the Associated newspapers, until a sufficient time had elapsed to destroy its commercial value as news. The court held that while there was probably no absolute property in the news as such, an injunction should be granted on the ground of unfair competition, saying (p. 236) : “Obviously, the question of what is unfair competition in business must be determined with particular reference to the character and circumstances of the business. The question here is not so much the rights of either party as against the public but their rights as between themselves. . . . And although we may and do assume that neither party has any remaining property interest as against the public in copyrighted news matter after the moment of its first publication, it by no means follows that there is no remaining property interest in it as between themselves. . . . Regarding the news, therefore, as but the material out of which both parties are seeking to make profits at the same time and in the same field, we hardly can fail to recognize that for this purpose, and as between them, it must be regarded as quasi property, irrespective of the rights of either as against the public.” Extending this thought the court further said (pp. 239-242) : “Defendant insists that when, with the sanction and approval of complainant, and as the result of the use of its news for the very purpose for which it is distributed, a portion of complainant’s members communicate it to the general public by posting it upon bulletin boards so that all may read, or by issuing it to newspapers and distributing it indiscriminately, complainant no longer has the right to cpntrol the use to be made of it; that when it thus i reaches the light of day it becomes the common posses- ■ sion of all to whom it is accessible; and that any pur<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>chaser of a newspaper has the right to communicate the intelligence which it contains to anybody and for any purpose, even for the purpose of selling it for profit to newspapers published for profit in competition with complainant’s members.</p>
    <p id="b503-3" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[141,621,1152,1729]]]'>“The fault in the reasoning lies in applying as a test the right of the complainant as against the public, instead of considering the rights of complainant and defendant, competitors in business, as between themselves. The right of the purchaser of a single newspaper to spread knowledge of its contents gratuitously, for any legitimate purpose not unreasonably interfering with complainant’s right to make merchandise of it, may be admitted; but to transmit that news for commercial use, in competition with complainant — which is what defendant has done and seeks to justify — is a very different matter. In doing this defendant, by its very act, admits that it is taking material that has been acquired by complainant as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and which is salable by complainant for money, and that defendant in appropriating it and selling it as its own is endeavoring to reap where it has not sown, and by disposing of it to newspapers that are competitors of complainant’s members is appropriating to itself the harvest of those who have sown. Stripped of all disguises, the process amounts to an unauthorized interference with the normal operation of complainant’s legitimate business precisely at the point where the profit is to be reaped, in order to divert a material portion of the profit from those who have earned it to those who have not; with special advantage to defendant in the competition because of the fact that it is not burdened with any part of the expense of gathering the news. The transaction speaks for itself, and a court of equity ought not to hesitate long in characterizing it as unfair competition in business. . . .</p>

It was held, aside from any question of deception or fraud, that plaintiffs were entitled to restrain the sale of such copies as a wrongful appropriation of their property rights, although the original records had been sold indiscriminately to the public for years and the copies were clearly marked as such. The court cited the “ticket-scalper” and “trading stamp” cases, and said (pp. 961, 962) : “Equity has granted relief in certain typical lines of cases where the doctrine of unfair competition seems to have been the guide to the decision, but where the basis upon which the relief was granted was the unfair taking <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>of the complainant’s property, rather than the deception of the purchaser, or the imitation of a patented or copyrighted article, or a registered trade-mark or trade name. . . . The jurisdiction of a court of equity has always been invoked to prevent the continuance of acts of injury to property and to personal rights generally, where the law had not provided a specific legal remedy, and it would seem that the appropriation of what has come to be recognized as property rights or incorporeal interests in material objects, out of which pecuniary profits can fairly be secured, may properly, in certain kinds of cases, be protected by legislation; but such intangible or abstract property rights would seem to have claims upon the protection of equity, where the ground for legislation is uncertain or difficult of determination, and where the principles of equity plainly apply.”</p>

They both furnish entertainment to the public over the radio. The orchestra obtains its remuneration from contracts with advertisers who pay it for the music rendered as supplementary to their advertising. Defendant’s revenue also is derived from advertisers, and presumably it can exact a greater compensation from them by being able to furnish mechanized music of an attractive quality at nominal cost — partly because this makes it unnecessary for the advertisers to pay for “live talent,” and partly because by thus entertaining the radio public a more receptive field is created for the advertising. Thus defendant can in effect “sell” to its advertising customers and to the public, at practically no expense to itself, the identical musical renditions of plaintiff’s orchestra. That such competition is extremely harmful to plaintiff and his orchestra is obvious. It probably must become increasingly difficult for them to demand and obtain $13,500 for a single performance over the radio if innumerable reiterations of their renditions can be furnished at a cost of seventy-five cents. There was testi<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>mony to the effect, and the learned chancellor found, that the constant broadcasting of the records<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">13</a> diminished the commercial value of the orchestra’s performances.

Fundamentally this is not a novel case, for the record exhibits an invasion of an <em>ancient </em>right. Whatever novelty there is arises from the fact that the invader is equipped with a modern instrumentality. The majority opinion’s purport,is that plaintiff’s interpretation of musical compositions constitutes “a product of such novel and artistic creation as to invest him with a property right therein” and that since “ordinary musicians” do “nothing more than render articulate the silent composition of the author,” they do not have a property right in their interpretations and therefore would not be entitled to such relief as the plaintiff herein sought. I do not agree that a plaintiff’s right to such protection in a court of equity depends on whether his production constitutes “a novel and artistic creation” which “elevates interpretations to the realm pf independent works of art,”</p>

If his interpretation is commonplace, his right therein is of little pecuniary value; if it rises above the commonplace, the value of his right rises correspondingly. By analogy, an individual’s <em>right to protection </em>against an invasion of his real property never depends on its value; <em>that </em>is a factor only in the measurement of damages. Drone on the Law of Copyright, page 5, says: There is “no distinction between the poet and the peasant in the ownership of their productions.” The true test is whether the thing in question is “capable of identification so that exclusive ownership may be asserted” (Drone, supra, p. 98).</p>

Such broadcasting would trench upon their right to privacy and each would be <em>equally </em>entitled to have that right protected against invasion. An amateur who declines remuneration would be as much entitled to have his renditions of music or literature protected against unauthorized broadcasting as would be the most highly paid professional performer. A score of years ago the daughter of the then President of the United States was a vocalist whose renditions of songs though pleasing would probably not have been classed by experts as “novel and artistic creations” amounting to “independent works of art,” yet it is obvious that had she made phonographic records of her singing for certain restricted purposes and had there been broadcasting at that time, some enterprising broadcaster would on account of the eminence of the position held by this vocalist’s father, probably have found it to his advantage to broadcast this young woman’s vocal interpretations.

The publication of his letter might not and probably would not cause him one cent’s worth of damages, but it might upset his peace of mind and disturb his social relations exactly as would the tapping of his telephone wire or the rifling of his diary or his correspondence. A person who insists that his telephone wire be not tapped is not solicitous about his property rights any more than is a person who asks police authorities to furnish him a bodyguard to protect him against intrusions.

The same protection is accorded to a casual letter or an entry in a diary and to the most valuable poem or essay, to a botch or daub and to a masterpiece. In every such case the individual is entitled to decide whether that which is his shall be given to the public. No other has the right to publish his productions in any form, without his consent. This right is wholly independent of the material on which, or the means by which, the thought, sentiment, or emotion is expressed. It may exist independently of any corporeal being, as in words spoken, a song sung, a drama acted.

Strange et al., </em>2 De Gex &amp; Smale’s Reports 652 (1848), it was held that where a workman, intrusted with copper-plates for the purpose of taking impressions for the plaintiff of etchings made by the latter, and not intended for publication, took impressions for himself, in violation of the trust, and sold the impressions to the defendant, who published a catalogue of them, accompanied by remarks of his own, the plaintiff was entitled at the hearing to a perpetual injunction to restrain the publication of the catalogue, and to a decree ordering the impressions to be destroyed; and that the defendant was not entitled to a preliminary trial of his title at law. In that case the Vice-Chancellor, the Right Hon. Sir J. L. Knight Beuce, said: “The author of manuscripts, whether he is famous or obscure, low or high, has a right to say of them, if innocent, that, whether interesting or dull, light or heavy, salable or unsalable, they shall not, without his consent, be published; and I think, as I have said, that to use a dishonest knowledge of them for the purpose of composing and publishing, and so to compose and publish a catalogue of them, amounts to a publication of them within the principle of the rule. Assuming the law to be so, what is its foundation in this respect? It is not, I conceive, referable to any consideration peculiarly literary. Those with whom our common law originated had not probably among their many merits that of being patrons of letters; but they knew the duty and necessity of protecting property, and with that general object laid down rules providently expansive — rules capable of adapting themselves to the various forms and modes of property which peace and cultivation might discover and intro<a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>duce. . . . Upon the principle, therefore, of protecting property, it is that the common law, in cases not aided nor prejudiced by statute, shelters the privacy and seclusion of thoughts and sentiments committed to writing, and desired by the author to remain not generally known. ... To consider, then, the case of mechanical works, of works of art, executed by a man for his private amusement or private use; whatever protection these, or some of these, may have by Act of Parliament, they are not, I apprehend, deserted by the common law. . . . It is for them [i. e., the owners of plates] to use, or bestow or withhold, . . . <em>They alone are entitled to decide </em>[italics supplied] whether, and when, and how, and for whose advantage, their property shall be made use of.”</p>

The right to restrict the use of these disks to private use is unquestionably his. It is a well-known historic fact that Edwin Booth, the eminent actor, refused, after his brother assassinated Abraham Lincoln, to appear thereafter in Washington, D. C., in any play. Let us assume that in his time there existed the present day mechanical devices for recording sights and sounds and Edwin Booth permitted a talking picture to be made of his rendition of one of Shakespeare’s plays, can it be contended that he could not have effectively stipulated that such a talking picture should never be exhibited in Washington, D. C.? I think it is clear that he could have so restricted the reproduction of such a picture and that a court of equity would have made that restriction effective, as an invasion of his right of privacy, and regardless of whether its invasion would cause him a pecuniary loss or not.</p>

There is no moral or legal difference between tapping telephone wires for the purpose of “listening in” than there is in using for broadcasting a phonographic disk made by plaintiff in defiance of the maker’s injunction written across that disk, to wit: “Not licensed for radio broadcasting.” It appears to me that the “tapping” of a <em>restricted </em>phonographic disk is closely related in law and morals to the unauthorized tapping of telephone wires, and the latter is merely old-fashioned eavesdropping brought up to date with the aural assistance of modern devices. At common law eavesdropping was considered such an invasion of peoples’ right to privacy that it was treated as something even baser than a civil wrong, to wit, a crime. See Blackstone, Vol. 4 (Lewis’s ed.), page 1570. The essence of eavesdropping was the invasion of others’ privacy, that is, “the lurking about dwelling-houses” and other places where persons met for private discourse, “secretly listening to what is said and then tattling it abroad.” See Wharton Cr. L., Vol. 2. (12th Ed., 1932), Sec. 1718, p. 2003. The defendant, by buying a phonographic disk on which plaintiff had impressed his orchestral rendition of musical compositions, which disk was expressly not to be used for radio broadcasting, and then by “tattling abroad” by means of broadcasting what was on that disk, was invading the same right to privacy which the common law protected against eavesdroppers.</p>

It is not a protection only of those who “seek privacy,” in the usual sense of that word. One who comes into equity demanding pro<a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>tection of Ms right to privacy is not preliminarily required to show that he has tried to live the life of a recluse and to “hide his light under a bushel.” The “right to privacy” is, as already pointed out, best illustrated in those cases where letter-writers who objected to having them broadcast, where those who objected to having their photographs copied, and where those who objected to having their telephone wires tapped, have severally sought and obtained equity’s protection against such invasions of their “right to privacy.” Whether a “star” is brilliant or dim, equity should prevent unauthorized persons from mechanically “hitching their [creaking] wagons” to “it.”</p>

But as, in my view, the only ground of complaint that can be recognized without legislation is the implied misstatement, it can be corrected by stating the truth; and a suitable acknowledgment of the source is all that the plaintiff can require.”</p>
