The statutes propose to establish a comprehensive system for the assessment of real estate and personal property in the County of Philadelphia. Three acts were passed to accomplish this purpose and they will be referred to as follows: No. 111, April 28, 1937, P. L. 476, “A,” relating to members of the Board of Revision and appraisers; No. 108, April 28, 1937, P. L. 472, “B,” providing for an appointive power, and No. 112, April 28, 1937, P. L. 480, “C,” concerning the system of tax assessments, and other related matters. As the Acts deal with the same subject matter and relate to each other, each may well be considered as part of one entire system.</p>
    <p id="b245-3" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[157,1319,1152,425]]]'>The objections to the Acts are that they violate the fundamental law in many particulars and are therefore invalid. It is urged, on the other hand, that together the Acts constitute a revision and reorganization of an important function of municipal government necessarily entailing loss of office by the incumbents, and that they do not run counter to any constitutional inhibition on the power of the legislature in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[160,1754,1152,642]],["BL_246.1",246,[268,333,1149,97]]]'>The legislature may abolish or reorganize municipal or other agencies of government, whether they be cities, boards, or commissions, and the reorganization may be such as to require an effective abolishment of offices in the city, board or commission. The incidental loss of an office occasioned thereby merely results from the valid exercise of this undeniable power. When such actions of the legislature are not in opposition to the Constitution, there is no limitation on its power. Its acts may be unwise, unjust and violative of political, as well as other rights, of the citizens, but these considerations cannot justify the courts in holding the legislation un<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>constitutional.

In considering acts of the legislature courts should be cautious in dealing with laws affecting the operation of the various agencies of government. Courts cannot be placed in a position, nor should they have the appearance, of being superlegislative bodies that control legislation because it is unwise, or is not in accord with the ideas of the judges. Courts are not guardians of political parties, creeds, or of any designated section of the social order; but when the people by their fundamental law have definitely restricted legislative activities, we are bound to give effect to the restriction.</p>

The present members were appointed by the judges of the common pleas under the authority of the Acts of March 14, 1865, P. L. 320, and February 2, 1867, P. L. 137. It must be determined whether the legislature has indicated by these three Acts any intent to abolish this long established department; and, if so, whether their effect is to cause an actual abolition of the . offices of the present members, or to continue the offices and bring about the removal of the incumbents in violation of Article VI, Section 4.</p>

    <p id="b249-3" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[155,682,1152,642]]]'>It cannot be doubted the board members are part of a system which at any time may be abolished, having its origin in legislative enactment, or may be reorganized in such way as to permit the abolishment of their office. But where the statute reorganizing the board and its functions, while adding some new duties and prescribing new qualifications for appointees, leaves intact the basic structure and purpose, here the system of assessment of real and personal property, it will not be assumed that the legislature intended by these additions to abolish the offices of the incumbents, unless the Act in other respects clearly works such result or manifests such an intent.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[155,1336,1152,688]]]'>Reorganization of an existing system or department of government does not necessarily require abolition of prevailing offices; in fact, generally that is an unusual procedure, and the intent to wipe out the old structure must be clearly apparent. Abolishment of office carries with it the idea of doing away with the identical office perpetually; this is not accomplished by stating in one act that the office is abolished, and in another or the same act providing for the recreation of the same office or one substantially similar. When the legislature so acts it is simply attempting a removal from office in violation of Article VI, Section 4, and the act falls: <em>Commonwealth v. Clark et </em>al., <a href="/pa/327/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="327 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1176721" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0181-01">327 Pa. 181</a>.</p>

Nowhere does Act “A” in terms abolish the office of members of the Board of Revision of Taxes. On the <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>contrary, the office itself continues. While the legislature may diminish a term of office or curtail it, without offending Article III, Section 13, they cannot violate Article VI, Section 4, in so doing. There is a vast difference between abolishing an office and removing the incumbents of an office. Section 8 of Act “A” merely states, “the terms of the members . . . are hereby terminated.” There is no ambiguity in this clause. The legislature intended to end the terms of the present members.</p>

This, however, was a minor feature of the comprehensive plan. The legislature did not intend to offend the Constitution; therefore, this section must be read as though the terminating clause was not contained therein. May we strike from the Act the unconstitutional portion and thereby save the remainder? A statute may be unconstitutional in part and yet be sustained with the offending part omitted, if the paramount intent of the legislature will not be destroyed thereby: <em>Rothermel v.

As the act did not, in terms, abolish the offices of the old members, the provisions for appointment of new members must be construed to be prospective. The old members will, therefore, continue in their offices until the expiration of the terms for which they were appointed by the judges. The legislature may change an “appointive power” but in so doing, generally speaking, it acts prospectively as in this case. The legislature may also enlarge the membership of the Board; here it is enlarged to seven members. The appellants, the new appointive power, will, under Acts “A” and “B,” merely appoint <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>the remaining four members. We decide this with the more confidence, aside from the unquestionable mandate of the Constitution, because it is not controverted that the present incumbents possess all the qualifications<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> specified by the legislature for new appointees, and a contrary result would have the effect of undoing much of the work of the Board for the current assessment.</p>

But, appellant proceeds upon a mistaken theory as to the <em>Benn </em>case, and to carry that theory to its logical conclusion would imperil the Governor’s power to remove executive appointees by broadening the definition of legislative function to include practically all governmental agencies created by the legislature. The <em>Benn </em>case held that as the General Assembly was the actual appointive power of the Public Service Commission it could, in delegating a share of this authority to another office, reserve the removal power to itself or limit removal by its appointive agent with its consent. The decision was based on the fact that rate-making is a legislative matter existing under the police power, and its exercise a legislative function. To hold that all boards or agencies created under the reserved power of the legislature, such as the Board of Revision of Taxes, exercise legislative functions, would introduce a new concept into the law. The board, with other allied duties, merely creates the basis upon which a tax may be levied. In no sense does it perform a function which is legislative in character. The legislature either fixes the tax rate itself or delegates this power to another agency, here City Council;, and, in execution of the tax law and to permit the levy of the tax, a base on which it is to be applied is found by the assessing authorities in accordance with a standard fixed by the legislature. The finding of that base is purely an executive function delegated to a municipal agency.</p>

In this connection we might say that the assessment for the year 1937, to be used as a basis for taxation in 1938, was started by the Board of Revision of Taxes with the necessary aid of the assessors early this year. There are upwards of 474,000 properties of the value of about three billion dollars to be assessed. The Board and the assessors are now in the midst of this assessment, and volumes of work have been completed.

Acts, which have not been repealed, require surveys and records to be made, and these may well supply the information and data called for by Act “C.” The assessors, as lawful or de facto officers with their knowledge of the details of assessment, will thus be able to complete their work and act in appeals taken after their returns to the Board, as required by law.

The Act of May 22, 1933, P. L. 853, Section 402, defines assessable or actual value.

The sale price was entitled to great weight as an important item of evidence but market value was the actual value for assessment uninfluenced by vague theories of actual value. Likewise, a bona fide offer of sale is not solely determinative of market value, but is merely evidentiary: <em>American Academy of Music Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/321/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="321 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1165874" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0433-01">321 Pa. 433</a>.

Appellees maintain this permits an indefinite deferment of assessment without the compulsory requirement of assessments at reasonable intervals, or triennially. We construe the word “may,” as used in Section 3, as mandatory, and to provide that assessments must be made triennially.

The distinction between that case and the present one is clear. The Acts apply to all cities of the first class and are not by their title limited to Philadelphia, as in that case, which is the only county co-extensive with a city of the first class now or likely to be in existence. The new Acts provide a complete method for tax revision in all cities of the first class and a uniform procedure for assessment. The case of <em>Perkins v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/156/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="156 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="844956" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0554-01">156 Pa. 554</a>, cited by appellees for the same proposition, likewise discloses an important point of difference. There the Act of Assembly, although stated to apply to all cities of the first class, could apply only to Philadelphia, because it had reference to the erection of public buildings on one of two designated sites within the limits of that city. These two cases, as well as the case of <em>Commonwealth v.

The first objection is that it involves the preparation of bills by the Board of Revision of Taxes for city, school and poor tax purposes (Section 10). This is not unrelated to the general scheme of tax administration set up by Act “C” and it is certainly indicated in the title under the clause “imposing duties on the board of revision of taxes, etc.”</p>
    <p id="b259-4" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[139,946,1154,1346]]]'>The second objection is to the provision of Section 3 that “No distinction shall hereafter be made between farm and suburban property and urban property” in making assessments. Assessors were required to classify property under these headings in making a return to City Council so that it might impose a rate of tax on each of the three classes: Act of March 24, 1868, P. L. 443, Section 1; Act of May 13, 1856, P. L. 567, Section 6. Thus it is urged that since the Board is no longer to classify the property but to assess all property in one class on one standard, the City Council will have no means of imposing the various rates of tax according to classes, and thus the system of varying rates for the several classes is abolished without notice in the title. The same reasoning leads to the conclusion that Section 3 repeals, by implication, the rate classification. Regardless of the effect of this section of Act “C” the subject does relate to assessments and to the duties of those making them, and is germane to the subject matter of the bill as indicated in the title. The title of the present Act certainly indicates the intention of the legislature to deal with all matters relating to the system of tax assessment in counties of the first class and serves to place all property owners and other persons interested upon notice of its broad scope.</p>

Even if this should not be the law, it may be said that in view of the fact the Board was created by special and local act prior to the Constitution of 1874 and provision was made for appointment by these Acts, the legislature has the power to modify, enlarge or amend the provisions of these Acts without being restricted by the special and local clause. Therefore, there is no reason why the legislature cannot continue in force the old provisions as to the appointment of the members of the Board.
