The company was incorporated on June 7, 1932, for the purpose of manufacturing and selling chewing gum, succeeding to a business of the same character conducted by the plaintiff individually. <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>The defendant Gum is a solvent corporation and had total assets on August 31, 1936, of approximately $300,-000.</p>

A deadlock has resulted in corporate affairs due to the inability of the factions to agree upon the source from which gum base, the principal ingredient used in the manufacture of chewing gum, should be purchased, and the price to be paid therefor.</p>
    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[260,997,1151,477]]]'>Three of the individual defendants, namely, Canning, Hamilton and Barker, are financially interested in Sweet’s Laboratories, Inc. (hereafter called Sweets), a corporation which manufactures and sells gum base. They are directors of Sweets, and at the same time Hamilton and Barker hold directorships in Gum. It is from Sweets that Gum has purchased its base since its organization, with the result that it has become the largest customer and outlet for its product.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.6",458,[261,1485,1150,421]]]'>In 1936, plaintiff, who was then the president of Gum, as well as the owner of one-half of its stock, began to experiment with bases made by other companies, procurable at less cost. This action, which threatened the business of Sweets, was met by retaliatory measures on the part of defendants, resulting in the ouster of the plaintiff as president, and the assumption of the management of the company by Hamilton and Barker.</p>
    <p id="b458-7" data-blocks='[["BL_458.7",458,[261,1917,1151,251]]]'>The issue between the two factions is whether Gum must purchase its requirements of base exclusively from Sweets at a price fixed by the latter, or whether it may obtain its supplies in the open market on a competitive basis.</p>

The plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that this resolution was conditioned upon an oral agreement with Sweets that the price charged Gum would he no greater than that prevailing in the open market for a similar quality base. He asserted that the company can obtain its requirements of gum base from a concern called the Dreyfuss Company, whose product is superior in quality to that supplied by Sweets, at the price of 20 cents a pound as against 34 cents a pound charged by Sweets. As the parties were unable to adjust their differences, resort was had to this litigation.</p>
    <p id="b459-3" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[139,1070,1155,968]]]'>The plaintiff filed this bill alleging fraudulent mismanagement by Hamilton and Barker and a conspiracy by the several defendants to control and operate Gum for the sole benefit of Sweets, resulting in irreparable injury to the corporation and its shareholders. The court below after a preliminary hearing appointed a temporary receiver for Gum, but the order making the appointment was on appeal vacated by this Court. It was our opinion that while the evidence failed to sustain the charges of conspiracy, it did indicate that the dissensions among the shareholders and their inability to break the deadlock possibly made out a case within the <em>Business Corporation Law </em>of 1933, P. L. 364, sections 1107-9. The record was therefore remitted for further proceedings, without specifically limiting the parties or the court below, if the plaintiff requested leave to amend his bill, in order to state a cause of action within the applicable sections of the Business Corporation Law.</p>

On that day the directors of the company were six in number. S. J. Hamilton, John O. Barker, and Walter T. Fahy were representatives of Sweets upon the board, and Harold J. Conner, J. Warren Bowman (the plain<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>tiff) and William B. Rudenko were directors representing the interest of plaintiff. All directors were present at the meeting. Plaintiff presented a resolution directing the officers to make no further purchases of gum base from Sweets until the price charged therefor was reduced from 34 cents to 20 cents a pound, and that, until such reduction was made, all base be purchased from the Dreyfuss Company. The vote upon the resolution followed factional lines, as Conner, Bowman and Rudenko voted for the resolution, while Hamilton, Barker and Fahy voted against it. Mr. Rudenko thereupon moved that the votes of Hamilton and Barker be disregarded as both were pecuniarily interested in Sweets and were disqualified to vote upon the resolution. Mr. Fahy, as chairman of the meeting, declined so to rule, held the vote to be a tie, and the resolution lost. An objection to the ruling was noted upon the minutes of the meeting, it being contended by plaintiff that the resolution had been carried by a vote of three in favor to one against it. The company continued its purchases of gum base from Sweets at the price of 34 cents a pound.</p>
    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[262,1498,1153,748]]]'>On September 29, 1936, the plaintiff filed an amended bill, praying for relief under the pertinent sections of the Business Corporation Law. In due course the defendants answered to the merits. On the same day that the amended bill was filed a rule was granted upon the defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue, enjoining further purchases of gum base from Sweets. It came before the Court for hearing on October 2, 1936, and on December 28, 1936, the court below entered a decree directing “. . . That Gum, Incorporated, its officers, agents and employees be, and they are hereby enjoined and restrained from purchasing such base as is needed for the manufacture of their product from Sweet’s Laboratories, Inc.”</p>

The allowance of an amendment rests in the reasonable discretion of the court and in the absence of plain error its action will not be reversed: <em>Hileman v. Hileman, </em><a href="/pa/172/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="172 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="874064" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0323-01">172 Pa. 323</a>; <em>Lehigh &amp; Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. v.

    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[154,1388,1153,697]]]'>The contention of the defendants in this regard is without merit, because the amendments are well within and germane to the purposes for which we remitted the record, as clearly appears from the opinion of Mr. Justice Linn. We do not regard it as a reversible error that the plaintiff was not required to pay the costs incurred prior to amendment as a condition of the allowance of the petition for amendment. While such requirement is generally made, the matter is entirely within the discretion of the trial judge, and, in the absence of gross and manifest error, the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed upon appeal: <em>Hileman v.

The rule of law is too well settled to be questioned, — that there should not be substituted in corporate management the wisdom and <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>judgment of a chancellor for the discretion and skill of the directors elected by the shareholders to manage the corporation. It is not our intention to depart from the salutary principle that “courts of equity will not interfere with the internal management of corporations by means of suits brought by stockholders against directors, officers or other stockholders”: Pomeroy’s “Equity Jurisprudence,” Volume III, p. 2520, approved by this Court in <em>Whyte v. Faust, </em><a href="/pa/281/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="281 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="1087042" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0444-01">281 Pa. 444</a>, where we said further (p. 448) : “It is also the prevailing and general rule that a court of equity will not practically remove corporate officers by enjoining them from performing any of their customary duties.” See also <em>McDougall v.

    <p id="APQ" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[254,1103,1151,423]]]'>However, such is not the proper approach to the present controversy. The decree does not, in our opinion, restrain the officers of the company from performing their customary and proper duties. The issue here presented is more fundamental in its scope, and involves the question whether directors financially interested in a contract or transaction before the corporation, are disqualified to act or vote by reason of such self-interest.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[248,1537,1154,691]]]'>A director is not per se disqualified from voting upon matters in which he has a financial interest either direct or indirect. However, his participation in such a vote will be closely scrutinized, and if it appears that the director availed himself of his position to further his personal interests rather than the welfare of the company, action predicated upon that vote may be rescinded or restrained at the suit of those injured thereby. In <em>Schmid v.

The court below decided that their votes should not have been received in determining whether the resolution of July 9, 1936, was adopted. It found that they had “an adverse interest because of their connection with the ownership of Sweet’s Laboratories, Inc.,” and accordingly “were not qualified or competent to vote on the resolution of the board of directors of July 9, 1936.” It concluded that the resolution “was duly adopted by the board of directors of Gum, Incorporated, and is valid and binding upon the corporation and its officers.”</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[142,1278,1154,640]]]'>We are in accord with this determination, as the evidence supports these findings and the conclusions based thereon. No resolution of a former board of directors ordering that the company’s future purchases should be made exclusively from one source is binding upon a subsequent board, unless there is some contractual obligation which renders such resolution enforceable. Such a contract has not been established in the present case. Hence any effort of the officers or agents of Gum at this time to purchase base from Sweets contrary to the resolution of July 9, 1936, is an invalid and improper act, and restrainable in equity.</p>

The power to grant relief in proper cases would be incomplete if the dominant faction within the corporation were permitted to dissipate the company’s assets while the affairs of the company were sub judice. It is desirable that, during the pendency of the present litigation, the affairs of the corporation be held as nearly as <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>possible intact until final decree. The company should not be required to pay during the interim a premium for its gum base, if it can obtain elsewhere supplies of the same quality at less cost, <em>for the sole reason </em>that several of its directors and stockholders are the owners of, or financially interested in the concern that manufactures and sells the gum base to the corporation. While in <em>form </em>the restraining order may appear to change the existing business practice of Gum, in <em>substance </em>it preserves the status which alone will safeguard the company’s assets during the progress of the litigation.</p>

In <em>Republican Mountain Silver Mines v. Brown, </em><a href="/f/58/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="58 F. 644" data-case-ids="6735779" data-case-paths="/f/58/0644-01">58 Fed. 644</a>, 647, the rule was stated as follows by Thayer, J.: “Corporations are in a certain sense legislative bodies. They have a legislative power when the directors or shareholders are duly convened that is fully adequate to settle all questions affecting their business interests or policy, and they should be left to dispose of all questions of that nature without applying to the courts for relief. A stockholder in a corporation cannot successfully invoke the powers of a chancery court to control its officers or board of managers, or to wrest the corporate property from their charge through the agency of a receiver, so long as they neither do nor threaten to do any fraudulent or ultra vires acts, and so long as they keep within the limits of by-laws which have been prescribed for their governance. If in either of the cases last specified a stockholder is nevertheless dissatisfied with the business policy that is being pursued, or the methods of corporate management, he must seek redress within the corporation, in the mode prescribed by its charter and by-laws, rather than by an appeal to the court.” Our prior decisions have applied that rule: <em>Hlawati v.

A part of the agreement was that Gum, Incorporated, would purchase from Sweet all the base it required. This agreement to unite their interests, made in 1930, was carried out informally until May, 1932, when the corporation was formed. Mr. Bowman testified that the agreement to buy the chewing gum base from Sweet was conditioned that “the quality of your base will always be equal to that of any other base, and also your price will always be fair.” <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>On June 7, 1932, the following resolution was adopted by Gum, Incorporated: “RESOLVED, That all contracts for supplies of chewing gum base shall be made with Sweets Laboratories, Inc., and all purchases of said chewing gum base shall be made from said Sweets Laboratories, Inc.</p>

Sweet replied that the price could not be reduced because the base could not be produced for sale at less, and that Gum, Incorporated, was charged the same price as other customers paid Sweet for the same base.

Each interest had three directors. The learned court held that two of the directors representing the Sweet interest were disqualified from voting “on the ground that they were pecuniarily and otherwise interested in Sweet’s Laboratories, Inc.” The learned court does not explain what is meant by the words “otherwise interested in Sweet’s Laboratories, Inc.,” and I have no means of ascertaining it from the record. They were pecuniarily interested but it was precisely that pecuniary interest of each half ownership, which, in the beginning, led to Sweet’s becoming a half owner and the plaintiff becoming the other half owner of Gum, Incorporated, as has been stated. Such pecuniary interest cannot rightfully be regarded as disqualifying one of the half interests from voting, and allowing the other half interest to take the sole control. The Sweet directors were no more interested in the success of Gum, Incorporated, than the plaintiff’s directors. That they were also interested in Sweet could not be disqualifying because from the inception of their relations the intention was that they should act in both capacities. Each had precisely the same character of interest in the success of the corporation. The unfortunate thing was that parties who had set up a business with equal interests should have allowed their differences to reach a stage where they could not agree. There was no fraud in what the directors did at the board meeting; it was always possible by their organization to have a deadlock; but that was not fraud. The record does not present a case calling for the aid of equity to prevent a majority from wrongfully imposing on a minority.</p>
