There is no evidence that the title to the lots is not clear. The parties differ about the meaning of the policy as related to Wakefield Street, formerly called Garden Terrace, shown on a plan and used as a boundary in the description of the lots conveyed. Plaintiff contends that the policy insures “a marketable title to two lots situate on Wakefield Street (40 feet wide) as a public street,” and finds it necessary to use the words “public street” to de<a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>scribe its contention; the words are not in the policy which presents no difficulty of construction as drawn.</p>
    <p id="b147-3" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[142,458,1154,1243]]]'>An account of the plotted street will be of assistance. A District Surveyor’s plan dated March 3,1925, entitled, “Plan of lots made for S. Perlman, 22nd Ward, Philadelphia,” is in evidence. Some of these lots front on Louden Street, some on Stenton Avenue, others on Garden Terrace which divides the two groups of lots, those abutting on one side of the street from those on the other. In Stenton Avenue appeared the words “Legally and Physically Open”; within the lines of Louden Street the words were “Not Open or Dedicated”; “On City Plan but not Physically or Legally Open”; within the lines of Garden Terrace the words were “Proposed St. Not on City Plan Not Open.” Altogether some 70 lots of ground were laid off with dimensions, etc., specified. There is also a later District Surveyor’s plan dated June 30, 1927. On it Louden Street is marked “On City Plan but not Physically or Legally Open”; Stenton Avenue is marked “Legally and Physically Open.” What on the former plan was Garden Terrace (with a slight variation at one end not material to the point for decision) is called Wakefield Street on this plan and within the lines of the street appear the words “Not on City Plan Not Open.”</p>

January 20, 1926, Perlman, owning the entire tract, which was vacant ground, made a mortgage to one Moss, describing as one tract all the lots on the west side of Garden Terrace and, as another tract, all the lots adjacent to the east side of it. In the mortgage to Moss the tracts were designated “according to a Survey and Plan thereof made March 3, 1925” by the District Surveyor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> One of the tracts was described as extending <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>from the side of Louden Street to and along the east side of Garden Terrace, and the other as extending along the north and west sides of Garden Terrace. This mortgage was foreclosed in 1927 and the property bought by one Jones. Jones conveyed to Adelman. Meanwhile, on May 19, 1926, between the date of the mortgage and the foreclosure, a judgment was entered against Perlman which, it is said, became a lien on Perlman’s interest in the bed of Garden Terrace as plotted. So far as appears, this judgment did not affect adversely the easement in the plotted streets vested by the prior mortgage. On August 4, 1926, Perlman made a formal deed of dedication to the city of the bed of the street now designated Wakefield Street as laid out on the plan of June 30, 1927. This deed was accepted by the Board of Surveyors on November 21, 1927.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Adelman, who purchased from Jones, mortgaged the same two tracts to plaintiff, again describing them as extending along the sides of the streets plotted on the plans. This mortgage was foreclosed in 1929 and plaintiff became the purchaser ; it then sold them to Friedman and took a mortgage from him; it is in this transaction that defendant issued the policy of title insurance now in suit, plaintiff having become owner by purchase at the foreclosure of the mortgage held by it.</p>

In the present case the description in the mortgage covered two lots or parcels of ground (A. &amp; B.) separated by a street referred to as Garden Terrace [now Wakefield Street].

Moreover, the mortgage includes all ‘Streets, Alleys, Passages, Ways — and Appurtenances, thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining.’ By the execution of the mortgage, rights of third parties accrued in Garden Terrace as a street, and under the case above cited, the Perlmans [who adopted or made the plan] impliedly at least covenanted that that street should be opened and remain open forever for use and convenience of the lot owners and to the public as a necessary incident to the use by the lot owners.”</p>
