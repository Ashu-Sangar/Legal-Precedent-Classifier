The question here involved, stated more precisely, is whether this Act of April 28, 1937, P. L. 473, validly amends five sections (1 to 5 inclusive) of the Act of June 23, 1911, P. L. 1123. The relevant provisions of these Acts of Assembly are considered in the following discussion.</p>

No decision having been rendered by the court below, and in view of the importance of the questions involved, the order for a special certiorari was made by this Court on June 15, 1937. Hence the matter is now before us upon a record composed only of the pleadings.</p>

L. 1123, which established for the first time in each county a permanent Board of Viewers. The Act of 1911 is general in its scope. It provides in Section 1 for the qualifications of viewers; in Section 2 for their appointment by the judges of the courts of Common Pleas in the respective counties; in Section 3 for a term of office of three years, subject to the power of the court which made the appointment to remove members for cause at any time; in Section 4 for the compensation to be paid the viewers; in Section 5 that upon petition for viewers, “the court shall appoint a board of view of three members — one of whom shall be learned in the law — from among the board of viewers of the county, ...” Subsequent sections of the Act specify the duties of such boards of view, with respect to public hearings, the reports of their findings, and of the damages or benefits assessed. It is provided that rules and regulations governing procedure, and for exceptions and appeals from the action of the board of view, be adopted.</p>

    <p id="b425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[146,671,1148,255]]]'>Thus it appears that, by the Act of 1937, in counties of the first class the courts are limited in the selection of “Boards of View,” not as heretofore to the personnel of the “Board of Viewers,” but to the personnel of the “Board of Revision of Taxes.”</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[144,946,1152,644]]]'>The respondents assert that the Act of 1937 is unconstitutional for the following reasons: (1) It violates Article V, Section 1 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania as an invasion of the judicial power; (2) it conflicts with Article III, Section 7 and Article V, Section 26 prohibiting the General Assembly from enacting local or special laws regulating the practice or jurisdiction of the courts, and requiring the laws relating to courts to be general and of uniform operation; (3) it offends Article I, Section 11 because it will result in the denial or delay of right and justice guaranteed to every citizen by this provision of the Constitution.</p>

It is contended that, by restricting the class from which viewers may be appointed, the courts are prevented from exercising their judicial function of selection and control of triers of fact. The same argument was made when the constitutionality of the Act of 1911 was contested. In <em>Reber’s Petition, </em>supra, that statute was attacked on the ground, inter alia, that the province of the judiciary was invaded by the limitation which was imposed upon the selection of road jurors. The objection was overruled by the trial court and was not raised on appeal. In dismissing the contention, Judge Endlich, whose opinion for the court below is reported in <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%20D.%204" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 Pa. D. 4">21 Dist. Rep. 4</a>, said, (p. 7) : “Whether in this respect the mode heretofore pursued of appointing juries of view from the whole body of electors, freeholders, etc., be a wiser one or not than their selection from a small standing body of men set apart for that purpose, and by their frequent service and increasing familiarity with all it concerns supposed likely to become experts in such matters, it cannot be denied that the legislature has the power of determining that question and ordaining which mode shall be followed.”</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[258,1588,1152,422]]]'>In this connection it must be borne in mind that the remedy by proceedings before a board of view, is wholly statutory: <em>Locust-Broad-Eighth Street Subway Cases, </em><a href="/pa/319/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="319 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1162328" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0161-01">319 Pa. 161</a>. As we there said (p. 165), “The basic question is whether there is a remedy by the board of view procedure. As such remedy is not in the course of the common law, we look to the statutes to see whether it has been provided.”</p>
    <p id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.6",426,[258,2022,1150,206]],["BL_427.1",427,[145,337,1153,524]]]'>The Board of Yiew is purely a creature of statute. Therefore the legislature possesses unlimited power to prescribe the conditions under which that remedy shall be enjoyed, and the rules and regulations incidental to <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>its exercise, without invading in any respect the domain of judicial power. If the legislature may say, as it frequently has in the past without successful challenge, that the selection of the members of the jury of view shall be made from electors only, or from freeholders only, or from electors resident in the immediate vicinity of the lands, or from a small body of citizens, it may validly impose further restrictions upon the class of citizens from which the selection of the jury is to be made.</p>
    <p id="b427-3" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[148,881,1153,861]]]'>However, it is not in derogation of the judicial power to prescribe that persons appointed by the courts to pass upon certain questions of fact shall be designated from an established and experienced panel of experts, particularly qualified to determine such questions. It was this consideration, apparently, which was a motivating force behind the passage of the Act of 1911. As we said in <em>Reber’s Petition, </em>supra (p. 632) : “Evidently it was felt that there was need of improvement in the character of work done by viewers in estimating damages caused by the exercise of the power of eminent domain. The legislature has endeavored to meet this need by providing a system in which jurors and members of boards of view, through permanent appointment, may gain the knowledge and experience in dealing with these questions which will yield better results.”</p>

By the Act of 1937 this choice is limited <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>to the seven members of the Board for Revision of Taxes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a> We cannot agree that this change works any unconstitutional impairment of the power of the courts freely to exercise their judicial functions. With the wisdom or desirability of the legislation now under attack, we are not concerned. It is not for us to determine that the members of the Board of Revision of Taxes are not as well qualified to serve as viewers as the members of the Board of Viewers.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[255,831,1149,1020]]]'>The respondents argue that the “members of the board of revision of taxes, must first, as assessors, determine the value of all real estate for purposes of taxation, . . . Later, as boards of view, they will sit in judgment upon the opinions they have already formed and expressed as to that value.” They contend that the board will become so biased that the appointment of viewers from among its number amounts to the denial of a fair and impartial trial. It is unconstitutional, they assert, for public officers who have made the appraisement of property for taxation purposes, to determine the value of the same property in a condemnation proceeding to which the county is a party in interest. This argument is based upon a false premise. Respondents assume that the hearing before the Board of View is in the nature of a trial, which must be surrounded with fundamental guarantees of impartiality, without which there is a denial of due process of law. Such is not the case. The functions of a board of view are not juridical.</p>

Proceedings before it are merely a <em>preliminary </em>step, provided by statute to ascertain tbe damages and to afford a report or estimate which may be the basis for an agreement between the condemning body and the property owner, fixing the damages to be paid. It saves in many instances the time and expense of a jury trial. The property owner, however, is not concluded by this report, but is entitled as a matter of right, secured to him by the Constitution, to demand that his claim be heard by a court and jury. He is thus protected from any bias or prejudice on the part of the board, before which his case was preliminarily presented. Where the right to a jury trial to assess damages for the taking of property is not denied, due process of law is not infringed.</p>

Article XVI, Section 8, says: “Municipal and other corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use shall make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed. . . . The General Assembly is hereby prohibited from depriving any person of an appeal from any preliminary assessment of damages against any such corporations or individuals made by viewers or otherwise; and the amount of such damages in all cases of appeal shall on the demand of either party be determined by a jury according to the course of the common law.”</p>

This right to a trial by a common law jury is vital upon the point we are now considering. The prohibition imposed upon the legislature is that it shall not interfere with the property owner’s right to appeal to the court, and there to have a jury trial. The hearings held before a board of <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>view obviously do not constitute the jury trial thus guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>

There can be no doubt, however, that it is entirely proper to differentiate between counties of the first class and other counties with lesser population, with respect to the qualifications of persons appointed to serve on boards of view. This distinction was recognized in the Act of 1911, which respondents contend is still the law. In Section 1 of that Act different qualifications are prescribed for members of boards of view in counties having a population in excess of one million than for those of smaller population. Classification is primarily a legislative question. For us to hold invalid the classification adopted in the Act before us would be to disregard completely the amendment of 1923, which was adopted in order to permit the enactment of legislation such as this — framed to meet the conditions peculiar to one of the classes of <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>counties of the Commonwealth. It is apparent that the questions arising in eminent domain proceedings may be different in counties almost entirely urban than in those which are rural, or suburban in character.</p>

It is pointed out that the Board of Revision of Taxes of Philadelphia consists of seven members, whose duty it is to make a triennial assessment of each of the many parcels of land within the county, and in addition to assess for taxation all personal property therein. This, respondents argue, in itself is an extremely heavy burden, and the members of the Board will not be able to perform promptly the further duties laid upon them by this statute. There is little merit in this contention. While it would seem that the legislature has seen fit to place extremely heavy duties upon the Board of Revision in counties of the first class, we cannot judicially determine that it will be impossible for members composing this Board to perform expeditiously these duties.</p>
