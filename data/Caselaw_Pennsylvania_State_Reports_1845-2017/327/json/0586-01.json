The evidence shows that appellee started his automobile across a thirty-six foot cartway when appellant\u2019s street car was at rest two hundred feet away. He reached a space between the two tracks when the car was one hundred twenty-five feet away. His car was struck in the rear just as he was leaving the path of the street car. We could not hold appellee guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law; the statement of facts clearly show this case was for the jury.\nJudgment affirmed.",
