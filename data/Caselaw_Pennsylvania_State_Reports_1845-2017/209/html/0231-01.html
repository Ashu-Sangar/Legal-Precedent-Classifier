The property- had been appraised by a committee of stockholders at the sum of $24,662.21, and it was transferred by the company to Payne and Wetter at this valuation in payment pro tanto of the debt due by the company to them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b263-8" data-blocks='[["BL_263.9",263,[187,1619,1176,357]]]'>This transaction was about January 1,1898. It was three years later when the litigation, which arose in consequence of what had taken place, fixed the liability of the trustees. They then filed the account which is now before us. Meanwhile the property remained in their possession until it was finally sold for a smaller amount than the valuation at which it was taken by Payne and Wetter.</p>

However honest they may have heen in their contention, the effect was, in all probability, disastrous in its consequences upon the market value of that for which they were accountable, and it would seem to be inequitable tó visit such a result upon the innocent creditor, whose activity was finally rewarded with success. The former decree of this court was intended to fix the liability of the trustees at the sum which they had substantially agreed to be the value of the property when they took it.</p>

On the same grounds we conclude that the report need not again be returned to the auditor for the purpose of taking proofs as to the price actually realized for the property when the sale eventually occurred. That is quite immaterial if we are right in the views already expressed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[273,1256,1175,199]]]'>The second question involves the right of Payne and Wetter to share pro rata in the distribution of the fund as creditors.

    <p class="summary" id="b264-6" data-blocks='[["BL_264.7",264,[271,1463,1174,404]]]'>In the adjudication originally filed in this case the question was raised, and it was then held that Payne and Wetter would be allowed to share in the distribution like the other creditors. We do not now intend to depart from the conclusion then expressed. So far as we are aware, there is no ruling upon the question in our own state to guide us, and we are not convinced, by the reasoning in the cases cited from other states, that we were wrong in the first instance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b264-7" data-blocks='[["BL_264.8",264,[268,1876,1176,559]],["BL_265.1",265,[158,379,1179,1031]]]'>If the case were one of actual bad faith on the part of those who were held as a matter of law to be trustees, we should have no hesitation in postponing them until all other creditors should be paid in full. There is, however, nothing in the case which shows any intentional wrongdoing on their part—nothing to indicate that they did not act with full honesty of purpose towards the plaintiff and all other creditors if there were any. What was done was done publicly, without the slightest attempt at concealment. Nevertheless, for very good legal reasons, the conduct of the transaction involved Payne and Wetter in liability, as trustees, and we so declared. We do not think <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>that we are bound to punish them further by holding that, notwithstanding they had no bad motives, and did no moral wrong, they must be debarred from the fund under distribution until all other creditors are paid. Such a penalty would be disproportionate to the nature and gravity of their action. The argument put forward, on behalf of the plaintiff, that such a disposition of the question would enable an experiment to be tried to obtain a preference without injury, if the experiment failed, does not apply with force to the case in our judgment. The making of such an experiment would, of itself, exhibit the intention to do a wrong, which could properly be visited by a postponement of the claim which the creditor attempted to prefer. An honest mistake, however, ought, we think, to be allowed to pass without such a serious result. In this particular case the trustees have, it must be presumed, in the expenses of litigation and in the depreciation of the value of the property, which was the bone of contention, suffered a penalty fully adequate to meet the demerits of their conduct. We, therefore, must also sustain the auditor in his finding upon the second question which we have discussed.</p>
