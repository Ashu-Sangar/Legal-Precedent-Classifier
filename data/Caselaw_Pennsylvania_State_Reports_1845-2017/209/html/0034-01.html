On July 17, 1900, William A. Douglas opened an account with the bank. Douglas at this time was a reputable and respected resident of Fox Chase, well known to the officers of the bank. Pie held responsible and lucrative positions with reputable financial institutions of the city of Philadelphia, being assistant receiv<a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>ing teller of the Guarantee Title &amp; Trust Company, and treasurer of the Chestnut Street Trust and Saving Fund Company. From the time of opening the account until November 21, 1901, his balances varied from several hundred tose veral thousand dollars. A few days prior to the last named date, Douglas applied to the cashier of the Fox Chase Bank for a loan of $2,500 on $4,400 of coupon bonds, payable to bearer, of the Wellsbach Light Company as collateral security. Mr. Pence, the cashier, regularly brought the matter to the attention of the board of directors, who, being satisfied with the responsibility of Douglas and the sufficiency of the collateral, directed the cashier to make the loan. Douglas’s note for $2,500 was accordingly discounted, and the amount thereof less discount, to wit: $2,461.25, placed to his credit on March 21,1901. This sum of money was subsequently drawn out of the bank by Douglas in the ordinary course of business and his account closed.</p>

He was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to prison. On these facts the learned judge of the court below being of opinion the question was one purely of law for the court, peremptorily directed a verdict for plaintiff, and this appeal by defendant followed the judgment entered on the verdict.</p>

Mason v. Frick, <a href="/pa/105/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="105 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="454312" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0162-01">105 Pa. 162</a>, held to the same -rule. In that case, like the one before us, the bond was that of a private corporation, payable to <em>bearer; </em>the plaintiff, Mason, kept it in his safe; the safe was broken open and the bond <em>stolen; </em>the thief transferred it to one Freeman, who knew when he took it that it had been stolen; Freeman pledged it as collateral security for a loan to Frick, the defendant, who took it in good faith. The rule that the bona fide holder of a stolen negotiable security is protected against a claim of the real owner was not even contested by the owner, but it was argued that the bond being that of a private corporation was not negotiable and that the holder took it subject to the equitable right of the real owner. It was held by this court that the law governing the case was that announced in County of Beaver v. Armstrong, <a href="/pa/44/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="44 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="484320" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0063-01">supra,</a> and that the bona fide holder was protected against the claim <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>of the real owner. The same rule was held by Judge SharsWOOD sitting in the district court of Philadelphia, Carpenter v. Rommel, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Phila.%2034" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="5 Phila. 34">5 Phila. 34</a>, where the defendant had purchased at the open board of brokers a lot of stolen negotiable railroad bonds.</p>

Good faith is defined to be honesty of intention and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry. The circumstances pointed to here as calculated to arouse inquiry are the facts, that Douglas although reputable was a young unmarried man living with his mother at the village of Fox Chase, not engaged in large business; that he held a subordinate position as clerk in a trust company; therefore it was improbable he would be the actual owner of this amount of bonds. The argument answers itself,—if he was a reputable young man living inexpensively and without ostentation with his mother, the conclusion would be that he did possess, from accumulations, securities worth |2,500, and that if he occupied a position of responsibility in a large trust company, he was honest and worthy. That he offered them in pledge for a loan at a small village bank instead of to a larger institution, only showed that like many others, especially those of limited means, he preferred just that kind of business. There does not seem to us to be a single circumstance in the case or anything in all of them together, which was calculated to arouse suspicion or put the defendant upon inquiry.</p>
