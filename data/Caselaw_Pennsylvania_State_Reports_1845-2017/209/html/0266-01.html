    <p class="summary" id="b297-8" data-blocks='[["BL_297.14",297,[163,995,1185,770]]]'>Pursuant to the provisions of the mine ventilation act of June 2, 1891, Mr. Gr. M. Williams was duly appointed by the governor to the office of inspector of mines. His term of office had not expired on January 1, 1902, when the amendatory act of June 8, 1901, went into effect. Before its expiration he resigned and Mr. E. E. Reynolds was appointed to fill the vacancy so occasioned. Mr. Reynolds resigned in December, 1903, whereupon the respondent was appointed in his stead by the judges of the court of common pleas of Luzerne county, pursuant to the provisions of section 13 of the act of 1901. In April, 1902, Mr. Martin had passed the examination prescribed by the act, and on May 16, 1902, had filed with the county commissioners the certificate to that effect required by law. ■ A subsequent examination was held in June, 1903, at which the respondent did not appear for re-examination.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-9" data-blocks='[["BL_297.15",297,[163,1773,1183,305]]]'>It is contended (1) that because he was not so re-examined he was ineligible as a candidate for appointment, and (2) that even if he were eligible, the judges were not empowered by the act of 1901, to appoint to a vacancy caused by the resignation during the term of office of an inspector appointed by.the governor under the act of 1891.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-10" data-blocks='[["BL_297.16",297,[164,2084,1182,251]]]'>Section 3 of article 2 of that act (viz : the old act of 1891) provides for the appointment of an examining board, etc., for the purpose of filling “ any vacancy that may occur in the office of inspector of mines by reason of resignation, removal for cause, or from any other reason whatever.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-11" data-blocks='[["BL_297.17",297,[164,2343,1181,96]],["BL_298.1",298,[280,364,1178,189]]]'>In view of that fact that the examiners were appointed “ In order to fill any vacancy,” etc.—and since the old act fixed no <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>time for the performance of their duties, they might well doubt whether they had any right to hold an examination until after the vacancy occurred, and in practice this rule seems to have prevailed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[278,570,1181,663]]]'>The practical result was that, in case of vacancy, the district concerned must remain without an inspector, and the dangers of such a situation continue for at least two weeks, pending advertisement of the examiners’ meeting, and as much longer as might be required to complete the examination, select a candidate for recommendation to the governor, and have him properly commissioned. Indeed, the act contemplates a possible disagreement of the examiners in their selection, in which event the court must dissolve the board and appoint a new one with like additional delays. It is quite conceivable that successive disagreements by sucessive boards might postpone appointment to the vacancy for a long period, during which the district would be without a local inspector.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b298-6" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[277,1243,1182,560]]]'>This defect is removed by the amendment of 1901, requiring examinations to be held at least yearly whether vacancies exist or not, and thus creating a body of competent men from whom an inspector may be promptly selected whenever a vacancy occurs. The amendment does not merely add something to or change some provision of the former enactment, but abrogates it entirely and substitutes a new one. Article III of the act of 1891 is amended “ so as to read ” in a particular way. This operates as a repeal of all its former provisions not incorporated in the amendment: Reid v. Smoulter, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20Pa.%20824" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="128 Pa. 824">128 Pa. 824</a>; Luzerne Water Co. v.

    <p class="summary" id="b298-7" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[277,1813,1179,616]]]'>Among the matters retained in the new article is the expression of the purpose of its enactment. As in the old act, so in the new, the article covers the subject, “ Inspectors and Inspection Districts,” and provides for the appointment of examiners, etc., “ in order to fill any vacancy in the office of inspector of mines.” The act is surely broad enough to cover any such vacancy whatever, whether the former incumbent had been appointed under the old act or elected under the new. Indeed, the continuance in office after the amendment should go into effect, of inspectors appointed by the governor under the act of 1891 is expressly recognized and provided for in section 7 of the amendatory act.</p>

      <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>So also the term of office (five years) created by the former act is distinctly recognized and referred to in .that section. It is there provided that the “ present inspectors who hold office under the appointment of the governor of the commonwealth shall continue in office until the expiration of the term for which they have been appointed,” and that “ at the expiration of the term of office ” of any such inspector the vacancy so occasioned shall be filled by election. If it occur in any other way—as by resignation during the term-—-there is no provision for filling it other than by appointment by the judges as prescribed by section 13. If it could not be filled in that way it could not be filled at all. The governor could not do it (1) because the act empowering him to appoint has been repealed, and (2) because, if it had not been, he could only appoint for a full term of five years, whereas the amendment expressly requires an election for three years at the end of existing terms of office. - The judges could not do it because not authorized. Such a vacancy must, therefore, remain unfilled, thus defeating to that extent the express purpose of the enactment to provide for the filling of any vacancy that may occur, etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[171,1407,1182,861]]]'>We are of opinion that section 13 contemplates that “any vacancy in the office of inspector of mines ” which occurs during the term for which the former incumbent was appointed or elected is to be filled by the judges by appointment for the unexpired term, “ said appointee to be one of the persons having filed with the county commissioners of said county a certificate from the board of examiners showing that he passed a successful examination before the said board, and is duly qualified as hereinbefore mentioned”—i. e., qualified as a candidate for election would have to be, as specified in section 9. That is to say, the appointee must possess these qualifications : (1) He must have filed the required certificate, (2) be a citizen of Pennsylvania, (3) thirty years of age or more, (4) have knowledge of the different systems of mining, (5) must have produced to the examining board evidence of five years’ experience, etc., (6) must have had experience in mines where explosive gases are evolved.</p>

That the amendatory provision entitled “ Article II—Inspectors and Inspection Districts ” should be a substitute for and fully supply that part of the act of 1891 also entitled “ Article II—Inspectors and Inspection Districts.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b300-7" data-blocks='[["BL_300.6",300,[276,838,1177,301]]]'>2. That they meant to remedy the mischief of a possible long delay in filling a vacancy in the office of mine inspector, by requiring frequent examinations (at least annual) without regard to whether a vacancy existed or not, and thus supply a reserve force of competent men from whom vacancies could be filled without delay.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b300-8" data-blocks='[["BL_300.7",300,[276,1149,1177,289]]]'>8. That they contemplated the filling of a vacancy by election, only where such vacancy should arise by expiration of the term of office and not where it should occur during said term, and that without regard to whether the term began by reason of election under the new act or by appointment under the old.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b300-9" data-blocks='[["BL_300.8",300,[275,1458,1179,703]]]'>4. That the lawmakers used the phrases “said inspector” and “ said term of office ” with reference to the preceding context of the enactment as a whole, referring to elected inspectors only or to mine inspectors as a class, irrespective of how they were chosen, according to whether the one reference or the other would best harmonize with their general intent to cover the entire subject of “ Inspectors and Inspection Districts.” For example, where in section 10 it is provided that “The salary of each of said inspectors shall be three thousand dollars per annum,” etc., the legislative purpose was to fix the salary to which a mine inspector should be entitled, whether elected or appointed, and not merely to provide compensation for elected inspectors and leave appointed inspectors unprovided for. '</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b300-10" data-blocks='[["BL_300.9",300,[275,2181,1178,251]],["BL_301.1",301,[164,361,1177,666]]]'>Nor in our opinion did they intend by sections 12 and 15 to impose the duties therein prescribed upon inspectors by election only; nor, by section 14, that if an elected inspector should become incapacitated a deputy might be appointed, but not if the incapacitated officer happened to be appointed in<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>stead of elected; nor, by section 19, to give this court jurisdiction to investigate charges of incompetency or malfeasance, etc., in case the inspector in question were elected and to deny such jurisdiction where (as in this case) the official concerned was appointed. Neither, by parity of construction, do we think that by section 18 it was intended that, if a vacancy occurred during the term of office of an elected inspector it could be filled by appointment, but if during the term of an appointed inspector it could not be filled at all. Such a construction, as already observed, would be manifestly at variance with the expressed purpose of the legislature to provide a way by this act for the filling of “any vacancy that - may occur in the office of inspector of mines.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[155,1037,1184,1384]]]'>Assuming that the judges have the power to appoint to the vacancy here in question, there is nothing in the act restricting the exercise of that power to candidates whose successful examination shall have been passed within one year or any other specified period before the time of appointment. It might be that at the time fixed for the latest examination no candidates appeared, while a dozen may have passed successfully at the last preceding one and filed their certificates. And that might have been a month earlier, for the act leaves the frequency of the examination to be fixed by the board, “ at least ” one to be held each year. Was it the legislative intent that in such case no appointment could be made until the dozen who had qualified themselves by doing all that the act required them to do should have done something more which the act does not require them to do, to wit: pass another examination within a particular period of time ? To so hold would be to read into the statute what is not there and thus bring about that delay in filling this important position which it was the apparent object of the act to avoid. The evident purpose of the requirement for an examination is to obviate the danger of an incompetent and unfit person being chosen as a mine inspector. If this purpose could only be effected by a yearly re-examination of the same person, the legislature, presumably, would have said so. On the contrary they have provided that one examination shall qualify an elected inspector for three years, without a re-examination during his term,—yearly or at any other stated time.</p>

      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>The lawmaking power has seen fit to impose upon the judges the duty of selecting a proper person from among those possessing certain specified qualifications. Such selection has been confided to their discretion. In its exercise it is to be presumed that they will be guided by those same considerations of fairness and good judgment which should influence the performance of judicial functions. Thus, for example, we may conclude that the legislature assumed that the judges would not appoint some one whose certificate of examination was so old as to afford no evidence of his fitness to cope with modern conditions, and so refrained from introducing into the act a time limitation which might be productive of more harm than good. If, in the exercise of their discretion the judges were to draw from the act some indication of the legislative intent as to limitation of time in this respect, such intent would seem to be that the passing of an examination would qualify any one who succeeded in doing so for not less than three years ; for it would surely be fair to assume that if it qualified a man who was elected to office for a period of three years, it would equally qualify another man who passed the same examination for a like period of time, even though the latter should not happen to be elected.</p>
