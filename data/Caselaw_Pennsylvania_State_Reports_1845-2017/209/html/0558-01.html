L. 175, and charges that the judges of the court of common pleas of this county had “ no warrant of law for calling in other judges to sit in this cause and the proceeding before them was corain non judice.”</p>

They are judges of the court of common pleas of Blair and Philadelphia counties respectively and presided at the request of the two judges of the court of common pleas of the county of Dauphin for what was deemed good and sufficient cause.

The judges who sat in the mandamus proceedings were sitting as judges of the court of common pleas of Dauphin county, so far at least as concerns the complainant; sitting as a court they pronounced the sentence of the law ; and we are asked to say by a decree that the act was contrary to law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b590-9" data-blocks='[["BL_590.9",590,[303,1979,1180,348]]]'>The function of an injunction is to compel inaction, that of a mandamus to compel action. If the defendant in the mandamus failed to obey the peremptory writ, he would be in contempt, and if we were to restrain him, he would be subject to contradictory orders, one by a court of common pleas and another by a court of equity. A court ought not to put a defendant in conflict with the order of another court.</p>
