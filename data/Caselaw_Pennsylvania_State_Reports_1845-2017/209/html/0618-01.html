But the title to the ground occupied by public buildings is vested in the county only for public use. Section 9 of the Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 537, declares that the titles of courthouses, jails, prisons and work houses together with the lots of land thereunto belonging, “ shall be and they are hereby <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>vested in the respective counties for the use of the people thereof, and for no other use.” By section 10 of the same act the commissioners are required, having first obtained the approbation of two successive grand juries and of the court of quarter sessions, .... to erect such building or buildings as may be necessary for the accommodation of the courts.</p>

They possess no power and can incur no obligations not authorized by statute. The general rule is thus stated in Dillon on Mun. Corp. sec. 997: “ In the United States there is no common-law obligation resting upon quasi corporations, such as counties, townships, and New England towns, to repair highways, streets or bridges within their limits, and they are not obliged to do so, unless by force of statute. Even when the legislature enjoins upon corporations of this character the duty to make and repair roads, streets and bridges, and confers the power to levy taxes therefor, the general tenor of the decisions is to treat this as a public and not a corporate duty, and to regard such corporations in this respect as public or state agencies, and not liable to be sued civilly for damages caused by the neglect to perform this duty, unless the action be expressly given by statute.”</p>

It was said (page 214) : “ The fact that a county has certain rights recognized in law as its own, does not sever it as a body from the state <em>i </em>but only distinguishes it in the state, and as a part of it, and allows local officers to enforce, in the name of the county, certain rights and duties which otherwise would have to be enforced in the name of the state. The institution of local divisions is merely a means of government, and counties and their officers are but parts of the machinery that constitutes the public system. This form of administration is no more a division of the government than is the allotment of particular localities, or particular functions, to what are usually called state officers.”</p>

But they lack the legislative faculty, and so are not, strictly speaking, corporations. Still, they are quasi corporations. They can perform many of the functions of proper municipalities. They can sue and be sued, can purchase, hold and alien lands, can appoint agents to execute their will, and can evidence their acts by a common seal. But because they cannot legislate, everything done by the agents of a county must be first authorized by the legislative power of the state.”</p>

For an elaborate collection of the authorities upon the subject, see the note to Hughes v. County <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>of Monroe, as reported in <a href="/citations/?q=39%20L.R.A.%2033" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="39 L.R.A. 33">39 L. R. A. 33</a>. The reasoning upon which these cases stand is based upon the doctrine that a county is a subordinate political division of the state, standing in the same attitude, and cannot therefore be sued, without statutory permission authorizing such action. An example of such reasoning is found in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in Dosdall v. Olmstead County, <a href="/minn/30/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="30 Minn. 96" data-case-ids="8875291" data-case-paths="/minn/30/0096-01">30 Minn. 96</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> upon facts closely resembling those of the present case. The court there said: “ The sole question to be determined in this case is the liability of the county of Olmstead for an injury alleged to have been suffered by plaintiff from falling through a broken sidewalk upon the courthouse premises, belonging to the county, which had become unsafe and dangerous through the negligence of the county commissioners, whose duty it was to keep the same in repair.</p>

Their officers are public officers, selected or appointed under the general laws, and perform their duties, which are public, under the authority of the state. They are bodies politic, with limited powers defined by law, and are hence frequently called quasi corporations: Dillon on Mun. Corp. (2d ed.) sec. 10 a. They are created wholly for a public purpose. The liability in this case is predicated upon the fact that the defendants, the board of county commissioners, are the agents of the county, and that the plaintiff has suffered personal injury from their official neglect. They are the agents of the county in this sense, that the powers of the county can only be exercised through them, because the public can only act through officers. The functions of these officers are public. They are only such as the law enjoins. It is their duty to keep the courthouse in repair, because the law of the state commands it. It is a duty which they owe to the public, and they are accountable to the public alone for their negligence. It is not necessary here to refer to the distinction existing between mere neglect of official duty, and affirmative acts of individual officers resulting in special injuries, or between officers whose duties are wholly public, and those who owe a special <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>duty to those whom they serve for a compensation, as in the case of sheriffs, county clerks, etc.</p>

The almost unbroken current of the authorities is that, as to the latter class of corporations, no such liabilities attach unless expressly provided by statute. This doctrine is too well and too long established to be questioned, and should be regarded as the recognized policy of the state, which the legislature alone should change.”</p>

In the present appeal it is argued that as the duty of maintaining highways has been imposed upon townships in Pennsylvania, and consequent legal liability for neglecting to repair has been implied, no good reason exists for making a distinction which exempts counties from the same responsibility. But the answer is that the legislature has seen fit to make this distinction. The statutory duty is imposed upon townships to open, construct and keep in repair all public roads within their limits: Union Township v. Gibboney, <a href="/pa/94/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="94 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="486511" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0534-01">94 Pa. 534</a>.</p>
    <p id="b654-6" data-blocks='[["BL_654.7",654,[284,1598,1178,350]]]'>Under the Act of June 26, 1895, P. L. 336, counties are empowered to improve or construct certain roads, which shall thereafter be maintained as county roads, and kept in repair at the expense of the county. But this does not apply to a street or highway within the limits of a borough or city. With this exception, the care of highways outside the boroughs and cities is left to the townships.</p>

L. 537, it is made the duty of the commissioners of the county to keep the public buildings in repair. But this does not include the repair of the sidewalk, for the sidewalk is no part of the buildings, and it is a part of the street. The street includes the whole of the land laid out for public use as a highway: McDevitt v. People’s Nat. Gas Co., <a href="/pa/160/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="160 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="852217" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0367-01">160 Pa. 367</a>. We cannot see in the provisions of the act of 1834, any intention upon the part of the legislature to make the county liable to a <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>private action for a failure to repair the sidewalk. No other statute imposing any such liability has been brought to our attention, and clearly in the absence of a statute imposing such responsibility, the county cannot be held.</p>
