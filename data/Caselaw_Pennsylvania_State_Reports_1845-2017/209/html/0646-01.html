And further, the said P. R. E. E. Linton was for the above reasons under a common-law disability to divest her title to said land by power of attorney, or any other manner except that prescribed by the laws of England and in force at the time of the execution of the said power of attorney, and that the power of attorney offered in evidence'was, from the day of its execution, void for the purposes for which it is offered.</p>
