Bennett, guardian of Jesse C. Clagett, a grandson of testator, and a son of Mary Kemper. The petition set forth various proceedings in the orphans’ court wherein the petitioners sought <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>to surcharge the trustees in their third and fourth accounts, and to open the first and second accounts by bills of review. It was averred that in the answers to the bills of review, the trustees charged that J esse C. Clagett was an illegitimate son of Mary Kemper. The petitioners averred that such charge was scandalous and groundless, and that in proceedings before an examiner the trustees were compelled to abandon the charge. The petition further averred that Mary Kemper, and Jesse C. Clagett, through his guardian, had instituted against Thomas JR,. Fort, Jr., civil suits for damages for libel, and that these suits were still pending. The trustees filed an answer responsive to the petition, and the case was heard on bill and answer.</p>

To deprive the beneficiary of unrestrained control over his estate was the very object of the creation of the trust. The fundamental purpose of the creator of the trust was to protect his beneficiary from some anticipated danger, from creditors, from risks of business, from his or her own improvidence, or other like cause, or to protect ultimate beneficiaries from waste or spoliation of the estate by the immediate one. For this reason he substituted the judgment and control of the trustee for that of the cestui que trust, or of the courts.</p>

    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[270,641,1175,398]]]'>The petition for removal in the present case is founded on averments of inharmonious relations amounting to hostile litigation, overcharges and bad management on the part of the trustees, and insecurity of the trust funds. The case was argued on petition and answer. The answer being full and responsive, except in one particular that will be noticed, the court would have been warranted in dismissing the petition without more.</p>

While inharmonious relations between trustee and cestui que trüst, not altogether the fault of the former, will not generally be considered a sufficient cause for removal, yet where they have reached so acrimonious a condition as to make any personal intercourse impossible and to hinder the proper transaction of business between the parties, a due regard for the interests of the estate and the rights of the cestui que trust may require a change of trustee. “ If his management of the trust justly subjects him to criticism and to a lack of confidence by the cestui que trust, he should not be continued in control of the estate Neafie’s Est., supra. In the present case when the trustees were cited to file an account they set up in answer that Jesse C. Clagett one of the petitioners (by his guardian) and son of the other petitioner, was not legitimate, and therefore had no interest that entitled him to an account. No attempt was made to sustain this averment, except the statement that it was made upon information and belief and as it was admitted that the son was born in wedlock and bore the name of his mother’s husband and his legitimacy therefore not legally open to question, it is not easy to perceive the relevancy of the averment, or why it should have been made. As this matter is the subject of litigation still pending, we refrain from further comment, but should the litigation show no sufficient justification for the averment of illegitimacy the court below would be well warranted in entertaining a new petition for removal based on the conclusion that the answer was a gratuitous in-<a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>suit -warranting an inference that the conduct and management of the estate by the trustees were governed by other motives than a bona fide desire for the best interests of the petitioners.</p>
