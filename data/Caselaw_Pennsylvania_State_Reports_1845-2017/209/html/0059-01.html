The estate <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>is not committed to him with expressions of desire as to how he disposed of it. The testatrix makes the disposition herself. She gives him the estate. This carries with it the power to convert, sell, convey, assign and transfer. He could have expended the whole of it, for there is no limitation, restraint or condition attached to the bequest. But if he did not consume or expend it, then what remained at his death she gave to others. This is the reasonable interpretation of the will. He did not consume the whole; what remains, therefore, is her estate, and passes by her will to the legatees. ' -</p>
