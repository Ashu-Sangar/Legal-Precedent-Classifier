If the interpretation placed upon this will by the learned auditing judge should prevail, then should Jane E. Robinson die without issue, the fund for distribution would not be subject to distribution by the will, but would go to the next of kin under the intestate laws.. The interpretation put upon the will by the court below not only avoids intestacy, the result sought by law, but secures equality- of distribution among the children of testatrix. And this is the very substance of the ruling of the present chief justice in Woelpper’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/126/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="126 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="968893" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0562-01">126 Pa. 562</a>, and the other cases cited by appellant.</p>
