The railroad company each morning placed empty cars on the three side tracks, and the plaintiff’s duty was to, shift the cars on all three side tracks into position for loading in front of the ovens. This could be done by gravity without the aid of an engine. On the morning of the accident the railroad employees delivered cars on one of the side tracks, and the plaintiff was advised by the freight conductor that no more cars were to come on that particular track. Plaintiff then proceeded to work. The switch of the track on which the plaintiff was working had, through the neglect of some <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>one, been left open, and the cars which were intended for another of the side tracks ran through the open switch and started a car on which the plaintiff was working, severely injuring him. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff under the act of April 4, 1868, was a fellow servant of the railroad company’s employees by whose neglect the switch had been left open, and that he was not entitled to recover.</p>

He was employed by the H. C. Frick Coke Company in the capacity of car shifter in connection with the operation of their coke works at that place. This plant includes five double blocks of ovens, and the product thereof, which is considerable, is shipped out over the Pittsburg, McKeesport <em>&amp; </em>Youghiogheny Railroad, which is operated by the defendant. The main line of the railroad is some distance from the ovens, apd the empty cars are supplied and the loaded ones removed by a branch, which for some distance from the main line consists of but a single track, but to serve all the five double blocks of ovens, some of which appear to be located parallel to each other, it is necessary that they have other lines off the main branch, and as a consequence the coke company maintains three tracks in connection therewith, known as “ front track No. 2,” “ back track No. 2 ” and “ back track No. 3.”</p>

A few minutes thereafter while plaintiff was engaged between the rails on back track No. 2 at the end of the car from the switch connection, the car on which was loosened some kind of a hook in connection with the brake, suddenly started and the force operating to move it was of such character as to cause the car to knock him down and drive it over him, bruising and injuring him to such extent that the doctor who was at once sent for says, “ I considered the man dying when I saw him.” He was sent to the hospital, however, and, after lingering many weeks, in a measure recovered although he insists that his injuries, which were doubtless very serious, are of a permanent character and that in comparison with his previous self he is not a half a man.</p>

Cummings worked on a coal yard owned by McCue, the cars to which were delivered by means of abranch or side track and then by a switch and short track into the coal yard. The coal was brought from the mines by the railroad company and when cars got to the yard they were transferred from the main track to the side track and from the side track in on McCue’s track at the coal <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>yard. A short distance from McCue’s track there was another coal yard track belonging to the National Coal Company on which cars were delivered in the same way. At the time in question the railroad company brought in twelve cars on the siding,- six for McCue and six for the National Coal Company. McCue’s were placed on his track and the plaintiff and another man proceeded to unload them; the locomotive then with the other six ran back on the side track and so far as McCue’s track was then concerned they were done until such time as they were to come for the empty cars but their work on the siding was not yet completed; the other six were to be put in on the National Coal Company track and for that purpose the engine with the said six ears, after having withdrawn from the McCue track, came ahead at a rapid rate intending to pass McCue’s coal yard and shove them in on the National Coal Company’s siding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[154,1180,1179,510]]]'>When the locomotive and train drew back from McCue’s siding it was the duty of those in charge to change the switch connecting McCue’s track with the siding so as to direct and send the train on its return past McCue’s siding and upon the siding of the National Coal Company. This was neglected, the switch was not turned and when the train returned it ran back again upon McCue’s track and collided with the cars previously left there, injuring the young man Cummings who was one of the parties engaged on the cars on the McCue track in unloading, by which injuries he lost a leg.</p>
