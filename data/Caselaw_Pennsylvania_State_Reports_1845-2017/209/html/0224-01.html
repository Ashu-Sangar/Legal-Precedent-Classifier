    <p class="summary" id="b254-12" data-blocks='[["BL_254.17",254,[261,1857,1174,468]]]'>Plaintiffs and defendant entered into a contract for the sale of premises, No. 1814 Chestnut street in the city of Philadelphia, containing in front on Chestnut street twenty-five feet and extending in depth 235 feet to Sansom street. The price agreed upon was $77,500, to be paid in cash upon the execution and delivery of a good and sufficient deed of conveyance. By the terms of the agreement the title to the premises was to be good and marketable and the premises were to be conveyed clear of incumbrance “ and free from all restrictions.”</p>

Suit was brought, alleging a breach of the contract of sale on the part of the defendant. An affidavit of defense was filed alleging delay in the preparation of the title papers beyond the period stipulated in the contract, an outstanding mortgage upon the property, the existence of a building restriction, and the ordinance of the city of Philadelphia providing for the widening of Chestnut street, which affected the property.</p>

In the presént case, however, while the ground involved in the restriction could not be actually built upon by the owner, he would be entitled to such damages as might be awarded for taking the property into the bed of Chestnut street, and the amount of the claim to be presented before a jury appointed to assess damages, might be materially affected by the character of his title to the property involved. The case is ruled by Batley v. Foerderer, <a href="/pa/162/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="162 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="856752" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0460-01">162 Pa. 460</a>,467. “ The absolute and unqualified use incident to the unrestricted ownership in fee is thus converted into 6 one clogged with conditions and restrictions in its enjoyment.’ As was well said by Thayeb, P. J., in Lesley v. Morris, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Phila.%20110" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Phila. 110">9 Phila. 110</a>, ‘ a perpetual prohibition of this kind fastened upon property has a tendency not only to diminish the enjoyment of the estate, <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>but also to affect its marketable value to a considerable degree,—a degree very difficult to be measured by any pecuniary allowance made to the defendant, and which makes his equity incapable of accurate or reasonable adjustment in money.’ ”</p>

The restriction by ordinance did not absorb or supersede the restriction by the deed, for even if the ordinance should be repealed the covenant in the deed would still restrict the use of the five feet on the line of Chestnut street. .The effect of the ordinance is well stated by the learned judge below, and on his opinion the order discharging the rule for judgment is affirmed.</p>
