James S. Sampson was the owner of a farm. In the month of November, 1885, he mortgaged the farm to the Fidelity Trust Company. Three months thereafter he died. By his will Sampson left his property, real and personal, to his widow for life, remainder to his children. In 1890 Sampson’s executors filed their first and final account, which was adjudicated. After this the real estate in question, the farm, came into the possession of the widow and children of the decedent. The widow is dead. On June 21, 1896, the Commonwealth Trust Company took a mortgage secured upon three fourths of the shares of the six children of Sampson; the said three fourths interest have by mesne conveyances become vested in two of the children.</p>

If it was still the real estate of the decedent, the learned auditor was correct in his conclusion of law. If not, he should have awarded to the Commonwealth Title &amp; Trust Company directly its proportionate share of the fund. The question is, in our opinion, not a novel one, but was ruled in Hutchins v. Terradill, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Leg.%20Int.%20300" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Leg. Int. 300">21 Legal Int. 300</a>. There, as in the case at bar, the question arose upon the exceptions to the auditor’s report. The opinion of the court was delivered by Shabswood, P. J., and is as follows: “The questions presented on these exceptions may be briefly stated thus : Where land is sold under a mortgage subject to which it was held by a person who has been dead more than five years, and against whose estate there are no debts of record, is the balance of the proceeds, after discharging the mortgage, to be paid to the administrator of the decedent or to the heir of his alienee ? I state the question rather more broadly than the facts of the case are reported by the auditor. It is true that by the 33d section of the act of 1834, it is provided that ‘ in all cases where property, real or personal, of a decedent is sold upon execution, and more money is raised than is sufficient to pay off liens of record, the balance shall be paid over to the executor or administrator for distribution.’ But by the 24th section of the same act,- as interpreted in Kerper v. Hock, <a href="/watts/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts 9" data-case-ids="1838073" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0009-01">1 Watts, 9</a>, and the long line of cases following that decision, at the expiration of five years land becomes discharged, in the hands of the heir, from liability for the debts of the decedent, not debts of record. It would follow then, that the land ceased for all purposes to be the decedent’s estate, and becomes the estate of the heir. A judgment against the executor or ad<a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>ministrator after the time has elapsed under the sale by the sheriff, confers no title on the purchaser: Bailey v.

    <p class="summary" id="b247-3" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[207,534,1184,718]]]'>The case of Hutchins v. Terradill is almost on all fours with the case at bar, the only difference being that in the case at bar the mortgage -was given by the decedent, and in the case of Hutchins v. Terradill by the vendor of the decedent. "We do not see, however, how this can make any difference. A judgment obtained upon either of such mortgages is the same, and it is probable that Judge Sharswood, in deciding Hutchins v. Terradill had in mind the case not only of a mortgage given by decedent’s vendor, but also one given by decedent himself. In his opinion lie says, “ I state the question more broadly than the facts of the case are reported by the auditor,” and refers to the land being held subject to a mortgage, which applies equally to the land held subject to a mortgage of the decedent’s making or of his grantor’s.</p>

Terradill. One is the case of Matlack v. Roberts, <a href="/pa/54/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="54 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1006308" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0148-01">54 Pa. 148</a> (1867). The facts of that case, as given by the auditor, were as follows: William Roberts, by his will, proved May 4, 1841, devised his lands to his two sons, Joseph and John, charged with legacies. In August, 1863 (twenty-two years after the probate of the will), the real estate of the testator was sold by the sheriff on a judgment for a debt due by the said testator in his lifetime. The proceeds were brought into court and distributed by the auditor of the said court and confirmed. No question of jurisdiction was raised in this case in the court below. But, upon an appeal to the Supreme Court upon other matters, the court said: “ The effect of that sale was to vest a title in the purchaser free and discharged of the devise, and to substitute the proceeds of the sale for the land. The auditor made distribution .... The act of February 24, 1833, section 33, provides that the surplus proceeds of a sale upon execution shall be paid to the executor, who shall give security therefor before receiving the money. The proviso then follows that such money shall be distributed as the real estate of which it is the proceeds would have been. This was manifestly intended as the rule to govern the executor in making the distribution. Here the law was so <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>far disregarded, that the surplus was not paid to the executors, but it was actually distributed as the real estate would have been,” etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[257,532,1183,616]]]'>As is pointed out in the argument of counsel for the except-ants, there is manifest error in the report of this case. The real estate of the testator was sold in 1843, and as William Roberts died in 1841, the sale was within five years of the death of decedent. In the report of this case (I cite from the written argument of counsel for the exceptants) the sale is stated to have taken place in August, 1863, but it says the report was confirmed February 9, 1844, indicating that “ 1863 ” was a misprint, and should read “ 1843,” and a copy of the statement filed in that case, appended as an exhibit to the brief of the ex-ceptants, shows that the sale was had’in 1843; that is, within two years of the death of the decedent.</p>

The facts in brief were as follows: Joseph J. Karch died intestate May 22, 1886, leaving a widow and daughter. Letters of administration were granted to widow, who filed two accounts prior to 1890. There were outstanding several debts due by the estate, including testator’s mortgage, of about $1,500, which was foreclosed May 19, 1888, the administratrix being the purchaser for $8,150. She paid something on account, received her deed, and gave the sheriff judgment bond for the balance. The question of to whom amount of judgment bond should be paid was then referred to auditor. Upon exceptions to this report McPherson, J., after deducting sheriff’s costs, cost of audit, amount due the mortgagee and another small claim of $3.76, decreed the balance of the money to the administratrix. The Supreme Court in sustaining the lower court says: “ It is manifest that much money has been wasted, and labor incurred in vain, in this attempt to distribute a dead man’s estate in the common pleas.” The sale was there had within two yeai’s of decedent’s death, before the accounts of the administratrix had been settled, and before the lien of decedent’s debts had expired, and therefore is not a parallel case with the one under consideration. It would have been absurd for the Supreme Court to have considered to whom the fund would have gone had the sale been without the five years from decedent’s death when these facts were not before them, <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>and silence upon this subject merely indicates that it was not considered.</p>

Upon reference to arbitrators, they found an award in favor of plaintiff for $1,755, part of which, i. e., $650, was contracted prior to 1863. That in 1864 decedent purchased real estate, placing title in name of his wife, and that at least $2,000 of the consideration was paid by decedent out of his own money. Judgment was entered sci. fa. and alias issued bringing in widow and children of decedent, to which no answer being made, judgment was entered thereon. Fi. fa. issued against administrator, widow and children and real estate in name of wife. The real estate was sold under a vend. ex. in 1872, the proceeds paid into court and referred to auditor for distribution, who awarded the fund to the administrator (Kelly). The lower court sustained exceptions and paid judgment creditor. The Supreme Court reversed, Williams, J., delivering the opinion of the court. The facts of that case show that there was a sheriff’s sale of real estate had four years after decedent’s death upon a personal judgment obtained subsequent to the death of decedent. In such a case the fund goes to the administrator, because such judgment gives no preference over the general creditors of the decedent, and therefore the funds should be marshalled for the benefit of all creditors.</p>

The section of the act of February 24, 1834, directing the surplus to be paid to the executor or administrator on the sale of real estate by execution, was intended for the protection of creditors whose claims were liens not of record, and for the protection of other creditors entitled to participate in the fund. There being no such debts and no creditors of the decedent being entitled to participate in the fund, while on the other hand the real estate had vested in the legatees, the fund belongs to the legatees, their heirs and assigns, subject to such measures as may be right to preserve to the widow the income of one third.”</p>

The auditor is of the opinion that they are reconcilable.
