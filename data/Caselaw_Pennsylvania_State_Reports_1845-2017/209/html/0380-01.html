The defendant was the owner of a plot of ground in Germantown and also of land in the southern part of the city. Plaintiff advanced to defendant $50,000 to be applied as purchase money and. to the dis<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>charge of two small mortgages on the Germantown property and for this took from him as security the mortgage on that property now in dispute. Then, defendant desiring to build on this property cut it up into eighty lots, and agreed with plaintiff, that it should advance to him money to build upon the lots as the money was needed for the buildings, defendant to deliver to plaintiff as security therefor eighty separate mortgages in the whole aggregating $200,000, one on each lot. It was further agreed that the first or $50,000 mortgage should stand also as security for the completion of the houses and as a protection against mechanic’s and municipal liens; it was further agreed that the trust company would release the lien of the $50,000 mortgage on the eighty lots upon which the money was to be expended by defendant in the contemplated building operations.</p>
    <p id="b413-3" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[148,1151,1181,819]]]'>After a sheriff’s sale on the eighty mortgages the company did record a release on the properties sold. But no release was formally executed and delivered at the time by plaintiff nor did defendant ever demand one. Defendant went on with his building operations, plaintiff advancing him from time to time large sums of money; after some time a dispute arose between them, defendant alleging that the advances were not so rapidly made nor so large as agreed upon, stopped his work. Then the parties came together and adjusted their dispute, by another agreement, to wit: plaintiff to advance $65,000 to defendant on another wholly different building operation, and to be wholly relieved from further'ad vanees on the Germantown improvements; defendant agreeing that the advances already made should be repaid within ninety days; and that the $50,000 mortgage should stand as security to plaintiff for such advances until repayment.</p>

Nearly all of them were purchased by plaintiff. Defendant was present at the sale and bid on several of the lots. No notice was given by him of any defect in the title or any' incumbrance by prior lien, nor was there any motion to set aside the sale after it was made. After this sale of the eighty lots, plaintiff alleging that it had not been repaid its loans by <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>the money realized at the sheriff’s sale nor had it been repaid advances made on the $50,000 mortgage, issued this sci. fa. on that mortgage to collect the amount still payable to it. To this suit defendant filed affidavit of defense, averring that the $50,000 mortgage was held by plaintiff only to protect it against mechanics’ liens and municipal liens which might be filed against the eighty houses and to insure the completion of the houses, and that it had received other mortgages aggregating $200,000 as collateral security for the payment of the money advanced; that plaintiff did not hold the $50,000 mortgage as security for any money loaned to him, the defendant, and that all the property described in the said last named mortgage had been purchased by plaintiff at the sheriff’s sales ; and further, that plaintiff is not entitled to judgment on said mortgage because it has suffered no loss by any default of defendant or any failure by him in his contracts. The court gave judgment in default of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</p>

In that agreement is this stipulation: “ That all security mortgages and bonds held by the said company as security for the completion and against liens of the said one hundred and sixty-four houses, shall also be held by said company as security for the repayment of all moneys due it on the Germantown operation, with the same force and effect as though security mortgages and bonds had been originally given for both operations.” The plaintiff averred that the $50,000 mortgage on which this sci. fa. is issued was one of the security mortgages held by.it under this description; that the eighty separate mortgages <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>which had been foreclosed and sheriff’s sales had, were also security mortgages specified in the same clause of the agreement. Before this last agreement was made, one had been executed by the parties on February 23, 1900, in which this §50,000 mortgage is specially referred to as a security then held by the plaintiff for advances, liens, completion of houses, etc. In the agreement first noticed, that of April 13, 1901, there was further this additional clause : “ And the said John Devlin further releases the said company from any and all claims to make further advances to him under a certain agreement relating to his operation in Germantown, and agrees to repay the company all moneys heretofore advanced to him under said agreement together with its proper charges within ninety days from the date hereof.”</p>

The defendant avers this §50,000 mortgage was given only to cover mechanics’ liens and as a guarantee for the completion of the houses, but the averment is negatived by the seventh clause of the agreement of April 13. Plaintiff agrees only upon the performance by defendant of that condition, payment of money due it and its proper charges, to assign or transfer the mortgage. This intention is further reiterated in the short supplemental agreement (exhibit O) of the same day where substantially the same language is repeated.</p>

Ayres, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 485" data-case-ids="1852556" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0485-01">1 W. &amp; S. 485</a>. As to third parties who might have been misled by it, such intention might be ineffective. But here the only parties interested are appellant and appellee, and they, as we have already shown, with the expressed intention that the trust company should be protected in advances made on the §50,000 mortgage, agreed that it should be held by the company until such advances were repaid.</p>
    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.6",416,[288,1501,1177,459]]]'>Defendant in his affidavit avers that the eighty houses were not completed because of the trust company’s default in not making the advances it had agreed to make while the buildings were being put up. Every question of this kind was, necessarily, at issue in the suit on the eighty mortgages and must be considered as settled by the judgments in those suits. Nothing in the assignment of errors calls for further notice. The judgment entered by the court below with the limitations and exceptions therein set forth is affirmed.</p>
