Ordinarily the act of incorporation or the charter fixes the corporate location by name, but in the present case the act left the location to be determined by the trustees, the words of the act being: “ To 'be permanently located at such place in western Pennsylvania as the trustees hereafter may determine.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-7" data-blocks='[["BL_380.14",380,[271,1447,1178,500]]]'>Manifestly the act contemplated but one location as made by the trustees, and that this should be the permanent corporate location of the college in the same sense that it would have been if the name of the place to be selected by the trustees had been written in the act itself. No power is given to the trustees to make any temporary location and no power is given to them to make any second location or relocation. The act simply authorized the trustees to make one single permanent location, and this is all they had any authority to do under any circumstances.</p>

It is well settled that individ<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>ual citizens can maintain suits in equity against corporations to restrain unlawful acts committed in exercise of corporate power where such acts are a transgression of private property or contract rights. If a suitor can show that his private individual rights, which are personal to him and which do not pertain to him as an ordinary citizen in common with others, are about to be invaded by an unwarranted exercise of power on the part of the corporation, we are of opinion and so hold that he has a right to prevent it by the remedy afforded by injunction. To hold that the plaintiffs have no standing to maintain this suit would be to declare that they never acquired any rights whatever under their contract for the location of the college and for which they paid their , money. The express language of the act of June 19, 1871, giving to the courts power to restrain by injunction unlawful acts of corporations at the suit of individuals, covers all cases where it is alleged “ that the private rights of individuals are injured or invaded by a corporation claiming to have a right or franchise to do the act from which such injury results.” Certainly this act is broad enough in its terms to cover the injury complained of in this case and include the plaintiffs in the class of persons for whom these provisions were intended.</p>

    <p id="b382-7" data-blocks='[["BL_382.9",382,[290,826,1178,872]]]'>The decree entered in this case is fully sustained by the reasons stated in the opinion of the court. By a special act of incorporation Thiel College was to be permanently located at such place in western Pennsylvania as should thereafter be determined by the trustees. After it had been permanently located by action of the trustees at Greenville, Mercer county, that place became as distinctly its only legal location as though it had been named in the charter. The plaintiffs, having contributed to a fund for the establishment and support of the college, have interests springing from their contract which differ from those of the public at large. While the Act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360, was not intended to permit an inquiry at the instance of a private suitor as to the validity of a charter or as to its forfeiture, it “ was intended to enlarge and mate clear the rights of individuals to inquire into the charter franchises of corporations when asserted to their individual injury Windsor Glass Co. v.
