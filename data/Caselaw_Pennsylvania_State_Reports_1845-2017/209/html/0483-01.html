L. Herr, and John H. Baumgardner, transferees, and the said Lucy D. Reinoehl to inter-plead. Thereupon, the court having granted a rule to show cause, subsequently, to wit: on July6,1901, ordered the said Lucy D.

The basis of the rule is stated in Kuhn v. Ogilvie, <a href="/pa/178/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="178 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="885510" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0303-01">178 Pa. 303</a>. The question of her transfer of her personal property for the same purpose did not arise at common law, as by marriage her goods and chattels became the husband’s. But after the Act of April 11,1848, P. L. 536, by which “ every species and description of property ” continued to be hers “ as <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>fully after marriage as before,” it was held in Lytle’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/36/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="36 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="992212" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0131-01">36 Pa. 131</a>, that an assignment by husband and wife of the latter’s chose in action was valid, though made to indemnify the indorser of the husband’s note. And in Kulp v. Brant, <a href="/pa/162/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="162 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="856814" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0222-01">162 Pa. 222</a>, it was said by our Brother Dean, “ It has so often been decided that a married woman may assign her personal property as security for her husband’s debts .... that it is useless to again cite the authorities.”</p>

Ogilvie, <a href="/pa/178/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="178 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="885510" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0303-01">178 Pa. 303</a>; Dusenberry v. Ins.

That act is an enabling act, and is not to be construed as narrowing a married woman’s contractual capacity, except where the intent to do so expressly appears. The provision in which such intent is claimed to be found, is in section second, which after authorizing her to make any contract in furtherance of the general power granted in the preceding section, enacts “but she may not become accommodation indorser, maker, guarantor or surety for another.” This has been held to apply only to the technical contract of indorsement, guaranty or suretyship included in the words of the act, Dusenberry v. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/188/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="188 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="901335" data-case-paths="/pa/188/0454-01">188 Pa. 454</a>, though it will be held to cover a manifest device to evade the prohibition, such as was before the court in Patrick v.

But what the statute prohibits is the incurring of a personal liability for the forbidden purpose, a liability which carries the risk of a general judgment. This clause was “ a cautionary provision against too liberal a construction of the very large powers conferred by the first part of the section, a saving of the previously existing disability so far as it covered the particular class of contracts specified : ” Kuhn v. Ogilvie, <a href="/pa/178/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="178 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="885510" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0303-01">178 Pa. 303</a>.

Reinoehl, or their guardian if under age,” etc. It was claimed that as the children had an interest, the <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>assignment by appellant and her husband in which the children did not join, was invalid, and for this are cited Brown’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/125/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="125 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="563967" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0303-01">125 Pa. 303</a>, and Entwistle v.

But in both those cases the assignment of the policy was called in question during the continuance of the insured life. The interest of the wife, assignor, was contingent on surviving her husband, and the assignee took only a defeasible title. In Brown’s Appeal, the death of the wife during the husband’s life had defeated the assignee’s title as against the children, and in Entwistle v. Ins. Co., his title being still contingent, during the husband’s life, the assignee was not allowed to surrender the policy and take its cash value. In the present case the facts are essentially different. The husband having died the contingent interest of the wife vested and the defeasible title of her assignee became absolute.</p>
