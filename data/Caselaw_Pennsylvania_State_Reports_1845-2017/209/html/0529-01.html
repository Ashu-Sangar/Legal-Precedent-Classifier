Such evidence was considered and decided to be inadmissible, in Com. v. Payne, <a href="/pa/205/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="205 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="930053" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0101-01">205 Pa. 101</a>, a much stronger case than the present, for there the offer was to follow the questions with proof of reputation for truth and veracity. That case is in harmony with our own prior decisions, Gilchrist v. McKee, <a href="/watts/4/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 380" data-case-ids="1842702" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0380-01">4 Watts, 380</a>; Conroe v.

They are very fully collected in Kolb v. Union R. R. Co., <a href="/ri/23/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="23 R.I. 72" data-case-ids="4843346" data-case-paths="/ri/23/0072-01">23 R. I. 72</a> (54 Lawyer’s Rep.

The facts are thus reported by the learned judge below: “ Upon the adjournment of court one of the jurors, through ignorance thought that he was allowed to go home until the meeting of court the next morning. He separated himself from his fellows and went to a water-closet. The two tipstaffs, who had been duly sworn and instructed not to allow the jury to separate, took the other eleven jurors to the jury room when it was immediately discovered that one of the jurors was missing. Search was made' and he was discovered in the hall of the courthouse coming from the closet. He was called as a witness and testified that he had talked to no one or heard any talk by anyone about the case. He was separated from his fellows but for a few minutes, probably from three to five. We are convinced that this unfortunate incident occurred entirely through the ignorance of the juror and the carelessness of the officers having the jury in charge, <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>and that no harm was done to the defendant nor was he in any manner prejudiced thereby.”</p>
    <p id="b561-3" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[163,460,1180,460]]]'>Because of their own long standing familiarity with the circumstances under which the jury are required to keep together, lawyers and judges are perhaps apt to presume the same knowledge on the part of the jurors, to whom however the distinctions between the rules in murder and other cases are unknown. In view of the recurrence of questions of this kind it is highly desirable that all juries shall be clearly and specifically instructed when to avoid separation, and generally as to their conduct during the trial.</p>
    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[162,928,1179,253]]]'>In the present case the separation was carefully investigated by the learned judge below, and it was affirmatively shown that the prisoner was not in any manner prejudiced by it. The ease is therefore within the authority of Com. v. Cressinger, <a href="/pa/198/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="198 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="920323" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0326-01">198 Pa. 326</a> (338).</p>
