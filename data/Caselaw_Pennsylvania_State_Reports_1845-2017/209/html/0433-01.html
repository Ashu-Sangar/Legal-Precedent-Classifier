The form of the reservation is very unsatisfactory because, from the manner of it, it does not clearly disclose the exact legal question reserved. But assuming that we might get around the informality of the reservation and find that it is good in substance, then, 2. The reservation embraces a mixed question of law and fact.

The court in entering judgment for defendant says: “ The question raised by defendant’s requests in their points for binding instruction and the nine reasons given therefor, which points on account of the reservation were refused,” and then follows the decree for judgment non obstante veredicto. The defendant had presented nine written points for instruction; the.conclusion of each was, in effect, for a peremptory instruction to find for defendant because the facts stated in them were established by the evidence. Logically then, the judgment was an affirmation of all of them, and the substance of all of them is a request that the court shall as a matter of law pronounce the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence. This affirmation is in direct <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>conflict with the court’s instructions on the written request of plaintiff thus :</p>

That if they believe and find from the testimony that the plaintiff stopped, looked and listened at a proper place and the best place from which to observe the approach of a train toward the State street crossing, then she was not guilty of contributory negligence, and if they further find from the evidence that the defendant company was negligent in approaching the crossing where the plaintiff was struck by the train, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, and the verdict of the jury must be for the plaintiff.</p>

      <em>“ </em>That point is affirmed. But we desire to explain, that you have no right to conclude that the plaintiff is not guilty of contributory negligence merely because she stopped, looked and listened. It is proper to take that into consideration, but she might be guilty of contributory negligence notwithstanding that fact.”</p>

First, in his opinion on the reserved point and in his charge to the jury, the learned judge says, the burden was on the plaintiff to prove that defendant was negligent and that there was no contributory negligence on her part. This was doubtless an inadvertent error, for the law does not impose on a plaintiff so heavy a burden. She is bound to prove negligence on the part of defendant and that this negligence caused her injury; she is not bound to go further and prove that she did not contribute to the result bjr her own negligence. That burden is on defendant, unless the evidence adduced by her discloses contributory negligence. It may or may not do this ; if it do not, she is entitled to a verdict, unless the defendant then adduces evidence establishing her contributory negligence. In most cases the question of contributory negligence is one of fact for the jury, though by no means always. Where the facts are clearly established and the inference of negligence from them manifest, the court should peremptorily so instruct the jury; but our latest case preceded by possibly one hundred others, Kuntz v. New York, etc., Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/206/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="206 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="931861" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0162-01">206 Pa. 162</a>, says : “ The question of <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>contributory negligence cannot be treated as one of law unless the facts and the inferences from them are free from doubt. If there is doubt as to either the case is for the jury.”</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[306,531,1175,199]]]'>In 'passing upon the question of contributory negligence in his opinion on the reserved point, the learned judge almost, if not altogether, in his own language identifies this case as one for the jury. He says :</p>
    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[304,739,1177,652]]]'>“ It is held that the stopping must be at a place where an approaching train may be seen or heard. That it will not do for a pedestrian crossing to say that he stopped and then stepped in front of a moving engine and was injured. That in such case the legal inference would be either, that he did not stop, look and listen, or that having done so he both saw and heard the approaching engine. He must comply with the legal injunction and then upon passing over the danger point, keep his eyes and ears open. Does the plaintiff’s case here properly measure up to the legal requirement ? The question is not entirely one-sided or free from difficulty, yet after careful consideration, but with considerable reluctance, I have come to the conclusion that it does not.”</p>

But assuming that the learned judge did not mean exactly what he said, was there clearly but one inference and that one contributory negligence to be drawn by the jury ? Plaintiff says in her testimony that as she passed over the bridge towards the crossing she heard a whistle of some kind; then walked on to the Susquehanna House corner; she then looked down the track which was unobstructed for 400 feet; she then passed on to a point south of the mill siding where she stopped,looked and listened; proceeding on from this point she looked both ways, neither saw nor heard a train, and just as she was about to step on the track was struck by the bumper of a locomotive and injured. There was positive evidence that she stopped, looked and listened when approaching to cross the railroad; while there is considerable evidence tending- to show that the point where, she stopped was not the best place for a sight of a coming train, the distance on the track which would be shown to the eye from that point would be greatest; then because of a curve in <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>the track and an embankment as the railroad is approached from that point, the view of it is narrowed to seventy or ninety feet; there was evidence that it was dark; that no whistle was blown or bell rung; that plaintiff continued to look and listen until she was struck. It is argued, with much force by appellee, that if she had looked before she made the last step she would not have been struck; but in reply it is urged that a train might have been coming on the track from either direction ; the one that injured her was running at high speed; it was visible onty a few feet from the crossing; it gave no warning and as caution required her to look at the tracks both north and south and while at the very moment her head was turned in the opposite direction the locomotive came upon her. We cannot certainly say this was not so; some of the facts are doubtful on the contradictory testimony; the inferences drawn from them may to some minds seem unreasonable, to others reasonable. That the most serious wounds on plaintiff’s person were on the back does not conclusively show that she was not listening or looking for a silent locomotive, but only that at the instant it struck her she was not looking in the direction from which it came.</p>
