Ryman &amp; Sons, lumber dealers in the <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>city of Wilkes-Barre. On January 2, he was directed by his firm to deliver a load of lumber to the Hazard Manufacturing Company in the city of Wilkes-Barre. He left the yard of his employers and proceeded out Lehigh street to Hazle street, where he approached the place of delivery of the defendant company. Some of the emplojrees of the defendant company who were engaged in remodelling the buildings were on the westerly side of Hazle street on a vacant lot on the opposite side of the street from the premises on which the buildings of the defendant were erected. When he reached the defendant’s place of business, he met a man by the name Westfield who was a laborer employed about the works of the defendant company. He asked Mr. Westfield where the foreman was and Mr. West-field told him. Greis, the plaintiff, proceeded from Hazle street to pass into the defendant’s building. This entrance had upon the doors notices of various kinds forbidding persons to enter. It was a place of entrance for cars that were shifted from the Pennsylvania railroad tracks and for wagons hauling the product manufactured upon the premises, which was wire. At the left after the entrance had been made, there were six doors. These doors were three feet and eight inches above the level of the tracks and of the roadway. They were sliding doors and opened into a storeroom of the defendant company where wire was kept in stock. The wire was admitted and removed from these doors from cars and from wagons. The floor of the storeroom, which was the sill of the door, was on the ordinary level of the floor of a freight car or the bottom of the box of a wagon. The plaintiff found the third door entering into th.e storeroom open. He climbed up over the elevation of three feet and eight inches and entered this storeroom. The room was dark and after walking ten or twelve feet, he fell into an open space passing to a lower floor and was quite seriously injured. The open space was used for the purpose of carrying the product manufactured upon the premises from one story to another. The stairs that he was in search of were located beyond the elevator pit and near the sixth door. AU the doors had the same elevation above the level of the tracks and of the roadway, namely, three feet and eight inches, and they all entered into the storeroom. At the sixth door there were steps leading from the bottom of the <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>tracks and of the roadway into the storeroom. These steps were visible from the entrance on Hazle street. The office of the defendant company fronted on Ross street. .</p>

The plaintiff alleges in his argument upon this motion that such instruction was erroneous. In the statement filed by the plaintiff, his cause of action is alleged as follows : That while the said plaintiff was proceeding through and over the usual and ordinary passage or way leading to said stairway on the first floor of the said building with which he was unacquainted and whilst using due care and caution in walking thereto, he was precipitated and fell through an elevator opening or well in said floor which was unfenced and unguarded to the basement or cellar floor of the said building several feet below.</p>

There was no such testimony in the case. There was testimony that the employees of the defendant company used these doors for the purpose of loading and unloading wire from cars and wagons, but no testimony that it was the usual and ordinary way leading from the Hazle street doors to the stairway in the wireroom near to the sixth door leading from the tracks and wagon entrance.</p>
