At bis death, February 21, 1885, <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>there was a judgment against him which was a lien on his real estate. This judgment was revived February 11, 189 0; a second time April 6, 1895, and a third time April 4, 1900. Each of these revivals was by amicable scire facias to which the executors "only were parties. In 1892 and 1894 judgments by confession were entered against all of the devisees, and they all assigned their interests in the real and personal estate of the decedent as collateral securities for the payment of the judgments. These judgments were revived, and were liens against whatever estate in the realty the devisees had when the sale was ordered.</p>

If the lien of the judgment against the decedent continued, the orphans’ court had jurisdiction to order the sale, and the deed tendered the defendant will pass a valid title. That the lien did continue has been settled beyond all doubt, unless there was an alienation of ^ the land by the devisees. Its priority might be lost as to other judgments for debts of the decedent, if there were any, by the lapse of more than five years between the first and second revivals, or as to mortgagees and judgment creditors of the devisees by the failure at the third revival to give notice to them, as provided by the act of June 18, 1895, but its existence as a lien continued.
