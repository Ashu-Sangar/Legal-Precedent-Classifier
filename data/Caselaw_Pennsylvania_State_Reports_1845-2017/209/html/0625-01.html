The agreement contained the following provisions: “The deed to be made for the above-described tract of coal and mining rights by the party of the first part, their heirs or assigns, on fifty days’ notice in writing by the party of the second part, his heirs or assigns. ... A failure of the second party to make first payment within fifty days from the above date shall render this agreement null and void.” There was no agreement on the part of the defendant to buy. No payment was ever made and no notice of acceptance given, up to the filing of the bill, two years and a half after the date of the agreement. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to a decree.</p>
