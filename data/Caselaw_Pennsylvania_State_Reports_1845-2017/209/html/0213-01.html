While replacing certain weights that had fallen off back of the machine his head was caught between a traveling mule and a post or bumper, and he was severely injured. The court entered a compulsory non-suit sa}dng:</p>

He had nothing at all to do with the machine, further than to put on and take off the bobbins. Twice while the machine was stationary he put on a weight that had fallen off. <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>How frequently weights were in the habit of falling off there is no evidence. He never had been given that to do as a part of his work; in fact, the plaintiff’s case shows that that was part of the duty of one of two other men working upon the machine. It seems to me, therefore, that he was not engaged in anything that was in any sense his work when he was hurt. In the second place, the danger was as apparent to him as to anybody ; that to do that which he did do, with the machine in motion, was likely to result in personal injury.”</p>
