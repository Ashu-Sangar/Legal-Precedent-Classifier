        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Mitchell,\nIt has long been settled that a married woman may mortgage her real estate for her husband\u2019s debt or for future advances to him. The basis of the rule is stated in Kuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303. The question of her transfer of her personal property for the same purpose did not arise at common law, as by marriage her goods and chattels became the husband\u2019s. But after the Act of April 11,1848, P. L. 536, by which \u201c every species and description of property \u201d continued to be hers \u201c as fully after marriage as before,\u201d it was held in Lytle\u2019s Appeal, 36 Pa. 131, that an assignment by husband and wife of the latter\u2019s chose in action was valid, though made to indemnify the indorser of the husband\u2019s note. And in Kulp v. Brant, 162 Pa. 222, it was said by our Brother Dean, \u201c It has so often been decided that a married woman may assign her personal property as security for her husband\u2019s debts .... that it is useless to again cite the authorities.\u201d\nThe Act of June 8,1893, P. L. 344, has not changed the law in this respect: Kuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303; Dusenberry v. Ins. Co., 188 Pa. 454; Adams Paper Co. v. Cassard, 206 Pa. 179. That act is an enabling act, and is not to be construed as narrowing a married woman\u2019s contractual capacity, except where the intent to do so expressly appears. The provision in which such intent is claimed to be found, is in section second, which after authorizing her to make any contract in furtherance of the general power granted in the preceding section, enacts \u201cbut she may not become accommodation indorser, maker, guarantor or surety for another.\u201d This has been held to apply only to the technical contract of indorsement, guaranty or suretyship included in the words of the act, Dusenberry v. Ins. Co., 188 Pa. 454, though it will be held to cover a manifest device to evade the prohibition, such as was before the court in Patrick v. Smith, 165 Pa. 526. But what the statute prohibits is the incurring of a personal liability for the forbidden purpose, a liability which carries the risk of a general judgment. This clause was \u201c a cautionary provision against too liberal a construction of the very large powers conferred by the first part of the section, a saving of the previously existing disability so far as it covered the particular class of contracts specified : \u201d Kuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303. The pledge of specific property whether real or personal was within her previously existing powers, and these, as heretofore said, were not narrowed by what was intended as an enabling statute to enlarge them.\nA second question is raised by appellant on the clause in the policies that they were payable to the assured (appellant) \u201c for her sole use, if living, and if not living to the children of Lucy and Adam 0. Reinoehl, or their guardian if under age,\u201d etc. It was claimed that as the children had an interest, the assignment by appellant and her husband in which the children did not join, was invalid, and for this are cited Brown\u2019s Appeal, 125 Pa. 303, and Entwistle v. Ins. Co., 202 Pa. 141. But in both those cases the assignment of the policy was called in question during the continuance of the insured life. The interest of the wife, assignor, was contingent on surviving her husband, and the assignee took only a defeasible title. In Brown\u2019s Appeal, the death of the wife during the husband\u2019s life had defeated the assignee\u2019s title as against the children, and in Entwistle v. Ins. Co., his title being still contingent, during the husband\u2019s life, the assignee was not allowed to surrender the policy and take its cash value. In the present case the facts are essentially different. The husband having died the contingent interest of the wife vested and the defeasible title of her assignee became absolute.\nA third question relates to the notes for which the policy was to be security. The assignments were absolute on their face, but to each was attached a paper reading as follows: \u201c Collateral security to M. L. Herr, and Jolin H. Baumgardner as sureties on note of $1,000 First National Bank, October 3, 1900, 90 days and any renewals, and secondly for any other indorsements.\u201d The learned judge below rightly construed this to mean that the policies were to secure first, the note described, next any renewals of it, and finally any other indorsements for the benefit of Reinoehl, made by Herr or Baumgardner, either jointly or severally.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Lancaster Co., May T., 1901, No. 94, on verdict for plaintiffs in case of Elizabeth Hager Herr, Executrix of' M. L. Herr, deceased, and John H. Baumgardner v. Lucy D. Reinoehl.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Dean, Brown, Potter and Thompson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nFeigned issue to determine the ownership of the proceeds of two policies of life insurance.\nOn a rule for a new trial Landis, J., stated the facts to be as follows:\nOn May 10, 1901, suit was commenced in the name of Lucy D. Reinoehl, to the use of Dr. M. L. Herr and John H. Baumgardner, transferees, against the Washington Life Insurance Company of New York, to recover the amount of two policies of insurance of $1,000 each, upon the life of Adam C. Reinoehl, the husband of the said Lucy D. Reinoehl. Thereupon the defendant presented its petition, whereby, admitting that it had issued the said two policies it averred that on May 11, 1901, Lucy D. Reinoehl, the beneficiary named in the said policies, had also brought an action of assumpsit, to June term, 1901, No. 1, to recover the identical moneys, and as the said company had no interest therein, and was liable to be put to the expense of defending two actions, and to be subjected to the risk of being compelled to pay the money twice, it prayed the court to order the said M. L. Herr, and John H. Baumgardner, transferees, and the said Lucy D. Reinoehl to inter-plead. Thereupon, the court having granted a rule to show cause, subsequently, to wit: on July6,1901, ordered the said Lucy D. Reinoehl to be made a party to the present suit; that the said parties should interplead, Dr. M. L. Herr and John H. Baumgardner, transferees, being plaintiffs and Lucy D. Reinoehl, defendant, and that the said Washington Life Insurance Company should be granted leave to pay the money claimed into court, with interest to the date of its payment, and costs. This was accordingly done.\nThe main facts out of which this controversy arises are as follows : On June 12, 1879, the said life insurance company, in consideration of $15.70, duly paid to it by Lucy Reinoehl, wife of Adam C. Reinoehl, issued a policy numbered 36,618, on the life of Adam C. Reinoehl for the sum of $1,000, and the said company thereby promised and agreed \u201c to pay the amount of the said insurance .... to the said assured (Lucy D. Reinoehl), for her sole use, if living, and if not living, to the children of Lucy and Adam C. Reinoehl, or their guardian, if under age, for their use, or if there be no such surviving children, then to the executors, or administrators of the said Adam C. Reinoehl.\u201d On June 12, 1881, a similar policy was issued, numbered 40,227, upon the life of said Adam C. Reinoehl for a like amount. The words of the covenant contained therein as to the beneficiaries are exactly the same as those contained in the first recited policy.\nOn October 20, 1900, Adam O. Reinoehl and Lucy D. Reinoehl, his wife, executed assignments of their interests in said policies to the plaintiffs. The said assignments are attached to each of the said policies, and read as follows: \u201cFor one dollar, to me in hand paid, and for other valuable considerations (the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged), I hereby assign, transfer and set over all my right, title and interest in policy No. 36618 on the life of Adam C. Reinoehl, issued by the Washington Life Insurance Company of New York. The Washington Life Insurance Company assumes no responsibility as to the validity of this assignment to Dr. M. L. Herr and John H. Baumgardner, of Lancaster city, Pa., and for the consideration above expressed, I do also for myself, my executors and administrators, guarantee the validity and sufficiency of the foregoing assignment to the above named assignees, their executors, administrators or assigns, and their title to the said policy will forever warrant and defend. Dated at Lancaster, Pa., this 20th day of October, 1900. (Signed) A. C. Reinoehl; Lucy D. Reinoehl, wife. In presence of Mary Acheson MacFarren.\u201d To each of the assignments was pasted or pinned a paper, which read as follows: \u201c Collateral security to M. L. Herr and John H. Baumgardner as sureties on note of $1,000, First National Bank, October 3, 1900, 90 days and any renewals, and secondly, for any other indorsements. (Signed) A. C. Reinoehl.\u201d\nThe said Adam C. Reinoehl died the latter part of the year 1900. Prior to his death, to.wit: on October 3,1900, he gave his note to the order of M. L. Herr and Jolm H. Baumgardner, payable at First National Bank of Lancaster, for the sum of $1,000. This note was indorsed by M. L. Herr and John H. Baumgardner, and being subsequently protested for nonpayment, was paid by the plaintiffs on May 10, 1901, by giving their joint note to the bank. On October 24, 1900, the decedent gave his note to the order of M. L. Herr, payable at the Fulton National Bank of Lancaster, for $1,175. M. L. Herr indorsed it, but Major Reinoehl got the benefit of it and Dr. Herr paid it after Reinoehl\u2019s death. On May 2, 1900, Major Reinoehl and J. H. Baumgardner had given their joint note for $1,000 to the Peoples\u2019 Building, Loan & Deposit Company, payable in six months after date. Reinoehl got the money for the note and Mr. Baumgardner paid it on December 31, 1900, to the building association.\nAt the trial the court gave binding instructions for plaintiffs.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $2,200. Defendant appealed..\nError assigned among others was in giving binding instructions for plaintiffs.\nT. B. Holahan and B. F.
