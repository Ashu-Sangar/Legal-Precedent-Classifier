        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe contention of the appellant that the bequest was a personal one to him as compensation for services to be rendered, and therefore not within the act of 1855, cannot be sustained. The bequest it is true is to him by name, but it is plainly to him not as an individual, but by virtue of his office for the words are \u201c to Rev. Richard Kennahan, or his successor, of St. Matthew\u2019s church,\u201d and \u201c for the purposes of saying masses \u201d for testator and his wife. It thus appears that the bequest is to appellant not only as priest of the church named, but also for a specific use and is thus charged with a trust. While therefore under the rules of the church as set forth in appellant\u2019s answer to the petition the money when earned might become the absolute property of appellant to be spent as he pleased, yet it can only be earned by the execution of the trust, to wit: the performance of the duties imposed by the testator\u2019s will.\nThese duties are clearly a religious use within the act of 1855. The case is not distinguishable in this respect from Rhymer\u2019s Appeal, 93 Pa. 142, where it was said by the late Chief Justice Sterrett, \u201c the testator has clearly declared the use or purpose to which his bequest shall be applied. It is to be expended in masses for the benefit and repose of his soul. While this may not be regarded as a charitable use within the accepted meaning of the word, it is certainly in every proper sense of the term, and according to the obvious intendment of the act, a religious use.\u201d\nThe case of Hodnett\u2019s Estate, 154 Pa. 485, cited by appellant is not at all in conflict with the views now expressed. In that case while the bequest was to the pastor of a church there was, as said in the opinion, \u201cnothing in the will to indicate that the bequest is or ever was intended to be in trust for any religious or charitable use; nor is there, dehors that instrument, a scintilla of evidence of any such trust,\u201d and it was shown that the legatee was not present at the making of the will, nor had any communication with the testator relative to the bequest or testator\u2019s wishes in regard to it, thus negativing the existence of any secret trust. What was decided in that case is that in the absence of any evidence in or dehors the instrument, the law will not infer a trust for religious use merely from the professional character of an individual legatee, though it might if the legatee were an artificial body having but one character and that religious or charitable, citing 1 Jarman on Wills, 193, \u201ca gift will not be deemed charitable merely from the nature of the professional character of the devisee.\u201d In the present case as already said the bequest was not only to the appellant or his successor as pastor of the church but express direction was given that it should be applied to a specific religious use. That brought it clearly within the prohibition of the statute. ,\nDecree affirmed.",
