    "head_matter": "Wood\u2019s Estate.\nWills\u2014Residuary clause\u2014Lapsed legacies.\nThe foundation of the general rule in respect of lapsed legacies is that the residuary clause is understood to be intended to embrace everything not otherwise effectually given, because the testator is supposed to \u201ctake the particular legacy away from the residuary legatee, only for the sake of the particular legatee, so that upon failure of the particular intent, the court gives effect to the general intent.\u201d\n\u25a0 Testator made certain bequests to charities, which bequests lapsed because the will was not witnessed. In the residuary clause he directed as follows: \u201cEverything not otherwise specified that I may own at time of my decease I desire shall be sold as soon as possible and proceeds divided as herein set forth,\u201d etc. Held, that the lapsed bequests should be distributed to the residuary legatees.\nArgued March 25, 1904.\nAppeal, No. 69, Jan. T., 1904, by Sarah Wood et al., from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Oct.'T., 1903, No. 129, sustaining exceptions to adjudication in estate of Ebenezer Wood.\nBefore Dean, Fell, Mestrezat, Potter and Thompson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it .appeared that Ebenezer Wood died on September 14, 1902, leaving a will by which he made certain bequests to charities. The will was not witnessed,- and these bequests lapsed. The residuary clause of the will was as follows :\n\u201c Everything not otherwise specified that I may own at time of my decease I desire shall be sold as soon as possible and proceeds divided as herein set forth; to my nephew, George Stammer, one fourth, and the balance in equal shares to Thomas H. Parkinson, now of Cape May, N. J., his two sons, Harrjr L. and Clifford, and his daughter, Florence Edna.\u201d\nThe auditing judge, Ashman, J., directed that the lapsed legacies should be distributed to the testator\u2019s next of kin and heirs under the intestate laws.\nThe exceptions to the adjudication were sustained by the court in banc, Penrose, J., filing the following opinion :\nThe purpose of a residuary clause in a will is to make a complete testamentary disposition of the estate of the testator so that no part of it may. be left to pass under the intestate laws. It is a gift of all that is, left after the gifts specified or designated have been paid or satisfied; and it carries with it, and is presumed to have been so intended, not only all personal estate which remains not specifically disposed of at the time the will is executed but all that, for any reason, is illy disposed of, or fails as to the legatees originally intended. This was very clearly enunciated \u201c having long been law \u201d in Cambridge v. Rous, 8 Vesey, 12, which has been followed in innumerable cases (see Massey\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 470). There may, of course, be a limited or restricted residuary gift which would carry nothing outside of the designated limits; but in the absence of clear evidence of intention to restrict, it is assumed that the testator intended the residuary clause in a general sense. Lord Eldon declared in Bland v. Lamb, 2 Jacob & Walker, 399, that \u201c Very special words are required to take a bequest of a residue out of the general rule,\u201d and in Leake v. Robinson, 2 Meriv. 362-392, Sir Wi. Grant said, \u201cIt must be a very peculiar case indeed in which there can be at once a residuary clause and a partial intestacy, unless some part of the residue itself be ill given,\u201d this being quoted with approval by Judge Kennedy in Woolmer\u2019s Estate, 3 Wharton, 477.\nIn the case now before us the residuary clause is thus expressed : \u201c Everything not otherwise specified that I may own at the time of my decease I desire shall be sold as soon as possible and the proceeds divided as herein set forth\u2014to my nephew George Stammer one fourth, and the balance in equal shares to Thomas H. Parkinson, his two sons, Harry L. and Clifford, and his daughter Florence Edna,\u201d and as among the gifts \u201c specified were some to charities which failed under the act of assembly because of incomplete execution of the will, it was held as the residue was only of what was not specified that the invalid gifts passed under the intestate laws and not to the residuary legatees.\nWe do not think such a construction of a residuary clause can be sustained as against the vast weight of authorities. It is not easy to see the difference between a gift following specified disposition of all the \u201c residue and a gift of everything as in this case \u2018 not otherwise specified.\u2019 \u201d The will shows a clear intention to exclude any part of the estate from passing under the intestate laws, and no particular mode of expression is necessary to constitute a residuary legatee. In Evans v. Jones, 2 Coll. 516, the testator bequeathed all his personal estate \u201c except \u201d the money laid out in stock, mortgages, and bonds to A, and gave the property thus excepted to B, yet the gift to B having failed it was held that it passed to A under the terms of the residuary gift.\nThe foundation of this general rule in respect of lapsed legacies it is said in 2 Williams on Executors, 1569, is that the residuary clause is understood to be intended to embrace everything not otherwise effectually given; because the testator is supposed to \u201c take the particular legacy away from the residuary legatee, only for the sake of the particular legatee; so that upon the failure of the particular intent the court gives effect to the general intent.\u201d\nOf course there may be cases in which the provisions of the residuary clause are such as to make it impossible to believe that the testator intended a legacy of a character inconsistent with such provisions to fall into it. As where a gift of liberty to slaves failed under a statute forbidding manumission, and the residuary clause directs the sale of all property which it is intended to embrace; but those cases bear no resemblance to the one now before us.\nThe exceptions are sustained and the distribution awarded accordingly.\nJError assigned was the decree of the court.\nSydney Young, for appellant,\ncited: James v. Irving, 10 Beav. 276; Wainman v. Field, Kay, 507; Lea v. Brown, 56 N. C. 141; Kerr v. Dougherty, 79 N. Y. 327; Hughes v. Allen, 31 Ga. 483; Nyce\u2019s Eat., 5 W. & S. 254.\nLouis Br\u00e9gy and Wm.
