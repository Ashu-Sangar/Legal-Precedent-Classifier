        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Thompson,\nIn 1890 Miss Benson, who had adopted the appellant as her daughter, who married Alfred J. Yollrath, bought for her the property 1105 Spruce street, Philadelphia, for the sum of $22,500. This property was purchased by her as a residence for appellant and in her will she provided \u201c that the house No. 1105 Spruce street, which I have purchased for my said adopted daughter Florence to live in, shall be held by the trustees named in my will for the said Florence and her children, under the same limitations, conditions and upon the same trusts as are set forth in the second section of this, my will. Should the said Florence at any time desire to change her residence, I direct that the said house may be sold if she desires and the proceeds applied to the purchase of another house, and I direct that the said house so purchased shall be held by the said trustees upon the same trusts and in the same manner as herein directed.\u201d\nIn 1899 testatrix bought for the appellant the property situated at 1621 Spruce street for the sum of $9,250, subject however to a mortgage of $20,000, payable in December, 1900. She bought this property as a residence for appellant who accordingly moved into it from 1105 Spruce street and has since with her family resided there. By a codicil to her will dated January 10, 1901, Miss Benson provided as follows:\n\u201cAs I have purchased the property No. 1621 Spruce street for the residence of my adopted daughter Florence, who has removed there from 1105 Spruce street, I order and direct that the said house 1621 Spruce street shall be held by my trustees upon the same trusts and in the same manner as set forth in the second section of my will. . . . Except as to the changes herein made, I hereby ratify, confirm and establish my said will and the former codicils thereto.\u201d\nThe appellant contends that testatrix by her will intended that both bequests were to be operative and that accordingly she is entitled to the rents of the one and the right to occupy the other as a residence. Appellees contend that she intended the bequest in the codicil alone to be operative and to be substitutional of the first and that therefore the appellant is not entitled to the rents of 1105 Spruce street. Testatrix originally provided a trust in behalf of this adopted daughter in the sum of $200,000, the income of which to be paid to her during life, but subsequently she cut down somewhat the principal of such trust fund. Clearly she intended to give appellant a substantial income and to couple with it a house for the residence of herself and family. In the first instance she purchased No. 1105 Spruce street for her \u201c to live in \u201d and in case she desired to \u201c change her residence \u201d she authorized this house to be sold and the proceeds \u201c to be applied to the purchase of another house.\u201d Manifestly she intended that after her death appellant should not be compelled to continue to live at the one place designated, but should, in case she should desire to do so, be permitted to select another place for her home. In that event the first should be sold and the proceeds of the sale used for the purchase of one to be substituted, but before her death appellant changed her residence to 1621 Spruce street, which testatrix had purchased for her as a residence in lieu of 1105 Spruce street and accordingly to carry out this substitutional intention she directed by her codicil, \u201c as I have purchased the property No. 1621 Spruce street for the residence of my adopted daughter Florence who has removed there from 1105 Spruce street, I order and direct that my said house No. 1621 Spruce street shall be held by ray trustees upon the same trusts and in the manner as set forth in the second section of my will.\u201d It is clear that the purpose of the testatrix as expressed in her will and codicil was that appellant should have a house for a residence. In the first instance, that house was No. 1105 Spruce street, but by the codicil this original intention as to that house was changed by substituting No. 1621 Spruce street. The words of the will and the codicil used to accomplish her purpose import a substitutional intention and their construction to that effect has the warrant of judicial determination.\nIn Sims v. Sims, 10 N. J. Eq. 158, it is said that when a legacy is given for a particular purpose and it is executed by the decedent in his lifetime, the presumption arises that there was the intention to cancel the legacy. In Hine v. Hine, 39 Barb. 507, this principle, after careful consideration, is recognized.\nIn Miner v. Atherton, 35 Pa. 528, it is said : \u201c A legacy by a father to a child is understood as a portion, because it is a provision by a parent for his child. If the father afterwards advances a portion for that child, it will be an ademption of that legacy, in whole or in part, as the advancements are larger or equal to, or less than, the testamentary portion.\u201d\nIn Tussaud v. Tussaud, L. R. 9 Ch. Div. 363, it is said: \u201cAs I understand the law, the court presumes that the parents, including in the term \u2018 parents \u2019 the person or persons standing in the place of the parents, do not intend to give double portions to their children.\u201d\nIn Benyon v. Benyon, 17 Vesey, 34, it is said: \u201c Where the same quantity has been given, and the same cause, or no additional reason assigned for a repetition of the gift, the court lias inferred the testator\u2019s intention to be the same and has rejected accumulations.\u201d\nIn Swoope\u2019s Appeal, 27 Pa. 58, it was held that where there is nothing on the face of the will and no circumstances to indicate an intention to give a double portion, the advancement will be a satisfaction or ademption of the legacy.\nFrom the object intended to be accomplished by the testatrix, from the occupancy of the first house as a residence, from the removal to the second house for the continuing purpose, from the words used in the original will and from those used in the codicil it is evident that the intention of the testatrix was to make the gift of the second substitutional for the first. The mortgage for $20,000 upon 1621 Spruce street matured some two years before the death of the testatrix and she did not satisfy it though amply able to do so. There is no evidence to warrant the conclusion that by her will she intended it to be paid off, after her death.\nTherefore the assignments of error are not sustained and the decree is affirmed.",

T., 1903, by Florence B. Yollrath, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Jan. Term, 1903, No. 612, dismissing petition to compel trustees to pay over rentals in estate of Harriet S. Benson, deceased.\nBefore Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Thompson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition to compel trustees to pay over rentals.\nThe petition set out that testatrix died September 3, 1902, leaving a will, of which E. N. Benson, R. D. Benson and Charles M. Morton are executors; that petitioner was decedent\u2019s adopted daughter and had intermarried in decedent\u2019s lifetime with Alfred J. Yollrath; that during decedent\u2019s lifetime she purchased in her own name for \u00a722,600 premises No. 1105 Spruce street, which were occupied by petitioner and her family as a residence until 1899, when decedent purchased premises No. 1621 Spruce street; since which time petitioner and her family have occupied the latter premises as their residence; that these premises were bought subject to a mortgage for \u00a720,000, which was not payable until December 31, 1900, and which still remains unpaid; that by decedent\u2019s will a certain fund was given her executors in trust for petitioner\u2019s benefit, and also premises No. 1105 Spruce street upon the same trusts, but with power to sell and with the proceeds purchase another residence for petitioner should she so desire; that after the purchase of premises No. 1621 Spruce street and the removal of petitioner thereto, decedent made a codicil to her will directing that the latter premises should be held upon the same trusts ; that the executors assert that under the will the mortgage of \u00a720,000 is not to be paid out of decedent\u2019s personal estate, and that there is no trust in petitioner\u2019s favor as to premises No. 1105 Spruce street, and have therefore deducted from petitioner\u2019s income the interest on the mortgage and have not paid over to her the rents collected from premises No. 1105 Spruce street.\nThe petition averred that petitioner is entitled to one or the other of these things and asks relief accordingly.\nThe answer admitted the facts, but denied that petitioner was entitled thereunder to the relief she asked.\nThe case was heard by Judges Ashman and Penrose. Judge Ashman was of the opinion that the petition should be dismissed. Judge Penrose was of the contrary opinion.\nThe court being equally divided a decree was entered dismissing the petition.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nJohn G. Johnson, for appellant.\nSamuel Diclcson, with him Walter E. Rex and Richard O. Dale, for appellees.\nGeorge Tucker Bispham, for residuary devisees.\nMay 2, 1904:"
