Ewing, a druggist, the complaint charging that he negligently provided Chloromycetin without prescription. Ewing joined as additional defendants Domenico Cucinotta, M.D., Samuel Levin, D.O., and Parke, Davis and Company (Parke, Davis).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The third party complaints against both Dr. Cucinotta and Dr. Levin alleged that they had caused or contributed to the injuries of the minor plaintiff by negligently prescribing Chloromycetin in disregard of its possible dangerous side effects. The third party complaint against Parke, Davis, the manufacturer of the drug, alleged that it negligently failed to warn the plaintiffs, the defendant and the additional defendants of the dangerous effects of the drug, failed to perform proper tests on the drug, and failed to take necessary precautions to avert the injuries complained of. After a <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>lengthy (7 week) trial, a jury verdict was returned in favor of the original defendant, Ewing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and against all additional defendants in the sum of $215,000. The verdict was comprised of $200,000 to Mary Ann’s estate and $15,000 to her parents in their own right. Motions for judgments notwithstanding the verdict and, alternatively, for a new trial, filed by each additional defendant, were refused and judgments entered on the verdicts, and from such judgments these appeals were taken. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[171,898,1147,1140]]]'>Following is an abbreviated recitation of the facts giving rise to the suit. Mary Ann was born on December 29, 1955. Dr. Cueinotta was her pediatrician and first saw her five days after birth. In the four years following he saw and treated Mary Ann for the ordinary childhood diseases. In October, 1958 and again in July, 1959 he saw Mary Ann for a condition he diagnosed as “acute catarrhal rhinopharyngo tonsillitis.” On the latter occasion he noted a “complicating abdominal pain, possibly mesenteric adenitis” (an infection of the mesentery glands of the stomach). He considered her condition to be caused by a staphylococcus aureus coagulóse positive infection. On both occasions he prescribed Chloromycetin, and the child responded well. On January 22, 1960, some six months later, her parents brought Mary Ann to the doctor’s office. Dr. Cueinotta made the same diagnosis, and again prescribed Chloromycetin. The prescription was for 2 ounces, and could be refilled but once. At no time did Dr. Cueinotta take blood tests or make bacteriologic cultures.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[172,2057,1145,101]],["BL_303.1",303,[156,346,1152,984]]]'>In February, 1960 Mary Ann’s mother felt, that Mary Ann had a respiratory infection (she had de<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>veloped a cold and some hoarseness). Mrs. Incollingo asked Ewing to refill the January 22 prescription of Chloromycetin. One refill having already been furnished, Ewing told her that a physician’s authorization would be required. According to Dr. Cucinotta, Ewing telephoned him to ask if the prescription could be refilled, and he answered in the negative. Mrs. Incollingo then called Dr. Levin, an osteopathic physician of whom she was a patient, asking that he authorize renewal of the prescription. Dr. Levin testified that Mrs. Tncollingo told him Dr. Cucinotta was not available. Without seeing or examining Mary Ann, Dr. Levin telephoned Ewing and authorized a refill of the prescription. At least one additional refill of the prescription was obtained in the same manner. Mrs. Incollingo did not administer the medicine to her daughter in accordance with the prescription instructions, but as she felt Mary Ann needed it.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[154,1344,1150,596]]]'>In May, 1960 Mrs. Incollingo again brought her daughter to Dr. Cucinotta, who found her to be suffering from aplastic anemia, a form of blood dyscrasia. His diagnosis at the time was that this was secondary to (i.e., resultant from) Chloromycetin. Mary Ann’s condition gradually worsened until her death in March, 1962. Although in his testimony Dr. Cucinotta qualified the causative role of the drug to “most probably” giving rise to the anemia, there was no real medical disagreement at trial that Chloromycetin was in fact the underlying cause of Mary Ann’s death.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[150,1953,1152,378]],["BL_304.1",304,[198,352,1152,1761]]]'>At this point it is necessary to describe briefly the nature of the drug here involved. As mentioned at the outset, Chloromycetin is a “broad spectrum” antibiotic, meaning that it is efficacious in the control and cure of a wide range of infectious diseases. Parke, Davis first offered Chloromycetin for sale in 1949 and was the sole producer until 1967. Chloromycetin was prop<a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>erly obtainable only upon the prescription of a licensed physician, and was not advertised to the general public. Because of its therapeutic effectiveness and low incidence of side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, Chloromycetin became a popular, widely used drug. Prior to and during the period that Chloromycetin was prescribed for Mary Ann the following language appeared on the immediate container and the outer carton: “Warning—Blood dyscrasias [disorders] may be associated with intermittent or prolonged use. It is essential that adequate blood studies be made. Caution—Federal Law prohibits dispensing without prescription.” In addition, the literature distributed by Parke, Davis pertaining to the drug contained the following statement: “Chloromycetin is a potent therapeutic agent and, because certain blood dyscrasias have been associated with its administration, it should not be used indiscriminately or for minor infections. Furthermore, as with certain other drugs, adequate blood studies should be made when the patient requires prolonged or intermittent therapy.” There is no question that the foregoing quotations, based on a Federal Food and Drug Administration announcement, were correct statements of fact as far as they went; there was, however, considerable dispute at trial as to whether they were sufficiently explicit and went far enough in describing the dangerous potential toxicity of the drug, whether they were given sufficient prominence on the containers and in the Parke, Davis literature, and whether the printed warnings were not in effect counteracted by the alleged overpromotion of the product by Parke, Davis salesmen, called in the trade “detail men”.</p>

While the case was not separated as to the several defendants at trial, they have raised on appeal somewhat different issues as to liability, and we shall for convenience discuss <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>them separately.

    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[151,636,1152,431]]]'>Appellant Cucinotta’s argument in support of his motion for judgment n.o.v. is that plaintiffs did not carry their burden of proving that his conduct was not in accordance with the accepted standards of the medical profession in Philadelphia in 1960. By the same token, a primary argument in support of his new trial motion is that the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury as to what constitutes malpractice.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[147,1087,1153,1030]]]'>Dr. Cucinotta, called by plaintiffs as for cross-examination, testified that he considered Mary Ann’s condition on January 22, 1960 to be a serious one requiring immediate therapy which could not be withheld until his clinical diagnosis could be confirmed by laboratory tests, and that in view of this condition it was his judgment that Chloromycetin was the appropriate drug to prescribe. Upon the two occasions in 1958 and 1959 when he had prescribed Chloromycetin for the same condition, Mary Ann had responded well and had shown no signs of adverse effects from the drug. He stated that it was because he was aware of the possible side effects of the drug that he had prescribed a small amount to be given within a short period of time, and that he refused to renew the prescription when asked to do so by Mr. Ewing. He stated that his treatment of Mary Ann was in accordance with the prevailing standards of the medical profession in Philadelphia at the time.</p>
    <p id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.7",305,[145,2147,1149,212]],["BL_306.1",306,[201,353,1148,929]]]'>Dr. Cucinotta asserts that no evidence was introduced to the contrary as to the practice in the profession. Indeed, as he points out, the plaintiffs’ chief expert witness, Dr. Edward H. McGehee, testified that <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>in Ms. opinion 75% to 80%<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> of the practicing physicians in Philadelphia in the period 1958-1960 would have prescribed Chloromycetin for Mary Ann’s condition, and approximately 50% of these would have done so without taking a throat culture. Another of plaintiffs’ experts, Dr. James P. Weston, testified that Dr. Cucinotta was practicing “the same way as a majority of his colleagues were at that particular time.” While plaintiffs’ medical witnesses attributed this practice to the widespread use of the drug brought about by the promotional efforts of Parke, Davis, as well as to the general effectiveness of the drug, Dr. Cucinotta testified that he received no impression, when visited by the Parke, Davis detail men, that Chloromycetin could be used with impunity, was not influenced by salesmanship of the manufacturer in his use of the drug, and was aware that it should be used only in serious cases.</p>

Maffucci </em>is the disagreement of plaintiffs’ experts with his view that Mary Ann’s condition on January 22, 1960, and also at the times of the 1958 and 1959 prescriptions, was serious. They characterized it as relatively trivial, a mild form of upper respiratory infection, not warranting the employment of Chloromycetin. Dr. McG-ehee stated that coagulase positive, staphylococcus aureas pharyngitis cannot be diagnosed by a clinical examination of the patient’s throat, and therefore a culture is necessary to establish the diagnosis; he also gave the opinion that mesenteric adenitis is a common condition, that it cannot be ascertained by external palpation; and that in any case it requires no treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> His opinion was, accordingly, that the use of Chloromycetin in Mary Aim’s situation was not reasonable medical treatment in the Phil<a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>adelphia medical community<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> in the 1958-1959 period. Dr. Weston also testified that laboratory tests, not clinical examination, would have been required to make the diagnoses in question, and this view had support from Dr. Levin and his expert witness, Dr. John W. Frost. Moreover, the warning on the label and package of Chloromycetin stated that “adequate blood studies should be made when the patient requires prolonged or intermittent therapy.” Dr. McGehee’s opinion was that the three courses of treatment ordered by Dr. Cucinotta, those in 1958, 1959 and 1960, constituted intermittent use of the drug, for which blood studies were required.</p>
    <p id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[216,1061,1148,817]],["BL_309.1",309,[155,336,1151,1039]]]'>The testimony to the effect that a large percentage of Philadelphia doctors would have given the same course of treatment as did Dr. Cucinotta was based on the opinions of plaintiffs’ experts that Chloromycetin was being misused for trivial complaints by doctors who did not read or pay attention to the warnings or who had been “oversold” by the drug company’s detail men. Dr. Cucinotta did not fit into these categories; he had read the warnings, he knew of the dangers, he had not been oversold. The dispute as to Dr. Cucinotta’s conduct, therefore, narrows down to the accuracy of his diagnosis, and whether it could or could not have been made clinically; to the interpretation of “intermittent” use, and whether blood tests were or were not mandated in light of three courses of treatment of the <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>drug separated by roughly six aud nine months, respectively. There was no testimony that, given Dr. Cucinotta’s knowledge and awareness, a substantial number of doctors at the time and place would have followed the same procedures. Thus Dr. Cucinotta, rejecting the indiscriminate use of the drug which, it was said by plaintiffs, was then characteristic of the medical profession in Philadelphia, could not limit his own responsibility to the skill and knowledge of the norm, see Restatement (Second) Torts, §290, comment / and §299, comment f; and in exercising the knowledge he himself possessed, he was required to employ the care and judgment of a reasonable man in like circumstances. This standard of care is distinctly recognized in <em>Donaldson </em>in clause (2) of the last paragraph above quoted. It was adherence to this standard which was put in issue by the testimony of plaintiffs’ witnesses; this testimony was sufficient to take the case to the jury as to Dr. Cucinotta.</p>
    <p id="b309-3" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[150,1388,1153,930]],["BL_310.1",310,[210,344,1147,314]]]'>What has been said above is similarly dispositive of the asserted error in the trial judge’s charge as to Dr. Cucinotta. The court was asked to charge (the 5th and 18th points for charge submitted on behalf of the doctor) that if, in prescribing Chloromycetin for Mary Ann, Dr. Cucinotta acted as a substantial number of physicians in Philadelphia would have acted under the same circumstances, the verdict must be in his favor; again, that if a substantial number of physicians in Philadelphia would have treated Mary Aun as did Dr. Cucinotta without taking a throat culture, it cannot be found that the doctor was negligent in not doing so. These requests, which were refused, did not advert to Dr. Cucinotta’s knowledge and awareness of the dangerous propensities of the drug, and of the warnings issued with respect thereto. The court charged that it was for the jury to determine “taking into considera<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>tion the testimony given to you by the doctors who testified,” whether Dr. Cucinotta’s conduct fell below the reasonable standard of medical care, “despite the number of doctors who would have done the same thing.” We find no error in these rulings or the charge under these circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[211,677,1147,1318]]]'>Two other points raised by Dr. Cucinotta, both in support of his new trial motion, require but brief mention. The first pertains to the allowance into evidence of testimony relating to the condition of Mary Ann and his treatment of her subsequent to the January 22,1960 prescription referred to in the original complaint, i.e., after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia in May, 1960. This consumed a period of several days out of the total period Dr. Cucinotta was on the stand as on cross-examination, and is alleged to have been not only an harassment of the witness but inflammatory of the jury. While originally directed to showing malpractice in the doctor’s treatment of aplastic anemia, this was a cause of action clearly not embraced by the pleadings, and was an approach eventually abandoned by the plaintiffs. The jury was informed by the trial judge that the treatment pertaining to this phase of the disease was not to be considered as any evidence of negligence. The testimony dealing with the effects of blood dyscrasia and its treatment was in the main relevant as to pain and suffering over a two year period, and properly for the jury on this basis. While unduly prolonged, we cannot say that the cross-examination was so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[213,2006,1147,313]],["BL_311.1",311,[146,316,1150,1036]]]'>The other charge of trial error urged upon us is refusal to allow into evidence the complete hospital records relative to Mary Ann’s seven admissions under Dr. Cucinotta’s care. The records were in court and stipulated by counsel to be authentic, and they were used as the basis for much of the cross-examination of <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>Dr. Cucinotta. Dr. Cucinotta’s position is that the histories in the records showed Mrs. Incollingo’s statements as to the number of refills of Chloromycetin which she had obtained through Dr. Levin were thus relevant on the disputed question of causation, and were admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, now embodied in the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act. Act of May 4, 1939, P. L. 42, §2, 28 P.S. §91b. The problem is, however, that no party to the action nor any other person responsible for the hospital entries in question is known to have given the information on which the histories were based. See <em>Fauceglia v. Harry, </em><a href="/pa/409/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="409 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1883319" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0155-01">409 Pa. 155</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20598" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="185 A.2d 598">185 A. 2d 598</a> (1962). The statements may have been made by Mrs. Incollingo, but the court was within the discretion allowed it by the Act in not permitting a good guess to take the place of proof of the source. No other hearsay exception has been advanced as ground for the admission of the records.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[144,1372,1149,701]]]'>Beyond this, however, there was no prejudice in the exclusion. While Mrs. Incollingo and Dr. Levin both testified that only two bottles of Chloromycetin were obtained by Mrs. Incollingo through Dr. Levin, there was other testimony that more than two were obtained. In Mrs. Ineollingo’s deposition she stated that she had called Dr. Levin three or four times relative to Chloromycetin; Mr. Incollingo testified the medicine was given on “many, many occasions”; Dr. Cucinotta himself testified there may have been as many as seven refills after January 22, 1960. Thus the main purpose sought to be served by the medical histories were fulfilled otherwise.</p>

He admits that he paid little or no attention to the written warnings relative to Chloromycetin, that he prescribed the drug extensively and indiscriminately for all kinds of viral infections, whether serious or not; and that he authorized two refills of Chloromycetin for Mary Ann by telephone, without ever having had her as a patient or examining her at the times of the authorizations. Dr. Levin seeks to avoid any liability for this course of conduct in that he felt Chloromycetin was a safe drug because of the representations of the Parke, Davis detail men and because the drug had never caused any trouble on the numerous prior occasions that he had prescribed it; that he knew Dr. Cucinotta and relied on the soundness of his prescription of the drug for Mary Ann; and that Mrs. Incollingo was a patient of his and he wanted to accommodate her, and she told him that she could not then contact Dr. Cucinotta.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Distance or weather might also be factors, he said.</p>

She asked the doctor to get it for her. “She was steering the entire therapy,” said Dr. Levin, “so I acceded to her wishes.” In April Mrs. Incollingo called yet another time, asserting that Mary Ann’s physician could not be reached, that the child had a viras again, and a sore throat, and that she would like to have the Chloromycetin prescription renewed once more. “I told her,” said Dr. Levin, “1 would be glad to do it this one time, but I didn’t think I would care to renew it again because I felt this was a dangerous drug to be kept on using, to keep on using.”</p>

Was Dr. Levin using the care and judgment of a reasonable man in renewing prescriptions of a drug, the propensities of which were readily ascertainable, for a person who was not his patient, whom he had never seen, as a favor to her mother whose good will as a patient he wished to retain? There was no evidence that this course of conduct was in accord with the professional standard of conduct in the community at the time.

Dr. Levin testified that “the drug was considered to be very safe, and there was no reason for me to suspect any toxicity.” He stated he was aware of the warnings in the precautionary statements on the wrapper of the drug, “but the drug detail men practically ignored it. It was played down ... we didn’t concern ourselves with this small inadequate description [of warnings]”. We decline to accept the proposition that a qualified doctor can so easily turn himself into a dupe. As indicated heretofore, the Parke, Davis warnings were there to read if he would, and the dangers of the drug were by 1960 also revealed in other medical literature to which the doctor had access and which he said he read.

Comment <em>h </em>to the section makes it clear that a product, as to which adequate warning of danger involved in its use is required, sold without such warning is in a “defective condition.” Comment <em>j </em>states that “in order to prevent the product from being unreasonably dangerous, the seller may be required to give directions or warning, on the container, as to its use.” The comment continues: “Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if it is followed, is not in defective condition nor is it unreasonably dangerous.” The Restatement reaches the same conclusion as to a product which is incapable of being made safe for its intended use, such as new or experimental drugs, as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience there can be no assurance of <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>safety, but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk. “The seller of such products”, concludes this comment (Comment fc), “again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed <em>and proper warning is given, </em>where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.” (Emphasis supplied.)

The first aspect of this contention has to do with Pennsylvania third party practice, and runs as follows: the original complaint against Ewing, the druggist, was a negligent filling of a prescription contrary to the instructions of the prescribing physician, Dr. Cucinotta; the third party complaint by Ewing against Parke, Davis stated, in effect, that he has was not properly warned about the drug; there was no allegation that Ewing was induced by Parke, Davis’ actions to refill the prescription against the doctor’s instructions; no evidence to this effect was offered, and indeed plaintiffs offered no proof in support of their complaint of negligence against Ewing; instead, they sought to prove the state of mind of the medical profession at large rather than any duty owed by Parke, Davis to Ewing or the appellees. In the first place, this argument overlooks the <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>important fact that the third party complaint also asserts a failure adequately to warn the other additional defendants, the two doctors. In the second place, it reads too narrowly the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure relative to joinder of third parties. Rule 2252(a) permits joinder by a defendant of “any person whether or not a party to the action who may be alone liable or liable over to him on <em>the cause of action declared upon </em>or jointly or severally liable thereon with him.” (Emphasis ours.) Rule 2255 provides, in paragraph (d), that “the plaintiff shall recover from an additional defendant found liable to him ... as though such additional defendant had been joined as a defendant and duly served and the initial pleadings of the plaintiff had averred such liability.” It is true that “the cause of action declared upon” by the plaintiff in this case was not the same as that set forth in the third party complaint : the negligent filling of a prescription by a druggist is not the same cause of action as the negligent failure by the drug manufacturer to give adequate warning to the druggist or the prescribing doctors. The same could be said in any third party situation. A’s cause of action against B, for example, is not the same as A’s cause of action against C, joined as alone liable, because a cause of action is by definition between particular named parties. It must be remembered that “[t]he general plan of the joinder procedure is to adjudicate all rights growing out of a certain factual background.” 8 Goodrich-Amram, Sec. 2255(d)-9, p. 107; see also the discussion at Sec. 2252(a)-5 and 6. The phrase “cause of action declared upon” as used in the rule may not be taken too literally. So long as the additional defendant’s alleged liability is related to the original claim which plaintiff asserts against the original defendant, the third party complaint is within bounds. We think that is the case here: the asserted failure of the manufacturer of the drug to warn the <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>prescribing doctors and the druggist of its dangers is sufficiently related to the plaintiff’s original charge that the druggist negligently dispensed the drug to be within the ambit of third party procedure. Contrast <em>Mallesky v. Stevens, </em><a href="/pa/427/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="427 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="1910378" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0352-01">427 Pa. 352</a>, 355, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20154" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="235 A.2d 154">235 A. 2d 154</a> (1967). The fact that at trial the plaintiffs concentrated their attack primarily on the third party defendants and hardly at all on the original defendant was not a variance as between pleadings and proof. As noted above, Pa. R. C. P. Rule 2255(d) in effect incorporates by reference in the original complaint the properly pleaded averments of third party liability contained in the third party complaint.</p>

As noted, the cause of action pleaded is negligent failure to warn the parties to the action (including particularly the two additional defendants who were prescribing physicians) of the dangerous effects of the drug. There was direct testimony on this subject, including both the printed warning and the promotional efforts of the detail men, by both doctors: Dr. Cucinotta stated, in effect, that he was adequately warned and understood the dangers and proper use of the drug, while Dr. Levin for his part indicated the contrary. Plaintiffs were allowed over objection to introduce, by expert witnesses, evidence directed to showing a failure to Avarn the <em>medical profession. </em>This consisted of the custom and practice of the manufacturer, Parke, Davis, in “overpromoting” its product, primarily through the use of detail men who minimized the dangers of the drug while emphasizing its effectiveness, wide acceptance and use, and lack of certain objectionable side effects associated with other drugs. The question is whether this evidence was properly admitted.</p>

As a practical matter, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to show how the promotional efforts of the manufacturer bore on the judgments of these codefendants without demonstrating that the efforts were directed to the entire class or group of which they were members: the advertisements and all the literature relative to Chloromycetin were directed to the medical profession; the printed warnings were directed to the medical profession; the detail men were engaged for the purpose of selling the drug by making calls upon the members of the medical jjrofession.</p>

The evidence indicated such a wide use of Chloromycetin as to suggest that it was not being limited to serious illnesses, and plaintiffs’ experts so testified. On this basis the trial court instructed the jury that if it found that Parke, Davis was on notice that the drug Avas being used indiscriminately, and yet failed to try to restrict its use to proper situations, then the company could be found negligent. We think the charge was proper. When a required warning is retained unchanged in the face of being Avidely disregarded, and the supplier knows or has reason to know of such wide disregard, a jury may be permitted to find the warning insufficient. Were the evidence limited solely to the two doctors here involved, this approach to the warning problem would not be possible. But the focus must <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>narrow, of course, from the general to the specific. There was adequate proof that the Chloromycetin ordered by one or both of the doctors in this cage was the cauge of death; a warning more explicit and more prominent given both by the written and the spoken word to those doctors might, go the jury could have found, have avoided the tragedy which occurred in thig cage.

The charge in this case clearly instructed the jury that the subsequent warning “was admitted for the limited purpose to show a caution which was not costly or burdensome to Parke, Davis in relation to the risk or danger involved.” The jury was thrice instructed that the 1961 warning was not to be taken as evidence bearing on antecedent negligence. Parke, Davis nevertheless takes exception to the following portion of the charge: “You may ask yourselves whether knowing that, whether having changed the warning in 1961 is the warning that they should have been fully aware of in 1960 and prior thereto [sic]. You may use that as evidence of the fact that they knew or should have known, and could have used that warning which they used in 1961 back in 1960, 1959, and 1958.” In reviewing this instruction, “we must look to the charge in its entirety to determine whether or not error was committed and whether that error was prejudicial.” <em>Mount v.

This action was commenced during the lifetime of the minor plaintiff, Mary Ann, who died shortly after it was instituted. Under the rule in <em>Radobersky v. Imperial Volunteer Fire Department, </em><a href="/pa/368/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="368 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1230381" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0235-01">368 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20865" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="81 A.2d 865">81 A. 2d 865</a> (1951), damages in such a situation are to be awarded on the basis of the deceased plaintiff’s anticipated gross earnings, with no deduction of cost of maintenance before reducing the loss of earnings to present worth. Appellants Dr. Cucinotta and Parke, Davis strenuously urge that this Court reevaluate and overrule <em>Radobersky </em>and apply the rule of <em>Murray v. Philadelphia Transportation Company, </em><a href="/pa/359/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="359 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="473161" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0069-01">359 Pa. 69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20323" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="58 A.2d 323">58 A. 2d 323</a> (1948). Under that rule the measure of damages would be loss of <em>net </em>earning power, i.e., gross earnings diminished by the amount the deceased plaintiff would have had to expend for his own maintenance had he not died, reduced to present worth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> It is apparent that the existence of the two rules results in different awards depending on whether suit is brought before or after death of an injured person, without re<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>gard to actual loss. That this inequality, not required by statute, may be unfair and result in unseemly haste to file suit prior to death is cogently argued by appellants. Appellees argue that the <em>Murray </em>rule would foster dilatory pretrial tactics on the part of defendants, seeking to delay suits until an injured plaintiff had died, and that <em>Radobersky </em>is justified in the light of the decisional and statutory background. They corn tend, further, that any overruling of <em>Radobersky </em>should be prospective only.</p>

In that case the question was not raised in the court below, and the pertinent instruction was not specifically challenged at trial. Because of this a majority of the Court were of the opinion that the requested reconsideration of <em>Radobersky </em>should not be made on the record then before the Court. In the case at bar the question was raised in the court below in the motions for a new trial, but the record does not show any earlier raising of the question in exceptions to the charge or in points for charge. Only a general verdict was returned, and there is no way of showing, without a retrial as to damages, which would of necessity be lengthy, the amount of maintenance and support which under <em>Murray </em>would be deductible. A request for a special verdict might have resulted in an allocation of damages as between pain and suffering and the elements of special damages, including lost earnings, which would have presented the question in a manner not requiring full retrial of the damage issues in a lengthy case. There is no question but that the charge of the court was correct under the law as it exists, <em>and </em>the verdict of the jury is not claimed to be excessive. Under these circumstances and on this record we again decline to reconsider the rules of damages referred to.</p>

    <p id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.6",330,[198,845,1148,542]]]'>I concur fully in the result reached by the majority and wish only to make explicit my view that a physician is not insulated from malpractice liability merely by possessing and employing the skill and knowledge usually possessed by physicians in the “same or similar locality.” It is also my view that a medical expert is not incompetent to testify as a witness in a malpractice action simply because he does not reside or practice in or otherwise profess a familiarity with the practice of medicine in the same or similar locality.</p>
    <p id="b330-6" data-blocks='[["BL_330.7",330,[194,1400,1148,646]]]'>During the period of its original formulation in the middle and late nineteenth century, the “locality rule” was plausibly expedient. The law was-arguably wise in indulging in the assumption that medical knowledge, skill and care varied considerably from community to community. Thus in the leading case of <em>Small v. Howard, </em><a href="/mass/128/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="128 Mass. 131" data-case-ids="726646" data-case-paths="/mass/128/0131-01">128 Mass. 131</a> (1880), the Massachusetts Supreme Court sought to protect the rural and small town practitioner by holding that such a practitioner “was not bound to possess that high degree of art and skill possessed by eminent surgeons practicing in large cities.” <a href="/mass/128/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="128 Mass. 131" data-case-ids="726646" data-case-paths="/mass/128/0131-01">Id. at 132</a>.</p>

Modern systems of transportation and communication, the proliferation and widespread dissemination of medical literature, and the prevalence and availability of seminars and postgraduate courses make it both possible and desirable for <em>all </em>practition<a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>ers to be reasonably familiar with current medical advances. Furthermore, the major source of a physician’s professional expertise is not the particular locality in which he practices but initially the institutions in which he received his education and professional training.</p>
    <p id="b331-4" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[164,670,1154,815]]]'>In light of the foregoing, the locality rule is an anachronism. Massachusetts, one of the original locality rule jurisdictions, has recognized this and abandoned the rule. See <em>Brune v. Belinkoff, </em><a href="/mass/354/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="354 Mass. 102" data-case-ids="3866723" data-case-paths="/mass/354/0102-01">354 Mass. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20N.E.2d%20793" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="235 N.E.2d 793">235 N.E. 2d 793</a> (1968), overruling <em>Small v.

The standard of care required of a specialist or general practitioner should be that of a reasonable specialist or general practitioner in similar circumstances practicing medicine in light of present day scientific knowledge. For the same reasons, a medical expert should be deemed a competent witness even if he does not reside or practice in the same or similar locality or is not otherwise familiar with the practice of medicine in the same or similar locality.</p>
