    <p id="b346-7" data-blocks='[["BL_346.9",346,[194,1238,1146,375]]]'>In this appeal, appellant Ervin Thompson asserts, inter alia, that he was denied the fundamentals of due process at his nonjury trial because he was foreclosed from presenting evidence on his behalf. Our examination of the record reveals appellant’s trial fell below requisite minimum standards of due process, and accordingly a new trial is ordered.</p>
    <p id="b346-8" data-blocks='[["BL_346.10",346,[192,1623,1146,323]]]'>The circumstances surrounding appellant’s conviction are as follows. Thompson was indicted on charges of carrying a concealed deadly weapon and larceny of a motor vehicle. He pleaded not guilty on the larceny bill, and a demurrer was eventually sustained on the weapons charge.</p>

The Commonwealth called three witnesses. James Harris, the owner of the stolen motor vehicle, testified as to the events on the evening of June 18, 1965 when he discovered the theft. Officer John Smith, the arresting officer, gave evidence concerning the circumstances which led him to apprehend appel<a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>lant. Detective Iialph. Bozini, who had been assigned to investigate the case, testified over objection as to certain statements allegedly made by appellant concerning the ownership of an automatic gun confiscated when appellant was arrested.</p>
    <p id="b347-3" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[147,619,1154,1149]]]'>After the demurrer to the weapons charge was sustained, appellant attempted to put on his evidence. The record discloses the following: “Ervin Thompson, being duly sworn, was examined and testified as follows: By Me. Hogan : Q. Where do you reside? A. 568 Washington Avenue. Q. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania? A. Yes. Q. What is your age? A. 19 years old. Q. You have heard the testimony that you were found on June 18 in possession of a car which had been reported stolen? A. Yes. Q. Will you explain to his Honor how you got possession of the car? A. I got off at Washington Avenue. Q. Explain it. A. I got off at Washington Avenue, and went into a bar, and I found some boys, and I met a Willie Price, and I had put him off at the bar. Then 1 took my girl friend to my mother's house, and that is where I got arrested. Q. You originally took these keys from the street? A. Yes. By The Court : Q. You no doubt had the keys? A. The keys were in the car. The Court : The verdict is guilty of larceny, and on Bill 238 the sentence is to the reformatory at Camp Hill. Testimony Closed.”</p>

In my view, the justification of this Court to hear the appeal when the matter now complained of was not objected to below is that the error involved was basic and fundamental. The result was that the trial, in the words of the majority opinion, “failed to satisfy the fundamental requisites of due process in our criminal system.” This is, therefore, exactly the kind of rare situation which our “basic and fundamental error” rule was designed to protect against.
