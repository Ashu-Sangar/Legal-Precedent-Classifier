Following disposition of post-trial motions, he was sentenced to a term of five to fifteen years.

We granted allocatur to consider one narrow issue: whether the trial court erred by not allowing appellant to examine <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>at trial, for purposes of cross-examination, certain verbatim notes relative to the crime made by a State Trooper while in conference with the victim.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[189,514,1144,536]]]'>One day after the commission of the crime, the victim was interviewed by a state trooper. Defense counsel’s request to inspect these notes, made at the beginning of cross-examination of the victim was denied by the trial judge for the reason that there was no “statement’’, only notes by the trooper. Although the victim neither signed nor read the trooper’s notes, she did testify, “[h]e took down every word I said.” Perhaps due to this ruling, the trooper was not cross-examined about his report.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[189,1060,1146,697]]]'>If we conclude that this report constitutes a statement by the victim, <em>Com. v.

Notwithstanding Pa. R. Crim. P. 310, we unequivocally held in <em>Kontos </em>that relevant,, pre-trial statements of witnesses in the possession of the Commonwealth must be made available to the accused, upon request, during, the trial. The pivotal question, in our view, is whether the verbatim notes made by the trooper should have been made available for defense inspection during the trial. As in <em>Kontos, </em>we have no occasion to consider the related question whether such notes should be discoverable prior to trial since no request was made.</p>

In <em>Felton </em>an investigating officer prepared a report from an interview with a witness which was not signed by that witness. Defense counsel requested permission to inspect that report during cross-examination of that witness. Although the motion was denied, the court carefully instructed counsel that this request could be renewed during cross-examination of the officer. The court also indicated that the witness could be recalled for further cross-examination if necessary. However, counsel did not follow this path and the Third Circuit concluded the court did not err in denying immediate access to the report. In the instant appeal, counsel’s request was flatly denied and unaccompanied by any suggestion that the matter could be reconsidered when the trooper took the stand. For this reason, we deem <em>Felton </em>to be inapposite.</p>
