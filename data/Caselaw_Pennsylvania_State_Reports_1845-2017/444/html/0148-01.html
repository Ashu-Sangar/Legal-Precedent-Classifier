Fallon, Jr. Fallon was awarded $50,000.00 by a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. Fallon’s parents received an award of $7,500.00 which was reduced to $4,308.67 in accordance with a remittur. Penn Central’s motions for judgment n'o.v. and for a new trial were <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>denied. Penn Central now appeals from these judgments</p>
    <p id="b183-3" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[116,433,1151,700]]]'>Most of the facts are undisputed. The accident occurred on the railroad crossing at the Gladstone Station on the Penn Central Railroad’s Philadelphia-Media line. The crossing, maintained by the railroad to enable its patrons to use the parking lot south of the two tracks, runs generally north-south while the tracks run generally east-west. On November 12, 1964, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Fallon, then seventeen years old, approached the crossing from the north. Fallon was then a student at a college in Philadelphia, and had driven the same route every weekday morning for at least two months. He planned to park his car in the lot and catch the next eastbound train to Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b183-4" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[118,1147,1152,1195]],["BL_184.1",184,[222,331,1145,208]]]'>As Fallon approached the crossing, an eastbound train was coming to a stop on the farther track, blocking the crossing. He stopped his car, his front bumper some twenty feet from the nearer, westbound track, to wait for the train to pass. At this point he could see only a few feet east down the westbound track, his view being obstructed by the station’s shelter. This shelter is set back approximately eleven feet from the nearest rail and is approximately fifty feet to the east of the crossing. The window on the left, or driver’s side, of Fallon’s car, through which he would look for a westbound train before crossing the closer track, was open approximately a quarter of an inch at the top. His radio was on, although “[i]t wasn’t on extremely loud.” After the eastbound train had cleared the crossing, Fallon proceeded toward the westbound track. He moved forward slowly but did not stop until the front of the car was within the swath of the train. He did not hear any warning signal. He first saw the train, traveling at approximately forty-five miles an hour, when it was less than sixty feet away and then “blacked out.” The front steps on the right side of the <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>lead car of the train (which was not scheduled to stop at Gladstone) collided with the left front of the automobile. Fallon was thrown from his car and sustained bodily injuries.</p>
    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[221,549,1148,634]]]'>Penn Central makes five arguments on appeal: (1) the evidence of negligence was insufficient to warrant a verdict against appellant; (2) the verdict was against the weight of the evidence; (3) the appellee was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law because he did not stop, look and listen from a place of safety where he would have a reasonable view of oncoming trains; (4) the trial court erred in not instructing the jury, as requested, that appellant had a superior right of way at the crossing; and (5) the verdict was excessive. We find no merit in any of appellant’s contentions. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[218,1204,1150,753]]]'>We treat first the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence of Penn Central’s negligence. It is well established that in considering a motion for a judgment non obstante veredicto, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict winner. See, <em>Herron v. Silbaugh, </em><a href="/pa/436/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="436 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="1926102" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0339-01">436 Pa. 339</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20755" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="260 A.2d 755">260 A. 2d 755</a> (1970); <em>Ferraro v.

A reviewing court is not to draw its own inferences from the testimony but is rather to give the verdict winner the benefit of every favorable inference of fact which the jury might legitimately draw from the evidence.

Fallon and one of ■his witnesses testified that it was difficult if not impossible to gain an adequate view of the westbound track without putting one’s car in or dangerously close to the swath of an oncoming train. The westbound track was straight for a distance of 1380 feet to the <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>east of the crossing and then curved out of sight. One of appellee’s witnesses testified that she had to put her car “on the track” or “practically ... on the tracks” to get a view of the 1380-foot straightaway. Fallon himself indicated that trees overhanging the tracks approximately 230 feet from the crossing obscured his view of oncoming trains.</p>
    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[125,717,1151,1134]]]'>Although maintaining a crossing with what the jury may have believed to be a dangerously limited view might not have been enough by itself to warrant a finding of negligence, a railroad does have a special duty of care towards those who use such a crossing. “When a railroad company knows that the view of approaching trains at a crossing is restricted to an unduly short distance, it is ‘bound to take that fact into consideration and so to regulate the running of its trains as to make it possible for a driver to cross the tracks in safety if, when just before entering upon them, he stopped, looked and listened, and no train was within sight and sound’: Schwarz v. D. L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/211/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="211 Pa. 625" data-case-ids="940038" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0625-01">211 Pa. 625</a>, 628, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.%20255" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="61 A. 255">61 A. 255</a>.” <em>Minella v.

Although we might not have drawn the same inferences from the evidence as did the jury, we believe that the jury was justified in finding negligence from testimony that the train was traveling at 45 miles per hour, that the engineer never saw Fallon’s car, and that the engineer failed to sound the train’s horn.</p>

Appellant argues that the “negative” testimony of Fallon that he did not “hear” any warning signals and of his witness that she did not “recall hearing any” signal was not enough for the issue to be submitted to the jury in light of Penn Central’s “affirmative” testimony by three railroad em<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>ployees that the whistle was blown.

Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Bell wrote in <em>Ferruzza v. </em>Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/394/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="394 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="1280891" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0070-01">394 Pa. 70</a>, 77, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.2d%20706" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="145 A.2d 706">145 A. 2d 706</a> (1958) : “The earlier cases held that a statement by a witness that he did not hear any sound or warning was negative and insufficient to prove negligence, if there was affirmative testimony that a bell was rung or an audible sound given: [citing eases]. This was subsequently modified (expressly or by implication) and the statement that he did not hear a bell rung or ■that it was not rung was interpreted to have the same meaning and amount to positive testimony—positive in character and substance—if the witness was in a position to hear and was <em>consciously </em>listening for a sound or warning: [citing cases].” (Emphasis in original.)</p>

Bather, it is whether he had acuteness of hearing, sufficient opportunity for hearing, and occasion for listening, and whether all the other circumstances tended to show that if a warning signal had been given he probably would have heard it, and therefore, not having heard it, he could fairly assert that no warning was given.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

      <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>It thus appears that a witness does not have to <em>say </em>that he was <em>listening </em>for his testimony to be considered positive evidence. Although Fallon had his radio on and window open only a quarter of an inch, we think that the jury could properly infer that he was consciously listening from the fact that he had “occasion for listening”—he was approaching a railroad crossing. In addition, Fallon’s witness, whose window was down and whose radio was apparently off, also testified to hearing no warning while she was preparing to cross the tracks. The jury could have inferred that this witness also was “consciously listening” and that in fact no warning or a less than adequate warning was sounded. We note that the Court in <em>Gostack </em>found that the consciously listening test had been met under circumstances similar to those in this case.</p>

The pictures, taken five days after the accident, indicated that the trees which Mr. Fallon implied obstructed his view did not overhang the rails at all. However, the jury may have believed (1) that the trees did obscure the view of the rails; (2) the testimony by Fallon’s witness that one had to be on the rails to see 1,380 feet; or (3) that even assuming that appellant’s assertions of view <em>vis a vis </em>clearance to be true, the crossing did not permit a reasonably unobstructed view from a reasonably safe vantage point.

    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[222,718,1146,697]]]'>Appellant’s fourth contention is that the trial court ei’red in failing to include in its charge the following instruction: “At grade crossings, a railroad train has the superior right of way over the crossing.” We agree with the court en banc that the trial court correctly dishonored this request and instead treated the right of way question in the context of the visibility and audibility of the train. Eight of way has no meaning other than in this context. Liability in this case is not a question of who reached the crossing first but rather of the conduct of the railroad as to motorists who have complied (or have been relieved of compliance under <em>Johnson) </em>with the stop, look and listen rule.</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[224,1426,1145,640]]]'>Finally, appellant contends that the jury’s award of $50,000 for Fallon’s pain and suffering was exorbitant, prejudicial, and shocking to the conscience of a court. Fallon spent approximately two months in the hospital over the span of a year, missed a year of college, suffered a disability of the urinary tract for almost a year, and apparently has scars remaining on his face and other parts of his body. We do not find the amount of the award shocking to our consciences. See <em>Smalich v.

A witness for appellee testified that “you practically have to have your car on the tracks to see to your left.” To the contrary, appellant introduced photographs taken five days after the accident, and engineering plans of the crossing, tracks, and adjacent structures. As the learned judge noted, the photographs were professionally taken and related to “a carefully plotted survey of the station area and tracks with accurate measurements done by a professional surveyor.” These documents were not contradicted or impugned in any way. The pictures, as the majority opinion observes, “indicated that the trees which Fallon implied obstructed his view did not overhang the rails at all.” The plans <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>and pictures show that a motorist could see approximately 530 feet to the left down the westbound track with a clearance of 5 feet between the front of the automobile and the swath of the train, with a 4-foot clearance, the view was increased to 1000 feet. There was no evidence that these dimensions and distances were not accurate. Indeed, the appellee did not testify that he looked to his left when his car was in these positions; only that when he did stop, with the front end of his car in the swath of the train, “I turned my head and saw it [the train] with my left eye”, 60 feet away.</p>

McLean Trucking Co., </em><a href="/pa/434/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="434 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1922605" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0427-01">434 Pa. 427</a>, 430, <a href="/citations/?q=256%20A.2d%20606" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="256 A.2d 606">256 A. 2d 606</a> (1969); <em>Austin v.

I thus conclude that the lower court abused its discretion in refusing to order a new trial, and respectfully dissent from the decision of this Court which affirms the refusal.</p>
