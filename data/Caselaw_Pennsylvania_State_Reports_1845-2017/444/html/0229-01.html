He was elected to that office in November of the same year and re-elected in 1963 and again in 1967 to successive four year terms. In July of 1970, Walsh made several personnel changes in his office. J. Vincent McGrath was demoted from First to Second Deputy ; Ernest De Angelo was demoted from Second Deputy to Clerk II; John O’Grady was appointed First Deputy; Gene Lenart was named to the then vacant position of Record Custodian Supervisor; and Mary Burak was dismissed from the position of Clerk II.

Accordingly, the City refused to pay the salaries of O’Grady and Lenart and continued to pay the salaries of Mc-Grath, De Angelo and Burak.</p>

The City answered and interposed a counterclaim praying for an order directing the Register to comply with the Charter. There being no issue of material fact, the case was heard and decided upon cross-motions for summary judgments. On October 30, 1970, the chancellor entered a decree nisi enjoining the City from attempting to apply the provisions of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter to the office of Register of Wills, its personnel, functions or duties. It was further decreed that the City honor and accept the appointments, transfers and discharges made by Walsh and pay the salaries of his employees at the rates and for the time periods certified by him or his duly authorized representative. The decree was made final by stipulation on November 13, 1970, and this appeal ensued.</p>

Shortly after the adoption of the City-County Consolidation Amendment of 1951, a dispute arose as to its effect upon the officers and employees of the former Philadelphia County offices of Sheriff, County Commissioner, Recorder of Heeds, Clerk of the Court of Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions of the Peace, Coroner, Board of Revision of Taxes, Registration Commismission, Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, and Register of Wills.

    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[141,1112,1150,754]]]'>The matter was resolved in <em>Lennox, </em>supra, where a distinction was drawn between the Consolidation Amendment’s effect on the City’s control over the personnel of the former County offices and its control over their duties and functions. It was generally held that although the duties and functions of the former County offices must continue as before until changed by legislative action, the Amendment was self-executing with respect to immediately bringing the personnel of those offices within the purview of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. However, a different conclusion was reached with respect to the Prothonotary and the Register of Wills. Speaking for the Court in <em>Lennox, </em>Chief Justice Stern reasoned as follows:</p>

As to the Prothonotary, it is provided in Article Y, Section 7 of the <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>Constitution that Tor Philadelphia there shall be one prothonotary’s office, and one prothonotary for all said courts, to be appointed by the judges of said courts,...; the said prothonotary shall appoint such assistants as may be necessary and authorized by said courts;....’ While it is true that by Article XIY, section 1, of the Constitution, the prothonotary is designated as a county officer, and that clause (7) of the City-County Consolidation Amendment provides that upon its adoption all county officers should become officers of the City of Philadelphia, the question arises whether, in view of Article V, section 7, the Prothonotary should be considered a county officer <em>within the intendment </em>of the City-County Consolidation Amendment. It is an established principle of constitutional construction that, where a conflict exists between a specific constitutional provision which is applicable to a particular case and certain general provisions which, were it not for such conflict, might apply, the specific provision will prevail : Philadelphia v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/270/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="270 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1066021" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0353-01">270 Pa. 353</a>, 358, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%20661" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="113 A. 661">113 A. 661</a>, 662; Commonwealth ex rel. v.

Here, such a conflict does exist because, if the provision of the City-County Consolidation Amendment Avere to be deemed applicable to the Prothonotary, clause (7) thereof would enable the General Assembly or the City Council, as the case may be, so to emasculate his functions as practically to abolish his office altogether, and, while presumably such extreme power would not be lightly exercised, its mere existence Avould constitute an encroachment upon the independence and the functioning of the judiciary. Furthermore, since the Prothonotary is authorized by Article Y, section 7, to appoint such assistants as may be necessary and authorized by the courts, that authority, if it were to be circumscribed by such regulations as the Civil Service Commission <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>might see fit to apply, could conceivably be impaired or even wholly nullified. ... It is because of the constitutional status specially given the Prothonotary (as distinguished from the Clerk of Quarter Sessions, who is not specifically referred to in the judiciary article of the Constitution, apparently because his office was not regarded as so essential to the functioning of the judicial system as to constitute a fundamental part thereof), that we are led to conclude that the office of the Prothonotary does not fall within the scope of the City-County Consolidation Amendment, and that therefore, not being transformed into a city office, it has not become subject to the provisions of the Charter.</p>

This, in effect, repeals the specific holding of Lennox that the Register of Wills is exempt from municipal control because of its constitutional standing. However, because the Register of Wills performs a judicial function. and is closely integrated into the judicial branch of government, Section 16 (y) leaves it to the <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>electorate of Philadelphia to decide by referendum if and when the office of the Register of Wills shall be ‘covered’, i.e., the power over that office transferred to City Government under the Charter; and until such referendum takes place, the powers and functions or status of the office shall continue as existing at the adoption of the 1968 Constitution. Since Sections 13(a) and 13(f), as interpreted in Lennox, would have the effect of transferring to the City power over the ‘personnel’ of the office of the Register of Wills contrary to the specific constitutional mandate of Section 16 (y), the general provisions of Section 13 must give way.</p>

The drafters of Section 16 (y) were obviously aware of the judicial reasons expressed in Lennox for holding the City-County Consolidation Amendment of 1951 inapplicable to the office of the Register of Wills. This is evidenced in the direction in Section 16 (y) that the Register of Wills shall no longer be considered a constitutional office, thereby meeting the vital, if not the sole reason, for the Lennox holding that the Register of Wills was not affected by the consolidation amendment. The drafters of Section 16 (y), however, did not choose to stop after removing the constitutional status formerly accorded the Register of Wills. Had they done so, arguably, in the absence of any other provision, the office of the Register of Wills, by terms of Section (4) <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>and Sections 13 (a) and (f) of the Local Government Article, would be a City office and the Register, in the words of Section 13(f), would simply ‘continue to perform duties and be elected, appointed, compensated and organized as may be provided by the provisions of this Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth in effect’ at the time the amendment became effective until the General Assembly otherwise provided. Alternatively, if the goal was the immediate application of Section 13 of the Local Government Article, the framers of 16 (y) could have adopted comparable wording to that of Section 13(f) speaking in terms of ‘duties’ rather than the expression ‘powers and functions’. Instead of spelling out clearly in Section 16 (y) an intent to bring the office of the Register of Wills within the Local Government provisions, however, the authors of Section 16 (y) did just the opposite, choosing to continue not only the duties or functions of that office but its powers. We cannot assume that this wording was not deliberate. Read against the background of the Lennox decision, the logical conclusion is the Register of Wills is ‘so closely integrated in the judicial branch of government’ (Lennox, p. 370) as to make desirable a referendum before declaring the Register a City office under the Charter. Until this event takes place, the Register of Wills shall serve ex officio as Clerk of the Orphans’ Court Division of Common Pleas, (16 (n) of the Schedule to the Judiciary Article) subject to the supervisory and administrative control of the Supreme Court.</p>

    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[137,911,1152,972]]]'>“Defendants urge that consideration of the debate of the Constitutional Convention wherein Section 16 (y) was amended by striking out ‘in the manner provided by law’ and ‘by a referendum’ inserted, leads to the conclusion that Section 16 (y) has no limiting effect upon the jurisdiction of the City over the personnel of the Register of Wills established by Section 13 of the Local Government Article. Particular reference is made to the comments of Delegate Córtese:—‘Mr. President, in order for, let us say by way of example, the office of the clerk of the court of Quarter Session to become part of the Home Rule Charter, it is only necessary that an ordinance to that effect be passed. But to bring in an office which is not in the charter at all, as is the case with the office of the prothonotary, a referendum as provided by law is necessary.’ Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1968, page 1131.</p>

Im<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>plicit in this argument is the assumption that the framers of Section 16 (y) intended that the Local Government provisions be immediately applicable to the personnel of the Office of the Register of Wills just as they already were with regard to the Clerk of Quarter Sessions. There are several answers to this argument. ‘Such statements must be understood to be merely the personal opinion of individual members of the Convention. What the Convention adopted, and what the electors of the Commonwealth accepted, is the Constitution as it is written, and its clear meaning cannot be distorted to fit the views of those particular delegates. It must be assumed that the people who voted upon the Constitution gave to the words employed their common and ordinary significance.’ Commonwealth ex rel. Margiotti v.

In any event, before we read an ambiguity into the meaning of the constitutional phrase ‘powers and functions shall continue as at present’, we should have a more explicit indication in this constitutional debate that the Local Government Article is meant to apply to the Register of Wills before a referendum takes place. Review of the debate on this Amendment indicates that the comments of the delegates cut both ways and excerpts equally justify the opposite view.</p>
