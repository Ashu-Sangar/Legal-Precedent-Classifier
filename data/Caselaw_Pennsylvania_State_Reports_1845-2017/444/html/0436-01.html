      <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>The prosecution emanated from the fatal shooting of one George Gorrell in Philadelphia. Three eyewitnesses testified that Thomas and George Whitfield strode up to a group of teenage boys standing on a street corner; that without immediate provocation Thomas punched one of the boys, Gorrell, with his fist and as the latter fell backward, Thomas drew a revolver and shot him in the head. This evidence amply meets the test to be applied in determining the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a criminal conviction, which test we have repeatedly enunciated. For example, see <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/443/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="443 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1936963" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0085-01">443 Pa. 85</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20A.2d%20781" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="277 A.2d 781">277 A. 2d 781</a> (1971).</p>

However, while positive identification of the specimen bullet was impossible due to its mangled condition, an expert testified that the sheared and flattened bullet extracted from decedent’s head would be consistent with being a .22 “long rifle” bullet such as those found in the Thomas house.</p>

Some thought there were two, while others said there was only one, namely, Whitfield. Those who testified that Thomas was ac<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>companied by two additional persons were unable to describe the third person. Most importantly, however, all eyewitnesses described and identified Thomas as the one who shot Gorrell. We note also that Whitfield, whose testimony was introduced by the defense,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> stated Thomas did the shooting. Further, Thomas did not take the stand to deny it.</p>

The trial judge then held that it had been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that the witnesses involved had sufficient opportunity at the time of the shooting to scrutinize the person who shot Gorrell and their identification of Thomas originated from this incident and not from the identification at the police station. Two of the witnesses were standing with Gor<a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>rell and only a few feet distant from the assailant at the moment the fatal shot was fired. The third such witness was only 10 feet away. They testified the lighting was good at the time and nothing existed to impair their vision. They were also able to describe the assailant with substantial accuracy. Further, despite rigorous cross-examination their unequivocal in-court identification of Thomas never wavered. Under such circumstances, the challenged testimony was properly admitted at trial. See <em>Gilbert v.

On cross-examination the doctor said that abstracting the appellant from the situation in which he found himself, he would know right from wrong concerning the shooting of another person. But in the context of the concrete situation with its accompanying stress “in a sense of how he feels and how he responds” he would not so distinguish. Dr. Lonsdorf also testified that an encephalogram test showed defendant to have some brain disfunction but in answer to the district attorney’s questions explained that the brain disfunction in and of itself is not mental <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>disorder or mental illness, but is a background on which other things can develop.</p>

There may be an unseen ligament pressing on the mind, drawing it to consequences which it sees, but cannot avoid, and placing it under a coercion, which, while its results are clearly perceived, is incapable of resistance. The doctrine which acknowledges this mania is dangerous in its relations, and can be recognized only in the clearest cases. It ought to be shown to have been habitual, or at least to have evinced itself in more than a single instance. It is seldom directed against a particular individual; but that it may be so, is proved by the case of the young woman who was deluded by an irresistible impulse to destroy her child, though aware of the heinous nature of the act. The frequency of this constitutional malady is fortunately small, and it is better to confine it within the strictest limits. If juries were to allow it as a general motive, operating in eases of this character, its recognition would destroy social order as well as personal safety. To establish it as a justification in any particular case, it is necessary either to show, by clear proofs, its contemporaneous existence evinced by present circumstances, or the existence of an habitual tendency developed in previous cases, becoming in itself a second nature.”</p>
