Appellant argues that introduction of the tacit admission was the primary motivation of his changed plea, that because he had not been informed of his appeal rights his conviction was not “final” as of the date of <em>Miranda (Miranda v.

While it is true that the changed plea came shortly after the tacit admission had been introduced, the appellant’s own testimony indicates that it played only a minor role in his decision to plead guilty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

During his absence the prosecutor told Dennis’ counsel that he was going to press for a 15-30 year sentence if Dennis did not change his plea. Also, he apparently stated that he would seek a lesser sentence if the plea were changed although no specific term was mentioned. Dennis’ counsel informed Dennis of this exchange when he returned to the courtroom. After the session resumed, a sidebar conference was called at which the prosecutor again expressed his desire for a 15-30 year sentence, and apparently defense counsel felt the trial judge to be favorably disposed to the prosecutor’s recommendation. When appellant’s counsel returned to their table, he did not tell Dennis the specifics of the discussion but stated “that they were going to throw the book at him (you), and give him (you) the maximum.” It was at that point that appellant decided to change his plea.</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[190,1282,1145,319]]]'>It is conceded that the prosecutor in stating that he would press for a 15-30 year sentence was mistaken as to the maximum sentence (27 years was the maximum) and appellant argues that the guilty plea must be vacated because of this exaggerated threat and because he was unaware of the possible range of sentences.</p>
    <p id="b364-5" data-blocks='[["BL_364.5",364,[186,1614,1149,478]]]'>Appellant’s counsel did not specifically advise appellant that the prosecutor had erred by three years, but he did state “I don’t think it can.be that much.” Throughout these proceedings Dennis’ counsel left the decision as to the plea to appellant. He advised neither a change of plea nor a continuation of the trial but emphasized that as Dennis, not he, would have to serve any sentence the decision would have to be Dennis’.</p>

It is not enough that the defendant, his counsel, or the court have the opportunity of discovering the inaccuracy or ascertaining the truth. It must be remembered that the prosecution has as great an obligation to discover the truth and assist the court in reaching a just result as it has the duty to seek and obtain convictions of those charged with crimes. <em>Lewis v. Lebanon Court of Common Pleas, </em><a href="/pa/436/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="436 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="1926044" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0296-01">436 Pa. 296</a>, 300-301, <a href="/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20184" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="260 A.2d 184">260 A. 2d 184</a> (1969). It would have been preferable, certainly, if appellant in this case had been informed of the exact range of sentences he faced. In addition, defense counsel, prior to his client’s decision to change his plea, could have been of somewhat more help in evaluating the strength of the case the prosecution had presented. Counsel properly left the final decision to appellant, but in making that decision, appellant (or any defendant) should have the benefit of counsel’s thoughts on the strength of the evidence presented and the possible outcome of the case.</p>

On this record it is impossible to believe that Dennis would have made a different decision even had the error not been made, and the prosecutor had said that he was going to press for a maximum of 27 years instead of a maximum of 30 years. Appellant was made aware of the fact that he faced a very substantial prison term, and subtracting three years makes it, for this purpose, no less substantial.
