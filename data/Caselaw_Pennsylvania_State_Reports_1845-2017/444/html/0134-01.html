On July 13, 1970, appellant, before sentence, requested permission to withdraw his guilty plea, and the next day filed motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. A hearing before the Court en banc was held on November 9, 1970, and that Court denied appellant’s petition to withdraw his guilty plea and also denied his motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment.

      <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>Appellant’s final contention is that he should he allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because the guilty plea was induced by a representation <em>on the part of the Judge </em>that his degree-of-guilt hearing would be held before and determined by a three-Judge panel. After a careful study of the record, we cannot agree. In appellant’s brief, it is contended that at the appearance before the Judge on April 10, 1970, the Judge represented that the degree-of-guilt hearing would be before a three-Judge panel. This is an unfair and improper statement by counsel. A <em>review of the record </em>discloses that the reference made to a three-Judge panel was made by appellant’s counsel, Gerald Ruth, and not by the Judge, as alleged in the appellant’s brief:</p>

Basically, the reason defense requests this is because, if this were true and the court <em>would consider the discretion of calling in additional Judges, </em>the defense may choose to refrain at this point to put the defendant on the stand until the other Judges would be available for a hearing.” The trial Judge responded: “Well, certainly on the testimony that’s been submitted we can’t rule out a finding of murder in the first degree. As far as calling in other Judges to hear the testimony, I don’t feel any compelling necessity to do that.” At this time, Gerald Ruth did not allege or even mention that the Judge had promised that three Judges would sit if defendant pleaded guilty. •</p>
