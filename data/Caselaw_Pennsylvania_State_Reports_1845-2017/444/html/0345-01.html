But in this situation, where a public instrumentality is involved, another equally important rule is controlling, viz., “that in the absence of a statute to the contrary, public property used for public purposes is exempt from taxation . . . and no express exemption law is needed." <em>Southwest Delaware County Municipal Authority v.

In so declaring, the Court was echoing the holding in <em>Commonwealth v.

In that case the question, as framed by the Court, was whether the City of Philadelphia was liable for a tax “on all gasoline purchased and consumed by it in the performance of its governmental functions as an agent of the Commonwealth.” The statute there involved imposed a tax “upon all liquid fuels sold by dealers . . . and upon all liquid fuels used within this Commonwealth by consumers when no such tax has been collected thereon by a dealer. . . ." While containing some exemptions, there was no express exemption of municipalities when acting in their governmental capacities. In holding the city exempt, the Court said: “We have many times said that while the State may, by a general statute, tax subordinate governmental agencies in matters affecting the performance of their governmental duties, the presumption is that this was not intended, and nothing <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>short' of an expressed or necessarily implied purpose to tax them will suffice to make them liable therefor.” <a href="/pa/303/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="303 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1130005" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0112-01">303 Pa. at 117</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> It is true that these pronouncements were made with specific reference to property taxes and not to excise taxes, but wé perceive no difference in principle as far as the presumption favoring exemption is concerned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
