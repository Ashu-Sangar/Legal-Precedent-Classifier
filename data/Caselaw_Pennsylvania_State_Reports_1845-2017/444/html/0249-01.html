The principal issues involved concern (1) the power of an orphans’ court to review and reopen the distribution of a decedent’s estate on the ground of fraud and (2) the sufficiency of evidence of fraud in the instant case. We hold that an orphans’ court does have such power and that the findings of fraud are adequately supported by the present record.</p>

On February 23, 1962, the Register of Wills of Philadelphia granted letters of administration to the decedent’s brother and sister, William Shafter and appellant Dorothy Zerkas.</p>

A question also arose at that time as to whether decedent was also survived by a wife and daughter. Appellant and Shafter submitted a signed affidavit admitting the existence at one time of persons known as Pauline and Mary Eogowska but denying any legal relationship of such persons to the deceased. William Henry, counsel for the estate, filed his own affidavit setting forth his belief that decedent had a wife Pauline and a daughter Mary but that they had not been heard from for almost fifty years.</p>

Herbert Davis, a genealogist hired by William Henry on behalf of the estate to search for Pauline and Mary Eogowska, reported to the auditing judge concerning the advertising efforts which had been taken to locate Pauline and Mary.</p>

On December 29, 1964, the auditing judge ruled that the decedent’s wife Pauline had forfeited her share of the estate by virtue of willful desertion; that decedent’s daughter Mary, having been missing for almost fifty years, was presumed to have predeceased her father leaving no issue; and that the estate was therefore to be awarded in equal shares to appellant, to the executrix of William <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>Shafter, and to the Secretary of Revenue to be held for Maria Arsak under the so-called Iron Curtain Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Answers to the amended petition were timely filed, and extensive hearings were conducted in April and May of 1970 before the same auditing judge. On July 8, 1970, it was decreed that Mary Youlgaris was decedent’s daughter and that appellant, as surviving administratrix, was liable to recover the assets previously distributed.

Indeed, deference to the chancellor’s findings of fact is especially appropriate in the instant case. The judge who presided over the extensive evidentiary hearings in appellee’s petition for review had been the auditing judge in all prior judicial proceedings concerning the estate, and he himself concluded that appellant’s fraud had induced him to authorize distribution as he did in 1964 and 1968.</p>
    <p id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.4",292,[187,1386,1148,972]],["BL_293.1",293,[178,334,1148,374]]]'>In so concluding, the auditing judge relied principally on (1) the deceitful insistence of William Shatter and appellant at the time of the original decree of distribution that decedent had never been legally married and that he never had a legitimate daughter, (2) the failure of Shatter and appellant to inform their counsel or the genealogist in charge of the search for decedent’s daughter that decedent’s wife had run away to live with a man named Matthew Christy, and (3) appellant’s attempt to bribe the genealogist to testify favorably in her behalf in the 1970 hearings on appellee’s petition for review. The first of these three incidents is significant in that it contributed to the auditing judge’s decision not to require a refunding bond of the 1964 distributees to protect appellee’s interest should she later reappear. The second is important because appellee grew up under the assumed name of Mary Christy, yet none of the advertising efforts made <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>in an attempt to locate her prior to 1964 mentioned the name Christy. And the third demonstrates appellant’s continuing bad faith and thus raises a serious doubt as to her truthfulness during the pre-1964 search for appellee. This evidence is sufficient in sum to support the conclusion of the orphans’ court that its original distribution decrees had been infected by fraud.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[178,720,1148,316]]]'>In addition to the preceding contentions, appellant claims that the orphans’ court erred in not applying the equitable doctrines of unclean hands and laches, in concluding that due process required that appellee’s petition for review be granted, and in denying appellant’s discovery petition. We a.re unpersuaded.</p>
    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[176,1048,1150,577]]]'>The record discloses that appellee had previously stated under oath in Connecticut probate proceedings in the estate of Matthew Christy that she was Christy’s daughter and that her mother, Pauline Rogowska, was Christy’s wife. The orphans’ court found that these prior inconsistent statements had not been made for any selfish motive of personal gain and that appellee neither sought nor gained any portion of Christy’s estate. In these circumstances there was no error in failing to bar appellee’s petition on the ground of unclean hands.</p>
    <p id="b293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_293.6",293,[175,1646,1147,202]],["BL_294.1",294,[192,332,1145,535]]]'>In arguing that appellee is guilty of laches, appellant asserts that appellee failed to exercise due diligence to attempt to locate or contact her father between 1962 and 1969 when she had reason to believe that he <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>was either dead or of an advanced age. In contrast to decedent’s wife whose willful desertion of decedent effected a forfeiture of her share of decedent’s estate, appellee as decedent’s daughter was under no legal duty to keep in touch with her father. The petition for review was filed within the five-year limitations period prescribed for such actions by Section 721 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949. That being so, we cannot conclude on this record that the orphans’ court abused its discretion in rejecting the defense of laches.</p>
    <p id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[191,879,1147,696]]]'>We need not presently consider the constitutional issue raised by appellant. In the course of his opinion in support of the granting of appellee’s petition for review, the auditing judge suggested that appellee had been deprived of property without due process of law by virtue of the failure of the orphans’ court to have required a refunding bond from appellant and the other original distributees as a condition of the original decrees of distribution. However, even if this conclusion be erroneous, such error would be inconsequential; as set out above, the court’s exercise of discretion in granting appellee’s petition for review is adequately and independently supported by evidence of fraud.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[193,1586,1145,318]]]'>Finally, we perceive no error in the auditing judge’s denial of appellant’s petition for discovery.

The orphans’ court decreed that appellant was “liable to recover the entire balance of principal and income” awarded under the previous distribution decrees. Under Section 721 of the Fiduciaries Act, the orphans’ court possesses broad power to <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>“give sueh relief as equity and justice shall require.” This power was not abused in this particular aspect of the court’s decree.</p>

The record is certainly susceptible of these innocent interpretations. The auditing judge, however, had a full opportunity to observe the witnesses at first hand, and we cannot conclude his interpretation of these events was clearly erroneous.</p>
