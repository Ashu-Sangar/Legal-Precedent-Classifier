    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.8",461,[159,714,1148,376]]]'>This is an appeal from a final decree of the Orphans’ Court Division of the court below dismissing a petition for adoption. Appellee, the natural father of the two children involved, refused his consent and appeared in opposition to the petition. The trial judge below, finding no abandonment, denied the adoption petition. This appeal followed, and we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b461-7" data-blocks='[["BL_461.9",461,[157,1104,1149,484]]]'>The pertinent facts are as follows: Arthur Lucky Vaders, the appellee, and Barbara Ann Vaders, one of the appellants, were divorced in 1962; both have since remarried. The appellants, Barbara Ann and Kenneth Kirby, are the childrens’ natural mother and her present husband, with whom the children have been living since 1963. The children are Arthur Lucky Vaders, Jr., bom October 7, 1957, and Kim Louise Vaders, born November 7, 1958.</p>
    <p id="b461-8" data-blocks='[["BL_461.10",461,[155,1601,1149,542]]]'>Mr. Vaders provided support for the children pursuant to a support order entered about the time of divorce in 1962 in the amount of $20.00 a week, later increased to $25.00. In 1965 Vaders moved to New Jersey and generally maintained his support payments, although there were instances when he was in arrears. Until 1987 Vaders visited the children sporadically; from that year to the date of trial he had not seen the children, although the record discloses that he did keep in touch with them through occasional gifts and cards.</p>

The <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>record discloses that later in February Vaders sent Valentine greetings to his children. Although appellants testified otherwise, the father claimed also to have sent Easter cards to both children in April of 1969. Vaders was notified in August of 1969 that he was delinquent with respect to support payments to the extent of over $800, and he thereafter resumed those payments.</p>

      <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>Appellants contend that the natural father’s failure to provide support payments for a period of time in excess of six months compels a finding of abandonment. It is well settled, however, that neglect, as evidenced by failure to provide support, is not sufficient of itself to prove abandonment. “While failure on the part of a parent to support a child is a factor to be considered in determining whether the parent has abandoned the child, yet failure to support, standing alone, is not conclusive of an intent to abandon the child: Southard Adoption Case (cites omitted).” <em>Hangartner Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/407/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="407 Pa. 601" data-case-ids="1307347" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0601-01">407 Pa. 601</a>, 604-5, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20A.2d%20280" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="181 A.2d 280">181 A. 2d 280</a>, 282 (1962). This Court, in its discussion of adoption proceedings, has often stressed the necessity of coupling neglect with some other indicative acts before conclusively finding an abandonment. “Mere neglect does not necessarily constitute abandonment; ordinarily, to have that effect, it must be coupled with affirmative acts or declarations . . . indicating a positive intention to abandon the child.” <em>Harvey Adoption Case, supra, </em><a href="/pa/375/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="375 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1244425" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0001-01">375 Pa. at 6</a>.</p>

While it is true he did suspend support payments, it is equally true that he felt compelled, upon notification of his delinquency and when his business was prospering, to reinstate those payments. Although petitioners, endeavor to show that Mr. Vaders’ income grew steadily through the months in question, indicating his ability to make payments, the crucial factor is not his neglect but his willingness, even belatedly, to resume payments. Moreover, during the time when he failed to make support payments, Vaders sent cards to the children on at least one, and possibly another, occasion. As to the father’s failure to visit the children since 1967, the lower court observed, “He <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>[Vaders] says lie did not seek visitation with the children because it would only make trouble. We agree heartily, having had the opportunity to see and hear the parties.”</p>
    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[194,563,1151,866]]]'>Taken together, we feel that these facts do not add up to abandonment. This Court has often stressed the finality of a finding of abandonment: . . because of the finality of the severance, the rights of a natural parent should not be terminated unless clearly warranted by the record.

Under §414 of the new Act, consent of a parent to adoption is not required if a decree of termination of parental rights with regard to such parent has been entered, or if the court finds that grounds exist under §311 of the Act for involuntary termination of parental rights. Like the prior law, §311 speaks in terms of “settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim” and refusal or failure to perform parental duties, but as alternatives.</p>
