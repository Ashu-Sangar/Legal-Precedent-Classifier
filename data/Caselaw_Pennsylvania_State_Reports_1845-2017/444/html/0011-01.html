While several issues lurk in this appeal, <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>our independent review of the record convinces us that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant ever “received” the merchandise in question.

This case was argued on October 6, 1970. At that time, counsel for appellant had failed to file any brief, contrary to our rules of court. However, oral argument was permitted on the assurance that a brief would be forthcoming promptly, as the issues involved were complex and concerned developing areas of the law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Our prothonotary has contacted both of appellant’s counsel repeatedly since that time in an effort to have the brief submitted. More than nine months have passed since oral argument, and appellant’s brief has yet to be made available. We are mystified by such flagrant disrespect to our Court and equally reprehensible jeopardizing of appellant’s interests in violation of the canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association, formally adopted by our Court mandating that a lawyer represent his client competently and zealously within the bounds of law. One of appellant’s counsel is not a member of the bar of this Commonwealth and was granted special permission to argue orally before our Court. He has abused that privilege. Had an examination of the record not disclosed a clear lack of sufficient evidence to support the conviction, we would have had to remand this case for the appointment of new counsel and additional argument, to the prejudice of appellant who remains incarcerated while his counsel follow other pursuits. Also, an unnecessary burden is added to the <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>appellate process. We strongly condemn counsels’ behavior and will refer the matter to the appropriate authorities for further action.</p>

The narcotics squad of the Pittsburgh police department had the premises at 7818 Bennet Street, Pittsburgh under surveillance for a number of weeks. On April <em>25, </em>1968, the police entered the premises pursuant to a lawfully issued warrant and proceeded to conduct a search of the building for narcotics. A search was made of the first floor and the basement, for the police had information concerning an alleged hiding place in a powder room in the cellar. During this search the officers discovered four women’s dresses with portions of the price tags still attached in a locked cupboard in the basement. The key to the cupboard was in the possession of appellant’s mistress, Patricia Kendall Davis. Subsequent investigation disclosed that the dresses had been stolen, although there was a dearth of evidence as to how recently.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Patricia Kendal Davis, appellant’s present wife and former mistress, lived in the first floor apartment. Appellant had clothing in the bedroom of her apartment and was observed spending the night there on several occasions.</p>
