Before us today is a direct appeal from these judgments of sentence. Upon reviewing the record, we hold that appellant must be afforded new trials by virtue of the introduction into evidence in each case of an involuntary incriminating statement.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.8",255,[202,1211,967,43]]]'>The facts for the most part are not in dispute.</p>

Approximately a half an hour later he was observed searching the stolen vehicle in the 4900 block of Smedley Street by Mrs. Margaret Curren. Being suspicious of appellant’s behavior, she summoned the police, and officers Anderson and Hewitt responded to her call. As these two officers approached the scene, appellant sped away in the car. Anderson and Hewitt, at first alone and later joined by other police cars, gave chase over a distance of six miles. During this period a number of shots were fired but no one was injured.</p>
    <p id="b255-7" data-blocks='[["BL_255.10",255,[126,1983,1149,319]],["BL_256.1",256,[207,330,1146,266]]]'>The automobile chase ended when the vehicle driven by appellant failed to negotiate a turn. He immediately abandoned it and attempted to flee on foot. By this time numerous police cars had arrived at the intersection. Anderson and Hewitt continued pursuit in their squad car, while Officers Quigley and McGinty <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>ran after appellant on foot. Moments later Anderson and Hewitt alighted from their car and joined their fellow officers. Appellant fired several shots at his pursuers, and the police returned the fire. In the course of this exchange, Officer Hewitt was fatally shot.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[206,607,1145,264]]]'>Immediately thereafter, Officer Quigley overtook appellant and both of them engaged in a violent hand to hand struggle. By the time other officers succeeded in parting the pair, it was discovered that Quigley had also been fatally shot. The bullet was never recovered.</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[202,883,1147,652]]]'>Appellant was taken to the hospital with three bullet wounds in his back and one each in his right arm and shoulder. He had also been bludgeoned with a blackjack by at least two other officers. At the hospital, approximately a half hour after his arrest and while being given medical treatment for his several wounds, appellant was interrogated by Detective Thomas McDonald. Appellant admitted to McDonald having stolen the car and, in addition, confessed to the commission of eight unrelated armed robberies, burglaries and larcenies between December 2, 1946 and April 16, 1947.</p>
    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[195,1545,1149,764]],["BL_257.1",257,[132,329,1146,152]]]'>Appellant was indicted in due course and tried separately for the killings of Officers Quigley and Hewitt. At each trial he took the stand as a witness in his own behalf and admitted stealing the car. He testified that he slowed down as the police first arrived but then sped away when he was fired upon without provocation or any warning to stop. According to appellant, he then shot twice in an attempt to disable the police car but without any intent to injure the officers. He claimed that when his car was forced to stop he wanted to surrender peacefully but was not given any opportunity to do so. He admitted that he fired several times in an attempt to force his pursuers to take cover but again insisted that he had no intention to kill or injure any <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>of them. As to Officer Quigley’s death, appellant claimed that his gun discharged accidentally while Quigley wag attempting to disarm him.</p>

With respect to Bill No. 192, appellant contends that the trial court erred in charging the jury that it was irrelevant who fired the fatal shot. With respect to <em>both </em>trials, appellant asserts that the introduction of evidence of his prior unrelated criminal acts constituted a per se violation of due process and that the trial court erred in not submitting to the jury the question of the voluntariness of his hospital statements and in exhibiting bias against the defense in the presence of the jury.
