Its purpose as a nonprofit corporation, set forth in the 1881 Delaware County Charter Book, is “to encourage riding and athletic sports among the members by the maintenance of a country resort for meeting ... in Delaware County” and its principal activities are fox hunting and the conducting of horse <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>races. To further these purposes, the club had, since 1907, maintained a clubhouse on a large tract of land in Media.</p>
    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[220,518,1147,587]]]'>By 1963 the urbanization of Delaware County had seriously diminished the ability of members to effectively pursue their sport. The huntsmen were also aware of the intentions of county authorities to take their land, by eminent domain if need be, for public recreational facilities. In the face of this predicament on December 16, 1963, thirty-five of the club’s forty-eight active members met in the clubhouse for the assigned purpose “To discuss and take necessary action regarding the future of the Rose Tree Fox Hunting Club.”</p>
    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[217,1124,1148,818]]]'>The upshot of that meeting was a series of adopted resolutions authorizing the directors to sell the club’s property in Media and pay existing bank mortgages and debts of the organization. The balance of these proceeds was to be placed in trust. By its terms the trust income would be used for an experimental period of three years to support club activities in York County exclusively,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and at the conclusion of this period, the principal would be distributed to each of the active members as of December 16, 1963, who elected to withdraw his pro rata share and terminate his membership. Additionally, it was resolved that members joining after the date of this meeting would have no vested interest in the land then owned by the club or the proceeds therefrom.</p>

    <p id="b613-3" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[154,495,1148,420]]]'>However by the time the three-year trust period expired, a majority of the club was composed of York area members and the club under this new majority, took the position that it would not allow the old Philadelphia members to withdraw their shares. On September 17, 1969, an action was instituted to allow the old members to withdraw their shares in accordance with the declaration of trust.</p>
    <p id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[155,937,1148,475]]]'>After the commencement of this action and the filing of preliminary objections, the parties sought to reach a settlement which would avoid the expense of further litigation and restore harmony to the social club. In essence the plan of settlement would allow a Philadelphia member who so elected, to withdraw one-half the amount to which he would have been entitled under the 1963 resolutions, the balance to remain with the club.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[155,1435,1148,649]]]'>The lower court refused to approve this settlement and thereafter sustained appellee’s preliminary objections on the grounds that absent dissolution, the members had no vested interest in the net proceeds of the sale of club real estate in Media and therefore no trust could be created since the members did not own the trust res. It was also held that since the club was not formally dissolved, any distribution of funds would constitute a violation of the Nonprofit Corporation Code, 15 P.S. §7309. Borden’s petition to intervene was denied by the court in its decree of November 5, 1970. These appeals followed.</p>
