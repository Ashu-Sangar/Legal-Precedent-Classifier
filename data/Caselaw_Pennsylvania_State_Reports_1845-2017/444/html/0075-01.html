The time has come—indeed is long since past—for the appellate Courts, both Federal and State, to change their recently created, unrealistic legal technicalities, and to enunciate and establish, in the interest and expedition of our Constitutionally mandated speedy Justice, a new rule or a pro bono publico change in the law with respect to appeals of every nature by a person who is convicted of murder or of any other felony. Once again, I recommend that this new rule, or principle or decision (or, if appropriate, a new or amended Legis<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>lative Act), should provide that a person convicted of murder or of any other felony (1) shall have a right to file motions for a new trial and/or arrest of judgment and/or any other motion or petition <em>within ten days after conviction, </em>and (2) shall have the right of (a) <em>one and only one </em>direct counseled appeal, <em>which must be taken within thirty days </em>after a judgment of sentence or other final Order, and (b) in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, <em>one and only one </em>counseled appeal from a P.C.H.A. hearing or writ of habeas corpus or similar proceeding, <em>which must be taken within two years </em>after the entry of a judgment of sentence or other final Order.</p>
