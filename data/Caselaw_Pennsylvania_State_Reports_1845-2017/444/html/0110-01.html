L. 1664, §4, 35 P.S. §780-4. A motion for a new trial was dismissed and a sentence of 2 to 5 years imprisonment plus the payment of f500 fine was imposed. On appeal the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence without opinion. Judge Hoffman filed a dissenting opinion in which Judges Jacobs and Spaulding joined.

Shaw who was present and in possession of the house at the time was immediately placed under arrest. A pretrial motion to suppress the evidence seized in the raid was denied after an evidentiary hearing, and at trial the Commonwealth was permitted, over objection, to introduce this evidence as part of its case against Shaw. This was error. The warrant which authorized the raid and search was constitutionally defective, in that it was issued without a showing of probable cause and, therefore, evidentiary use of the property seized in the execution of the warrant was constitutionally proscribed at trial.</p>

In substance, the complaint alleged that Shaw was in possession of the premises for which the warrant was requested; that he was a known narcotics user and wanted as a fugitive by the New York State Police on a narcotics criminal charge; that an undercover agent of the Pennsylvania State Police had learned of a shipment of marijuana to the premises during April 1968 and had witnessed the use of marijuana and hashish on the premises during the same month; that from April to December the complaining officer traveled by the premises twice a week and observed the presence of automobiles bearing out-of-state licenses; and, that on December 8th, a “caravan of vehicles” came to the premises from New York State bringing many long-haired hippie-type individuals wearing “psyehodyllic and unusual clothing” who remained there for hours.</p>

In order for the issuance of a search warrant to be constitutionally valid, the issuing officer must reach the conclusion that probable cause exists at the time he issues the warrant.
