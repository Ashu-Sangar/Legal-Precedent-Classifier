    <p id="b619-12" data-blocks='[["BL_619.18",619,[140,1894,1148,267]]]'>This is an appeal from an order entered below denying without hearing appellant’s petition for post-conviction relief from the judgment of sentence imposed following his conviction by a jury in Dauphin County, on June 5, 1963, of murder in the second degree.</p>

In 1965, he alleged in habeas corpus proceedings that he had been unlawfully deprived of his <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>appeal rights, but after an evidentiary counseled hearing<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the trial court ruled that since Newsome had been fully and timely advised of his right to appeal, he knowingly and intelligently waived this right. We subsequently affirmed this ruling, <a href="/pa/428/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="428 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1912323" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0141-01">428 Pa. 141</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20763" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="236 A.2d 763">236 A. 2d 763</a> (1968).</p>
    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[189,668,1149,817]]]'>The only reasons asserted in the instant petition why relief should be granted are: (1) Petitioner’s arrest was illegal because it was based on the coerced statement of his girl friend; (2) The trial court erred in denying a motion to sequester the witnesses at trial; and, (3) Petitioner’s right to be tried by an impartial jury was prejudiced because a prospective juror (who was excused for cause) stated during voir dire examination in the hearing of the entire panel that “according to my mind, I think the man is guilty.” These complaints are not cognizable in a collateral attack on the conviction and judgment. They pertain to trial error which may be challenged only in a direct appeal. And as noted before, we have ruled that Newsome knowingly and intelligently waived his right to such an appeal.</p>
