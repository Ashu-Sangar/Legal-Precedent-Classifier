Appellants in their original briefs and argument had challenged <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>the disparity in the measure of damages for personal injury resulting in death, depending solely upon whether suit is commenced before or after the death. The issue was adverted to in Part 4 of our opinion, but not decided because the record before us did. not show that the question had been raised at the trial by exceptions to the charge or in points for charge. See <em>Evans v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., </em><a href="/pa/418/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="418 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1896088" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0567-01">418 Pa. 567</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=212%20A.2d%20440" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="212 A.2d 440">212 A. 2d 440</a> (1965). In their petition for reargument, appellants brought to our attention portions of the trial record, not included in the printed record on appeal, which showed that in fact the question had been properly raised and preserved at trial. We accordingly granted reargument and now address ourselves to the merits of the problem.</p>

The rule which the court below correctly applied in this case, because the action was commenced during the lifetime of the minor plaintiff, Mary Ann Incollingo, is that of <em>Radobersky v. Imperial Volunteer Fire Department, </em><a href="/pa/368/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="368 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1230381" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0235-01">368 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20865" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="81 A.2d 865">81 A. 2d 865</a> (1951). Under the rule of that case, damages are awarded on the basis of the deceased plaintiff’s anticipated gross earnings, with no deduction of cost of maintenance before reducing the loss of earnings to present worth. The rule which appellant urges upon us is that of <em>Murray v. Philadelphia Transp. Co., </em><a href="/pa/359/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="359 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="473161" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0069-01">359 Pa. 69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20323" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="58 A.2d 323">58 A. 2d 323</a> (1948), applicable in cases where suit is commenced by the personal representative. Under <em>Murray </em>the measure of damages would be loss of <em>net </em>earning power—gross earnings diminished by the amount the deceased plaintiff would <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>have had to expend for his own maintenance had he not died, reduced to present worth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[169,437,1150,1148]]]'>The arguments of the parties may be briefly summarized as follows: Appellant asserts that the dichotomy between the measures of damages is unjustifiable and that one rule applying to all survival actions should be adopted. That rule should be the realistically compensatory net earnings rule of <em>M'ti/rray. </em>The gross earnings rule of <em>Radoberslcy </em>awards damages which include the amount which the defendant would have had to expend on himself had he lived; when death has in fact occurred prior to suit, such an award is excessive and in effect punitive. Appellees counter that the <em>Murray </em>rule is the solitary aberration in a century of judicial decisions which establish estimated gross earnings as the standard of recovery, and if indeed the measure of damage rule is to be made uniform, it is the <em>Murray </em>decision rather than <em>Radoberslcy </em>which should be abandoned. Appellees’ alternative position is that should we reverse the <em>Radoberslcy </em>decision, which was indisputably the governing law at the time of this trial, such ruling should in fairness be purely prospective so as not to apply in the instant case.</p>

At common law, there was no recovery for wrongful death and the right of action for personal injuries whether or not suit had been commenced before death did not survive the death of an injured person. See <em>Murray v. Philadelphia Transp. Co., supra; Pennsylvania RR v. McCloskey’s Admr., </em><a href="/pa/23/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="23 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="974049" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0526-01">23 Pa. 526</a> <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>(1854). See generally Harper and James, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>§24.1 et seq. (1956). This condition was remedied in Pennsylvania by legislative enactments, the most recent of which, with regard to survival actions, are §§601, 602 and 603 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Those sections provide as follows:</p>

That case held that damages should consist of pain and suffering until death and loss of estimated earning power, without deduction, from the date of the injury for the period of life expectancy. This rule was reiterated in many subsequent opinions. See, e.g., <em>Kaczorowski v.

Co., supra. </em>That case accords with <em>Pezzulli, supra, </em>only to the extent that it indicates that the measure of damages should be the same in both categories of survival actions. The <em>Murray </em>court, after carefully reexamining the established measure of damages mandated by a long line of judicial precedents, concluded that damages should be measured by loss of net, rather than gross, earnings. In so deciding, the Court noted that when a plaintiff is totally disabled as the result of an injury, but has not died, he is awarded his estimated loss of gross earnings, from which he must pay his own maintenance costs, so that “all that remains is his net earnings.” If such a plaintiff dies, however, the expense of maintaining himself during the period of his life expectancy is eliminated. To include this predictable but unexpended maintenance cost in an award to the decedent’s estate, said the Court, resulted in recovery which is more than compensatory.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The opinion speaks generally in terms of an individual who is fully disabled due to another’s negligence and subsequently expires because of the same injury, never differentiating as to the time that the suit was commenced. Credence is lent to this interpretation by Mr. Justice Stern's dissenting opinion, <a href="/pa/359/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="359 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="473161" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0069-01">359 Pa. 69</a>, 76, which avowed that the majority had overruled 100 years of precedent (which prece<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>dents, it should be noted, had developed under the survival of suit statute).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

As the case before us graphically illustrates, the damages issue has become so conceptualized as to result in a formalistic and paradoxical rule which varies the measure of damages dramatically depending upon whether or not the plaintiff has been able to reach the prothonotary’s office before death has reached him. We can but agree that both <em>Pezzulli, </em>

Clearly, damages are to be compensatory to the full extent of the injury sustained, but the award should be limited to compensation and compensation alone. See <em>McLane v.

Expressed more concisely by Chief Justice Gibson, speaking for the Court in <em>Forsyth v. Palmer, 2 </em>Harris 96, 97 (1850) : “The rule is to give actual compensation, by graduating the amount of the damages exactly to the extent of the loss.” Accord, <em>Kountz v.

But if such a plaintiff dies, his action, whether commenced or continued by his personal representative, is for the benefit of the estate. We cannot be blind to the reality that neither the deceased person nor his estate is burdened with the personal maintenance costs of the decedent. It thus becomes clear that the proper measure of damages designed to be compensatory must include a deduction based upon decedent’s cost of personal maintenance. On the other hand, the estate should not be deprived of those earnings which are in excess of decedent’s personal expenses, which funds could be distributed through decedents’ estate in much the same manner that the decedent himself might have apportioned them. If we were seeking to compensate for the loss of life itself, it may be true that the best approximation of the value of that life could be cast in terms of an individual’s personal maintenance costs. It has never been the law in Pennsylvania, however, nor do we here choose to hold that the loss of life itself is compensable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Following five years of pretrial proceedings, a seven week trial took place in 1967. The transcript of that trial encompasses eight lengthy printed volumes in which testimony bearing upon the issue of liability is inextricably intertwined with testimony bearing upon the issue of damages. It appears that a retrial even though limited solely to the issue of damages would necessitate extensive and expensive dupli<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>cation of evidence tracing the history of decedent’s illness, medical history, pain and suffering, and, in addition, include expert testimony as to decedent’s projected future earnings and maintenance expenses.</p>
