    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.7",487,[146,606,1148,321]]]'>On October 17, 1969, appellant was tried before a judge and jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Lie was found guilty of second degree murder. His post-trial motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied and he was sentenced to serve a term of from four to eight years in prison.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.8",487,[145,939,1148,419]]]'>On direct appeal from the judgment of sentence, appellant alleges two errors: (1) that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to properly charge the jury on the necessity of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) that the court should have granted his motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment because the verdict was not supported by the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.9",487,[142,1380,1150,818]]]'>Appellant urges that one portion of the charge is violative of one of the basic precepts of criminal justice—that the defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. The allegedly offensive portion of the charge reads: “And now, members of the jury, you are shortly going to retire to the jury room to give this case your careful consideration. You <em>may </em>return a verdict of not guilty if the guilt of the accused has not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt. You may, if the evidence warrants, return a verdict of guilty of Murder in the First Degree. You may return a verdict of guilty of Murder in the Second Degree. You may return a verdict of Voluntary Manslaughter.” (Emphasis added)</p>

See, e.g., <em>In re Winship, </em><a href="/us/397/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="397 U.S. 358" data-case-ids="12054393" data-case-paths="/us/397/0358-01">397 U.S. 358</a> (1970); <em>Commonwealth v.

It is well established, however, that in reviewing a charge to determine whether or not there has been reversible error, we must consider the charge as a whole. <em>Commonwealth v. Butler, </em><a href="/pa/443/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="443 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1936987" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0545-01">443 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=278%20A.2d%20911" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="278 A.2d 911">278 A. 2d 911</a> (1971); <em>Commonwealth v.

An examination of the charge as a whole clearly indicates that the lower court properly and fully charged as to the <em>necessity </em>of proving a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The following five passages from the charge demonstrate that, in the charge as a whole, the requisite language was used. “Our forefathers in their great wisdom in establishing the tribunal of justice made an inflexible rule that the accused <em>must </em>be presumed innocent throughout the entire course of the trial <em>of the </em>case and until such time as the jury by a consideration of all the evidence, the arguments of counsel and the charge of the court conclude that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

On the night of January 17, 1969, appellant and Kleer (the victim) engaged in a fight in the bar of the Carnegie Hotel in Pittsburgh. This fight was the sequel to an earlier fight between the two in which the victim had beaten the appellant. While on the way to the Carnegie Hotel on the night of the shooting, the appellant and his brother both stated that they were going to get even with Kleer. Once in the bar, appellant and his brother jumped Kleer. The fight was temporarily quelled by the barkeeper, but soon thereafter resumed outside. During this continuation of the fight, appellant told a friend, who had gone to the bar with him, to go to the car and get the gun. This friend was prevented from getting the gun <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>by one of the hotel’s waitresses. Appellant, his brother, and the friend then proceeded to wait in an alley next to the hotel where the friend heard a sound which resembled a shot. The victim was shot while passing in front of the alley at the same time that the appellant was positioned in the alley. Appellant, his brother and the friend then sped away in their car. While in the car, appellant’s brother said to him, “Well, you got him back for what he did to you.”</p>
