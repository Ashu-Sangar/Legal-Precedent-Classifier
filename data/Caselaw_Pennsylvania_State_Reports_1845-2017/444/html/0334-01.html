    <p id="b368-5" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[193,1067,1149,431]]]'>Cross-examination developed that Mrs. Raub had never before spoken with the appellant and, consequently, was unable to identify the voice on the telephone as his.

Pertinent to our present fact situation is the statement of the Superior Court in the case last cited: “The Commonwealth was not confined to proof of familiarity with the voice of the person telephoning. . . . The fact that [appellant] was the person who telephoned . . . [the witness] is not to be distinguished from any other fact and may be proved by competent direct or circumstantial evidence.” We may add that in some instances it would seem that voice identification might be the less reliable form of ascertaining who placed the telephone call.</p>

Thus Mrs. Abel further testified that after she had repeatedly asked appellant where Grant White had gone, appellant told her he had killed White by shooting him numerous times. Moreover, appellant himself took the stand and testified that he was waiting for the deceased at the trestle, close to where decedent’s body was ultimately found, on November 21, 1968.
