Such a rating is the only prerequisite necessary for dismissal by the Board absent a showing of bad faith or arbitrary and capricious action on the part of the Board. See, e.g., <em>Travis v.

DuBois Area School </em>District, supra. However, the cases are entirely dissimilar, for in Mullen, the hearing court specifically determined that the appellant in that case was competent and his dismissal was the result of an arbitrary and capricious exercise of the discretionary power vested in his employers. Our review of the evidence supported the hearing court’s finding.

As was observed in <em>Travis v. Teter, </em>supra: “. . . It is well settled that in a mandamus proceeding a Court can compel a public official who is vested with discretionary power to exercise that discretion; but (unless the discretion is arbitrarily or fraudulently exercised or is based upon a mistaken view of the law) it cannot interfere with or control the official’s discretion of judgment. Expressed another way, it is the discretion and judgment of the official (who is vested with a discretionary power) which prevails and not that of a Court or a jury or a person aggrieved; and a Court cannot compel such official to exercise Ms discretion in a manner which will produce a result which the Court may deem wise or desirable: Kaufman Construction Co. v.
