Davis and Charlotte Davis, are a husband and wife who in 1959, with funds derived from the sale of jointly owned real estate, purchased land in Luzerne County as tenants by the entire-ties with a view to establishing thereon a nursing home. A building for the purpose was constructed the same year, and thereafter operated by them under the names of “Davis Nursing Home”, “Davis Convalescent Home”, and “Davis Nursing and Convalescent Home”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellees maintained two bank accounts, each entitled “Davis Convalescent Home,” with authority in both to withdraw monies.

Davis listed the nursing home with one Irving Levin, a New York real estate broker, for sale. Soon thereafter Mr. Levin procured appellant as a prospective purchaser, and a “binder agreement” was entered into, signed by appellant as purchaser, appellee William S. Davis as “Seller (Owner)”, and Mr. Levin as broker. The agreement was not signed by Charlotte Davis, nor was she mentioned in it. In July Mrs. Davis, through her lawyer, advised appel<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>lant in writing that she would not convey any interest in the nursing home. Mr. Davis tendered a return of the $1,000 hand money, which was refused. This suit for specific performance was then commenced.</p>

We therefore need not decide whether there was a partnership, or whether, if there was one, the binder agreement called for a sale of the partnership business, including its assets, or a sale only of the specified real estate, personal property and good will. Neither do we need consider the fact that this binder by its terms was subject to further approval by the seller, with a formal sales agreement to follow thereafter. The remaining portion of this opinion will assume that the Davises were operating the home as a partnership and that they owned the as<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>sets of the business, including the real estate, in that capacity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b375-4" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[135,445,1156,1483]]]'>Under Section 10(4) of the Uniform Partnership Act, Act of March 26, 1915, P. L. 18, 59 P.S. §32 (the Partnership Act), a conveyance by one partner of real estate (and by the same token an agreement to make a conveyance) titled in the names of all the partners, passes the equitable interest of the partnership, subject, however, to an important proviso, viz., that the act is within the authority of paragraph (1) of Section 9 of the Partnershjp Act. Section 9(1) makes a partner an agent of the partnership <em>“for the purpose of its business”, </em>and makes the act of a partner “for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership” binding on a partnership unless in fact the partner has no such authority, and the person with whom he is dealing knows he has not. The transaction here involved was manifestly not the carrying on in the usual way of the business of the partnership, but the converse; it was the sale of the business, including good will and apparently all other assets, except cash. Under paragraph (2) of the same Section 9, such a transaction is not binding on the partnership unless authorized by all partners. Similarly, paragraph (3) provides that all partners must authorize, <em>inter alia, </em>the disposition of the good will of the business or the doing of “any other act which would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the partnership.”</p>

      <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>Appellant argues that Charlotte Davis, <em>by </em>her conduct, tacitly authorized her husband-partner to enter into the binder agreement, or at least that she is es-topped to deny such authorization. The chancellor did not find the elements of estoppel (i.e., that appellant was misled, to his detriment, by the conduct of Mrs. Davis), but that issue aside, we think that, at least insofar as the contemplated conveyance relates to real estate, the nonsigning partner’s authorization to the one purporting to act for the partnership must be in writing in order to be binding. Nothing in Section 9 of the Partnership Act dealing with the extent of a partner’s agency relationship with the firm provides or suggests that the requisite authority of the partners for whom one partner is acting can be less than written authority where real estate is involved. There is no reason to suppose that the unequivocal and long-standing requirement of the Statute of Frauds that an agent to sell real estate must be authorized to do so in writing in order to charge his principal<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> is not applicable to a partnership agent, and we hold that the authority must be so evidenced.
