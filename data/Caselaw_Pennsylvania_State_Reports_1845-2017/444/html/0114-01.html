Jones, was called for trial in Philadelphia on four bills of indictment charging him with the following criminal offenses: Bills Nos. <em>1237 </em>and <em>1238 </em>February Sessions <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>1964, Illegal Possession and Use of Narcotic Drugs; Bills Nos. <em>518 </em>and <em>514 </em>February Sessions 1964, Larceny and Use of Narcotic Drugs. Jones pleaded “not guilty” to <em>all </em>indictments and waived a jury trial. According to tbe official transcribed notes of tbe proceedings, it appears <em>that </em>after the Commonwealth had presented some testimony to sustain the indictments, counsel for Jones stated to the court, “the defendant will change his plea on the charge of unlawful use of drugs.” Counsel were then invited to approach the bench and after a side bar conference the following discussion ensued: “Mr. Irwin [defense counsel]: If your Honor please, the defendant will change his plea on the Charge of unlawful use of drugs. The Court: That is Bill No. 1237? Mr. Irwin: He will plead guilty to the one in June [sic; July] of 1964, No. 514. (The Defendant was rearraigned and pleaded Guilty to Bill No. 514.) The Court: What about Bill No. 1237? Mr. Irwin: The defendant will change his plea on that, also. (The Defendant was rearraigned and pleaded Guilty to Bill No. 1237.) Mr. Irwin: I think I should demur to Bill No. 1238. The Court: Demurrer sustained.”</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[219,1562,1146,99]]]'>Hence, as far as the record discloses no disposition was made or adjudication entered as to Bill No. 513.</p>

During the sentencing procedure, Jones was represented by counsel other than his trial counsel.</p>

An appeal was entered in the Superior Court which subsequently <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>affirmed the judgment without opinion. Judge Hoffman filed a dissenting opinion in which Judges Spaulding and Cercone joined. See <a href="/pa-super/215/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="215 Pa.

    <p id="b149-3" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[114,557,1148,311]]]'>The record clearly fails to sustain any conviction on indictment No. 513 and, needless to say, we are bound by the record. Moreover, conviction of criminal charges may not be presumed and a judgment of sentence may not be imposed on a conviction which the record does not sustain.</p>
