Plaintiffs contend it does not and for several reasons. The first is that the provision exempting from taxation those persons whose incomes fall below $1,000 or $1,500, depending upon whether they are single or married, shows upon its face a lack of uniformity. There can be no doubt that these exemptions were inserted for the purpose of putting the burden of the tax upon those most able to bear it, <em>but it results in taxing those whose incomes arise above a stated figure merely because the legislature believes their incomes are sufficiently great to be taxed. It is obvious that the application of the tax is not uniform. . . </em>.

    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[204,1591,1150,697]]]'>The second of the two decisions most significant to the instant case is <em>Saulsbury v. Bethlehem Steel Company, </em>supra, decided in 1964. In that case we ruled then an “occupation and occupational privilege tax” which exempted individuals with an annual income of less than $600 transgressed the limits of uniformity. In so holding, this Court reaffirmed the rule of <em>Kelley v. Kalodner </em>and largely on the basis of that decision concluded that: “If a tax is levied on an occupational privilege, it must apply to <em>all </em>who share the privilege.

      <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>It is true that the challengers of the constitutionality of state or local taxation bear a heavy burden in their efforts to overturn such legislation. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Life Assurance Company of Pennsylvania, </em>supra, at 376-77, <a href="/citations/?q=214%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="214 A.2d 209">214 A. 2d at 214</a>. Nevertheless, in comparing the taxing scheme in <em>Kelley </em>and <em>Saulsbury </em>with that involved in the instant case, the conclusion is unescapable that the personal income tax presently challenged violates uniformity. Although the Tax Reform Code of 1971 purports to impose a flat 3%% tax upon “taxable income”, the concept of “taxable income” already reflects the federal personal exemptions for the taxpayer and his qualified dependents. (See Table I, supra, lines 49 and 50.) Thus, built-in to the Tax Reform Code of 1971 are <em>exactly the same elements of nonuniformity </em>as were condemned in both <em>Kelley </em>and <em>Saulsbury.</em>

The Tax Reform Code of 1971 imposes in its own terms a tax “[f]or the privilege of receiving, earning or otherwise acquiring income from any source whatsoever . . . .” The holder of tax exempt Pennsylvania securities certainly enjoys this privilege of receiving income yet is not taxed for the privilege but instead is given a tax preference. This situation is manifestly contrary to our holding in <em>Saulsbury </em>that a tax upon a privilege “. . . must apply to all who share the privilege.” In addition, despite the existence of a legislative policy favoring this type of tax preference for state and local obligations of this Commonwealth, such a legislative policy cannot prevail over a clear constitutional mandate of uniformity.</p>

However, taxes of nearly every kind and description and nomenclature are Constitutionally and legally permissible, provided they do not violate any provision of the Constitution or any pertinent statute. Of all the provisions of the Constitution, the interpretation and application of those provisions which pertain to taxes, and especially the <em>Uniformity Clause, </em>present the most difficulties. Some of this Court’s decisions on the subject of taxes are confusing, and others irreconcilable. Moreover, similar difficulties arise in the interpretation and application of tax <em>statutes </em>and tax <em>ordinances. </em>An illustration of this difficulty may be found in the recent case of <em>National Biscuit Co. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/374/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="374 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1241450" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0604-01">374 Pa. 604</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%20182" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="98 A.2d 182">98 A. 2d 182</a>, in which this Court held that a tax on the privilege of transacting business was an <em>excise </em>tax, and was not duplicative of the corporate net income tax, or of the State’s capital stock tax, or of its foreign corporation <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>franchise tax, because those taxes were <em>property </em>taxes, whereas the challenged Philadelphia ordinance .tax was an excise or privilege tax.

This interpretation and conclusion was arrived at by determining (1) whether the challenged tax is a tax on the same subject matter and (2) whether the measure of the tax “is the base or yardstick by which the tax is applied.” Irrespective of what said tax actually and legally was (and which of the aforesaid cases was correctly decided), these cases demonstrate that a provision of the Constitution, or of a statute, or of an ordinance pertaining to taxes is oftentimes very difficult of interpretation, as well as application.</p>

The federal definition is complicated, but in simplest terms means gross income (as defined in the Code) less certain adjustments. From this “adjusted gross income” are subtracted allowable deductions (or a standard deduction if deductions are not itemized) and personal exemptions. The resultant figure is “taxable income”. To this the federal code applies a graduated rate of tax and then permits certain tax credits. The state statute applies a flat 3.5% rate. The result of this incorporation by reference of the federal definition is, as the majority opinion and the opinion of President Judge Bowman, dissenting in the court below, make clear, to employ as a tax base a figure which is something less than all income received by a taxpayer, and which may vary considerably even among taxpayers having the <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>same gross income, depending on their particular situations.</p>

The reason is that, in addition to certain deductions allowed to individuals which have no similarity to those allowed to corporations (notably deductions for medical expenses and alimony payments), there is no parallel in the federal income tax on corporations with the exemptions which are an integral part of the federal income tax on individuals. The federal income tax on individuals, as is well known, allows a personal exemption of |625<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> for each taxpayer and for each of his dependents as defined, allows an additional exemption if the taxpayer is 65 years of age or older, and an additional exemption if the taxpayer is blind. I agree with Judge Bowman that these exemptions, “while meritorious in terms of ability to pay, bear no rational relationship to a tax on net income.” Moreover, as the majority opinion makes clear, exemptions very like those now in the federal income tax structure were held violative of the uniformity clause in <em>Kelly v.

Neither are the exemptions saved by the new Section 2(b) (ii) of Article VIII of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides for the establishing of classes of taxpayers who are in need of tax exemption or special tax provision because of age, disability, infirmity or poverty. This is so both because the Legislature did not undertake to establish such classes with respect to the federal exemptions and because those exemptions apply regardless of the amount of the taxpayer’s income.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a>
