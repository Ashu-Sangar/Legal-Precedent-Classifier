Hence, the parent’s presence in the litigation resulted from Pados’ action and not that of her child. Secondly, the minor plaintiff did not testify against her mother, nor did the latter admit negligence, thereby making her insurer liable. Only Pados testified against the additional defendant, and the imposition of liability by the jury was not the product of dispute, contention or any other disruptive circumstances within the family circle.</p>

In the case now before us, the defendant Pados joined Mrs. Falco as an additional defendant; Edward Falco did not <em>institute </em>the suit against his wife. My comments in an earlier similar <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>situation are equally applicable here: “In the absence of any spousal conflict, dissension or disagreement created by the institution of the trespass action itself, there is no basis for concluding, as a matter of fact or policy, that domestic harmony is threatened or destroyed by litigation of the present nature. There is an obvious and significant difference in the impact which direct litigation . . . may have upon a marriage as contrasted to recovery, as here, on a judgment created by third party litigation in which both spouses unite in a joint effort to place liability upon an original defendant.</p>

In the absence of a showing (or even a suggestion) that the circumstances here in any way offend the <em>judicially </em>announced public policy of preventing marital discord, there is no reason for denying the spouse enjoyment of the judgment. To do otherwise, on this record, is to employ the public policy doctrine where the reason for the rale does not, in fact, exist. So employed, the doctrine is not a concept for preserving domestic harmony, but becomes instead a misdirected application for defeating a fair and just result. Surely, developing concepts of proper responsibility for negligent conduct prompts the rejection of needless extensions of immunities.</p>

I believe, nevertheless, that these are areas of the parent-child relationship, unique in our society, to which the traditional concepts of negligence should not be applied. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, discarding the doctrine of parental immunity in <em>Goller v. White, </em><a href="/wis-2d/20/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="20 Wis. 2d 402" data-case-ids="8676230" data-case-paths="/wis-2d/20/0402-01">20 Wis. 2d 402</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20N.W.2d%20193" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="122 N.W.2d 193">122 N.W. 2d 193</a> (1963), excepted two situations from the scope of its decision: “(1) where the alleged negligent act involves an exercise of parental authority over the child; and (2) where the alleged negligent act involves an exercise of ordinary parental discretion with respect to the provision of food, clothing, housing, medical and dental services and other care.” In my view, the premise upon which the parental immunity doctrine has traditionally been supported, preservation of family harmony and parental authority, is a valid reason for recognizing the Wisconsin court’s exceptions. While the facts of the case at bar do not involve the excepted areas, I add this caveat in light of the Court’s statement that “the doctrine of parental immunity has no rational purpose today, and henceforth will not be recognized in Pennsylvania.”</p>
