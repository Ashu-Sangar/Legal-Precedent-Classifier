On September 21, 1960, appellant Moroz, while represented by counsel, pleaded guilty to a murder indictment before a three-Judge Court.

Upon appeal, we remanded the case to the lower Court with leave to file post-trial motions, and with a right to appeal if such motions were denied. Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were filed in the Court below and denied, and these appeals followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a>

His counsel also contacted several potential defense witnesses, including appellant’s private family doctor in order to have him testify that appellant’s mother had visited him several times about appellant’s excessive drinking and other family problems. We cannot hold, after a searching examination of the record, that it was gross error on the part of counsel, <em>Commonwealth v.
