In 1963, appellant sought a writ of habeas corpus in the State Courts and, after a complete hearing, the relief sought was denied.

Appellant, an auxiliary policeman, later that day went to his wife’s apartment. He testified as follows with respect to what thereafter transpired: Upon entering the apartment, he discovered his wife having sexual relations in front of Ms children with Robert Cliett. He left the bedroom and walked into another room, where Ms wife soon joined him. When he told her that he would report her conduct to the Court, she shouted to Cliett, “Get Mm!” Cliett picked up a large wooden slat and charged toward appellant, who then fired the gun in Cliett’s direction. Appellant wag unable to remember anything after firing the first shot. His first recollection afterwards was that he had <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>a gun in his hand in an alley about one-half a block from his wife’s apartment.</p>

His defense to the killing of his wife was that he “blacked out” after firing the first shot at Cliett, and hence could not have had the requisite criminal intent to be convicted of any crime subsequent thereto.</p>
    <p id="b52-6" data-blocks='[["BL_52.6",52,[215,1096,1148,1128]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that the Court below erred in permitting the district attorney to read into the record the testimony of a Commonwealth witness taken at appellant’s degree-of-guilt hearing in 1962, after the Commonwealth proved the unavailability of this witness at the time of trial. The Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, §3, 19 P.S. §582, provides: “Whenever any person has been examined as a witness, either for the commonwealth or for the defense, in any criminal proceeding conducted in or before a court of record, and the defendant has been present and has had an opportunity to examine or cross-examine, if such witness afterwards die, or be out of the jurisdiction so that he cannot be effectively served with a subpoena, <em>or if he cannot he found </em>

      <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>Appellant does not contend that the Commonwealth failed to show the unavailability of this witness. Rather, he claims that there is a substantially significant difference between a degree-of-guilt hearing and a subsequent jury trial, in that the motivation to cross-examine is not as strong in the former proceeding as in the latter, and that the criminal issues are completely different in each. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b53-4" data-blocks='[["BL_53.4",53,[111,772,1149,1174]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v.

We rejected this contention, and held that there was no error in admitting into evidence at the trial the transcript of the testimony given by a deceased witness if defendant had been represented at the prior proceeding and had had the right to cross-examine the witness. We pertinently said (page 525) : “Our basic concern is for the reliability of the testimony which was elicited in the preliminary hearing, and we do not feel that its reliability is affected by the scope or focus of the proceedings.” We believe this test of <em>reliability </em>is applicable and is met when defense counsel, as here, has the opportunity to cross-examine the now missing witness at a degree-of-guilt hearing. The motive and reason for cross-examination is readily apparent and equally important in each of said hearings, i.e., to challenge and discredit the witness’s testimony and lay the grounds for a rebuttal and/or a reduction of the crime.</p>
