    <p id="b65-10" data-blocks='[["BL_65.12",65,[121,1251,1147,152]]]'>This case involves a dispute between the executors of the Estate of Mathias P. Whitenight and his widow Hazel over the ownership of certain bearer bonds.</p>
    <p id="b65-11" data-blocks='[["BL_65.13",65,[119,1413,1150,912]]]'>Mathias P. Whitenight died testate on January 21, 1968. On January 30, 1968, letters testamentary were granted by the Register of Wills to M. Paul Whitenight and Mathias C. Whitenight, two sons of the testator who were apparently named as his executors. White-night’s will does not appear in the record. However, the Opinion of the lower Court states that his will, after providing a $1,000 bequest to a grandson, gives his widow, Hazel Whitenight, <em>the income for life from one-third of his residuary estate, </em>the corpus to be divided at her death among his seven children (by a prior marriage) or their issue. Testator gave the remaining two-thirds of his residuary estate absolutely to his seven children or their issue. Although the will gives his widow Hazel less than her statutory share, the Court’s Opinion states that she did not elect to take against his will.</p>

      <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>Shortly after testator’s death, his executors and their attorney undertook to locate $18,000 of U. S. Treasury bonds which they believed were owned by the testator, but which were not found among his personal effects.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[192,595,1147,853]]]'>On April 20, 1968, the attorney for the Estate wrote a memorandum to all of the beneficiaries of the Estate, informing them that he had notified the United States Treasury Department that the bonds were missing. On April 30, 1968, testator’s widow Hazel, who had lived with her husband in their jointly owned home, wrote to the attorney for the Estate stating that she had possession of these bonds. She added (1) that between 1962 and 1963, $6,000 (face value) of the Treasury bonds had been purchased with money supplied from her earnings as a teacher; (2) that $5,000 of the Treasury bonds had been given to her by her husband in repayment of a loan; and (3) that $5,000 of these Treasury bonds were given to her by her husband as a gift, $2,000 of which was to equalize gifts which her husband had made to his children.</p>
    <p id="b66-5" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[191,1468,1145,371]]]'>On April 21, 1969, the executors brought this action in replevin against Hazel Whitenight, seeking possession of all the above-mentioned bonds. After Hazel filed an answer denying the executors’ ownership (or right to possession), the case went to trial, on August 26, 1969, before the President Judge sitting without a jury.</p>

This was further corroborated by testimony and by the bank records. The executors thereby made out a prima facie case of ownership in the testator. See cases, infra. After the executors had <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>rested, Hazel Whitenight was ealled as a witness to support her claim. The executors objected to her testimony on the ground that her interest was adverse to the interest of the testator’s estate and, therefore, she was incompetent to testify under the “Dead Man’s Rule”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> as to any matter that transpired between herself and the decedent during his lifetime. Their objection was overruled, and Hazel’s testimony was admitted. Moreover, the Court believed Hazel’s testimony. Following submission by both parties of requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law, the lower Court entered a verdict in favor of Hazel. Exceptions filed by the executors were dismissed by the lower Court, and from the judgment entered on the verdict, the executors took this appeal.</p>

We are well aware of the fact that rules of evidence which have been adopted to thwart spurious claims sometimes result in precluding a living person from establishing a meritorious claim.
