The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict is not questioned; however, we have read the record and are completely satisfied that the trial evidence supports the conviction.\nAlthough no request for further instructions, or exceptions of any nature were entered to the charge of the court to the jury at trial, the appellant now maintains that in two instances it was erroneous and a new trial is required. We have studied the charge in its entirety and conclude that nothing therein warrants a reversal of the judgment. The issues for decision were correctly and clearly defined and submitted in a fair manner.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Roberts concurs in result.",
