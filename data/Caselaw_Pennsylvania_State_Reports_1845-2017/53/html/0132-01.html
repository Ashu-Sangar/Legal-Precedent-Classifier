On appeal to the Register’s Court an issue was framed to try the legitimacy of the devisees, or, in other words, to try the question of fact, whether the parents were married before the boys were born. This was a question for the jury, but it is complained of that the court instructed the jury, on the authority of Thorndell <em>v. </em>Morrison, 1 Casey 326, that cohabitation of the parents was, alone, sufficient to establish their marriage. It appears from the charge that the learned judge did very distinctly negative the plaintiff’s point, that proof of cohabitation and reputation was necessary to ground a presumption of marriage, and did lay down the law, on the authority of the above case, that continued cohabitation for twenty years, without proof of reputation, was sufficient evi dence of the marriage.</p>
    <p id="b135-6" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[241,1206,1158,1244]],["BL_136.1",136,[303,435,1157,171]]]'>Herein we think there was manifest error. The doctrine of Thorndell <em>v. </em>Morrison, interpreted, as all reported judgments ought to be, by the facts of the case, is that reputation <em>and </em>cohabitation are sufficient evidence of marriage for civil purposes, and this doctrine is consistent with our antecedent cases. This was the proposition which the <em>court </em>decided in that case, and if incautious language fell from the judge appointed to express the opinion of the court, it should be received with the limitation imposed by the facts. Unless this rule be observed in interpreting and applying our decisions, injustice will be done to us, and the lav/ will rapidly fall into confusion. Reading that decision in the light of this rule, it does not sustain the instructions given to the jury in this case, but it should have led the learned judge to an affirmance of the plaintiff’s points. Nor was the error harmless. Had there been evidence of reputation as well as of cohabitation, it might have been presumed that the jury based their verdict upon it notwithstanding the mistake of the judge, but there was no such evidence except by the mother, and she was successfully contradicted on this point. Whether there was a marriage or not would be a fact peculiarly within her knowledge, but whether there was a <em>reputation </em>of marriage was a fact to be proved by neighbors and acquaintances rather than by her. A reputation that was known only to her would be no reputation at all. Reputation consists of the speech of the people who have an opportunity to know the parties, and when the people all deny knowledge of such reputation, and allege, as several witnesses did, that the reputation was that the parties were not married, it signifies nothing that the woman permitted herself to swear that she and Stump were “ known and reputed to be husband and wife in the <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>community in which they resided.” Reputation and cohabitation at best are only presumptive proofs, and where either of these grounds fails, the court should not allow the presumption of marriage to be built upon the other.</p>
    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[303,607,1158,126]]]'>But che court put the case to the jury, not only on the presumptive evidence of cohabitation, but on the direct proof by the mother, Jane Stump, herself.</p>
    <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[304,735,1156,473]]]'>If she and Abraham Stump were ever married, I do not mean in form by a minister or magistrate, but in fact, by a mutual contract which the law would account sufficient for civil purposes, she could have told the jury when, in what place, and in what words the contract was made, for her deposition was taken, and all objections to her competency were waived. Yet all she swore on this head was that “ about thirty-one years since she went to the house of said Abraham Stump, to live with and keep house for him, under a mutual promise and agreement that they would sustain towards each other the relation of husband and wife, and that they did thus live and cohabit together.”</p>
    <p id="b136-8" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[304,1208,1155,340]]]'>In our opinion, this was not proof of a marriage in fact. Marriage is in law a civil contract, and docs not require any particular form of solemnization before officers of church or state, hut it must be evidenced by words in the present tense, uttered with a view and for the purpose of establishing the relation of husband and wife, and, like all other civil contracts, should be proved either by the signature of the parties or by witnesses who were present when it was made.</p>

And what more is the proof in this case ? The woman says she went to Stump’s house to live with and keep house for him. That was a contract for housekeeping such as women often make with widowers. But she adds that it was under a mutual promise and agreement that they would sustain towards each tho relation of husband and wife. When was this promise and agreement made ? Not when she went there, for the witnesses say she did not sleep in the same room with Stump until after the birth of her first child. If they were to sustain the relation of husband and wife from the first they should have slept together — if that relation were subsequently established, in what words was the contract formed— when was it made, and who witnessed it? On these points there was an utter failure of proof.

    <p id="b137-7" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[206,808,1158,343]]]'>Now this declaration of the illegitimacy of the defendants would not conclude them unless it could be shown, which was not shown, that the legislature made it at their instance ; but it tends strongly to contradict the testimony of Mrs. Jane Stump. She says that after the birth of the sons the marriage ceremony between her and their father was performed, and that afterward, by advice of counsel, they had the Act of Assembly passed, legitimating the children.</p>
    <p id="b137-8" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[205,1151,1161,472]]]'>“ They,” that is, she and Abraham Stump, had the act passed. Then it was an admission by each of them that they were not married when the boys were born. And the marriage ceremony, openly performed after the birth of the sons, was a further admission to the same effect. And both facts were direct and conclusive contradictions of her pretence that the marriage relation had been established when she went to keep house for Stump or at any time prior to the birth of the sons. Though she was mistaken in attributing the act to her husband, as it did not pass till near a year after his death, yet that it was passed at <em>her </em>instance is no doubt true, which makes the admission more personal.</p>

Collateral Inheritance Law, for they would have been as capable in law of taking as if they had been born in lawful wedlock, but their estate vested at the death of the testator, which was in May 1853, and if illegitimate then, the Commonwealth’s right to the tax vested then also. The legitimating act passed the next year contains no word to release the Commonwealth’s vested right, and that it can have no such retroactive effect, <em>proprio vigore, is </em>shown by the case of Galbraith <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 2 Harris 258, where a similar act, passed the next day <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>after the death of the decedent, was held insufficient to take the estate out of the Collateral Inheritance Law.</p>
