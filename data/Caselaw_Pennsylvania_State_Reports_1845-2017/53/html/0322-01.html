It appeared also that about 1,000,000 feet of lumber had been sawed at the mills by the defendant, and that he had delivered to the plaintiffs 468,000 feet before the commencement of the suit. Of the lumber in controversy, there were about 200,000 feet also sawed at the plaintiffs’ mills, which appeared to have been manufactured from logs cut from other lands than the plaintiffs’, which <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>the defendant alleged he had purchased for himself; but which the plaintiffs alleged he purchased and manufactured as their agent. The defendant also alleged, and it did not appear to be controverted by the plaintiffs, that there were about 15,000 feet more in the lumber taken possession of by the sheriff, which the defendant bought and put on the rafts after they had started. The defendant, about April 5th 1865, brought the rafts to two points, “ Logan’s” and “ Ireland,” above Pittsburgh, where he stopped it. Some difficulty arising between the plaintiffs and defendant about the lumber, the defendant refused to deliver it, and the replevin was issued.</p>

He contends that under the terms of the contract, he ■became the owner of the one undivided third part of the mill, land and timber thereon, and of the lumber manufactured therefrom, either as a part owner or tenant in common with the plaintiffs; and that as part owner he was lawfully in possession of so much of the said lumber as was manufactured out of the timber which grew on said land, and, therefore, replevin will not lie at the suit of the plaintiffs against him for the possession thereof. He contends that upon the execution of the contract, he became entitled to, and possessed of, an immediate, present and vested interest in the land and timber growing thereon, and, consequently, that he was a part owner of the lumber manufactured therefrom, although <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>he may not have delivered to the plaintiffs a sufficient quantity of lumber to pay the cost of the land, mill and other buildings, and the expense of manufacturing and delivering the said lumber in market as required by his contract. But this, as it seems to me, is not a reasonable and proper construction of the contract, and could not have been the intention of the parties. The contract, by its very terms, is executory, and was not intended as a conveyance of the undivided third interest in the land, mill, &amp;e., but only as an agreement for a conveyance when the condition upon which it ivas to be made should be fully performed. It was manifestly the intention of the parties that the defendant should not have any vested interest or estate in the land, mill, &amp;c., until after the delivery to the plaintiffs of boards and shingles sufficient to pay the cost thereof, and the expenses of manufacturing and delivering the said lumber. When this should be done, or in the language of the contract, ‘ at such time he is to receive one undivided third interest in the lands, mills, &amp;c.and the plaintiffs <em>‘ </em>agree <em>at such time </em>to execute a deed of general warranty’ to him for the one undivided third part thereof. The intention of the parties to a written agreement is the criterion by which to determine whether it operates as a present conveyance or as an executory contract. The contract in this case is clearly executory, and therefore it vested in the defendant no present interest or estate in the land and timber growing thereon, and consequently no title or interest could pass to him thereby, to the lumber manufactured out of the said timber. If, therefore, the defendant, at the date of the issuing and service of the writ of replevin, had not delivered to the plaintiffs sufficient lumber to pay all advances for purchase of land, erection of mills and cost of manufacturing and delivering said lumber in market, he had no title, under and by virtue of the said contract, to the lumber in question, so far as the same was manufactured out of the timber grown and cut on the plaintiffs’ land. The plaintiffs were not only the owners of the said lumber, but upon its arrival in Pittsburgh, they were entitled, by the provisions of the contract, to its possession, in order to make sale thereof. It was the duty of the defendant, under his contract, to deliver it to them. It was expressly stipulated that the plaintiffs should have full and entire control of the sale of said lumber until such time as they shall have received sufficient lumber to pay all advances for purchase of land, erection of mills and cost of manufacturing and delivering in market. In order to make sale of the lumber the plaintiffs must have possession thereof. There could be no effectual sale without delivery of possession, and there could be no delivery of possession by the plaintiffs if it was not in their custody or control, or in other words, in their actual possession.</p>

Beyond all doubt, Corbett acquired an equitable estate in the lands, mills, &amp;c., to be perfected by a conveyance of the legal title to an undivided third of the premises at such time as he should have manufactured, in the manner provided, and delivered to Lewis &amp; Nelson, boards and shingles sufficient to pay the cost of saw-mills and manufacturing. But, until that time arrived, Lewis &amp; Nelson were to have full and entire control of the sale of said lumber.</p>

These grounds, if well laid in the evidence, were sufficient to sustain the action. Eor, though the learned judge may have put it too strongly when he denied that Corbett could have <em>any </em>interest in the lands until he had fully paid up, yet his equitable interest in the land did not entitle him to the possession of the manufactured lumber for <em>purposes of sale. </em>Eor purposes of manufacture and transportation he had the lawful possession of the lumber, but full and entire control of the sale of said lumber was expressly vested in Lewis &amp; Nelson, and when it was brought to Pittsburgh, or any other point of market at which they chose to exercise their exclusive right of sale, he was bound to deliver it to them, and they might enforce their rights and his duty by an action of replevin. His equitable and contingent interest in the land gave him no right to control the sale of the manufactured lumber. And this, not because his title was inchoate, but because he had divested himself of dominion over the lumber by the agreement. His rights were all derived from the agreement, and they must be limited and controlled by it. One tenant in common of lumber-lands may certainly agree that if his co-tenants will furnish all the supplies for the manufacture of the lumber, they shall have exclusive control of the sale of it. And this will give them the right to exclusive possession for the purposes of sale. Their liability is to account to him for the proceeds of the sale, but their right to make the sale, and for this purpose to demand the possession, is as unquestionable as the terms of the agreement. Corbett was entitled to a credit on the land contract of $8 per 1000 feet for the boards, and $1.75 per 1000 for the shingles, and an action’ of account or a bill in equity would have been the appropriate form for enforcing this right, but the court submitted the question to the jury in this action. “If, therefore,” said the learned judge, “ the defendant, at the date of issuing and service of the writ of replevin, had not delivered to the plaintiffs sufficient lumber to pay all advances for purchase of land, erection of mills, and cost of manufacturing and delivering said lumber in market, he had no title under and by virtue of the said contract .to the lumber in question, so far as the same was manufactured out of the timber grown and cut on the plaintiff’s land.”</p>

But the jury did not find the fact in Corbett’s favor, and the consequence is that he remains subject to the terms of the agreement, which, as before stated, clearly entitled Lewis &amp; Nelson to exclusive possession of the lumber for purposes of sale.</p>
    <p id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[172,702,1158,635]]]'>The court is complained of for submitting, without evidence, the question whether Corbett was intending and endeavoring to sell the lumber short of the Pittsburgh market, but even if well grounded, we see no force in the complaint, because Lewis &amp; Nelson’s right of sale was absolute and exclusive upon the agreement, and did not need to rest upon an ascertainment of the fact suggested. Corbett bound himself to deliver at Pittsburgh, but that was for their benefit, and they might waive their rights ánd demand delivery above Pittsburgh. It was like a power revocable at the pleasure of the principal, or like a bailor demanding possession of his own goods <em>in transitu. </em>If Lewis &amp; Nelson found out a better market than Pittsburgh, the agreement permitted them to avail themselves of it, though if Corbett had already incurred the expenses of running to Pittsburgh he would be entitled to them in his account with Lewis &amp; Nelson.</p>
    <p id="b331-7" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[173,1346,1160,897]]]'>It is argued that if the lumber had been levied on as Corbett’s property, either at the mill, or while in transit, a sheriff’s sale would have passed a good title, and for this the case of Mitchell <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20187" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Wright 187">1 Wright 187</a>, is relied upon. That was not a case of bailment, at least it was not so stated, but of a lease that amounted to a purchase of the goods, and it was said they would be liable to levy and sale in the hands of the purchaser, though he had not paid for them, but here, upon our construction of the agreement, Corbett, though holding an equitable interest in the lands, was to have no property in the timber severed from the freehold until he had manufactured enough, at the specified rates, to reimburse the capitalists their outlays. The manufactured lumber must have been the exclusive property of Lewis &amp; Nelson, else they could not have the “ full and entire control of the sale of it.” What Corbett had in it was a right to charge the specified prices against their advances. His labor mixed with the lumber was to be compensated in this manner, but the property in the lumber, until advances should be reimbursed, was in Lewis &amp; Nelson, and not in him, and, therefore, we cannot admit that a sheriff’s levy or sale of the lumber as his property, would have passed any title whatever.</p>
    <p id="b331-8" data-blocks='[["BL_331.6",331,[177,2245,1157,174]],["BL_332.1",332,[357,435,1158,472]]]'>The only remaining assignment of error relates to that portion of the lumber which was manufactured out of timber not grown upon the plaintiff’s lands, but the only ground of complaint here is that there was not evidence to raise the question which the <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>court submitted to the jury.' I say the only ground, for if there was such evidence no just exception can be taken to the instructions. If Corbett bought the timber as the agent of the plaintiffs, and with their money, the jury were properly instructed that the property would be in the plaintiffs, and not in him. But, was there evidence ? It is indeed slight, though Newton Taylor says of the logs he put in as a part of the Clark lumber, that he understood they were for Lewis &amp; Nelson. Corbett bought the timber, but from the drafts, receipts and letters that passed between the parties, it was possible for the jury to infer that these purchases were made on the general account of the mill.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[358,907,1156,385]]]'>But there was a part of the charge which covers this lumber, that is not assigned for error. It was the part that related to the confusion of goods. Now if the jury failed to find evidence that Corbett acted as agent for Lewis &amp; Nelson, in buying lumber from other lands than theirs, to be manufactured at their mill, and so found <em>him </em>to be the owner of such lumber, yet if he confused and mixed it with theirs, and made his boards undistinguishable from theirs, the instruction was that he would lose his property, and this is not assigned for error.</p>

    <p id="b332-8" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[359,1460,1151,86]]]'>On the whole, therefore, we find none of the errors sustained, and accordingly the judgment is affirmed.</p>
