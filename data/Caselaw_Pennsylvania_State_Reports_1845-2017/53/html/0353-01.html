The testimony shows that the policy in December 1862 was issued after a survey and inspection of the premises by Mr. Gardner, the agent of the company, and appears to have been based entirely upon the personal knowledge thus acquired by him.

If the company was not otherwise informed that distilling had been introduced in connection with brewing, what was the duty of the plaintiffs when they went first to insure after the change of business ? manifestly, it was their duty to make it known to the insurance company. The secretary himself examined the building in 1862, and would of course presume, when applied to for a renewal of insurance, that the building continued to be used as a brewery and malt-house as when he inspected it.</p>

      <em>“ </em>There must be the most perfect fairness in obtaining a policy of fire insurance, in disclosing all circumstances material to the risk, even the reasonable grounds of apprehension on the part of the insured must be stated. Good faith forbids either party, by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary ; concealment is regarded as a species of fraud, a suppression of truth. The reason of the rule against concealment is to prevent fraud and encourage good faith. In every kind of insurance it is held to be one of the plainest principles of equity, that a contract which one party has been induced to enter upon, from his ignorance of the thing concealed, shall not be enforced against him by the other who has concealed it. The contrary would lead to frequent and fraudulent suppression of information. All the authorities concur in the position, that if the concealment is mate <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>rial it will avoid the policy, notwithstanding the party insured did not intend to commit any fraud. The suppression of the truth may happen by mistake, and be entirely without fraudulent intention; still the underwriter is deceived, and the policy is void, for the reason that the risk run is really different from the risk understood, and intended to be run, at the time of the agreement.</p>

There was no such endorsement, and the only way to excuse the want of it was to prove that distilling had been added to the business of brewing before the policy issued, and consequently that it was one of the risks intended to be insured.</p>
    <p id="b360-8" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[279,1160,1166,812]]]'>The evidence upon this point was conflicting, Gardner, the agent, denying that he knew that plaintiffs intended to add the business of distilling whiskey to their. appropriate business, but several other witnesses proved him there inspecting the premises •in November 1863, when all the arrangements for distilling were pointed out and explained to him. One of these witnesses, Robert Watson, speaking of Gardner’s visit in November 1863, says, “ he came there to see around; I showed him around. He inspected the building; showed him the mash-tubs ; showed him where we were going to move the boiler. I had then ordered a new boiler, and showed him where we were going to set it. The still was there, it had been put up the month before. I showed him the old mash-tub and the new one, and where we mashed the grains and took the extract out of them for making whiskey. I think it was some three or four weeks before the policy of December 5th 1863 was taken out.” On his cross-examination, this witness said he did not tell Gardner we were then distilling whiskey, but I told him that we were going to do it, and showed him the machinery we were putting up.</p>

The first policy on the “ Phoenix Brewery” issued December 5th 1862 for $5000, at one year. By endorsement on the policy made in December 1863, this risk was renewed for a year, to expire December 5th 1864. On the 2d December 1864, the plaintiffs took another policy for $5000 on “ barley and malt contained in assured’s malt-house and brewery, known as <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>Phoenix Brewery,” to expire on 29th November 1866. On the 5th December 1864, an endorsement was made upon the last-named policy, by which an additional risk of $5000, upon the same barley and malt, was taken in consideration of an additional premium paid. It would seem that this was a continuation of, or rather a substitution for, the policy of 1862 and the renewal of 1863. It is upon this policy of 2d and 5th December 1864 for $10,000, that the suit is brought.</p>
    <p id="b361-6" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[211,770,1159,303]]]'>Now if this policy, or the renewal of the policy of 1862 made in December 1863, were granted with the full knowledge of the agent of the company that distilling whiskey was to be carried on in the brewery, the conditions about endorsement of notices have no application, and the company have no ground to allege an increase of risk: Girard Fire Ins. <em>Co. v. </em>Stephenson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20298" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Wright 298">1 Wright 298</a>.</p>
    <p id="b361-7" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[212,1073,1158,472]]]'>The condition or covenant is, that without notice endorsed upon the policy the risk shall not be increased “ <em>during-the continuance of the </em>insurance.” But where a policy is for a year, and then is renewed, and then is substituted by a new policy, and the assumption of an additional risk by endorsement on such new policy, notice of an increased risk given before the renewal of the original policy, runs through all the subsequent insurances. The company must be held, therefore, to have assumed these subsequent risks upon the barley and malt with their eyes wide open to the fact that distilling whiskey, as well as brewing ale, was carried on in the Phoenix Brewery.</p>
    <p id="b361-8" data-blocks='[["BL_361.6",361,[209,1547,1162,858]]]'>2d. It appeared in evidence that there were two barrels of whiskey near thfe still, and a considerable quantity, perhaps thirty barrels, stored in the cellar at the time of the fire, which the court treated as a natural and necessary incident to the business of distilling. Although the fire did not originate from this whiskey, nor from the distillery business in any of its parts, this answer of the court is assigned for error on the ground that there was no proof of a custom among distillers to retain in their distillery so large a quantity of the manufactured article. We believe that distillers do not always have warehouses for storing their liquors in, and where the business is only incidental to that of brewing, such a warehouse could hardly be expected. Nor do we know that thirty or forty barrels of whiskey are an unusual quantity for a distiller to have on hand in his distillery. The court said it was a natural incident of the business, and we are bound to believe it until the contrary is shown. Had there been any evidence of the custom of distillers, it would have raised a question for the jury; but without such evidence, there was nothing to submit to the jury on this head, and <em>non constat </em>that the court erred in what they said.</p>
    <p id="b361-9" data-blocks='[["BL_361.7",361,[875,2404,448,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
