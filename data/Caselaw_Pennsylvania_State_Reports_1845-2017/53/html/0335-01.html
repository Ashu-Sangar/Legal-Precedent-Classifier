That this was fully expected and intended by the defendants themselves, is very apparent from their advices and accompanying bill forwarded to the plaintiff under date of September 29th 1862, in the former of which they say, “ We have shipped you per order of Messrs. Pulton &amp; Co., this day, the following;” then follows a list of the goods. This letter with a bill or invoice, was in course of mail received by the plaintiff, who daily expeuted and looked for the goods for months — but they never came. It is very clear that the consignment and bill forwarded, fully invested the plaintiff with title to the property, and that, therefore, the goods were to be at his risk and expense: <a href="/binn/1/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Binn. 106" data-case-ids="1787920" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0106-01">1 Binn. 106</a>; 12 S. &amp; R. 183; 1 Str. 1701; Story on Sales, § 306; Angell on Car., § 497 ; Smith’s Merc.

No such right was made to appear in the case. There was no insolvency or other equivalent cause alleged against the plaintiff; on the contrary his bill on London in the hands of the defendants, we may presume was good, only wanting the shipping-bills to make it available. The defendants consigned the goods for the purpose of shipment to H. H. Swift &amp; Co., New York, forwarding merchants to the plaintiff at Bahia. The plaintiff had instructed the defendants in their order for the goods, to ship <em>direct </em>to Bahia, or <em>via </em>Pernambuco (if possible in preference), <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>and then to Rio Janeiro. These instructions were not given to Messrs. Swift &amp; Co., but simply a direction to ship to Bahia. This they testify they could not do, and informed the defendants shortly after receiving the goods, that transportation direct could not he had to Bahia, and advised a sale. After the lapse of two or three months, without advice to the plaintiff, the defendants did order a sale of the goods. They had in the mean time greatly advanced in value, perhaps to the full amount of the verdict, which was $900. Predicated of these facts, the court was asked to say that the sale was illegal, and they did. There was no error in this. As already said, the goods belonged to the plaintiff, and no sale was legal under the circumstances. There was no difficulty in shipping via Pernambuco. The Messrs. Swift &amp; Co., themselves, had been engaged in shipping goods to that port for some thirty-eight years. James A. Wilson also proves, that the goods could have been shipped in the fall of 1862 to Pernambuco. The inability to find transportation was the only excuse set up. This -was disproved by the testimony referred to, had the plaintiff’s directions been pursued — but which were totally disregarded. There was no error in the answer of the court to the point referred to.</p>
