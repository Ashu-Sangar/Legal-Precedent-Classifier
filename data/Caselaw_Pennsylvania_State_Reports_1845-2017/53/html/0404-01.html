D. 1862, for $428.20, on account of his distributive share in the personal and real estate of his deceased father. If Swan Lucas, however, had the control of this fund, the testimony does not disclose that he appropriated it before that date, at which date he gave the receipt aforesaid. But it is contended that, as no application had been made for an auditor to ascertain liens, &amp;c., as is provided by the Act of 29th of February 1832, § 49, the administrators had the right to apply the fund to those primá facie entitled, and if such payment was made, that it was a good and valid payment or disbursement of the balance due Swan Lucas, out of 'his father’s real estate. On examination of this section, your auditor is of the opinion that it is not compulsory but permissive. That an executor or administrator might invoke its provisions to protect himself against a mispayment, or secure to him the benefit of all the facts, a full hearing and an impartial decision. The section does -not authorize the auditor to <em>create or declare </em>liens, but simply to <em>ascertain </em>them, and when ascertained the court may order the amount of money that may be payable to any of the parties against whom <em>liens existed, </em>to be paid into court, which has power to distribute it as it would have in the case of a sheriff’s or coroner’s sale. Besides, it appears from an inspection of the above receipt and the judgments claiming the-fund, that the judgments are prior in point of time to the receipt. It may also be observed that the receipt was a personal matter of the said Thomas and Charles Lucas, and in which the estate of Thomas Lucas, Sr., was in no wise interested. The auditor, therefore, declines to <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>appropriate the fund or any part thereof to that claim, but appropriates it to such judgments as were entered against Swan Lucas after his father’s death according to their priority, which your auditor finds and appropriates as follows:”</p>

    <p id="b406-13" data-blocks='[["BL_406.19",406,[319,1725,1161,599]]]'>Proceedings were commenced in the Orphans’ Court of Greene county for a partition of the real estate, AYhich was sold by the administrators under a decree of the court, and on the 18th March 1862 they reported the sale of the several purparts for $15,952.50, payable in three annual instalments, with interest, the first of which was payable on the 1st March 1862, the second on the 1st March 1863, and the last on the 1st March 1864. On the same day the court confirmed the sale, and on the 28th March, ten days aftenvards, the court appointed an auditor to distribute the fund, and on the 6th October the court confirmed his report, except as to Swan Lucas’s share, the same being excepted to.

This left a balance of his share of the proceeds of the real estate, amounting to 662.30, which the auditor appropriated to pay judgments against Swan Lucas, entered after, the death of his father, in 1861, and before the sale in the partition suit. There were liens on the interest or share of Swan Lucas in the real estate, and they were to be paid according to their pi-iority. The administrators were simply the officers of the court to make the sale and receive the proceeds, of which they were simply the custodians and trustees — subject to the orders of the court, and with no power to pay any part of the fund to any one to whom it did not belong. The share of Swan Lucas belonged to his judgiaentcfeditors, and neither he nor the administrators could divert it from them. The administrators, in violation of their duty, took a receipt from Swan Lucas on the 11th April 1862 for ¡$428.30, on the ground that they were sureties for him. Swan Lucas could not make the appropriation, and they had no money in their hands to pay it, for the whole amount was appropriated to pay his debt to his father’s estate.</p>
