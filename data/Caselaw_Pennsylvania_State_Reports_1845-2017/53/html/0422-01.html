Tomb and Mary Tomb, for a tract of 441 acres of land. On the 17th of May 1862, the defendants pleaded not guilty. On the 25th of September 1863 William Tomb confessed “judgment as to himself alone, without prejudice to others.” On the 6th of January 1864,'the jury found “for the defendants all the undivided two-thirds of the tract of land in dispute.” The judgment on this verdict was removed to the Supreme Court and reversed, January 2d 1865. On the 4th of January 1866, Margaret and _ Mary Tomb, under objection of plaintiffs, “ take special defence for the undivided two-thirds of the land in dispute,” and the jury were sworn against them., the plaintiff protesting.</p>

Stewart’s title became vested in the plaintiffs September 20th 1863. In this controversy the plaintiffs alleged that William was the sole owner; the sisters claimed that each of the three had an equal undivided interest in the lands. These questions were submitted to the jury as questions of fact and found for the defendants. On the trial before Buffington, P. J., the plaintiffs submitted this point:</p>

The jury have been sworn as against the girls alone, and they have entered on record a special defence for the two-thirds, leaving the residue to the plaintiff under the judgment confessed. If they are tenants in common with the plaintiffs, they could rest upon their possession, as they had a right, as tenants, to a common possession of the whole, till partition should be made and their respective interests should be set off in severalty. They have taken defence to only two-thirds, and, if they have shown title to that amount, that carried with it the right of possession, for all in which they had the right of property, which was in common to the whole and every part. And having taken defence for that alone, leaving the residue to the plaintiffs under their title and right from William, we think the verdict should be for defendants.”</p>

The action was ejectment against William Tomb and his two sisters. All three defendants pleaded not guilty, but afterward William confessed a judgment to plaintiff for all his interest. The sisters then .took a special defence for two undivided third parts, and on the trial the court were asked to charge <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover for one-third, although it may appear that the defendants, Mary and Margaret, are entitled to the other two-thirds.</p>
    <p id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[286,567,1166,130]]]'>The court said no, the girls have taken defence for only two-thirds, and if they have shown title to that proportion, they had the right of possession in common with the plaintiffs until partition.</p>
    <p id="b424-7" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[285,695,1167,690]]]'>It seems to us that the point was discreetly answered. Counsel think that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover their one-third as against <em>all </em>the defendants. When the suit was brought such was undoubtedly their right, but when they took a judgment against one of the three tenants in common, and the other two limited their defence to two-thirds of the premises, the question undoubtedly came down to this — Have the two shown title to two-thirds ? What else could be in litigation upon such a record ? Not the plaintiffs’ right to one-third of the whole, for that was confessed. If one-third of the whole was what the plaintiffs sought, they should have taken execution upon their judgment against William, instead of trying ejectment against the sisters after their disclaimer of that one-third. The plaintiffs contend that they may recover a third of the whole. They have got it already. And they should not forget that the defendants’ right to two-thirds of the whole is as complete as theirs to one-third.</p>
    <p id="b424-8" data-blocks='[["BL_424.6",424,[285,1385,1166,214]]]'>As the_ record stood at the trial, the plaintiffs manifestly were not entitled to recover if, as their point assumes, Mary and Margaret were entitled to two-thirds. They had got all they were entitled to have, and the defendants, entitled to all they defended for, the verdict justly belonged to thoin.</p>
