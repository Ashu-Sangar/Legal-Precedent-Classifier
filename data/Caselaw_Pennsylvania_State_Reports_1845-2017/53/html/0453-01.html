Not long afterwards, the boiler exploded, several persons were injured and Daniel was killed.

The deceased was a minor son of the plaintiff, and worked at a large rolling-mill of the defendants, at a furnace assigned him, in close proximity to the boiler Avhich furnished the motive power to run the nail factory.

The language quoted in this assignment of error is a general statement of the law in the opening of the charge ; but in justice to the court, the subsequent part of it, applying it to the case in hand, should have been also stated. “ It has been faintly pressed by the defendants, that'the boy himself was guilty of such rashness and negligence to his own safety, as at least to bring him within the principle of concurring negligence in two particulars.” The second of which was: “That the fire in the heating furnace of the nail factory was under the control of the boy — was on that occasion excessive, and added to the danger.”</p>

In every large manufactory, where a number of workmen are employed in different departments of the same business, we should have it split up into any number of objects, although they all had the one common ¡Durpose. Thus in one manufactory the making of screws would be called one object, and the doing woodwork another, and so on, and then a person employed in a superior department would be said to have nothing to do with the porter in the same establishment.” There was, therefore, no error of which the plaintiffs could complain, and that is all we need say on this point.</p>
    <p id="b459-7" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[232,1452,1158,373]]]'>The 3d error is the answer to the plaintiff’s 10th point, which is in these words: “ That the measure of damages is not to be confined simply to what wages the deceased might have earned during his minority, but may also include the advantage of his society and assistance at home, out of active hours, and also the contingency of his remaining at home and laboring for his parents after he attained his majority — as well as the aid they might reasonably expect from him in their old age, even if he were married.”</p>
    <p id="b459-8" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[232,1837,1155,300]]]'>The court, answering, say: “ This point is answered in the negative. It is the pecuniary value of the service of the boy during his minority that can be recoveredand in the charge, “ If the jury find for plaintiffs, the measure of damages is simply the money value of this boy’s services till he arrived at the age of twenty-one years. Plaintiffs are not to be allowed -for the agonized feelings of parents, nor loss of his society.”</p>
    <p id="b459-9" data-blocks='[["BL_459.7",459,[232,2134,1161,129]]]'>This is clearly, the law, and a proper answer to the instruction' prayed for: Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Kelly, 7 Casey 372; Same <em>v. </em>Zebe, 9 Casey 318; 13 Indiana 366.</p>
    <p id="b459-10" data-blocks='[["BL_459.8",459,[230,2263,1153,87]]]'>The jury gave $200 damages, and we see no error of which the plaintiff could complain.</p>
