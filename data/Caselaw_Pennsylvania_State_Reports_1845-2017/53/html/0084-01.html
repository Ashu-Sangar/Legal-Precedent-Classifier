A descriptive warrant may be abandoned or shifted or more land be included than is called for ; and in order that the Commonwealth may have precise knowledge of the land that has been actually appropriated to it, and be paid for any surplus that has been surveyed into it, the survey as in other cases must be returned within a period that has been fixed, not to exceed seven years: Chambers <em>v. </em>Mifflin, 1 Penna.

Did the learned judge mean, that if the purchase-money had been paid, twenty years’ delay to return the survey would not postpone it to a younger survey ?

These were the lines and comers of the Love survey which the Goldthwait called for, and which became by necessity both of law and fact the lines of the Goldthwait.</p>
    <p id="b90-10" data-blocks='[["BL_90.7",90,[311,2267,1160,172]],["BL_91.1",91,[217,418,1175,1251]]]'>Now, on the Goldthwait side of these lines lay the <em>locus in quo </em>of the trespass complained of, and although the location of these lines on the ground was indeed a material question in the cause, we shall see in an after part of the case, that their location was <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>so clearly fixed in the evidence that the jury could not have erred therein, if their attention, instead of being diverted to other objects, had been kept riveted to that point. But the defendants claimed by the lines of the resurvey of the Love warrant, and not by its original lines. This is proved by the patent which they gave in evidence, and which bounds their tract on the Goldthwait side by seven lines instead of three. Thus starting from the chestnut from which the above three lines started, the resurvey ran the same course 19 p., then from an offset of 20 p. ran the same course 41 p., then from another offset by the same course 41J p., then from an offset which brought the survey back to the original line, he ran by the same course 28 p., making in all 129J p. on the line S. 21½° W., which, as originally run in 1794, called for only 98 p., an excess of 8ÍJ p. beyond the ori ginal survey. From that corner three lines more were run to bring the resurvey to the corner of the Deardorff. Throwing out the lines of the above rectangular offsets, we have thus seven lines substituted by the resurvey for the three of the original survey, the first four of which seven lines substitute one of the original survey, and overrun it 31J p. And by just so much as these four lines overrun the one line of the original survey of 98 p., by so much does the resurvey of the Love warrant interfere with and overlap the Goldthwait survey. Regarding the case in the light of interfering surveys, which is one of the necessary views to take of it, the Goldthwait warrant and survey must be treated as the prior right, not because it originated first, but because the laches of the holder of the Love warrant postponed it to the Goldthwait. And to whatever timber was cut within the interference the plaintiff showed the best title.</p>
    <p id="b91-6" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[232,1669,1165,508]]]'>One of the principal reasons assigned for extending the 98 perch line in the manner above described, is the call for a watercourse, or a run which is marked upon the official survey of these tracts, and which is not found where it is marked on the draught. As this watercourse is not a boundary, but only an interior mark, its location is unimportant. No doubt it is inaccurately indicated upon the official draught, but as marks and corners were found sufficient to determine the location of the line of 98 perches, the erroneous indication of the place of the watercourse cannot impair the survey. Such mistakes are very common in respect to streams that cross lines instead of constituting boundaries themselves.</p>

It is true the Deardorff was older than the Love, and as the latter calls for <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>the former, it may also be true that these two tracts must be so located that no gore shall be left between them. But what has the Goldthwait to do with that question ?</p>
    <p id="b92-6" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[326,560,1162,347]]]'>This tract does not come between Love and Deardorff, and neither party on the record makes title under the Deardorff. Its lines are not in question in this suit, nor are they necessary to be adjusted to determine the present dispute — the true boundary between Love and Goldthwait. That question depends primarily on the lines run upon the ground, and if the marks indicate where these lines were run, you do not impeach them by showing that they would not close the Deardorff survey.</p>
    <p id="b92-7" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[330,905,1163,646]]]'>Were not the three lines marked on the official draught as common to both the Love and Goldthwait tracts the true lines ? We say they were if sufficiently verified by marks on the ground. But you say that those lines, whilst they might close the surveys to which they belong, would not suit the lines of the Deardorff. Very well. Be it so. The fact weighs nothing in <em>this </em>case, because only the Love and Goldthwait warrants, and not the Deardorff warrant, are in question here. Love and Goldthwait may be well bounded by the three lines I have specified, and yet the Deardorff as the elder warrant be pushed to lines which shall be inconsistent with the three lines, or the Love survey be extended where necessary to meet the Deardorff, or the gore may be permitted to exist between them. But these will be questions for future consideration between other parties, and cannot be brought into this controversy between the parties now upon the record.</p>

They describe corners and marks enough for this purpose. And the surveys on the part of the defendants verify many of the same marks, and indeed throw no other discredit upon these lines than that they do not coincide with those of the Deardorff. This was the misleading object of the Deardorff. It betrayed the surveyors, or some of them, and the court and jury into the rejection of well-marked lines on other tracts that were the only ones in question. It ought not to have been permitted to do this. The Goldthwait and the Deardorff do adjoin, perhaps do interfere on one side, but not on the side that is in question here. ^The only surveyors who have gone all around the Goldthwait say these lines that are in question here close the surveys well as they are marked upon the official draught. There they are consistent with themselves, and as they are sufficiently marked upon the ground they must prevail against the Love warrant and all who claim under it.</p>
