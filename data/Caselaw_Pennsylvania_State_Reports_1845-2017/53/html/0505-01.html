On this part of the case the plaintiff’s construction of the will is, that Samuel and his wife were trustees for life for the use of the children, and that the children, together with parents, were the real beneficiaries and objects of the testator’s bounty; I do not so consider it. My construction of the will is, that they were the owners- of their life estates in order to enable them the better to support the children in their tender years, and that the children themselves had no interest, legal or equitable, during their lives.

It still remained subject to the life estate of Samuel’s wife, if she survived him, and also the remainder of the children after their death.

[The executor, merely as executor, has only to administer the personal assets of <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>the deceased. He has nothing to do with the real estate, except under a power in the will or under an order of the Orphans’ Court for payment of debts of his testator for which he has no personal assets. All his power and duty in this case was to pray distribution of this $405 of surplus among the legatees, and his duties then were at an end. He had no right to confess a judgment against the land of Samuel, a devisee for a legacy. The legatees themselves were the proper persons to proceed for the recovery of their legacies charged upon the land of the devisees. The application by the executor to sell was, therefore, in my judgment, certainly irregular.] The court, however, acted otherwise and decreed the sale and confirmed it. No appeal was taken and it remained unimpeached on the record. The docket entry states that it was for the payment of debts. As a general rule the docket entry being the rolls of the court, and presumed to have been made up under the direction of the court, is entitled to much consideration.</p>

For these reasons, and in view of various decisions to protect the court from being interfered with collaterally; and in view of the importance of holding the decrees of that court firmly from collateral attacks, I have come to the conclusion and so instruct the jury, that the sale under the order of the Orphans’ Court, if fair and made in good faith, was conclusive of the right to the property in the hands of a bond fide purchaser for value.</p>

The remainder of the land was ordered by the will to be sold after Samuel’s death, and the proceeds divided among his children. About two years before his death his children, by deed, elected to take the land itself instead of the money. It is now insisted in argument that this election was invalid, because there was one son, Matthew, who had not joined in making the election or in bringing suit, and who had died intestate and without issue. Whether there is anything in this point we have no means of judging. It was not made in the court below so far as the record shows, and no facts appear in the record to raise it. All we have in the record is the admission that the plaintiffs were the children of Samuel Torrance, and that the deed of election was by the children of Samuel Torrance. It is true the docket entry of the action informs us that Matthew Torrance died without issue and intestate, his death suggested, and the other plaintiffs are his heirs. But when he died, or whether he was a party to the deed, is not mentioned, and no copy of the deed is furnished upon the paper-book. The question is not. noticed by the judge in his charge, and no point upon it was made by the defendant. If the defendant intended to embrace it in his point requesting the court to charge the jury that from all the evidence in the case the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>it is clear the attention of the judge was not drawn to this question or there was no evidence to raise it, for his answer has exclusive reference to the question of fraud, which was the great point in the trial of the cause. It is impossible for any court to perceive every aspect of a cause which may possibly be presented in the evidence, and if counsel will not fairly raise the question in the court below, we ought not to be asked to reverse because the point put to them may, like a drag-net, sweep everything before it.</p>

The question, therefore, has now no practical bearing on the present controversy, and we are brought at once to consider the title of the defendant below, the plaintiff in error.</p>

The defendant below enjoyed this estate during its whole extent. His next title is that acquired under the Orphans’ Court sale. And here we think the court below erred in favor of the plaintiff in error in holding that he derived any title under that sale. It is a conceded principle that the acts and decrees of the Orphans’ Court, within its jurisdiction, stand upon the same footing as those of any court of record, and are therefore not examinable collaterally, and cannot be set aside except in due course of law by appeal. But a want of jurisdiction is as fatal to the acts of this court as to those of any other: Elliott <em>et al. v. </em>Piersol <em>et al., </em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pet.%20340" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Pet. 340">1 Pet. 340</a>. For a long time the Orphans’ Court was looked upon as an inferior jurisdiction, and its judgments were often examined collaterally until the case of McPherson <em>v. </em>Cunliff, 11 S. &amp; R. 422, placed it on a higher foundation. This was followed by the revised act of the 29th March 1832, the 2d section of which enacted that “its proceedings and decrees in all matters <em>within its jurisdiction </em>shall not be reversed or avoided collaterally in any other court.” Jurisdiction, therefore, is the' test, and has been recognised by this court repeatedly as the true rule: Painter <em>v. </em>Henderson, 7 Barr 52; Lockhart <em>v. </em>John, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pet.%20340" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Pet. 340">Id.</a> 139 ; Keech <em>v. </em>Rinehart, 10 <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pet.%20340" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Pet. 340">Id.</a> 242 ; McKee <em>v. </em>McKee, 2 Harris 231. The proper question which the court below should have examined and decided is, whether the proceedings under which <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>the sale to the defendant below took place fell within the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court. The learned judge thought that because the clerk, in entering the petition on the docket, called it a petition for a sale for the payment of debts, the purchaser was not bound to look further, and the proceeding must be deemed to he within the jurisdiction of the court. It is not the clerk’s misdescription which settles the question of jurisdiction, but the facts set forth in the petition. The court acts on these and not on the docketing of the paper ; and this too is the provision of the statute, where the purpose is to secure the appearance of a person amenable to its jurisdiction. The 57th section of the Act of 29th March 1832, regulating the manner of proceeding in the Orphans’ Court in such case, declares it to be on petition of a person interested, setting forth facts <em>necessary to give the court jurisdic</em>tion., the specific cause of complaint and the relief desired, supported by oath or affirmation. The 19th section of the Act of 16th June 1836, declaring the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court, directs that such jurisdiction shall be exercised under the limitations and in the manner provided by law.</p>

He proceeds to state the recovery of a judgment against himself for a legacy, and then to describe a tract of land of which he avers the testator died seised, alleging it to be charged with the payment of the legacy for which judgment was obtained and other legacies, and concludes with a prayer for a sale to pay these debts. It was not to sell for the testator’s debts, for none were averred or set forth or referred to. It was not to sell for a balance of an account, for no balance against the estate was alleged, nor a deficiency of assets. On the other hand, it was just as clearly not an application to sell the estate of the devisee as charged with the payment of the legacies. No devisee is either named or alleged, no estate of his is claimed to be charged, and no will referred to as containing such charge. The executor is himself the only party, and the estate of the testator the only subject of charge. The proceeding 'is neither one thing nor another, but a sort of cross between two. To this mongrel the executor made a return that he had sold the land of the testator, and this was the sale approved by the Orphans’ Court. But it was not a sale for the payment of the testator’s debts, for none existed or were averred to confer jurisdiction. It was not a sale for the payment of legacies, for neither the estate nor the person charged was set forth, nor was his estate actually sold; while the petitioner, the executor, had no authority to make application for the sale : Conard’s Appeal, 9 Casey 47 ; Field’s Appeal, 12 Casey 11; Swoope’s Appeal, 3 <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>Id. 58; Strickler <em>v. </em>Sheaffer, 5 Barr 240; McKee <em>v. </em>McKee, 2 Harris 237. There was nothing to give the court jurisdiction. The proceeding was anomalous and unauthorized by any law — it was not merely irregular, but wholly void.</p>
    <p id="b512-10" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[326,591,1164,546]]]'>We are not unmindful that general jurisdiction over the subject protects the decrees of the Orphans’ Court from being assailed collaterally. But this is not such a case. Had the application been to sell the testator’s estate for his own debts, their existence might be presumed; or had it been to sell the devisee’s estate for the payment of legacies charged upon it, the want of authority in the executor to petition would have been but an irregularity. It would be the height of injustice to hold that a man’s land can be sold in a proceeding against another (the testator), when neither his estate is condemned, nor he is made a party, and the person applying has no authority to demand a sale. The defendant below took no title by this anomalous and void proceeding. The question of fraud was therefore immaterial.</p>
