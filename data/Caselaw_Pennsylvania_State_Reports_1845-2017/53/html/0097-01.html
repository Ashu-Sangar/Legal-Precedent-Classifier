On the one side, it is urged that the inquisition of lunacy, produced in evidence, finding that John Noel on the 1st day of November 1864 was aged sixty-nine years, and was by reason of lunacy incapable of managing his estate, and was wasting and destroying the same ; and that he had been in the same state of incapacity for the space of two years then last past, and thus reaching back to a period prior to the date of the execution of the notes in suit, not only devolves upon the plaintiff the necessity of showing that Noel, the defendant, had á lucid interval at the time he signed the notes, and was competent to execute them, but that, like a legal presumption, the insanity proved by the inquisition continues to exist, in contemplation of law, until the contrary is established. On the other side, it is insisted that it is incumbent on the defendant to show that he was <em>non compos mentis </em>at the time of the execution of the notes, the presumption of law being that he was sane. The authorities seem to have settled that an inquisition finding a party either a <em>lunatic or habitual drunkard, </em>is primfi facie evidence of incompetency to make a contract at any time covered or overreached by the finding, and imposes upon the party introducing a contract executed by a lunatic or habitual drunkard, the burden of proving' him to have been of sound mind at .the time of the execution thereof. This looks like a severe rule, when it is made to operate against one who had no notice of, and was in no way interested in the proceedings <em>de lunático inquirendo ; </em>but it is the rule nevertheless, as we understand the decisions, and it is our duty so to declare it. In- order, therefore, to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, it is his duty to satisfy you that Mr. Noel was of sound mind and memory when he <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>signed the notes, and understood the nature and extent of the obligation he assumed by becoming the surety of Benjamin Cook. In the language of the defendant’s 4th point, it must be shown that Mr. Noel ‘had memory and judgment enough to understand the character of the act and the legal responsibility entailed thereby.’ This is the correct standard of capacity in cases of this description ; and you must determine from all the evidence, whether Mr. Noel possessed such capacity or not. It is a question of fact for you, and one which the court has no right or power to decide.</p>

It is not disputed that the signature to these notes is in the proper handwriting of Mr. Noel, but whether he understood the contents of the notes is a question for the jury, and we cannot say, nor are we required to say, that he did not know he was signing promissory notes as surety of Cook, because it has not been proved that the notes were read or explained to him. Further notice of this point of the defendant is unnecessary, as we have already instructed you that the burden of proof that Mr. Noel was of sound mind when he executed the notes, has been devolved upon the plaintiff by the inquisition of lunacy.

How was it with Mr. Noel, and particularly, how was it with him when he signed these notes ? You must conduct this inquiry bearing always in mind that the burden of the proof rests upon the plaintiff, yet you are not precluded from considering all the evidence in the case — as it all bears more or less strongly on the point in issue.”</p>
