    <p class="summary" id="b217-9" data-blocks='[["BL_217.8",217,[250,827,1156,1200]]]'>Under the call of the President of July 17th 1864, for 700,000 volunteers, the commissioners of the • county having refused to procure volunteers, twenty-six men were drafted from Jackson township, to fill the quota of thirteen men allowed to that township ; part of the men reported to the provost-marshal September 28th 1864. After this time some citizens of the township, including James Meek and Thomas E. Smith, school directors, and Bayard, met. Bayard at first encouraged them to borrow' money for the purpose of filling the quota of the township, but afterwards refused <em>to </em>have any part in it. The others borrowed money and hired men to fill the quota, who were accepted "as volunteers. The drafted men were released, and returned home ; the thirteen men filled the quota of the township. There had been no previous agreement between the persons who furnished the men and the township authorities, except with Meek and Smith, the two directors, who agreed for themselves to have a resolution adopted by the school board to repay the money for hiring the substitutes, if they could procure a concurrence of a majority of the board. There was no meeting of the citizens of the township to ascertain whether a majority desired the quota to be filled or the money to be repaid. In October 1864, the board issued bonds to repay those who had furnished the money, and on the 17th of December resolved to levy a tax to pay the bonds, Meek being one of the board present when the resolution was passed. A tax was levied —a duplicate and warrant were issued to Meek to collect the tax ; the other defendants were school directors, and authorized issuing the warrant under which Meek levied on and sold the oxen of Bayard.</p>

But it is unnecessary to decide this point, as the case presents a different question.</p>
    <p id="b218-11" data-blocks='[["BL_218.17",218,[301,1896,1153,339]]]'>A few citizens of Jackson township, not a majority as required in the 2d section of the Act of 25th August 1864, advanced the money required to raise volunteers as substitutes to avoid the draft which took place in September 1864. Afterward the school hoard of the township issued bonds to pay the money thus advanced without any precedent authority or vote of the township, and proceeded to levy a tax to pay these bonds. Out of this levy the present action arose.</p>

It was simply the individual act of a few, noble and praiseworthy indeed, but uninvited by public authority, and not within the retrospective provisions of the law. There was, therefore, no authority on part of the board to refund the sum advanced, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
