    <p class="summary" id="b167-10" data-blocks='[["BL_167.8",167,[242,895,1155,1032]]]'>This was an ejectment, brought January 12th 1865, by Theron E. Wright and Waity M. Wright his wife, against Lorenzo Dun-ham and others, for one-eleventh of 95 acres of land, in Corry, &amp;c., 45 acres of which was held under an equitable title from H. J. Huidekoper. The plaintiffs claimed the land in the right of Mrs. Wright, one of eleven children of Jesse Dunham, deceased, who owned the whole tract at his death. The plaintiffs having proved their title, as above, the defendants offered in evidence a deed, dated May 19th 1859, from Mrs. Wright to Lorenzo Dunham for all her interest in the lands in controversy, to he followed by evidence that her husband, Wright, assisted her in making the contract of sale to Dunham; that they received the purchase-money together; that when the deed was executed by her, her husband was in the state of New York, and could not come over to join her in the deed, but agreed that he would at some future time; that she executed and acknowledged it in Pennsylvania, separate and apart from her husband, as her voluntary act, without coercion or compulsion of her husband, and delivered it to Dunham; and from that time onward both were frequently at Corry, and saw the improvements making on the same; that the consideration paid for the land was a full and adequate one, but since that time it has been increased in value a thousand fold by improvements on it costing $15,000, and by the general rise in lands.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b167-13" data-blocks='[["BL_167.11",167,[244,2225,1156,217]]]'>The deed was again offered to show the wife’s assignment of the supposed equity she might have in the contract of Huidekoper.
