    <p class="summary" id="b93-13" data-blocks='[["BL_93.11",93,[213,1358,1164,431]]]'>In the court below Jonatban Rhule brought an action of assumpsit against the Glamorgan Iron Company, and declared on a special contract for erecting a trestle-work railroad, and also on the common counts. He laid his damages at $8000. There was no affidavit that the claim was beyond $100. The pleas were <em>“ </em>non assumpsit and payment.” The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $83. The court (Wood, P. J.) discharged a rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered without costs, and entered judgment on the verdict with costs. This was the error assigned.</p>

    <p id="b93-22" data-blocks='[["BL_93.21",93,[215,2390,1164,86]],["BL_94.1",94,[320,434,1163,470]]]'>There was no affidavit, as already said. It is well settled that if the claim of the plaintiff be reduced by set-off below $100, he <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>is still entitled to costs. But that there was a set-off in this case does not appear by the record. It is not implied, we think, by the plea of <em>“ </em>payment” alone, nor receivable under it, unless notice of special matter be given. “ <em>Payment with leave,” </em>&amp;c., would, I think, undoubtedly allow the inference of set-off in reducing the claim. The Defalcation Act of 1705, allows the set-off of bonds, bills, accounts, promises or legacies under the “ plea of payment,” but since the Act of 1810, at least, no presumption exists that a demand is reduced by set-off where the plea is “ payment,” or where the record does not show the claim was reduced by set-off.</p>
    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[320,906,1162,602]]]'>This is expressly decided in Rogers <em>v. </em>Ratcliffe, 11 Harris 184. I think this rules the case before us. It is the fault of the plaintiff if he claims more than $100, that he does not make an affidavit, or if he has not made it, he ought to rule the defendant to give notice of special matter, and that would bring his defence on the record, and would of course qualify the plea of payment, and show whether set-off or direct payment was the defence. If the former, and the claim was reduced by it, the party would be entitled to costs — if the latter, and he recovered less than $100, he would not be so entitled: <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Whart.%2094" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Whart. 94">9 Whart. 94</a>; <a href="/watts-serg/1/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 57" data-case-ids="1852586" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0057-01">1 W. &amp; S. 57</a> ; 9 <a href="/watts-serg/1/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 57" data-case-ids="1852586" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0057-01">Id. 66</a>; 4 Barr 330.
