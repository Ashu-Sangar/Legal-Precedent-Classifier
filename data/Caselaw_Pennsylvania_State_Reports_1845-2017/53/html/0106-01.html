The 3d and 5th clauses of the will now before us do very unequivocally vest in Catharine Shreiner, the testator’s daughter, a title to the legacy of $2500, and the ÍOth clause with equal clearness places it with the executor in trust for her, the interest to be paid to her so long as she remains single and unmarried. Taking the will altogether, it is the not uncommon case of a right presently vested, with the enjoyment in possession postponed to a future event, the legatee meantime enjoying the usufruct. The event upon which the possession of the fund was limited was her marriage — the ceasing of her celibacy. The legacy was hers, but whilst she remained <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>single the executor as her trustee should invest it and pay her the proceeds.

But the learned judge treated the creation of the trust by the 10th clause as inconsistent with the absolute gift before expressed, and therefore void, and he accordingly rejected it. We do not think that a sound interpretation. All written documents and wills, more than all others, are to be construed as wholes — parts should interpret and modify other parts — and the intention which permeates the whole cannot but be accepted as the final meaning of the instrument.</p>
