A terminus <em>ad quern </em>is one thing, a connection with another railroad is quite another thing. One railroad may terminate at another, and not be connected with it. This right of connection is an incidental privilege usually conferred upon a new company, to connect with all intervening roads between the termini established for the new road: See The- Lehigh Companies’ Case, in pamphlet — or as in this instance to connect with any road that may be formed at, or which may come to, the designated terminus. I say designated terminus, for that is such which the company fixes under legislative authority. An authority to build to the state line’anywhere within two counties is a wide and indefinite authority, but. it carries with it necessarily the corporate power to exercise a sound discretion in fixing definitely the place on the state line within these counties to which to build, and when in the exercise of a sound discretion the company fixes the place, the authority instantly attaches, and it becomes an authority to build to that place — it becomes the legally designated terminus. I had occasion to state this principle of interpreting charters somewhat at large in the unreported case at Nisi Prius between the two Le-high companies last winter, and to show that it did not conflict with the doctrine of strict construction that has always prevailed in this court. If we should take the view of the charter in question which the learned attorney-general suggests, we would nullify it altogether, for as there is no road upon the northern boundary and never can be within this state, there would be no terminus <em>ad quem </em>for the Cross Cut road, present or future, and the act would be null. It had as well never been made. No doubt legislation is scandalously loose in Pennsylvania touching railroads, but when it has passed in the forms of the constitution, it must, if possible, receive such judicial construction as will effectuate the plain intent of the legislature. And especially is this true when the corporation in question, instead of arrogating powers not granted, or shirking duties clearly imposed, is going forward in good faith to carry out what was universally understood to bo the public object in view, and which the terms of the enactment are broad enough to cover.</p>
    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[323,2296,1166,162]],["BL_69.1",69,[213,444,1162,508]]]'>It is argued that if we do not construe the words “ <em>connect' with any railroad constructed or to be </em>constructed” to be descriptive of the terminus, we destroy their force and meaning. Not so if the distinction betwixt railroad termini and connections be <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>diligently borne in mind. We hold the legislature meant a terminus by the reference to the state line and a railroad <em>connection </em>by these words for commercial purposes. And it weighs not with us that the connection intended was to be with a New York road. If the legislature, referring themselves to the immense productions of the oil region, and to the blockade mentioned by one of the learned counsel in argument as occurring at Corry for lack of transportation, projected this new outlet into the state of New York for the more convenient exportation of our great staples, it becomes us to read their enactment in the same liberal spirit in which it was conceived, instead of defeating it by verbal refinements.</p>
    <p id="b69-4" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[214,963,1158,171]]]'>We therefore hold that the defendants have shown good right to build to the state line in Erie county, and to connect with any roads that are constructed or may be constructed to that point, though they lead into the state of New York.</p>
    <p id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[213,1136,1159,213]]]'>The Sd plea involves a construction of the proviso to the 3d section in respect of gauge. The language of the proviso is that “the gauge of said road shall not exceed four feet ten inches, and said company shall be subject to the provisions of the 5th section of an act incorporating the Meadville Railroad Company.”</p>
    <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.6",69,[212,1349,1159,807]]]'>The plea is that they are constructing a road with a gauge of four feet nine and a quarter inches, which is within the grant, but it is argued that the grant of such a - gauge is not to them but to the road with which they are to connect. The antecedent of “ said road” is said to be the road next before mentioned, which is not the Gross Out, but the road with which the Gross Cut is to connect. If the strict rule of grammar be that a relative pronoun is to be referred to the nearest antecedent, the word “ said” is not a pronoun but a participle, which refers to the principal subject-matter of the sentence. And there can be no doubt that the Cross Gut road is the principal .subject of the 3d section of the proviso thereto. This was the road the legislature had before their mind — to the company to build <em>this road </em>they were granting powers — it was <em>this road </em>for which the termini were prescribed and the right of connections provided, and can it be reasonably doubted that it was for <em>this road </em>the gauge was prescribed? We think not. “Thegauge of said road” means, we think, the gauge of the Gross Out road, and not of the road it is to connect with.</p>
    <p id="b69-7" data-blocks='[["BL_69.7",69,[210,2166,1163,302]],["BL_70.1",70,[329,433,1160,218]]]'>And the gauge adopted admits of connection for purposes of railroad transportation with the Philadelphia and Erie, and thus answers the other condition of the proviso referring to the Mead-ville company. The object of that clause was to secure to the Philadelphia and Erie the same connection with the Gross Cut which was provided by law for the Meadville road, and the plea avers that this is accomplished by the gauge adopted. The Act <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>of April 22d 1868, establishing the gauge of the Philadelphia and Erie for all roads that connect with it, is not apparently inconsistent with what is being done under the Act of 1864, but if the two acts be inconsistent, that under which the Cross Cut is building is the latest, and must prevail.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[329,649,1160,556]]]'>The 4th plea is neither a plea of <em>non usurpavit </em>nor a disclaimer, but is a substantial repetition of the charter right of the defendants to connect with any railroad constructed or to be constructed at any point of the northern boundary of Erie or Warren, and as such we esteem it a valid plea. It is nowise impaired by the negative averments that they are not constructing a railroad in the state of New York, and that their railroad is not at present connected with any road in that state. These negations are quite consistent with a claim of right to build a railroad to the northern boundary, and- let it be remembered that it is only the'grounds of this claim that the defendants were called on to exhibit. Having done this in this place, it cannot be set aside as irrelevant, nor be treated as a disclaimer.</p>
    <p id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[329,1207,1160,332]]]'>And so with the 5th plea, which is made of negative averments and an affirmative one in favor of their road between the termini they claim, it can be regarded only as a repetition of their charter rights ignoring the irrelevant matters suggested in the information. As an answer to the demand by what authority they claim the right complained of, this plea is a sufficient profert of the Act of Assembly for the purposes of a general demurrer, and therefore a defence.</p>
    <p id="b70-7" data-blocks='[["BL_70.6",70,[327,1548,1160,258]]]'>We see not how a party so interrogated by the Commonwealth could set forth their authority by more frequent reference than the defendants have done. The pleas taken altogether amount to the Act of Assembly, and nothing more ; and that must be their shield and buckler, or they have none. If we have construed it rightly, we think it a perfect defence.</p>
    <p id="b70-8" data-blocks='[["BL_70.7",70,[328,1806,1159,173]]]'>It is not necessary to consider whether this quo warranto be at common law or under our Act of Assembly, for no such question is raised upon the record. We have treated the case upon the pleadings altogether, and upon these</p>
