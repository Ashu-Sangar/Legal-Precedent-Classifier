There had been a former action in 1854, between the same plaintiff and William Gilmore, for the same nuisance, and a recovery against the defendant. Afterwards the plaintiff agreed with the defendant that he should have the use of the alley for $30 per annum. On the 30th of December 1861, the plaintiff gave defendant notice “ to surrender the alley and remove all obstructions from the samewhich he disregarded, and maintained the obstruction till April 1866.</p>

Hersberger, that he had agreed to pay the plaintiff $50 for the use of the alley, the agreement being in writing. This was objected to, on the ground that the writing was the best evidence ; but it was admitted by the court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-11" data-blocks='[["BL_195.9",195,[210,1515,1161,556]]]'>The defendant gave in evidence a deed from James Wylie and wife to James McCully (defendant’s landlord) for the ground occupied by the alley, no title in Wylie and wife having been shown. He also offered to prove, “ that previous to bringing the former action, Foster Graham, under her direction, caused the alley in question to be closed, and objected to its use, for the purpose of showing that plaintiff has no right to its use, and therefore cannot recover in this suit, and also by deeds to show that the right of plaintiff was a mere license to use alley of defendant’s landlord, upon conditions which had not been complied with previous to the former suit.” This was rejected on the ground that the judgment in the former case is conclusive of plaintiff’s right.</p>

If, however, the plaintiff and defendant by any arrangement agreed that defendant should have the use of the alley for a stipulated sum, then so far as the plaintiff is concerned she cannot recover for such time in this action, whether the rent was paid or not. So, if she rented to Hersberger and received pay for it, she cannot recover damages from defendant for that time; but if there was any time within six years after plaintiff had terminated this arrangement, by the notice in evidence, which we hold sufficient, with defendant for the use of alley, and previous to the lease to Hersberger, plaintiff is entitled to recover whatever the damages may have been for that. The amount, if plaintiff is entitled to recover more than nominal damages, should be whatever the property would have rented for more with the use of the alley than without it.”</p>
