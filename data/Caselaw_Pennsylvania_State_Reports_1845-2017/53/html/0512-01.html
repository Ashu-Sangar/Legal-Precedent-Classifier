On one of the days of the fair, Mrs. Hinds was a passenger on the defendants’ train, in the ladies’ car, which was the hindmost in the train. As the train approached the Beaver station, a large crowd of boisterous drunken men and women were seen approaching the station, and as soon as the train stopped noisy and disorderly drunken men forced themselves into the ladies’ car: the evidence made it pretty clear that it was impracticable for the conductor to keep them off the train. One of the intruders, who was amongst the most boisterous, and was uttering loud threats against some one, jumped on the rear platform as the car started. Soon after the car moved off, a fight was commenced in this car by this last intruder. In the course of the fight some one was thrown upon Mrs. Hinds with such violence that her arm was greatly injured, and she laid by from her ordinary duties. The evidence was conflicting as to the efforts made by the conductor to quell the fight — some of the witnesses testifying that he could have got amongst the combatants ; others, that the crowd was so dense that he could not enter the car at all, and could do no more than stand at the door and call out for peace, and tell the passengers to throw the rioters from the car. The car was stopped two or three times between Beaver and the next station; but at each time went on after two or three minutes or less, without anything special being done to stop the fight or eject the rioters: all, or most of them, got out at the next station.</p>

Drunken and quarrelsome men intruded into the ladies’ car in great numbers whilst the train stopped at Beaver station, and in the disgraceful fight which ensued among them, the plaintiff’s arm was broken, and for this- the railroad company is sued. Had the suit been against the riotous men who did the mischief, the right of recovery would have been undoubted, for it is not more the duty of railroad companies to transport their passengers safely than it is the duty of passengers to behave in a quiet and orderly manner. This is a duty which passengers owe both to the company and to fellow-passengers, and when one is injured by neglect of this duty the wrongdoer should respond in damages.

The negligence' of the company, or of their officers in charge of the train, is the gist of the action, and so it is laid in the declaration.

It is not the case of a voluntary reception of such passengers. If it were, there would be great force in the point, for more improper conduct could scarcely be imagined in the conductor of a train than voluntarily to receive and introduce among quiet passengers, and particularly ladies, a mob of drunken rowdies. But the case is that of a mob rushing with such violence and in such numbers upon the cars as to overwhelm the conductor as well as the passengers.</p>

The conductor did not “ allow” improper numbers, no more than improper characters, to get upon the cars. He says he took no fare from them, and in no manner recognised them as passengers. To allow undue numbers to enter a car is a great wrong, almost as great as knowingly to introduce persons of improper character, and in a suitable case we would not hesitate to chastise the practice severely. But this is not a case in which the conductor had any volition whatever in respect either of numbers or characters. He was simply overmastered, and the only ground upon which the plaintiff could charge negligence upon the company would be in not furnishing the conductor with a counter force sufficient to repel the intruders. This was not the ground assumed by the plaintiff, and it would scarcely have been maintainable had it been assumed.</p>

Whilst a conductor is not provided with a force sufficient, to resist such a raid as was made upon the train in this instance, he has, nevertheless, large powers at his disposal, and if properly used, they are generally sufficient to preserve order within the cars, and to expel disturbers of the peace. His official character and position are a power. Then he may stop the train and call to his assistance the engineer, the fireman, all the brakesmen, and such passengers as are willing to lend a helping hand, and it must be a very formidable mob indeed, more formidable than we have reason to believe had obtruded into these cars, that can resist such a force. Until at least he has put forth the forces at his disposal, no conductor has a right to abandon the scene of conflict. To keep his train in motion and busy himself with collecting fares in forward cars whilst a general fight was raging in the rearmost car, where the lady passengers had been placed, was to fall far short of his duty. Nor did his exhortation to the passengers to throw the fighters out come up to the demands of the hour. He should have led the way, and no doubt passengers and hands would have followed his lead. He should have stopped the train, and hewed a passage through the intrusive mass until he had expelled the rioters, or have demonstrated, by an earnest experiment, that the undertaking was impossible.</p>
