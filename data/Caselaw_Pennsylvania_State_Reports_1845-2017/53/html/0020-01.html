The gauge of this road was fifty-six and a-half inches, being that of the coal-roads then in use. Three years afterwards, parliament authorized the construction of a railway from London to Birmingham. This railway was of the same gauge, and built by the same engineer ; and has since grown into the London and North Western Railway, with -1274 miles of road, on which have been expended over fifty-two millions of pounds sterling, and of whose management and operations a most interesting account is given in the Quarterly Review for December 1848. The half-yearly dividend of this road for the first half of 1865, was 3 per cent.</p>

The act of incorporation was obtained on the 31st of August 1835, and Mr. J. Kingdom Brunei, who had made the preliminary surveys, was selected as the engineer, and under his advice the gauge of seven feet, or eighty-four inches, was adopted.</p>

On roads where the curves were more frequent and sharp, and the mercantile traffic bore a larger proportion to the passenger than on the Great Western, Mr. Brunei admitted that a narrow gauge might be more advantageously used. A few years later he said: “ It can have no connection with any other of the main lines, and the principal branches were well considered, <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>and almost formed part of the original plan, nor can these be dependent on any other existing lines for the traffic which they will bring to the main trunk,” an,d the commercial isolation of this exceptional system was therefore contemplated and designed by the engineer and directors. This line, therefore, dissociated itself from the general railway system of England, and wherever the two gauges approached each other occasioned, of course, a break of gauge, and a transhipment of passengers and baggage, and also of freight, whether dead or alive.</p>

The magnitude of the nuisance was admitted, and after a discussion in the House of Commons, Mr. Cobden moved for the appointment of a commission, and the House subsequently unanimously voted an address, “ praying her Majesty to be graciously pleased to issue a commission to inquire whether in future private acts for the construction of railways, provision ought to be made for securing a uniform gauge ;” and a commission was accordingly appointed of Sir E. Smith, Professor Barlow and Professor Airy, who made their report in January 1846v Eorty-six witnesses were examined, including engineers, locomotive manufacturers, managers, secretaries and carriers. Eour employees of the Great Western were in favor of the broad gauge, four were opposed to break of gauge, but gave no opinion about width of gauge ; three were for intermediate gauge, with no opinion as to uniformity; five were for intermediate gauge theoretically, against broad gauge, and now favorable to uniformity; and thirty for uniformity and a narrow gauge. They considered the improvements already made had obviated all the difficulties which the narrow gauge formerly presented. The commission recommended “ that the gauge of four feet eight inches and a-half be declared by the legislature to be the gauge to be used in all public railways now under construction, or hereafter to be constructed, in Great Britain.”</p>

L. 410, Purd. 844, pl. 41), authorizes the leasing of railroads by other railroad companies where their roads “ shall be directly or by means of intervening railroads connected with each other.” The Catawissa road connects with the Philadelphia and Erie road, and that road connects with the Atlantic and Great Western road. Identity of gauge is not required. The legislature knew that railroads in this state were of different gauges, and that by law a company could adopt any gauge and change it at pleasure. Railroads forming a junction or coming in any manner in contact, are connected in the sense used in the act. The term is so understood by the general railroad community, as appears by the numerous affidavits, by the complainants, who advertise as connecting with <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>the Atlantic and Great Western Railway, selling tickets to points on the latter road, and resolutions recognising the connection with it — and by the legislature in various Acts of Assembly authorizing connections of railroads with'canals, plank-roads, &amp;c.; when the connection was to be made to allow cars to pass from one road to another the intention has been expressed. The allowing the connection by “ intervening roads,” shows that it was not intended that cars and engines should pass from one road to another, for the intervening road might not allow the cars to pass over their road, or after the -lease might change the gauge. Nor could cars, &amp;c., pass over the length of a road bisected by a river without a bridge. Improvements have been made to run cars over gauges of slight difference ; and may not improvements be attained for the difference between six feet and four feet eight inches ? But cars may be run on both roads by putting a correspondingly narrow track on the Atlantic and Great Western Railway, and the court will decree in its favor, on condition that the company does so within a certain time.

The Act of March 29th 1859 (Pamph. L. 290), provides, that the Aet of 1847 shall be construed to authorize companies owning connecting railroads to enter into leases, &amp;c., with each other, in respect to the use of their several railroads. This is not, as is said, a merely supplementary aet, but is an independent act, differing entirely from the Act of 1847. The Act of April 23d 1861 (Pamph. L. 410), authorized any railroad companies, however numerous, to hold stock and bonds in any other company, “ and to enter into contracts for the use or lease of any other railroads; * * * provided that the roads * * * shall directly or by means of intervening railroads be connected with each other.” There is nothing in this act about the cars of one road running on the other: that has been dropped. The great point in this case is the meaning of “ connection.” The phrase is not, connecting <em>gauges, </em>nor connecting <em>rails, </em>nor connecting <em>traelcs, </em>but connecting <em>roads. </em>There are two considerations to be presented here:— 1st. Cars can run from one road on to another where the gauges are not the same, for it is done on roads of 4 ft. 10 in., and 4 ft. 8J in. gauges, and the progression of science may overcome a much greater difference of gauge ; 2d. Gauges may be the same and the rails united, and cars may not be able to go from one to the other on account of the angle of connection, or the steepness of the connecting grade — with other features, as closeness of tracks, width of tunnels, &amp;c., &amp;c. In addition to this is the right the <em>directors </em>of any company have to change its gauge. The word is to be interpreted by its popular meaning, which embodies the sense of all mankind, while the knowledge of a technical meaning is confined to a few experts. The meaning assigned to an expression in a law, should be that which is popularly given to it; for the body of the people are those who are to be affected by a law, and the meaning of its words should be according to their understanding of them. A line of boats may be connected with a line of stages; but they are not the same: so a turnpike may be connected with a railroad, the ocean with a river, and the like.</p>

And although an Act of Assembly is a most solemn act of record, yet directing such a copy as this to be filed does not make it part of the act. The requisition in the Pennsylvania act, that to give effect to the contract of consolidation, the other states shall “ authorize a like consolidation,” does not mean like <em>legislation.” </em>The <em>consolidation </em>is to take-effect in a particular way; and the object was that our legislation should not clash with that of the other states. Consolidation may be effected by a general iaw in Pennsylvania and special law in New York — applying to all companies in Pennsylvania, and to individual companies in New York, as each particular case arises.</p>

It was a legal and valid contract, fully authorized by the Act of Assembly of 13th March 1847, § 1, and the Act of 29th March 1859, § 1, (Purd. 844); and the right which it conferred upon the Catawissa Company to run, under special regulations, twenty-seven miles of the Philadelphia and Erie Company’s road, from Milton to Williamsport, constituted — to say the least of it — an <em>appurtenance </em>of the Oatawissa Railroad. As an appurtenance, it would pass to the Atlantic and Great Western Company, under the lease of 1st November 1865, unless restrained by the necessary construction of the original instrument conferring the right. On this point it is argued, that the 14th clause or section of the agreement ought to be construed to restrain the transfer. That clause declares that in case of an assignment “ <em>for the benefit of credit</em>ors.,” by the Catawissa Company, or in case of a <em>“ judicial sale or </em>transfer” of their road, the agreement shall be void and of no effect. But the transfer here was neither an assignment for the benefit of creditors, within the meaning of the 14th clause, nor <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>a judicial sale or transfer, but a voluntary transfer of a lawful appurtenance along with the main body of the Catawissa Railroad ; and such a transfer, forbidden by nothing in the agreement, was authorized by the Act of Assembly of 23d April 1861, which gave railroad companies power to contract for the lease or use of railroads of other companies. As matter of construction, it must be held that this power to lease applies as well to the <em>appurtenances </em>of a railroad, as to the very structure of the road itself. By virtue of the prior acts above referred to, the Catawissa Company acquired this appurtenance, and annexed it to their road. By virtue of the Act of April 1861, they could transfer it as part of their road, acquired and transferred on the faith of legislation. Why should the transfer be thought to put an end to the contract ? Where was the ground of forfeiture ? Be it, that the contract was not assignable at law, or that the companies had not power, under their respective charters, to make or transfer such contracts, these enabling statutes came to their assistance, and supplied what was lacking.</p>

If the legislative authority to transfer did not exist under the Act of 1847 and 1859, the facility with which such authority could he obtained was well known, and should have been guarded against in framing the agreement, but was not.

The Act of Assembly of 23d April 1861 (already referred to), after conferring power upon railroad companies to contract for the use and lease of each other’s roads, concludes with a proviso — “ <em>that the roads of the companies, so contracting or leasing, shall he direetly, or hy means of intervening railroads, connected with each other.”</em>

Although these roads cross at grade near Corry, and come to common platforms and depots at that place, so that the passengers and freight are transhipped from one road to the other, yet it is said they are not connecting roads; and it is earnestly argued that no roads of different gauge can connect with each other, within the meaning of the proviso of the Act of Assembly.</p>
    <p id="b59-7" data-blocks='[["BL_59.6",59,[223,1617,1162,598]]]'>If, in construing the proviso, we were to govern ourselves by the strict laws of language, the argument would be likely to prevail ; because it is indubitable, that the word <em>connect, </em>etymologically considered, implies a closer union than can be made of railroad tracks of different gauges. The Latin particle <em>eon, </em>when used as a prefix, signifies <em>union </em>or <em>association; </em>as <em>concourse </em>— a running together; and when placed before the verb <em>necto, </em>which means to tie, we have the root of our English word <em>conned, </em>which, taken literally, must mean to <em>tie together, </em>to be joined or <em>united. </em>Perhaps the most perfect illustration of the meaning of this word is derived from the process of knitting, where the union of parts becomes very intimate. It would be.difScult to say that railroads of different gauges could be knitted together; so intimate a union between such roads is physically impossible.</p>
    <p id="b59-8" data-blocks='[["BL_59.7",59,[223,2213,1164,259]],["BL_60.1",60,[325,455,1158,1414]]]'>But it is <em>legislative </em>language we are to construe, and it must be received, not necessarily according to its etymological meaning, but according to its popular acceptation, and especially in the sense in which the legislature is accustomed to use the same words. The legislature did not limit the right of connection to roads of similar gauge. Nor yet were they ignorant that diverse <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>gauges prevailed in Pennsylvania; and that, under the Act of 11th February 1853, every railroad company may adopt a gauge of their road, and change it according to the discretion of directors. And it must be presumed that the legislature of 1861 knew also — what the industry of counsel has fully shown to us — that a great number of Acts of Assembly, running through a period of nearly twenty years, had provided for the <em>connection </em>of railroads with canals, plank-roads and other public improvements; for <em>connection </em>between <em>canals </em>and cities, and for the <em>connection </em>of railroads of different gauges. We have also been referred to numerous Acts of Assembly, in which the legislative intent, that railroads should be so connected as that cars might run from one road upon the other, has been fully expressed, making thus a distinction in the legislative mind between <em>mere </em>connecting, and so <em>complete a </em>connection, as to allow the use of the same cars on both roads. I do not cite these various acts, because they are sufficiently referred to in the printed briefs; but it is impossible to go through them without seeing that the legislature have customarily used the words “ <em>connect” </em>and <em>“ connection,” </em>in railroad laws, in a much more loose and general sense than their radical signification; and that, where a union has been intended so intimate as to enable cars to pass from one road to another, this intention has been expressed in unmistakeable language. We would therefore violate all legislative analogies, and disregard our whole railroad history, were we to construe the proviso to the Act of 1861 according to the strict laws of language, and deny connection to railroads of dissimilar gauges. But, on the other hand, we conform ourselves to the course of Pennsylvania legislation, when we define a railroad connection to mean, where no supplementary terms are used, either such a union of tracks as to admit the passage of cars from one road to the other, or such intersection of roads as to admit the convenient interchange of freight and passengers at the point of intersection.</p>

The legislative intent is to be sought for through this ordinary signification of common words; and if a contemporaneous construction of the same words by the legislature itself can <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>be discovered, it is very high evidence of the sense in which the words are to be received ; for <em>contemporánea expositio est fortissima in lege.</em>

Standing on this ground, we decide that the Catawissa and the Atlantic and Great Western are railroads <em>connected </em>by an intervening road, notwithstanding the diversity of gauge prevents the running of common cars. The intersection at Corry, that has been formed between the Philadelphia and Erie and the Atlantic and Great Western, being such as admits the interchange of freight and passengers, constitutes a <em>connection </em>between the Catawissa and Atlantic and Great Western, within the meaning of the proviso of the statute under consideration.</p>

The two roads were of the same gauge; and the point ruled was, that a connection between them must be formed somewhere in Luzerne county ; and I defined that necessary connection to be such a union of the tivo roads as to admit the transition of cars. It was no general exposition of railroad connections, but only a definition of that particular connection. If anything more than this can be made out of that opinion, I am bound to say that the subsequent argument of this case, and the consultations and reflections upon it, have settled .me in the construction hereinbefore expressed.</p>
