Jacob Kuhns was a son, and Adam Bowman, one of the defendants, a son-in-law, of Philip. From the evidence, it appeared that James Murry, the county surveyor, on the 1st of June 1813, at the request of Philip Kuhns, made surveys dividing this tract of land into two parts, one to be for his son Jacob, and the other for Bowman. After lines had been run and a calculation made, the surveyor found that too much would fall to Jacob’s part; the lines were again run till the tract was equally divided. Jacob and Bowman both lived on their respective parts at the time of the division and afterwards. On the 28th of February 1822, shortly before the death of Philip, he made deeds to Jacob and Bowman for their respective tracts, each calling for the other as an adjoiner, and in both deeds the survey of Murry was referred to.

The erasure and alteration of the deed of Philip Kuhns to Bowman, if wilfully made, rendered the whole deed a forgery, and the defendants cannot protect themselves under it or any copy of it, although one of record. After such alteration and erasure the deed cannot be used as evidence, and it will be the duty of the jury to disregard it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b314-11" data-blocks='[["BL_314.9",314,[309,1527,1153,555]]]'>Answer: “ The fraudulent alteration of a deed after delivery, in a material part, avoids it, and it cannot be used as evidence. But the evidence on which the defendants rested in the present case was the record of the deed which contained no erasure, nor appearance of it. The original deed was introduced by the plaintiff himself. By our Acts of Assembly the record of a deed is made equally admissible as evidence with the original. The alteration of. a deed does not destroy the estate, nor operate as a forfeiture, but only affects the evidence of title, and if the party has legal and genuine evidence of title, as a regularly recorded deed, the fact that the original may have been altered after it was recorded does not affect the record of it. Eor -these reasons the point is answered in the negative.”</p>

But the lines marked upon the ground before completing the survey may be abandoned, and a portion of the land included within the lines left out, and the draught made to conform to such alteration, and if such were the case, and the parties so treated it, and the titles <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>were made accordingly, the right would be governed by such alteration, notwithstanding marked lines were made upon the ground, and still subsist. The proper course for a surveyor in such case, if he has included too much land, was to have gone over the land again, obliterate the old lines and make new ones; but the law does not require that such care should have been used. Whether there was such ■ abandonment of a part included within by the marked lines and the length of the line, redrawn from 56 to 33, was done designedly, is a question of fact for the jury, and if the jury believe it was so altered, then the marks on the ground would not be the line of survey as finally settled, but the survey as so altered and reformed.”</p>

If the plaintiff had not the possession of the disputed part, the action cannot be maintained. The part in dispute was not cleared nor cultivated, nor actually occupied by either party, and in such case the constructive possession is in the party having title. If Kuhns had the right and title, he can maintain this suit; if this land were within the deed to Bowman, then he would have the actual possession as connected with his general occupation, and the plaintiff must fail. Whether it is within the deed of the one or the other is for the jury.”</p>

To constitute such right there must be actual, adverse, continued and exclusive possession for twenty-one years. If the land in dispute, in the judgment of the jury, was not originally in the Kuhns deed, but was within Bowman’s deed, has Kuhns proved such a possession as gives title by the statute, ? This is not the case of overlapping surveys where both include it; it is either in the one or the other, but not in both. There was no part cultivated, no clearing on, no actual or visible possession nor exclusive occupancy by either. In such case the possession was incident to the title. There is nothing, therefore, to sustain the statute, so far as regards acts on the ground, and the only ground would be a constant assertion of actual possession as part of his farm on the part of Kuhns, and constant disclaimer of title by Bowman for the whole space of twenty-one years. In such case loose and unsatisfactory declarations and <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>mere claims of right are not sufficient. Where the effect is to take away a man’s title, the evidence ought to be of a satisfactory character. The claim of Kuhns under the statute, and the fact that Bowman disclaimed, seems to me to he slight, but it is for the jury. Without such constant assertion of right, coupled with acts of ownership on one side and constant acts of disclaimer on the other for the whole period of twenty-one years, there is nothing in the fact of this case to make title under the statute.”</p>

But where the person having the better title, although in actual possession of a part of a whole tract, confesses that a particular part of the land included in his survey is not in his possession, and that he does not claim it, and the owner of the adverse title claims it by marked lines on the ground, as part of his land, on which he also has an actual residence, and uses it as part of his farm, then there is no room for the doctrine of constructive possession in reference to the owner of the better title.

Philip Kuhns undertook, in 1813, to divide the tract equally between his son, Jacob Kuhns, and his son-in-law, Adam Bowman, and for this purpose he employed James Murry, the deputy surveyor of the county, to run and mark the necessary lines. It would seem from the testimony delivered on the trial below, that Murry’s lines, as first run, did not make an equal division, and that he and the parties went back upon the land and ran off till it was equally divided. Murry made a draft of his survey, and in 1822, when the deeds were drawn, this draft was referred to in the deeds, hut in copying the courses and distances the scrivener mistook the course S. 56° E. 95 6-10 perches for 25 6-10, and so wrote it down in Bowman’s deed.

The plaintiff’s suit was trespass for entering upon unimproved woodland, and the great question in the cause- was whether the <em>locus in quo </em>was within the lines of his deed. If it was, he had both the constructive possession, which title always draws to itself, and the actual possession, which results from residence upon and cultivation of the tract, of which the woodland was part — but if the <em>locus in quo </em>was not within his lines, he had neither the constructive nor the actual possession of it, and could not maintain trespass, whether the defendants had title or not.</p>

This proposition evidently had reference to the experimental lines first run by Murry, but which were abandoned when it was found they would not effect an equal division.. Though it be true of official surveys of vacant land, that the lines on the ground constitute the true survey, yet rejected lines provq nothing, and ought to be obliterated. -Much more should erroneous lines be rejected that were run in this unofficial, parental effort to divide a tract equally between a son and a son-in-law. If the courses and distances in the deeds made an equal division, which the lines on the <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>ground did not, the jury had ground for presuming that some of the lines first run were rejected, and those mentioned in the deed were finally adopted.

He insists that for more than twenty-one years he had used this woodland as farmers ordinarily use woodland adjacent to their farms, and that he had thus acquired title, even though it were not within the lines of his deed. But, according to the doctrine of Ament <em>v. </em>Wolf, 9 Casey 331, the plaintiff’s failure to reside or cultivate within the lines of the tract to which the woodland belongs, is decisive against his attempt to set up the Statute of Limitations. In Hole <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse, <a href="/wright/1/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Wright 116" data-case-ids="626078" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0116-01">1 Wright 116</a>, it was said to be apparent from all the authorities, that to maintain an actual possession of woodland, as such, it is indispensable that the intruder take actual possession by residence or cultivation of part of the tract to which, the woodland belongs.

His occasional trespasses, therefore, to take timber, constitute no possession under the statute.</p>
