He there purchased a schooner, changed her name to “ Reindeer,” and put on board of her 288 bales of cotton. The vessel sailed from the Brazos river to run the blockade. She was captured and proceedings were instituted in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the condemnation and forfeiture of the vessel and cargo. On the 27th day of February 1863, in that court, it was <em>“ </em>orderéd that proceedings herein be discontinued, so far as relates to 73,533 pounds of cotton, being a portion of the above-named cargo, belonging to James Millingar, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and that the marshal release and deliver the same to the said James Millingar or his attorney.” The vessel and the rest of the cargo were afterwards condemned. The cotton thus released to Millingar was <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>sold by him, and after deducting expenses and allowances claimed by him, there remained in his hands the sum of $25,949.70.</p>

It was to be held in the name of Charles Gearing until the Federal forces should take the place, and then be turned over to them for him (M.).

Thus far there is no dispute about the law. The learned counsel, however, differ as to what was done by the court in the premises. The defendant’s attorney alleges the action of the court on the 17th of February 1863, was a judgment by default against all claimants, and equivalent to a formal decree of condemnation against the vessel and cargo, by which, the title of Gearing was divested, and the same was <em>ipso facto </em>vested in the United States, or in the United States and the captors jointly. Whilst the plaintiff’s counsel denies the correctness of this position, and contends that no judgment nor decree whatever, affecting the title to the property captured, was pronounced on that day, nor until after this cotton had been released and delivered to the garnishee, and therefore Gearing’s title, if he had any before, remained in him, unimpaired by that proceeding: 1 Curtis 359.

In examining the question, we must not be led astray by false names. We must look at the true character of the transaction rather than to the name by which it may be called. In order to test the correctness of the defendant’s position, we will suppose Charles Gearing was indebted to sundry persons here, including the defendant, in the sum of $25,000; that he and James Millingar went to Texas together, and after some time Millingar being about to return home, Gear<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>ing placed in his hands $30,000, with directions, when he reached home, to take out of this sum, say $5000, the amount of his own claim, and pay to the other creditors $20,000, the amount of their claims, and hand over the remaining $5000 to his wife, to be kept by her until his return. This Millingar agreed to do, took the money, came home, and instead of performing his promise, neither paid a dollar to any one of the creditors, nor handed over a dollar to Mrs. Gearing, but put the whole in his pocket. When Gearing comes home and ascertains that Millingar has violated every promise he made when he received the money, he brings an action against him for money had and received to his use. Millingar sets up as a defence that he is not the agent of Gearing, but a trustee for the creditors, and, therefore, he cannot recover; the creditors must proceed against him by bill in equity for an account. Who can doubt for a moment that such a defence would be unavailing, if not frivolous ?</p>

And in Swartswalter’s Account, 4 Id. 77, it was held that an administrator or trustee, who in the management of the funds acts unfaithfully and dishonestly towards his <em>cestui que trust, </em>will be allowed no compensation on the settlement of his account, and Mr. Justice Kennedy, in delivering the opinion of the court, says : ‘ Now, it is entirely inconsistent with every principle of retributive justice, that a trustee who betrays j the confidence reposed in him and attempts to defraud the <em>cestui que trust </em>by appropriating the trust-funds to the discharge of a pretended claim of his own, should receive the same reward that is due to virtue only, and given as a remuneration for services rendered with a view to advance the interests of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>On principles of policy, as well as those of morality and justice, in order to insure a' faithful and honest execution of the trust as far as practicable, it would be inexpedient to allow to the trustee who has acted dishonestly and with an intent fraudulently to convert the trust-funds to his own use, the same compensation with him who has acted uprightly in all respects and with a single view to promote the true interests of his <em>cestui que trust. The </em>withholding compensation altogether in the. first case, and bestowing it only in the latter, may have a tendency to deter trustees from attempting anything unfair in the execution of the trust, and induce them at the same time to perform their duties with common honesty at least, if not with all the skill and diligence that might possibly be applied ;’ and to the same point are the cases of Say <em>v. </em>Barnes, 4 S. &amp; R. 116; Aston’s Estate, <a href="/whart/5/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Whart. 228" data-case-ids="8877678" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0228-01">5 Wh. 228</a>; Dyott’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20566" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 566">2 W. &amp; S. 566</a>; Fournier <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 7 Id. 31; McCahan’s Appeal, 7 Barr 59 ; Drysdale’s Appeal, 2 Harris 537.

First, we agree with the learned judge that the proceedings in the Prize Court did not affect the ownership of the released cotton, but left it as it would have stood if no capture or seizure had taken place. There being no condemnation of it, no change of title took place, and the government and <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>the captors had put an end to any supposed rights of theirs by their own voluntary act. Upon this point we think the reasoning of the court below is conclusive.</p>
    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[312,561,1162,341]]]'>Then the garnishee claims this cotton as his own, being purchased in Texas by his debtor, who thus paid his creditor by investing his debt in cotton, and sending it to him in that shape. This the jury have directly negatived, and even if we differed from them it is not our province to criticise or to interfere with their decision upon that point, as it was not the property of the garnishee, so neither are its proceeds in his hands, and this brings us to the real question in the case.</p>
    <p id="b372-7" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[311,904,1164,850]]]'>This cotton was purchased by Gearing with his own money, and, of course, was his property ; was shipped for Havana, there to be sold, and the proceeds to be remitted to James Millingar, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he to pay the indebtedness of Gearing <em>pro rata </em>to each creditor, and if there was over enough to pay them, the balance was to be given to his wife, Mrs. Gearing, for him. This was distinctly submitted by the court to the jury, and found by them. Owing to the capture, the cotton came directly into Millingar’s hands, and was by him turned into money. In Lestapies <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 5 Barr 71, it was held that where one by fraud obtains compensation for injuries done to the property of another, who himself was unable to make a claim therefor, the receiver is accountable to the party whose property is injured; so here, if the cotton was released upon a representation that it belonged to Millingar, he is accountable to Gearing for it. Under this state of facts the relation between them was that ,of principal and agent, with specific instructions as to the application of the money the proceeds of the cotton, in which Millingar has no further interest than as a creditor of Gearing to receive an equal share with the other creditors.</p>
