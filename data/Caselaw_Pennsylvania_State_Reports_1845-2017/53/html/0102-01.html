      <em>“ </em>It will be observed that the estate is made subject to the collateral inheritance tax as passing <em>from </em>the deceased proprietor to the present <em>living owner, </em>and the argument for the Commonwealth supposes that this took place on the death of Elizabeth Brubaker in 1864, that this estate then passed from her to Levi Eckert. There are three modes contemplated by the Collateral Inheritance Act, in which estates may pass from those who are seised and possessed of the same: 1st. By <em>death with a will; </em>2d. By <em>death without a will, </em>or <em>dying intestate; </em>3d. By <em>transfer </em>by deed, bargain or sale, made or intended to take effect after the death of the grantor or bargainer. It is very clear that by neither of these modes could this estate pass to Levi Eckert from Elizabeth Brubaker. She made no will nor any deed or bargain to transfer the estate. Dying intestate, what of this estate did she leave ? Plainly, nothing. She <em>had nothing </em>to leave. Her estate terminated with her life ; and no estate or interest did or <em>could pass from her, </em>by any of these modes, or in any other way.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b105-7" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[220,1295,1158,676]]]'>“ In confirmation of these views it may be remarked that the liability of this estate to the tax under the Act of 1826, was complete on the death of the testator Peter Eckert. The whole estate passed from him — the life estate to his sister Elizabeth Brubaker, the remainder to his heirs until the life estate ended, when, <em>eo instanti, </em>it vested in Levi Eckert. The tax was chargeable on the whole estate immediately after the death of the testator and was collectable from his executors., Had they paid it, they would have been entitled to credit for the same in their account. The executors failing to pay, this tax of 2J per cent, continued a charge upon the estate, when it came into the possession of Levi Eckert, and was paid by him, properly, as he was bound to do ; and we are of opinion that he was bound to pay at that rate only, since the whole estate <em>passed from Peter Pclcert </em>who died in 1828, and nothing passed from Elizabeth Brubaker who died in 1864, to Levi Eckert.”</p>
