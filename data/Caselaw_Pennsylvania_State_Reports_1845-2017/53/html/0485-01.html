But did the plaintiffs violate the provisions of the policy, and were they guilty of a breach of their duty under the contract, in carrying benzole into the japanning-room, and using it for the purpose and in the manner they did ? The evidence shows that they used it in the same way and for the very same purpose that it is used in all tanneries of the kind in this and in other states. Formerly spirits of turpentine were used in making the composition called ‘ sweet meat,’ and the varnish used in the manufacture of patent leather. And spirits of turpentine were also used to thin or reduce the sweet meat and varnish, so as to fit them for use. But within the last four or five years benzole has been substituted in the place of turpentine, and has been found to answer the same purpose as turpentine in the manufacture of patent leather. It was used by the plaintiffs for this purpose when the contract of insurance was made; and the evidence on both sides shows that they used it precisely in the same way that it is used in other tanneries and establishments of the same kind, — those that have been carried on here and elsewhere. The officers of the company knew, or ought to have known when they took the insurance, what articles were used by the plaintiffs in their tannery in the manufacture of patent leather.</p>

Besides, if they were ignorant of the process, and did not know what articles were actually used by the plaintiffs in the manufacture of their leather, ‘ the privilege of keeping not more than five barrels of benzole, in a small shed entirely detached from the other buildings,’ ought to have put them on inquiry. Why should the privilege be asked for and granted if benzole was not to be used in the tannery, and if not necessary and essential in the process of making patent leather ? If the officers of the company did not know that benzole was used by the plaintiffs in making and reducing the composition and varnish employed in the manufacture of their leather, it was their own fault; and if they did know the fact, they ought not to complain or attempt to evade the responsibility of their contract because the loss has happened in consequence of the plaintiffs using benzole in the usual and ordinary way that it is used in such tanneries as theirs. So far from the plaintiffs being liable to the charge of misconduct, which, in its legal signification, means a transgression of some established and definite rule of action or law (Citizens’ Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Marsh, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20364" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Wright 364">6 Wright 364</a>-6), they were not even guilty of negligence or carelessness in using the benzole, if they used it in the same manner and for the samé purpose that it is customarily <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>and uniformly used in other establishments and tanneries of the same kind. If one does anything, or uses any article of a hazardous nature for the same purpose and precisely in the same way that everybody else does, be cannot be regarded as negligent or wanting in skill. Besides, the mere fault or negligence of the assured and his servants is no defence to an action on the policy to recover for a loss, for it has been repeatedly ruled, and it is too well settled to be doubted, that a loss by fire, occasioned by the mere fault or negligence of the assured, by his servants or agents, without fraud or design, is a loss within the policy for .which the insurers are liable. If, therefore, the jury find from the evidence that the benzole in the open bucket in the japanning-room was the indirect and remote cause of the fire, without which the loss ■would not have happened, the defendant, under the terms and conditions of the policy, is responsible therefor, if the jury find that benzole was commonly and ordinarily used at the date of the policy and at the time of the loss, in the process of manufacturing patent leather in other tanneries of the same kind as the plaintiffs’, and that they used it for the same purpose and in the same way in making and reducing their composition and varnish, as it is customarily and uniformly used in other establishments of a like kind. The defence set up and relied on here would prevent the plaintiffs from using their tannery for the manufacture of patent leather; for the testimony of the chemist called by the defendant shows that the composition used in the manufacture of the leather, composed of linseed oil and benzole, ignites as readily and burns as freely as benzole itself.”</p>

The policy granted the “ privilege of keeping not more than five barrels of benzole in a small shed entirely detached from all the other buildings, situated on the rear end of the lot, about 100 feet from the main building, and nowhere else on said premises.” But the shed containing the benzole was expressly excepted out of the policy.</p>

This business is not enumerated in the list of hazardous risks, and the company could not have expected it to be suspended, nor to be carried on in any other than the customary modes. They insured it. They took the risk, after having their attention drawn to the dangerous article, and after excluding it, as <em>stored in bulk, </em>from the policy. But did they mean to exclude it from the factory as an element or agent in the conduct of the business ? To assume that they did, in the absence of language to that effect, would be to assume that they expected the business to stop, or to be carried on out of the usual mode.- The words of the policy descriptive <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>of the subject-matter of the insurance, are, <em>“ </em>the buildings of their tannery and patent leather manufactory,” and it must be intended that these words included whatever, not expressly excepted, wTas necessary and essential in conducting such a business. In the case of Harper <em>v. </em>The City Insurance Company, 1 Bosworth N. Y. Rep. 520, this was the doctrine applied to a printing establishment, where the fire originated from the use of camphene, which was one of the hazardous articles enumerated by the policy, but it appeared that camphene was ordinarily used by printers for cleaning their types and plates, and was so used in that instance. On this ground it was treated as one of the risks covered by the policy.
