As additional security for the payment of these goods, the defendant gave three promissory notes to the plaintiffs, falling due, respectively, March 18th 1861, April 7th 1861 and April 13th 1861, none of which were paid, but remained till after maturity in plaintiffs’ hands.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-6" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[301,746,1158,300]]]'>In the spring of 1861, the defendant professing to be unable to pay his debts, attempted to get his creditors to sign an article, agreeing to take 50 per cent, of their respective claims, to be in full. The plaintiffs signed the article with the proviso attached, that all of defendant’s creditors should likewise sign. In point of fact all the creditors did not sign the article ; several of them refused to do so, and were paid in full.</p>

The declaration was on the common counts, and also on the promissory notes, copies of book entries being filed under the rule of court. The defendant pleaded non assumpsit, payment and set-off. If upon the foregoing facts the court is of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, judgment is to be entered for the plaintiffs for the sum of $720, with interest from the 29th of April 1861, and costs. But if otherwise, then judgment to be in favor of defendant.'</p>

In point of fact all the creditors did not sign the article ; and several refused to do so, and were paid in full. The plaintiff was paid the 50 per cent.; but, as the conditions of compromise were not complied with, commenced this suit for the balance of the debt. The right to recover is so clear that it is hardly necessary to refer to Durgin <em>v. </em>Ireland, 4 Kernan (14 N. Y.) 325, where Denio, C. J., says: “The condition upon which the payment of 50 per cent, of the amount of the note was to operate as a satisfaction of the whole sum, was not performed. The payment was by the agreement to be full satisfaction, provided all the other creditors agreed to a similar composition, but not otherwise.” The effect of the payment which was made upon the note in question, was simply to satisfy the demand <em>pro tanto. </em>The residue was still owing, and an action on the original contract was the proper remedy for recovery.</p>
