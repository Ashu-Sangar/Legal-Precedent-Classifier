Words are actionable in themselves only where an offence is imputed by them for which the party is liable to indictment and punishment either at common law or by statute.</p>
    <p id="b420-10" data-blocks='[["BL_420.13",420,[312,1654,1165,171]]]'>The words in the 1st count are that the said David Byerly had “ taken apples,” or had <em>“ </em>stolen apples,” or had “ taken apples without asking for them,” or words to that effect, and in substance that the plaintiff had committed larceny.</p>

But when the slander charged is an alternative between trespass and larceny, an indictable offence is not necessarily imputed. And when with another disjunctive conjunction they are described as “ words to that effect,”'the imputation becomes still more equivocal, for to <em>“that </em>
      <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>effect” may mean either to the effect of trespass or larceny— these being the antecedents, with nothing in the relative to distinguish which is meant. It is quite conceivable that the jury may have found under this count that the defendant only imputed a trespass to Byerly, and if so, the words were clearly not actionable. When words <em>per se </em>do not import criminality, a <em>colloquium </em>is necessary to couple them with facts which give a particular hue to the meaning, and which by the help of innuendoes designate the persons and things alluded to, and disclose the charge of guilt: Starkie on Slander 391; Thompson <em>v. </em>Lusk, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%2011" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Watts 11">2 Watts 11</a>; Deford <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 Penna. R. 105; Gosling <em>v. </em>Morgan, 8 Casey 215. Then, if the evidence sustain the allegation, the verdict can be interpreted as finding the crime imputed; but where words are 'laid in an equivocal sense, as imputing a trespass or a felony, though proved as laid, the verdict cannot be considered as determining the sense in which they were understood.</p>
