Morris against Robinson W. Downey, alleging neglect of professional duty as attorney at law in relation to the collection of a judgment. The plaintiffs were the executors of James Stephens, deceased, and employed Mr. Downey as their counsel in settling the estate. Amongst other matters, a claim of the estate against one Isaac Shull was put into his hands for collection. The case was submitted by agreement to the final determination of three referees. By a rule of the Court of Common Pleas of Greene county, in reference to “ Amicable Arbitrations,” it is provided that “ when the award of arbitrators or referees is filed, a judgment <em>nisi </em>may be entered in vacation by the prothonotary, or in term time, on motion, according to the terms of the submission, and notice thereof shall be given by the party intending to enforce the award to the adverse party or his attorney; and the judgment shall become absolute and final unless reasons for setting aside the award shall be filed within four days after service of such notice,” &amp;c.</p>

Shull sold his real estate to John B. Gordon on the 8d of March 1857, and a scire facias was issued by Mr. Downey, on the judgment, February 28th 1859, with notice to Gordon.</p>

The statute requires the submission to be approved by the court and judgment to be entered on the award, giving to the record, in the meantime, only the effect of a verdict of a jury.</p>
    <p id="b426-11" data-blocks='[["BL_426.17",426,[314,1543,1160,245]]]'>“ In Greene county there is a rule of court regulating the practice in amicable arbitrations, and it authorizes the prothonotary, on the award being filed, to enter judgment <em>nisi </em>thereon, and after four days’ notice of the filing of the award by the party wishing to enforce it, he shall be entitled to have judgment absolute entered.</p>
    <p id="b426-12" data-blocks='[["BL_426.18",426,[316,1799,1157,642]],["BL_427.1",427,[239,423,1158,88]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>The award was filed and judgment <em>nisi </em>entered on the 18th February 1854, and on the same day it was entered on the lien-docket ; on the 28th of the month final judgment was entered, pursuant to notice, but no further entry was made in the lien-docket. It was conceded by the appellants’ counsel that the judgment in the case was to be taken to be of the 28th of February, and that the judgment <em>nisi </em>did not constitute a lien. It is true he was forced to this by the fact that his sci. fa. would not be within five years,' if the entry in the lien-docket was to be considered the entry of the judgment. From an examination of the ¡Drovisions of the Amicable Arbitration Law, we are inclined to think he was right. The judgment <em>nisi </em>was but a step towards final judgment; and until the final step was taken by the terms of the act, the award was to have no greater effect than the verdict of a jury. The final step was not taken until the 28th of <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>February 1854, when judgment absolute was entered.
