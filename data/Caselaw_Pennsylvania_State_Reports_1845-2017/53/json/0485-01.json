        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nWoodward, C. J.\nAssuming that the fire originated from the use of benzole in the patent leather manufactory, the material question was whether the use of that article was a violation of the conditions of the policy. The policy granted the \u201c privilege of keeping not more than five barrels of benzole in a small shed entirely detached from all the other buildings, situated on the rear end of the lot, about 100 feet from the main building, and nowhere else on said premises.\u201d But the shed containing the benzole was expressly excepted out of the policy.\nThe custom of the workmen was to carry an open bucket of benzole into the factory as often as wanted to be used in reducing the composition called \u201c sweet meat,\u201d an article that was used in the manufacture of patent leather, and on the morning of the fire one of them had carried in a bucket containing three or four gallons of benzole, which he set down in the middle of the room and turned to the door, when it took fire, from some unknown cause, and communicated the flames to the building, which was wholly consumed.\nThe argument on behalf of the company is, that the policy both in letter and spirit meant to confine the benzole to the shed on the rear of the lot, and to exclude it from any other part of the premises \u2014 that carrying it from the shed in open buckets across the yard, and setting it down in a room with the door open, was an abuse of the privilege granted by the company, which, if it could have been anticipated, would have prevented their taking the risk \u2014 that such use of it was keeping it elsewhere than in the shed, and was therefore a palpable violation of the covenant.\nThe answer which the learned judge made to this argument was substantially as follows: You insured a patent leather manufactory \u2014 you knew, for you were bound to know, that benzole was ordinarily used in such factories ; you stipulated that five barrels of it might be kept on hand near to the factory ; and the necessary presumption is that you meant it might be kept for use in that factory as the article is ordinarily used in similar factories. If, therefore, it was kept in the place stipulated, and used according to the custom of the trade, it was one of the risks covered by the policy. The jury found the fact that the mode of using it was according to custom, and so recovery was had.\nIt appears to us that the argument was well answered. This business is not enumerated in the list of hazardous risks, and the company could not have expected it to be suspended, nor to be carried on in any other than the customary modes. They insured it. They took the risk, after having their attention drawn to the dangerous article, and after excluding it, as stored in bulk, from the policy. But did they mean to exclude it from the factory as an element or agent in the conduct of the business ? To assume that they did, in the absence of language to that effect, would be to assume that they expected the business to stop, or to be carried on out of the usual mode.- The words of the policy descriptive of the subject-matter of the insurance, are, \u201c the buildings of their tannery and patent leather manufactory,\u201d and it must be intended that these words included whatever, not expressly excepted, wTas necessary and essential in conducting such a business. In the case of Harper v. The City Insurance Company, 1 Bosworth N. Y. Rep. 520, this was the doctrine applied to a printing establishment, where the fire originated from the use of camphene, which was one of the hazardous articles enumerated by the policy, but it appeared that camphene was ordinarily used by printers for cleaning their types and plates, and was so used in that instance. On this ground it was treated as one of the risks covered by the policy. See also Girard Fire Insurance Company v. Stephenson, 1 Wright 298.\nWe think there was no error in the admission of the testimony of E. J. Harden. He gave an intelligible account of the mode of using benzole in twelve factories at Newark, New Jersey, and said it was brought in and used from cans and buckets. If any other custom had been established at Pittsburgh it could have been shown, but in the absence of all other evidence on the subject this was competent to fix the usage of the business.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nThompson, J., dissented.\nStrong, J., did not sit at the argument.",

    "head_matter": "The Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. versus McLaughlin.\n. 1. A policy of insurance on a patent leather manufactory allowed keeping benzole in no place but in a shed detached from the building; the insured in conducting their business used benzole and carried it as needed into the factory in an open can. Held, not to be a breach of the conditions of the insurance. _\n_ 2. Benzole being ordinarily used in such manufacture, the presumption was that it was intended that it might be used as it is ordinarily used in similar factories.\n3. In a policy on a \u201ctannery and patent leather manufactory,\u201d it must be intended that there was included whatever, not expressly excepted, is necessary and essential in conducting such a business. _\n_ 4. A witness familiar with the mode of using benzole in such factories in Newark, was asked as to the mode, &c., of using benzole in the factories with which he was acquainted. Held, that the question was proper.\nError to the District Court of Allegheny county.\nThe action was covenant on a policy of insurance in which John Y. McLaughlin and Richard T. Leech, trading as J. Y. McLaughlin & .Co., .were plaintiffs, and The Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company were defendants. The writ was issued to July Term 1865.\nOn the 13th of April 1864 the defendants issued a policy of insurance to the plaintiffs \u201c upon the buildings of their tannery and patent leather manufactory, including bark shed and bark contained therein (except oil shed on the rear end of their lot),\u201d and certain specified contents of the building; \u2014 the aggregate amount insured was $5000.\nThe policy contained the following provisions:\u2014\n\u201c It is a condition of this policy that there will be no fire in any of the above described buildings, except under the boilers.\n\u201c Privilege granted for keeping not more than five barrels of benzole in a small shed entirely detached from all the other buildings, situated on the rear end of their lot, about one hundred feet from the main building, and nowhere else on said premises.\n\u201c If the premises above mentioned shall, at any time when such fire shall happen, be, in whole or in part, occupied for purposes considered hazardous, in the printed proposals and conditions hereunto annexed, unless liberty so to occupy them be expressly stipulated for, this policy, and every clause, article and thing herein contained, shall be void and of no effect.\n\u201c In the insurance of goods, wares or merchandise, the building or place in which the same are deposited, is to be described; also, whether such goods are of the kind denominated hazardous, and whether any manufactory is carried on in the premises. And. if any person shall insure his or their building or goods, and shall cause the same to be described in the policy or in any description or plan referred to therein, otherwise than as they really are, so that the risk offered shall thereby be underrated, such insurance shall be of no force.\u201d\nAmongst the \u201c hazardous\u201d risks mentioned in the enumeration attached to the policy are \u201c factories, oils and varnish, boilers of paint, &c.\u201d The business of the plaintiffs is not one of those enumerated specifically.\nThe benzole was in the shed as stipulated.\nIn making varnish for japanning the leather, manufacturers use benzole mixed with linseed oil, forming a composition called \u201c sweet meat,\u201d which is spread on the hides; it is applied in the room where the hides are first coated. The composition is put into a can of 40 to 60 gallons. The second coatings of the composition, by reason of the evaporation of the benzole from the heat of the room, have to be \u201c thinned down\u201d from time to time by benzole. The supply is taken into the room in cans or buckets containing about five gallons and is poured out from them or buckets.\nOn the 2d of February 1865, a japanner in the employ of the plaintiffs, brought three or four gallons of benzole from the benzole shed, in an open tin bucket and carried it into one of the japanning-rooms. He was just then requested by another of the hands to get him some lampblack: he set the bucket down in the centre of the floor of the japanning-room and turned away to go to the door, w'hen from some cause not ascertained, the benzole immediately took fire and the building and contents w'ere burned.\nThe suit was brought to recover for this loss.\nOn the trial before Williams, A. J., a witness having stated that he knew the way benzole was used in twelve establishments in Newark, N. J., was asked by plaintiffs to state \u201c how it is used, in what vessels and how applied in the establishments with which you are acquainted ?\u201d\nThe question was objected to by the defendants but allowed by the court, and an exception taken.\nThe defendants submitted a number of points, involving the one question whether carrying the benzole into the factory and using it there, as the case showed, were a breach of the conditions of the insurance.\nThe judge, after stating the evidence, charged: \u2014 \u25a0\n\u201c The benzole, if not the proximate, was the remote or indirect cause of the fire ; and the defendant contends that the fire would not have occurred as it did, if the benzole had not been brought into the japannery, as it was, in an open bucket; and that the bringing of the benzole into the japannery in the way it was done by the plaintiffs\u2019 servant, with their knowledge that such was his habit, was such a clear and. direct breach of the terms and condition of the policy, as will prevent them from maintaining this action, and recovering the amount insured by the said policy. But did the plaintiffs violate the provisions of the policy, and were they guilty of a breach of their duty under the contract, in carrying benzole into the japanning-room, and using it for the purpose and in the manner they did ? The evidence shows that they used it in the same way and for the very same purpose that it is used in all tanneries of the kind in this and in other states. Formerly spirits of turpentine were used in making the composition called \u2018 sweet meat,\u2019 and the varnish used in the manufacture of patent leather. And spirits of turpentine were also used to thin or reduce the sweet meat and varnish, so as to fit them for use. But within the last four or five years benzole has been substituted in the place of turpentine, and has been found to answer the same purpose as turpentine in the manufacture of patent leather. It was used by the plaintiffs for this purpose when the contract of insurance was made; and the evidence on both sides shows that they used it precisely in the same way that it is used in other tanneries and establishments of the same kind, \u2014 those that have been carried on here and elsewhere. The officers of the company knew, or ought to have known when they took the insurance, what articles were used by the plaintiffs in their tannery in the manufacture of patent leather.\n\u201c They must be supposed to know that it was carried on in the usual and customary way; and if it was usual and customary to employ benzole in the manufacture of such leather, they must be presumed to have known the fact and to have contracted with reference thereto. Besides, if they were ignorant of the process, and did not know what articles were actually used by the plaintiffs in the manufacture of their leather, \u2018 the privilege of keeping not more than five barrels of benzole, in a small shed entirely detached from the other buildings,\u2019 ought to have put them on inquiry. Why should the privilege be asked for and granted if benzole was not to be used in the tannery, and if not necessary and essential in the process of making patent leather ? If the officers of the company did not know that benzole was used by the plaintiffs in making and reducing the composition and varnish employed in the manufacture of their leather, it was their own fault; and if they did know the fact, they ought not to complain or attempt to evade the responsibility of their contract because the loss has happened in consequence of the plaintiffs using benzole in the usual and ordinary way that it is used in such tanneries as theirs. So far from the plaintiffs being liable to the charge of misconduct, which, in its legal signification, means a transgression of some established and definite rule of action or law (Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Marsh, 6 Wright 364-6), they were not even guilty of negligence or carelessness in using the benzole, if they used it in the same manner and for the sam\u00e9 purpose that it is customarily and uniformly used in other establishments and tanneries of the same kind. If one does anything, or uses any article of a hazardous nature for the same purpose and precisely in the same way that everybody else does, be cannot be regarded as negligent or wanting in skill. Besides, the mere fault or negligence of the assured and his servants is no defence to an action on the policy to recover for a loss, for it has been repeatedly ruled, and it is too well settled to be doubted, that a loss by fire, occasioned by the mere fault or negligence of the assured, by his servants or agents, without fraud or design, is a loss within the policy for .which the insurers are liable. If, therefore, the jury find from the evidence that the benzole in the open bucket in the japanning-room was the indirect and remote cause of the fire, without which the loss \u25a0would not have happened, the defendant, under the terms and conditions of the policy, is responsible therefor, if the jury find that benzole was commonly and ordinarily used at the date of the policy and at the time of the loss, in the process of manufacturing patent leather in other tanneries of the same kind as the plaintiffs\u2019, and that they used it for the same purpose and in the same way in making and reducing their composition and varnish, as it is customarily and uniformly used in other establishments of a like kind. The defence set up and relied on here would prevent the plaintiffs from using their tannery for the manufacture of patent leather; for the testimony of the chemist called by the defendant shows that the composition used in the manufacture of the leather, composed of linseed oil and benzole, ignites as readily and burns as freely as benzole itself.\u201d\nThere was a verdict, November 11th 1865, for the plaintiffs for $5185.75, and the defendants took a writ of error.\nThe errors assigned were the admission of the evidence objected to and the charge of the court.\nJanuary 7th 1867,\nR. & S.
