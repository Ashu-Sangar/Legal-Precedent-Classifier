        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Gbeen,\nWe think it quite clear that every clause of this will which is supposed to limit or restrain the effect of the devise in fee simple to the wife of the testator, has been considered and adjudged in the numerous decisions we have heretofore made. In Jauretche v. Proctor, 48 Pa. 466, which is the leading case, the words of the third and fourth articles of the will, were much more restrictive than anjr of the words in the will we are considering. The words of the third article in that case were an absolute prohibition against any disposition of the estate by the devisee during her life. We held that it was only a restraint upon the power of alienation which was void as against the fee. The fourth article of that will was almost precisely the same as the residuary item in this. We held it to be a gift, not of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate, but of the estate of the devisee unconsumed by her, and hence it could not be considered as being intended to reduce her fee simple estate in the whole. The same is true of the third item of the present will. It is merely a direction to sell whatever of the estate she may not have sold or disposed of during her life. It is a recognition of her right to sell and dispose of the whole estate, and not a restraint upon her estate under the will. These are all the points of contest in this case, but these and a number of others, which have no existence here, have all been adjudged in favor of the estate of the devisee in the cases which have followed Jauretche v. Proctor. It will only be necessary to indicate some of them by reference, to wit: Presbyterian Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 219; Bowlby v. Thunder, 105 Pa. 173; Hopkins v. Glunt, 111 Pa. 287; McIntyre v. McIntyre, 123 Pa. 329; Good v. Fichthorn, 144 Pa. 287; Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 110, and Levy\u2019s Estate, 153 Pa. 174.\nJudgment affirmed.",

He claimed that under the will of William Evans his grandmother took an absolute estate in fee simple, and as she died intestate and only left three children and himself, an only son of a deceased child, that he was entitled to one fourth of the real estate in question under the intestate laws as an heir of the said Elizabeth Evans his grandmother.\nThe defendant to this suit, Elizabeth Smith, on the other hand claimed that under the will of William Evans the wife was given an estate for life with power of disposing of so much thereof as might be necessary for her maintenance and support, and that whatever remained of the estate of William Evans after the death of his wife, Elizabeth Evans, vested in the three children under whom she claimed.\nThe court gave binding instructions for plaintiff.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned among others was (2) above instruction.\nJ. W. Byon, for appellant.\nIt was the intention of the testator to provide for his widow during her natural life adequate support, and after her death, to have his estate pass to his children.\nThis will being inartificially drawn must be liberally construed: 1 Jarman on Wills, 6th ed., p. 326; Redfield on Wills, 442; Dole v. Johnson, 3 Allen, 364.\nWhere there are two clauses in a will, which are so inconsistent with each other that it is impossible to give effect to both, the former must give way to the latter: Stickle\u2019s Ap., 29 Pa. 234; M\u00fctter's Est., 38 Pa. 314; Lewis\u2019s Est., 3 Wharton, 162.\nAfter an unqualified devise by the testator precatory words to his devisee cannot defeat the estate previously granted: Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 108; Coates\u2019s Ap., 2 Pa. St. 129; McKonkey\u2019s Ap., 13 Pa. St. 253; Pennock\u2019s Ap., 20 Pa. St. 268; Kinter v. Jenks et al., 43 Pa.

Moyer and James Byon, for appellee.\nEvery portion-of a will must be given effect, where the different portions are consistent enough to admit of so doing: Jauretche v. Proctor, 48 Pa. 466; Hunter\u2019s Est., 6 Pa. 97; Thompson\u2019s Ap., 89 Pa. 36; Wright\u2019s Ap., 89 Pa. 67; Reck\u2019s Ap., 78 Pa. 432; Forsythe v.

Laverty, 70 Pa. 73; Levis\u2019s Est., 153 Pa. 174; Smith\u2019s Ap., 23 Pa. 9; Francis\u2019 Est., 75 Pa. 225.\nThe rule in Shelley\u2019s case is not one on construction but an inexorable rule of law, that when the ancestor takes a preceding freehold, a remainder shall not be limited to his heirs as purchasers: Kleppner v. Laverty, 70 Pa. 73; Doebler\u2019s Ap., 64 Pa. 17; Jaurechte v. Proctor, 48 Pa. 466; Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 219.\nA devise with power to give a fee passes a fee: Browns\u2019 Est., 38 Pa. 293; Johnson v. Morton, 10 Pa. 245; Coane v. Parmentier, 10 Pa. 72; Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 219; Morris v. Phaler, 1 Watts, 389; Culbertson v. Duly, 7 W. & S. 195; Snyder v. Baer, 144 Pa. 278; Musselman\u2019s Est., 39 Pa. 469.\nWhere a fee is clearly given, subsequent inconsistent bequests or devises will not reduce it to a less estate, unless the intention of the testator so to do clearly appears: Pennock\u2019s Est., 20 Pa. 268; Walker v. Hall, 34 Pa. 483; Kinter v. Jenks, 43 Pa. 445; Beck\u2019s Ap., 46 Pa. 527; Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 224.\nWhen the first devisee has the absolute right to dispose of the property in his own unlimited discretion, and not a mere power of specifying who may take, it amounts to an unqualified gift, and any estate over is inconsistent therewith, and consequently void: 2 Redfield on Wills, 277; 1 Jarman on Wills, 677, note 2; Lynd v. Esterbrook, 7 Allen, 68; Fiske v. Cobb, 6 Gray, 144; Ide v. Ide, 5 Mass. 500; Burnbank v. Whitney, 24 Pick. 146; Jackson v. Delaney, 13 Johns. (N. Y.) 537; Jackson v. Bell, 19 Johns. (N. Y.) 168; Karker\u2019s Ap., 60 Pa. 155.\nWords of command have no-more controlling force in such cases than mere precatory words: Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 108: Levy\u2019s Est., 153 Pa. 177.\nMarch 11, 1895:"
