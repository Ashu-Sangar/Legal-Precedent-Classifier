Hill, Appellant.\nStreets\u2014Original paving\u2014Macadamizing street.\n\u25a0 Where city councils appropriate a certain sum for the repairs of a street, and the highway department uses the money in macadamizing the street, there is no such original paying as will prevent a city contractor from subsequently recovering from a property owner the contract price for laying a pavement of vitrified brick in accordance with an ordinance authorizing such pavement.\nArgued Jan. 9, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 484, Jan. T., 1894, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1889, No. 659, M. L. D., on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nSci. fa. sur municipal lien. Before Br\u00e9gy, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that, on March 30,1889, an ordinance \u25a0was approved authorizing the paving of a portion of Woodland .avenue, including that part in front of defendant\u2019s property,, with vitrified paving bricks. Under the ordinance, John M. Mack, the city contractor, did the work of paving in front of the property of defendant.\nDefendant put in evidence an ordinance a\u00a1iproved Nov. 5, 1883, appropriating $20,000 for repairing Woodland avenue.\nDefendant then offered in evidence a contract made between W. B. M. Conklin and the city of Philadelphia, in pursuance of the last named ordinance, dated June 14,1884, to regrade Woodland avenue from the end of the stone pavement, near Fiftieth street, to Cobb\u2019s creek, and to macadamize the southeast side thereof, and also the bills and statements showing a settlement with the said Conklin for said work, and the approval of the work by the city. Objected to and objection sustained. [1]\nDefendant further offered to prove that W. B. M. Conklin entered into the contract above named on June 14,1884, including the macadamizing in front of defendant\u2019s property; that he did the work and got the money. Objected to and objection sustained. [2]\nDefendant further offered to prove that before the paving was done, for which this lien was filed, Woodland avenue, in front of defendant\u2019s property, was laid from curb to curb with macadamized pavement, with the exception of a space of the roadway on the side of the curb, which was paved with cubical blocks along the curb four feet wide. Objected to and objection sustained. [3]\nDefendant also offered to show that when Woodland avenue was macadamized, the work was done under and in pursuance of an ordinance of councils approved Nov. 5, 1883. Objected to and objection sustained. [4]\nThe court gave binding instructions for plaintiff. [5]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1-4) rulings; (5) instructions; quoting bills of exception and instructions..\nJoseph S. G-oodbread, for appellant,\ncited: Huidekoper v.
