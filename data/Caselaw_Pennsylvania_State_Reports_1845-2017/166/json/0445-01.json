    "head_matter": "Samuel P. Hiester v. Charles W. Yerger, Appellant.\nWill\u2014Heirs\u2014Rule in Shelley's case.\nTestatrix devised real estate to her nephew \u201cfor and during the term of his natural life, upon conditions to keep the same in good repair andj insured and also pay all the taxes thereon during said term, and after his decease, whether before or after my decease, I give and devise the saidj premises unto his then surviving heirs in fee simple.\u201d Held, that the nephew took a fee simple estate in the land.\nArgued Feb. 6, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 67, Jan. T., 1895, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Montgomery Co., June T., 1894, No. 10, in favor of plaintiff on cases stated.\nBefore Steiirett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine the marketable title of real estate which plaintiff agreed to sell to defendant.\nFrom the case stated it appears that plaintiff claimed title under the will of his aunt, Mary Hiester Weber.\nThe material portion of the will is as follows:\n\u201c Clause IY. I give my residence, No. 82 East Airy street with the lot and appurtenances belonging thereto, .and \u00a1the premises No. 55 Penn street both in said borough (Norristown) to my nephew Samuel P. Hiester for and during the term of his natural life, upon conditions to keep the same in good repair and insured and also pay all the taxes thereon during said term, and after his decease, whether before or after my decease, I give and devise the said premises, No. 32 East Airy street, unto his then surviving heirs in fee simple.\u201d\nWe and, J., filed the following opinion:\n\u201c Whether intentional or otherwise, the testatrix has used words which, under the uniform rulings of our court, confer an absolute estate in the first taker. Had the wdll read \u2018 to Samuel P. Hiester \u2019 for life and after his decease to his \u2018 heirs in fee simple,\u2019 there could have been no serious contention as to the construction to be placed upon the devise. The added words \u2018his then surviving\u2019 heirs do not change the meaning to be given to the word \u2018 heir,\u2019 and may be treated as superfluous, as was done in Criswell\u2019s Appeal, 41 Pa. 288, where the devise was to testator\u2019s son Joshua during his natural life and that of his present wife, etc., \u2018 and it is further my will and desire that after the decease of my son Joshua and his present wife that the said tract of land descend to their heirs jointly and their heirs and assigns forever, or to such of them as may be living,\u2019 the court holding that the addition by the testator of the words \u2018 then living \u2019 to the word heirs was insufficient to cause the latter to give way; for superfluous or inconsistent words or doctrines in a will will not suffice to reduce the word \u2018 heirs \u2019 or \u2018 heirs of the body \u2019 to words of purchase. To the same effect is Appeal of Cockins and Harper Executors, 111 Pa. 26, where the devise was \u2018 to my three nieces, share and share alike, during their lives, and at their deaths to go to their heirs in equal amounts to all heirs living at the time of their deaths; \u2019 and it was held that the devisees took under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, the real estate in fee simple and the personal estate absolutely.\n\u201c There is no.distinction between the expressions \u2018his then surviving heirs \u2019 and \u2018 heirs then living,\u2019 or \u2018 heirs then living at the time of their deaths.\u2019 In each case the word \u2018 heirs \u2019 refers to those who under the intestate laws would inherit from the first taker qua heirs.\n\u201c Following the ordinary rules of construction, therefore, the word \u2018heirs \u2019 as used in this devise, must be presumed to have been used by the testatrix in its technical sense, and is to be regarded as a word of limitation and not of purchase, there being nothing in the will to show that it was used in any other manner. The testatrix unquestionably intended the remainder-men to take through the tenant for life, and not directly from herself. Conceding that the testatrix intended to give Samuel P. Hiester but a life estate in the premises No. 32 East Airy street, yet having ascertained that she used the word \u2018 heirs \u2019 in its technical sense we must apply the rule governing cases of this kind, although by so doing we defeat the particular intent of the testator.\n\u201c And now, October 1, 1894, judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of fifty dollars with costs of suit.\u201d\nError assigned was entry of judgment as above.\n'William E.
