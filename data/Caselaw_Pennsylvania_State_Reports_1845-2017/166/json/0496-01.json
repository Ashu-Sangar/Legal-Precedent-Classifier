    "head_matter": "Fidelity Ins. Trust & Safe Deposit Co. v. John F. Byrnes et al., Appellants.\nSheriff's sale\u2014Setting aside sale\u2014Discretion of court.\nThe Supreme Court will not reverse an order confirming a sheriff\u2019s sale, where it appears that the land sold as a whole was made up of the unsold lots and streets of a land association; that the evidence as to the inadequacy of price was conflicting; and that defendant had given no available assurance that a higher and better price would be realized by the proposed re-sale of the property.\nArgued Feb. 11, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 32, July T., 1894, by defendants, from order of C. P., Del. Co., confirming sheriff\u2019s sale.\nBefore Stbrrett, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to sheriff\u2019s sale.\nFrom the record it appeared that the land sold belonged to a land association, known as the Folsom Land Company, and was composed of unsold lots and streets on a plan of lots. The land was sold as a whole for $20,000, under judgments upon two mortgages aggregating with costs etc. $78,000, but the court required that plaintiff, who was the purchaser, should release defendant and the Folsom Land Company from personal liability for balance of mortgage. The sale was made under an order of court giving plaintiff leave to sell the property as a whole or in part. The advertisement of sale was submitted to defendant\u2019s counsel, and modified by them, and then published in its modified form. Real estate experts differed in their testimony as to the adequacy of the price realized by the sale. Exceptions to the confirmation of the sale were dismissed by the court.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions, quoting them.\nW. Henry Sutton and Isaac Johnson, for appellant.\nThis advertisement and the depositions plainljr show that to sell such a property as this in a lumping sale is to sacrifice it.\nThe courts do not look with favor upon this kind of a sale: Rowley v. Brown, 1 Binn. 62; Grim v. Reinbold, 148 Pa. 446.\nA lumping sale of real estate will be set aside unless it forms a clear exception to the general rule, which, in Pennsylvania, is that lots of ground, houses, etc., should be sold separately: Vastine v. Fury, 2 S. & R. 426; Ryerson v. Nicholson, 2 Yeates, 516; Tate v. Carberry, 1 Phila. 133; Thomas v. Curren, 6 W. N. C. 432; Baker v. Chester Co., 73 Pa. 117.\nLewis Lawrence Smith, for appellee.\nThere was no real inadequacy of price. The property was properly sold as a whole. The tract contained about 270 acres, including a considerable number of acres of streets. Its use and development as a land association imperatively demanded that it should be sold as a whole: Morse v. Freck, 7 Pa. C. C. 456; Marsh v. Pier, 4 R. 288; Cooper v. Wilson, 96 Pa. 409.\nIt is a sufficient answer to the allegations of various defects in the advertisements, that a draft was furnished to appellants\u2019 counsel under order of court, and the actual advertisements used were in accordance with their corrections: Johnson v. Johnson, 7 Lanc. Law Rev. 331; Swires v. Brotherline, 41 Pa. 135; Young\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. & W. 382; Weaver v. Lyon, 3 Cent. Rep. 263; Sharp v. Long, 28 Pa. 439; Barton v. Hunter, 101 Pa. 411; Carson\u2019s Sale, 6 W. 146.\nMarch 5, 1895:"
