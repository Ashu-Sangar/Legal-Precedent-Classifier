    "head_matter": "Robert Patterson\u2019s Estate. Appeal of John M. Risher, Executor.\nDecedent's estate\u2014Promissory notes\u2014Forgery\u2014\u2019-Evidence.\nA claim against the estate of a decedent on promissory note was resisted on the ground that decedent\u2019s signature was forged. A witness for claimant testified that he saw decedent sign one of the notes upon which claim was made, and that he saw him sign another note of which one of the notes in question was a renewal. A daughter of decedent and her husband testified to the genuineness of the disputed signatures. The only evidence to the contrary was that of expert witnesses. Held, that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that the notes were genuine.\nArgued Nov. 12, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 322, Oct. T., 1894, by the executor, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., May T., 1804, No. 46, distributing decedent\u2019s estate.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that the People\u2019s Bank of McKeesport was the owner of the three notes which they presented for payment at the audit. The first of these notes was dated Dec. 17, 1892, at four months for $3,000, drawn by William B. Rath to the order of Robert Patterson and indorsed by Robert Patterson and R. H. Rath. The second note was dated Jan. 24, 1893, at four months for $4,000, drawn by W. B. Rath to the order of Robert Patterson, and was- indorsed by Robeit Patterson and James Rath. The third note was dated Feb. 3, 1893, at four months for $650, drawn by W. B. Rath, to order of Robert Patterson, and indorsed by Robert Patterson and R. H. Rath. These notes were all discounted by the People\u2019s Bank of McKeesport, Feb. 4, 1893. They were all renewals of other notes for like amounts that had matured on the respective dates of the notes in question.\nThe $4,000 was the last of a series of renewals the original of which Avas a note dated April 30,1891, for the sum of $5,000. The note of Avhich it was the renewal, became due Jan. 24,1893, R. H. Rath testified that at the instance of his father James Rath, one of the indorsers, he went to the home of Robert Patterson in the latter part of January or first of February, 1893, and saw Robert Patterson indorse the $4,000 note. He also testified that he saAv Robert Patterson indorse a $3,000 note in J. R. Wylie\u2019s office in Duquesne, of which the $3,000 note marked Avas a renewal. R. H. Rath was also an indorser on the latter note. Sarah E. Rath, the wife of W. B. Rath and daughter of Robert Patterson, who lived in the house with her father in Pittsburg the last year of his life, and lived near him in Duquesne for several years immediately preceding his removal to Pittsburg, after comparison of the indorsements of these several notes with the admittedly genuine signatures of her father and from her knowledge of her father\u2019s signature, testified that the indorsements were genuine and were in the handwriting of her father, Robert Patterson. W. B. Rath testified to the same effect. The only evidence to contradict this testimony was that of experts.\nThe court sustained the validity of the notes and awarded the amounts of them Avith interest to claimants.\nError assigned among others was above decree.\nJ. S. Ferguson, F. G-. Ferguson with him, for appellant.\nF. P. Douglas, John D. Watson and Charles B. Payne, Daniel Harrison with them, for appellees.\nJan. 7, 1895 :"
