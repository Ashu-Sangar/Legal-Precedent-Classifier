The sale was not delayed, nor were costs incurred that might have been avoided bj^ an earlier presentation of the claim. There was therefore no error in dismissing the exceptions and discharging the rule to set aside the appraisement. The questions presented by plaintiff\u2019s exceptions have been sufficiently considered and properly disposed of in the opinion of the court below. For reasons there given the decree should not be disturbed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.",

Hannah Schmick.\nExemption\u2014Debtors\u2014Execution\u2014Notice.\nThe defendant in an execution, whose real estate is about to be sold, is not barred by a delay of ten days in making his claim of exemption, where the sale has not thereby been delayed, nor costs incurred that might have been avoided by an earlier presentation of the claim.\nArgued Feb. 5, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 49, July T., 1894, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Lehigh Co., Jan T., 1890, No. 228, dismissing exceptions to appraisement for debtor\u2019s exemption.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to appraisement for debtor\u2019s exemption.\nFrom the record it appeared that Hannah Schmick, on March 5, 1890, executed a judgment note for $370 containing waiver of condemnation for purchase money of a house and lot of ground situate in Weisenburg township, Lehigh county. When judgment was entered the defendant owned an adjoining tract of land upon which this judgment also became a lien. On December 16,1893, execution was issued with this direction indorsed thereon:\n\u201cP. S. The within judgment is for purchase money for house and lot, situate in Weisenburg township, Lehigh county, bounded on lands of Jonas Snyder, Daniel Rupp and other lands of Hannah Schmick, containing about half of an acre. Condemnation waived.\u201d\nOn December 26,1893, the defendant after the property had been advertised, claimed the benefit of the exemption law out of the real estate levied upon.\nThe sheriff on January 5, 1894, appointed three appraisers who reported in writing: \u201cWe went upon the real estate of said Hannah Schmick, the defendant, in the above execution, levied on under the same, having found that the same is of greater value than three hundred dollars, do determine that in our opinion said real estate cannot be divided without prejudice to or spoiling the whole.\u201d\nThe court dismissed exceptions to the appraisement.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to the appraisement.\nJohn Rupp, Evan Holben with him, for appellant,\ncited: Com. v. Boyd, 56 Pa. 402; Bowyer\u2019s Ap., 21 Pa. 210; Ulrich\u2019s Ap., 48 Pa. 489.\nJames L. Marsteller, for appellee, was not heard,\nbut cited in his printed brief: Cornman\u2019s Ap., 90 Pa. 254; Shaw\u2019s Ap., 49 Pa. 177.\nFeb. 25, 1895:"
