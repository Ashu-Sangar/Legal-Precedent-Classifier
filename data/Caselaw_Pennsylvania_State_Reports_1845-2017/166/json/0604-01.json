But the law adds or implies no such conditions where the parties themselves fixed the terms of the contract.\u201d In this case, the defendant by his contract und\u00e9r seal, indorsed on the judgment note, guarantees \u201c the payment of the within judgment note and all moneys due and to become due thereon if the same cannot be recovered out of the property purchased of Robert Service\u2019s estate by said Howell McNair by deed this day delivered.\u201d This is a special, not a general guaranty. By forthwith entering judgment on the note and thus acquiring a lien on the real estate mentioned in the guarantee, and then keeping that lien continuously alive, the plaintiff did all that, in good faith, she was bound to do under the terms of the special contract.

P. Bucks Co., Sept, T., 1891, No. 27, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Mc-Collum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover on a guaranty. Before Yerkes, P. J,\nAt the trial it appeared that on April 16,1874, Howell E, McNair purchased a farm from Robert Service and borrowed the money to pay for the same from John S. Rhoads to whom he gave a judgment note. The judgment note was indorsed as follows:\n\u201c For a valuable consideration I do hereb}1' guarantee the payment of the within judgment note and all moneys due and to become due thereon if the same cannot be recovered out of the property purchased of Robert Service\u2019s estate by said Howell McNair by deed this day delivered.\nWitness my hand and seal this sixteenth of April, 1874. Witness,\nJ. L. DuBois.\nJohn B. Walter, [seal.] \u201d\nOn the same day judgment was entered upon the note, and became a lien upon the laud purchased by McNair. The judgment was subsequently revived three times. On March 30, 1880, John S. Rhoads assigned the note to Amanda Ritchie. On April 23, 1891, the land was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale.\nPlaintiff claimed the sum of $1,051.46 with interest from April 23, 1891, being the amount of the judgment not reached by the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale.\nThe court charged in part as follows: \u2022\n\u201cNow, then, gentlemen, taking that as the nearest definition and most pointed instruction which can be given you as to what constitutes due diligence, you will inquire from all the facts in this case whether due diligence was used by Miss Ritchie in the collection of her claim, considering the character of the obligation, that it was given as a lien on real estate, and what, from all the circumstances in the case, was in contemplation of the parties when they entered into their respective undertakings, and also what the condition of the maker of the note was, the value of the property guaranteed, for in effect this is a guaranty of the value of the farm bought, and you will determine from all the facts, taking into consideration this declaration of the Supreme Court, whether the plaintiff used due diligence in collecting the money out of the farm of Mr. McNair. If she did, then Mr. Walter is bound by his obligation to pay whatever it fell short of discharging the lien.\u201d\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,239.67. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was above instruction, quoting it.\nHugh B. Eastburn, Geo. Boss J. E. Long with him, for appellant,\ncited: Kramphs\u2019s Exrs. v. Hatz, 52 Pa. 525; Miller v.
