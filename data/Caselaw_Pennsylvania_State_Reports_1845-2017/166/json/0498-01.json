Chester Co., dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report, in estate of Lewis Rees, deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nHemphill, J., filed the following opinion:\n\u201c The fourteen exceptions filed to the auditor\u2019s report, raise two questions:\n\u201c1st. Has the auditor erred in finding that William Tennent, Jr., was the illegitimate son of William Tennent, Sr.\n\u201c 2d. If illegitimate has he erred in holding that the acts of assembly do not confer upon him the right to inherit from his \u2022uncle, by representation through his mother.\n\u201c William Tennent, Jr., a claimant to a share in this estate, is the son of William Tennent, Sr., and Alice, a sister of the decedent, whose death occurred previous to that of her brother.\n\u201c The auditor finds that he was an illegitimate son, and a careful examination of his report and of the testimony taken by him, satisfies us that he was correct in so finding.\n\u201c Being therefore an illegitimate he could not inherit at common law, and is expressly denied the benefits of our intestate act of April 8, 1888, the 17th section of which provides that \u2018 The provisions of this act relative to decedents and distribution of real and personal estate, among the descendants and collateral relations of intestates, shall be construed to mean such persons only as have been born in lawful wedlock.\u2019\n\u201c The exceptions are therefore dismissed, the report confirmed, and an order made to pay out in accordance with the auditor\u2019s schedule of distribution.\u201d\n'Errors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nJames C.
