There was no provision in the agreement as to how or when the amount borrowed should be repaid.

    <p class="summary" id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[203,593,1168,915]]]'>“ [The total amount of the paving bills, as shown by the surveyor’s certificates, and testified to by Mr. Kelly, amounted to $4,492.73, so that there is a balance between the $4,340.99 paid and the $4,492.73, of $151.74, as I make the calculation. The calculation is one for you to make, however, and not for me. This sum would be increased to some extent by an item of interest. Both parties, I believe, agree that interest ought to be charged up to the time of a continuance of the suit in No. 1 Court, the continuance of an attachment suit which, as I recall the testimony, was about September, 1890. Mr. Zane and Mr. Kelly have testified that at that time there was an agreement between the parties that no further interest should be charged. Mr. Sparhawk, on the other hand, says that the agreement was that there was no interest to be charged until after the settlement of the attachment suit, which was settled on the thirty-first of March, 1891. In other words, he contends that the interest would be lessened to the extent of about six months’ interest. That is a question for you to determine.] [10]</p>

A man paying on account of various claims under the law may appropriate the sums which he paid to any one, or either of them. That is. within his power. If, at the time he makes a payment, he wants it to be appropriated to one of several of the claims which are held against him, he may make such appropriation. If there was such an appropriation made at the time by the defendant, then it would go as against the claim to which the appropriation was made, in settlement of that claim. If he does not make the appropriation, it is"within the power of the other party to appropriate the money to any one of those claims. In this aspect of it, if there was an appropriation made bjr either of them, it is difficult to see how there can be a recovery on the part of the plaintiff upon more than one of these suits, because at whichever end you begin to make the appropriation of payments there would be a <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>payment of all of them with the exception of the last one. If there was no appropriation by the parties, the law would appropriate the sums to the first bills which came due. If these bills came due at the same time, if there was no difference in the dates at which they accrued, then you would have to distribute the amount which is due pro rata, among all of the claims, including those for paving, as I said, beyond Amber street and Arcadia street.] ” [11]</p>
