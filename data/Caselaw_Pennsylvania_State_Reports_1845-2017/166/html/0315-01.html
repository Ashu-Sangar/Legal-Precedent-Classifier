Defendants, in consideration of plaintiff joining in the agreement, and for the mutual use and accommodation of all the parties to the agreement, agreed to lay out two streets on their own land. One of the streets was described as running to the line of ground of plaintiff. Defendants executed a deed of dedication of the streets to the city. The streets were at right angles with each other, and one of them projected beyond the other for a distance sufficient to reach plaintiffs line, forming a cul de sac. This blind end of the street was not placed upon the city’s plans. Defendants erected a fence at the intersection of the street, cutting off the blind end, and depriving plaintiff of an exit from his property through the blind end of the <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>street. On a bill in equity to compel the removal of the fence, the master found that no fraud had been practiced upon defendants by plaintiff, although plaintiff drew the agreement and was at the time the attorney and agent of the defendants. <em>Held </em>that under the agreement plaintiff had a right to the use of the blind end of the street.</p>

The learned master’s findings of fact are abundantly sustained by the pleadings and proofs; and the decree complained of is the legal sequence of the clearly established facts. The allegation of fraud in procuring the agreement of July 26, 1887, is not sustained by any sufficient evidence. After correctly reciting the facts as to the ownership of different parts of the property, etc., the agreement provides, on behalf of all the parties thereto, for the vacation of Bicking street, and, on behalf of the defendants, for laying out and opening—for the mutual use and accommodation of all the parties thereto—Yocum street and Lincoln square, the latter extending southeastwardly from the southwestwardly side of Greenway avenue to the line of plaintiff’s Woodland avenue lot, and then grants and conveys to plaintiff and John Bozorth, their heirs and assigns, the free use and privilege of said Yocum street and Lincoln square, as and for streets, passageways and watercourses, in common with the defendants, their heirs and assigns, owners, tenants and occupiers of the ground bounding thereon, at all times thereafter forever. So far as appears from any evidence in the case,'the negotiations leading up to the execution of the agreement and the subsequent deed of dedication, etc., were conducted as such transactions usually are. It is fair to presume that defendants knew the southwestwardly terminus of Lincoln square was partly on the northeastwardly line of plaintiff’s Woodland avenue lot. The agreement calls for that line, and there is nothing to show that they were ignorant of the fact. But, whether they knew or not, plaintiff was not bound to explain to them what benefits, if any, might result to him from the agreement. It is enough to know that, so far as he was concerned, evidence <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>of fraud is not in the case. It is unnecessary to specially notice either of the specifications. Neither of them is sustained.</p>
