The general opinion of those consulted is that Mrs. Heller has undertaken an enterprise of considerable magnitude, which will call for the employment of a large capital and possession of rather more than average business ability to bring it to the degree of success evidently sought after. There appears a disposition to closely watch the progress of this business, and some have not ceased to regard it as an experiment which will need time to prove its success.
