Defendant’s firm consisted of three partners, one of whom, George L. Harrison, was in Europe. Plaintiff had written to the absent partner in reference to his further connection with the firm, but had received no definite reply. On March 15, 1892, plaintiff notified the two resident partners that he had an offer of a salary of $5,000 a year from other parties. Plaintiff testified m effect that the two resident partners requested him not to leave them, and offered him, if he would remain, a new contract for ten years at a salary of $5,000 a year, or in the alternative at <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>$4,000 a year with an increase of $250 per annum until $6,000 a year was reached. Plaintiff insisted that the new contract should only be terminable upon a year’s prior notice being given. He averred that the two partners agreed to this, and a verbal contract was entered into by which plaintiff was to receive $4,000 the first year, with an increase of $250 until $6,000 was reached, the contract not to be terminated by either party without twelve months’ prior notice thereof being given. Defendants admitted that an agreement had been made that plaintiff should receive a salary at the rate of $4,000 per year until Greoi’ge L. Harrison should return, but denied that any further contract was made, and denied that any terms were made as to dismissal, or that one year’s notice, or one year’s wages was agreed upon.</p>
