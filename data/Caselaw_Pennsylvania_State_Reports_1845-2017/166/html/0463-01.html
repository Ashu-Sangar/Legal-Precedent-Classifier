[You have the testimony of a number of witnesses who said that immediately after his returning to consciousness, upon inquiry, he said, ‘ I did it,’ but gave no excuse for the act except by saying that it may have been from jealousy.

If the pistol was purchased for this purpose, it would be a very strong indication of not only a willful act, but of a deliberate and premeditated act, because' if he thought of doing it on Tuesday and continued to meditate and deliberate upon it until Wednesday morning, it would certainly be full time for all the deliberation and premeditation that the law could require.] [2] [In the further evidence of that, they claim that before the act was committed, the defendant had passed in and out through the house two or three times, and that immediately before it was committed, he closed the doors as he went from the front room to the dining-room, and from the dining-room to the kitchen, so that both doors were closed between the kitchen and the dining-room and the dining-room and the parlor, and that that is evidence of á purpose and a fixed determination to do what was done deliberately.] [3]</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[265,481,1168,1729]]]'>“ The defence is that the prisoner, at the time this offence was committed, was not responsible for his act, or, at all events, was not in a condition to commit the act under circumstances which would make it murder of the first degree. This, as I said, is the defence, and therefore you must take the testimony offered by the commonwealth and ascertain first if the crime has been fully established as having been committed by the defendant and what the degree of the crime is, and then ascertain how that testimony is affected by the testimony of the defence as to his condition at the time this offence was committed. It was alleged that the defendant was insane, and j'ou heard the testimony upon that subject. [It seemed to me that the testimony upon the question of insanity was very meager. The testimony of his sister was that after the death of his wife, a year or more before this unhappy affair, he became very despondent and seemed to be changed in some respects ; that he had been of a very kind disposition, and would still be kind at times, but at other times was cross; that he would sit for hours doing nothing, or walk up and down the floor restlessly; that he showed unkindness towards his mother, to whom he had always been very kind before. That was a year or ’more before this trouble. From that time up to the time, or within a few da3rs of the commission of this offence, there is very little evidence. One or two of 'his fellow workmen said that he acted queerly;] [6] that there were times when he would not speak, or speak very little for a day at a time, but no one ventured the opinion that he was insane or irresponsible. The fact is that he engaged in work all that year, except when he was idle for want of employment, and prosecuted the ordinary affairs of his life, and the witnesses who boarded with him said he was a very pleasant man. They made no allusion to his being out of his mind. I believe there were only one or two witnesses who said they thought he was ‘ a little off ’ at .times. However, you have all of that testimony.</p>

It is incumbent upon the defendant to show you that that condition of things existed in order to relieve him from the consequences of his action. You heard his testimony ; that on the Monday night preceding this killing having been thrown out of employment, he commenced to drink and that he drank that night very heavily; that on Tuesday morning he got up and left the house without eating his breakfast and commenced to drink again and continued to drink during that day; that he went to the house of Mrs. Buchanan in the morning and there made arrangements with her to go to the park in the afternoon and that they did go to the park but that he was so intoxicated that he did not know where he was; did not know how he got there; did not know whether he walked or rode; did not even know where he had met Mrs. Buchanan and Mrs. Johnston, and did not know anything at all until towards evening, when he found himself lying on a bench in the park with his head on Mrs. Buchanan’s lap; and after that, he took her home in the evening and then continued to drink; that he went to his room, buying a half pint of whisky before he went, which he drank in the morning, and then, after taking four or five drinks at one saloon and two or three at another, he went to Mrs. Buchanan’s house and this thing occurred. [He gave you a succinct statement of what he did up to the time of his going out to the kitchen, a few minutes before this shooting occurred.] [7] Then you have the testimony of the officers and the physicians at the hospital as to what he said when he regained consciousness after this thing did occur. The defend <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>ant says he did not know that the offence had been committed at all; that he had no knowledge of that occurrence. Now, though intoxication merely is nob an excuse for crime, if a man is so <em>intoxicated; </em>that is, if his mind is so thoroughly unhinged that he does not know what he is doing, it seems to me that that would excuse him entirely; he would have no responsibility whatever. It may be, however, that it may have less effect than that; that is, a man may still be responsible for his crime and not capable of the deliberation and premeditation necessary to constitute a willful intent, and you will have both of these things to determine. Upon that subject, I will read to you again from the same judge, though in a different case, in which he has given the law on this question very clearly. In this case, the question was whether or not a reasonable doubt of a man’s sanity would work an acquittal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[266,1155,1169,1122]]]'>“ So that you see that in the first place, it is the duty of a defendant relying upon insanity or intoxication to prove the fact that such condition existed at the time the offence was committed. As I have said, there is very little proof of insanity in this case, and you would scarcely find that there was a natural insanity existing of the degree necessary to acquit a man of crime, as described by the authority just read to you. [The question of intoxication depends almost wholly upon the testimony of the defendant himself. He tells you that he was entirely oblivious to everything that occurred during the time in which this killing was done though he knew before and after. He also says that he was entirely oblivious to what occurred during a part of the previous day. In addition to his evidence, one or two other witnesses testified that he acted queerly the night before the killing. They were the two men who boarded at the same house, and into whose room he went before going to bed. The commonwealth have met this by the testimony of Mrs. Johnston, who contradicts him as to his condition on Tuesday, and by that of three or four persons who saw him on Wednesday immediately before this occurrence, all of whom said that they saw no evidence of drunkenness or intoxication of any sort.] [8]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.6",492,[266,2285,1163,145]],["BL_493.1",493,[212,379,1168,906]]]'>“ The first question then for you to determine is: Is there evidence ? Are you satisfied ; not clearly but by the weight of evidence simply, because he is not bound to prove it except <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>by the weight of evidence; the fair preponderance of evidence; but it is his duty to establish the fact of intoxication or insanity by the weight of evidence. The burden of proof as to that is upon the defendant. Unless satisfied of that, then you rely upon the testimony of the commonwealth showing the crime as it has been detailed. But, as I have said, if you find that there is no evidence of intoxication at all; if you do not believe the testimony produced by the defendant as to his intoxication, then you would have to rely upon the testimony of the commonwealth throwing his out entirely. But if, to your minds, there is evidence of intoxication, then you are to determine whether or not that exonerates him wholly from the crime and relieves him from all responsibility, or whether it was such as only to affect the degree of the crime. And as to that, we again have an opinion by the same learned judge from whom I have read before. [Referring to Lewis, C. J.] It was partly read to you by the counsel for the defence, but I will read the whole of this section.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b493-3" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[211,1305,1168,1115]],["BL_494.1",494,[247,378,1165,709]]]'>“ Thus we must perceive, that at the bottom of all that has been said on the subject of murder in the first degree, is the frame of mind in which the deadly blow is given—that state of mind which enables the prisoner either to know and be fully conscious of his own purpose and act, or not to know. Why is insanity a defence to homicide ? Because it is a condition of the mind which renders it incapable of reasoning and judging correctly of its own impulses, and determining whether the impulse should be followed or resisted. Intelligence is not the only criterion, for it often exists in the madman in a high degree, making him shrewd, watchful, and capable of determining his purpose, and selecting the means of its accomplishment. Want of intelligence, therefore, is not the only defect to moderate the degree of offence; but with intelligence there may be an absence of power to determine properly the true nature and character of the act, its effect upon the subject, and the true responsibility of the actor; a power necessaiy to control the impulses of the mind, and prevent the execution of the thought which possesses it. In other words, it is the absence of that self-determining power, which in a sane mind renders it conscious of the real nature of its own purposes, and capable of resisting wrong impulses. When <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>this self-governing power is wanting, whether it is caused by insanity, gross intoxication or other controlling influence, it cannot be said truthfully that the mind is fully conscious of its own purposes, and deliberates or premeditates in the sense of the act describing murder in the first degree. We must, however, distinguish this defective frame of mind from that wickedness of heart which drives the murderer on to the commission of his crime, reckless of consequences. Evil passions do often seem to tear up reason by the root, and urge on to murder with heedless rage. But they are the outpourings of a wicked nature, not of an unsound or disabled mind. It became necessary, therefore, to inquire upon the evidence in this case, whether the prisoner was really able to deliberate and premeditate the homicide.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[244,1094,1172,1116]]]'>“ So, gentlemen of the jury, you will, in this case, take the evidence of the commonwealth showing that the homicide was committed, and the surrounding circumstances; then it is for you to determine, as I have said before, whether or not that act was done by the defendant. You will then find whether it was lawful or unlawful. If unlawful, it is presumed to be malicious, and presumed to be murder. If you find i't so, you will then determine whether or not the evidence of the commonwealth satisfies you that it was done under circumstances of deliberation and premeditation, and willfully. If so, and there was no excuse, he would be guilty of murder of the first degree. If you are not satisfied of the deliberation, premeditation and willfulness of the offence, then he would be guilty of murder of the second degree, unless you find that, at the time the act was committed, he was in a state of mental incapacity, produced either by natural causes affecting the mind, or by intoxication; and then you will consider the extent of that intoxication, if you believe any existed; whether it was such as to prevent him from knowing that he committed the act at all, or if it was such as prevented him from deliberating and premeditating upon this offence and forming the willful intent which is necessary to constitute murder of the first degree.”</p>

We see no reason to doubt the accuracy or impartiality of what was said. These comments were fair to the commonwealth and to the prisoner, and they were necessary to the proper submission of the case. The prisoner had made the facts which indicated his guilt and led to his conviction. The conclusions to be drawn from them were so clear and irresistible tha¡t any reference to them was an argument against him; but no undue prominence was given in the charge to the commonwealth’s testimony, and that in his favor, intended to excuse or lessen the degree of his crime,, was treated with entire fairness. The qualifications to the affirmative answers to the second and fifth points correctly stated the law, and it was eminently proper that they should have been made. They were in effect an instruction that mental incapacity is to be established by the weight of the evidence, and that an act is presumed to have been done sanely until the contrary appears by the evidence. These were explanations proper to be made in conneo<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>tion with the affirmance of the points. They did not tend to weaken the effect of statements of the law in the prisoner’s favor, to which he was entitled, but to make the points tell the whole truth and not a part of it only.
