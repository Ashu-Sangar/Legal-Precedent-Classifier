The sale was not delayed, nor were costs incurred that might have been avoided bj^ an earlier presentation of the claim. There was therefore no error in dismissing the exceptions and discharging the rule to set aside the appraisement. The questions presented by plaintiff’s exceptions have been sufficiently considered and properly disposed of in the opinion of the court below. For reasons there given the decree should not be disturbed.</p>
