After the suit was brought Bates made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Defendant denied that he had made any settlement of mutual accounts in 1884, but averred that he had made a settlement with the assignee by which it appeared that $103 was due to defendant.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[184,428,1165,1209]]]'>“ The defendant denies that there was a settlement or balance struck at this time and states that after the assignment was made he met the plaintiff’s assignee; that they went over their book accounts and that they were then settled for and balance of $103 and some cents remained due the defendant. Now, if that is true, if there was a settlement made, if these accounts were not settled at the time alleged by the plaintiff, but subsequently by the defendant and the assignee, why that would probably be an end to this case, if that amount had been adjusted between them. The defendant says there is nothing due from him whatsoever; that the accounts prior to the assign ment were adjusted with the assignee and nothing found due the plaintiff, but a balance of $103 was due him; that all the dealings that they had subsequent to the assignment were adjusted by settlements made between them and credits given upon the judgments and mortgages, I believe. If that is true there is an end to this case and the plaintiff cannot recover. If the book accounts existing at the time of the assignment were fully settled up by plaintiff’s assignee he was entitled to no other credits or accounts that the plaintiff may have had against the defendant or any other person. If the assignee fully settled up those accounts then there would be an end to this case, if you believe the defendant, and the plaintiff could also not recover.”</p>

The jury has found for the plaintiff as they well might do under the evidence, and of course we cannot disturb it. The only other question was as to the amendment. That this was properly allowed is too plain for argument. It consisted of nothing but adding the name of the plaintiff’s assignee for the benefit of creditors. As the title was really in the assignee the amendment was entirely proper and could be made at any stage of the proceedings. This is the very object of the amendment law.</p>
