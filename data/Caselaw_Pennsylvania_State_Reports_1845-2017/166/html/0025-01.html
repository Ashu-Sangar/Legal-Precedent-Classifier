It was provided in the lease that all repairs should be made by the tenant; and also that, if he should “ continue to occupy the said tenement after the expiration of the term, .... without entering into any other or further agreement, then the amount of rent, terms of payment and other covenants and agreements .... shall be continued as applicable to such further terms as the said parties may continue to occupy the relation of landlord and tenant.”</p>
