    <p class="summary" id="b470-6" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[229,587,1163,1317]]]'>“ Whether intentional or otherwise, the testatrix has used words which, under the uniform rulings of our court, confer an absolute estate in the first taker. Had the wdll read ‘ to Samuel P. Hiester ’ for life and after his decease to his ‘ heirs in fee simple,’ there could have been no serious contention as to the construction to be placed upon the devise. The added words ‘his then surviving’ heirs do not change the meaning to be given to the word ‘ heir,’ and may be treated as superfluous, as was done in Criswell’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/41/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="41 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="480073" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0288-01">41 Pa. 288</a>, where the devise was to testator’s son Joshua during his natural life and that of his present wife, etc., ‘ and it is further my will and desire that after the decease of my son Joshua and his present wife that the said tract of land descend to their heirs jointly and their heirs and assigns forever, or to such of them as may be living,’ the court holding that the addition by the testator of the words ‘ then living ’ to the word heirs was insufficient to cause the latter to give way; for superfluous or inconsistent words or doctrines in a will will not suffice to reduce the word ‘ heirs ’ or ‘ heirs of the body ’ to words of purchase. To the same effect is Appeal of Cockins and Harper Executors, <a href="/pa/111/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="111 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="545433" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0026-01">111 Pa. 26</a>, where the devise was ‘ to my three nieces, share and share alike, during their lives, and at their deaths to go to their heirs in equal amounts to all heirs living at the time of their deaths; ’ and it was held that the devisees took under the rule in Shelley’s case, the real estate in fee simple and the personal estate absolutely.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b470-7" data-blocks='[["BL_470.7",470,[230,1912,1163,245]]]'>“ There is no.distinction between the expressions ‘his then surviving heirs ’ and ‘ heirs then living,’ or ‘ heirs then living at the time of their deaths.’ In each case the word ‘ heirs ’ refers to those who under the intestate laws would inherit from the first taker qua heirs.</p>

The testatrix unquestionably intended the remainder-men to take through the tenant for life, and not directly from herself. Conceding that the testatrix intended to give Samuel P. Hiester but a life estate in the premises No. 32 East Airy street, yet having ascertained that she used the word ‘ heirs ’ in its technical sense we must apply the rule governing cases of this kind, although by so doing we defeat the particular intent of the testator.</p>
