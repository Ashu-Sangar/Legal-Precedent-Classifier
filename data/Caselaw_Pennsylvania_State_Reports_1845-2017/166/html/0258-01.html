After notifying the defendant of the time and place of meeting, etc., they proceeded to hear and consider the matters in dispute, and thereupon found that there existed a valid cause of action on the part of the plaintiff against the defendant, owing to a breach of said contract by the latter, and further found and certified that there was due by him to plaintiff, in respect of said breach, the sum of $1,320.55. This action of the arbitrators is fully set forth in their award.

If there is, we have failed to discover it. Defendant does not deny that there were matters in dispute between himself and plaintiff in respect of the building contract; nor does he deny that after being duly notified of the meetings of the arbitrators, he stood aloof and refused to participate therein. No reason for this is even suggested, unless it be in the averment that he had received from plaintiff all that he was entitled to claim, except “a balance of $292.77 still due and justly owing from the plaintiff to the defendant,” etc. This is no excuse for refusing to appear before the arbitrators and make such answer as he had to plaintiff’s complaint. Having thus ignored the special tribunal which he assisted in creating and investing with full and exclusive authority, “ to determine all questions arising under ” the contract between plaintiff and himself, he is not in a position to raise questions which he might have presented to the arbitrators, or to re-open, in this action on their award, questions upon which they were authorized to pass and did in fact determine in making up their award. According to the terms of the submission, the arbitrators were to determine all questions arising under the building contract; no action could be maintained by either party finally alleged breach of the contract until a cause of action was certified by the arbitrators, and if, as was done in this case, <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>they certified “ the amount due in respect of such breach,” their no action could be maintained “except for the amount or sum so certified.”</p>

In Hartupee v. Pittsburg, supra, the plaintiff was nonsuited on the ground that his only remedy under the contract was on an award by the defendant’s mechanical engineer who was final arbiter of any dispute under the contract in question, and no such award had been made.</p>
