Plaintiff assigned one half of his interest in the patent to defendant. He alleged that the consideration for the transfer was a promise on part of defend<a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>ant to divide with him all profits made by the sale of the device, and also all damages which might be recovered from people who infringed the patent. On Nov. 18, 1892, plaintiff and defendant applied for a re-issue of the patent. The application was rejected Dec. 12,1892, on the ground of unreasonable delay, and also upon the further ground that the new claims asked for had been substantially anticipated by other patents. Defendant claimed that the article which was manufactured was different in its parts and in its arrangements from the article covered by the patent, and that it was a distinct and independent invention.</p>

    <p id="b312-7" data-blocks='[["BL_312.14",312,[258,1030,1165,957]]]'>This case depended mainly on questions of fact which were fairly submitted to the jury with instructions which appear to have been substantially correct and adequate. The only subjects of complaint are the affirmance of plaintiff’s second and fourth points, for charge, recited in the first two specifications, and the refusal of the court to affirm defendant’s fifth and sixth points recited in the two remaining specifications. There is nothing in the record that would justify us in' sustaining either of the specifications of error. The points recited therein were each correctly answered. As embodied in his sixth point, the contention of defendant, that “ the joint action of the parties in surrendering the patent in question and applying for a re-issue thereof .... amounted to a cancellation of the patent,” etc., is untenable. Section 4916 of the Revised Code provides that “such surrender shall take effect upon the issue of the amended patent.” The alleged surrender therefore never became effective, because the re-issue which the parties applied for was refused. The case appears to have been carefully and correctly tried, and we think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>
