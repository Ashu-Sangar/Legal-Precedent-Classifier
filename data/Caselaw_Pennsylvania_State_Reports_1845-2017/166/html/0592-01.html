The preamble of the lease recited that it was “ for the purpose of more conveniently transacting the business of the said company, and for the better accommodation of the public.” The lease of the land was for “so long as the same shall be used for railroad purposes.” The depot was subsequently abandoned, and the land upon which it stood was sold by the railroad company, and the lease assigned to the purchaser. The purchaser and his tenants used the property merely as a private siding. <em>Held </em>(1) that the meaning of the lease was that the land should be used for public railroad purposes; (2) that when the land was used merely for a private siding, the lease thereupon ceased.</p>

The West Chester Railroad Compan3r, having leased its road to the West Chester &amp; Philadelphia Railroad Company, the depot of the latter company, erected'on Market street, about four squares distant from the Gay street' depot, has been used for receiving and landing passengers, as well as for the greater part of the freight business theretofore transacted at the Gay street depot. Ever since 1864, however, freight has been sent over the tracks of the railroad company into and from the car house. In 1881 the railroad company assigned and conveyed all their rights in the car house, including the Parker lease, to U. H. Painter. The evidence tended to show that in recent years the tracks on the land in controversy had been used merely as private sidings.</p>

The law requires all writings to be construed by the court, and it is the duty of the jury to take from the court the construction it puts upon a written paper. The testimony of witnesses is always harmonized and construed by the jury. The foundation, therefore, of the title of the defendants to this strip of ground, lies in this written lease. You will notice by the preamble to the lease that the “ West Chester Railroad Company, of the county of Chester, Pennsylvania, is now engaged in altering and improving the railroad depot fronting on Gay st eet, in the borough of West Chester county and state aforesaid, for the purpose of more conveniently transacting the business of the said compai'y, and for the better accommodation of the public.” That is the preamble to the lease. That is to sa3r, the railroad company found itself hampered for want of room for the purpose of transacting its public business. A railroad company is a public corporation. A railroad is one of the highways of the state. It is .operated by a coi’poration, but still it is a state institution. It is ci’eated for the purpose of accommodating the public, not for the accommodation of individuals. Every person has a right to travel over a public highway. Every individual has a right to travel on a railroad, subject only to <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>certain reasonable regulations, such as behaving himself well, paying the toll, or paying a regular freight, in which there is to be no discrimination; all are to be treated alike. Now, it seems for the purpose of conducting this public business, this railroad company found it necessary to enlarge its depot. When we come to look to the title of the railroad company for the ground upon which its depot stands, we find it was acquired by grant and not by public condemnation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[182,815,1182,1631]],["BL_620.1",620,[262,397,1174,609]]]'>“It bought, like an individual, the ground upon which it built its depot. It was, therefore, the owner in fee of that improvement, and could sell it whenever in the judgment of the board of directors the exigencies of the case required. It did not require the intervention of the commonwealth to divest it of the title which it had to that piece of ground. It had bought it and it could sell it. [And when it once did exercise that right and sell the land upon which its depot stands, without inserting in the deed any restriction, or without preserving its right to use it as a depot, the right to use that as a depot at once ceased, and ceased forever. When, therefore, the depot was no longer to be used for the accommodation of the public, for the carrying of freight or for the transporting of passengers, the condition contained in this lease was broken.] [6] For you will observe that in order to enlarge its depot it was necessary to go over on the land of a neighbor, and in order to get the right to build upon that land it leased this little strip of ground now in question. That lease was perpetual, so long as the depot was used for railroad purposes. It was perpetual, upon two conditions, one that 125.00 a year rent should be paid, and the other that the land should be used for railroad purposes. Whenever, therefore, the railroad or its lessees, persons holding under it, should cease to pay the rent, or should cease to use the land for railroad purposes, the condition upon which the lease was made was ended, and the lease terminated, and the landlord would have a right to recover possession. Now that is a brief statement of the facts as they are before you, and the only difficulty in the case is the proper construction to be put upon the words in this lease ‘ for railroad purposes.’ You will notice, after you get down from the preamble, and after we read the description of the propert3r leased, these words: ‘ That the said John J. Parker, for the consideration <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>hereinafter mentioned, has demised and leased by these presents, and by these presents doth demise and lease, unto the West Chester Railroad Company above named, and its assigns, so long as the same shall be used for railroad purposes, the following described tract of land.’ You will observe it is in the lease, ‘ so long as the same shall be used for railroad purposes,’ and the preamble says they were to be public railroad purposes, not private. [The preamble says : ‘ For the accommodation of the public it became necessary to enlarge the depot,’ and the lease shows that the land was leased for the purpose of carrjdng out that design, and that the lease was to continue so long as the land was used for railroad purposes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[259,1013,1178,812]]]'>“Now, gentlemen, I construe that to mean, so long as the land was used for public railroad purposes.] [7] I do not hold that it was necessary that it should be used as fully as it was at that time. I do not hold they were bound to build a larger depot if it became necessary, nor do I hold that they could not reduce their depot if the business did not require it as large as it was then. But I do hold that this land was to be occupied, at least partly, by a railroad depot, and not by an individual proprietor who intended to use it as a storage house or for some other purpose, or who intended only to use the railroad so far as it accommodated his individual ownership or rights in the property. [And holding, therefore, that the kind of use for railroad purposes that the defendant was bound to observe was a public railroad and not a private one, I hold that the defendants here, if you find that it is not a public depot, have no title, and the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.] [8]</p>

They have got to ask privilege before they can get in there. They are trespassers if they go in without privilege. There is no means by which small parcels of freight can be transmitted; there are no agents to receive them, no bills of lading to be given for them, there is nobody to receipt for the freight or to take down from whom <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>it comes or to whom it is to be transmitted. The only railroad use to which the land now seems to be subjected is the entry of cars at the will of the owner of the land, or to bring in cars freighted with his own merchandise. It does not seem to be used as a general railway freight or passenger station. I do not hold that it was necessary to maintain a passenger depot there. I think under a liberal construction of this lease the railroad companjq if it continued to own the land, could have established a freight station there, and that would be within the meaning of the lease. But they certainly could not stop both, sell the land and divest themselves of all title, and the landlord still be compelled to receive the rent and allow them to use his land. He had the right when he leased either to sell them the land or lease it to them. For some good purpose the landlord saw proper to keep the title to his land, and he leased it. For some proper purpose the railroad company saw proper to exercise that right and merely lease and not buy. They could have condemned the land if they had seen proper ; perhaps they could have compelled him to let them have it for railroad purposes by paying the damages. But they got' together and agreed upon the lease, and the agreement was that the lease should last so long as the depot was used for railroad purposes.</p>

In affirming defendants’ fourth point he rightly charged in substance that the verdict must be for the defendant, “ unless the jury find that the property is no longer used for railroad purposes.” The verdict for plaintiff necessarily implies a finding in her favor of the controlling fact in the case, viz: that the property in controversy has ceased to be used “ for railroad purposes,” within the true intent and meaning of the lease of 1847, as construed by the court.
