At the common law a distress for rent could not be .made after the termination of the relation of landlord and tenant, which might happen by the death of either, and therefore the statute of <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>8 Anne, chap. 14 (1710), was passed, to give a remedy to the landlord, by enacting that his executor might distrain within six months after the termination of the lease, but <em>during the possession of the tenant from, whom such arrears became due. </em>These italicized words were omitted from our Pennsylvania statute of March 21,1772, which re-enacts the statute of Anne, probably because they were considered superfluous and merely declaratory of existing law: Clifford v. Beems, <a href="/watts/3/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 246" data-case-ids="1841251" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0246-01">3 Watts, 246</a>.

In Bradby on Distresses, 77, it is said that as a distress is in the nature of a remedy upon the land, if the tenant be dead the goods of the deceased remaining thereon may be distrained in the hands of his executor or administrator for rent accruing before and after his death. For this the author cites Bolton v. Canham, executor, Pollexfen, 125 (25 and 26 Car. II., A. D. 1675), which was not a proceeding on a distress, but an action against an executor for rent in arrear, and the dispute was over a question of priority in the distribution of the personal estate of a decedent. Another case cited by Bradby is Braithwaite v. Cooksey, 1 H. Blackstone, 465 (1790), decided <em>per curiam, </em>and without reasons assigned. On looking at the arguments in behalf of the successful landlords we find it based on three English statutes, neither of which, however, by express words or fair inference, confers a right on the landlord to distrain on the goods of a deceased tenant. Perhaps, however, the reason given by the court of appeals of New Jersey was the true reason of the old law. That court said that “ under the old law it was a mere struggle among the creditors for priority, and the law was indifferent who succeeded: ” Wood v. Hopkins, 1 Pennington, 692. In Turner v. Barnes, 2 Best &amp; Smith, 110 E. C. L. 435 (1862), Braithwaite v. Cooksey was declared not to fur<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>nish a precedent to be followed, and it was decided that when a tenant at will at a yearly rent died owing rent in arrear, and the day after his death the landlord distrained, the house being occupied by the lessee’s servants, the distress was unlawful. A modern English writer (Foa on Landlord and Tenant, on page 408) well expresses the law when he says that the right to distrain after the death of the tenant must be limited to the case in which the personal representative becomes tenant under the lease in his testator’s place, and the arrears distrained for have not actually fallen due until after the death.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[185,892,1174,650]]]'>“ The question has been considered and decided in two cases in this state, in the first of which, Hoskins'v. Houston, 2 Clark, 489 (1844), Judge Lewis, in the common pleas, held that a landlord has no right to distrain for rent after the death of the tenant. Judge Lewis’ opinion is an elaborate dissertation upon the law on this subject, and he comes to the conclusion that since our acts of 1772, 1794, and 1834, providing for the distribution of a decedent’s estate, no priority can be obtained by a distress levied after the death of a tenant. The other case is Stahlman’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Pitts%20L.J.%20113" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="26 Pitts L.J. 113">26 Pitts. L.

Scott, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 344" data-case-ids="1856223" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0344-01">4 W. &amp; S. 344</a>, that a landlord cannot dis-train goods which are in the custody of the law; and Judge Lowkie, in Mickle’s Admr. v. Miles, <a href="/grant/1/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Grant 320" data-case-ids="225778" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0320-01">1 Grant, 320</a>, said that the goods of a deceased lessee are not liable to distress. The act of February 24, 1834, which gives the landlord the second <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>preference in distribution would be neutralized if the landlord could by a distress obtain the first place as to goods on the demised premises. There would be no necessity for giving the landlord a second preference as to such goods if he could by a distraint obtain a priority over all other creditors. The insolvency of the deceased tenant makes no difference in the application of the law, which was intended principally for just such cases; for if the estate were solvent the preferences would not consume the estate before all the creditors were paid. In the language of Judge Woodward, in Moss’s Ap., <a href="/pa/35/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="35 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="990464" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0162-01">35 Pa. 162</a>, no attentive reader can doubt that the legislature meant to substitute the landlord’s claim on the proceeds of an execution or administration for his right of distress. As death brings administration, the same as judgment brings execution and levy, with their preferences and equalities, it is not in the power of parties to defeat the rights of creditors' which are vested in' them by law. Upon the death of a tenant his personal estate is placed at once in the grasp of the law, and no creditor can obtain any advantage over another, either by distraint, execution, or agreement.</p>

The contention, briefly stated, concerns the right of the legal representatives of a deceased lessor to distrain for rent due, the goods and chattels of his deceased lessee in the hands of the administrator of the latter. They base their claim of a right so to do upon the lease which created the relation of landlord and tenant between the decedents, and by its terms extended to their respective “heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns,” their respective rights and liabilities under it. The right of distress as defined by the lease was exercisable on the nonpayment at maturity of any quarter’s rent, and included goods while on the premises and for thirty days after their removal therefrom. It is undisputed that the goods replevied in this case were distrained by the legal representatives of the lessor while in the custody and under the control of the administrator of the lessee, and the question to be decided is whether the distress was authorized by the provisions of the lease to which reference has been made. The distrainors have not brought to our notice any decision of this court which directly sustains their claim nor do we know of any. They have cited Gratz v. Bayard, 11 S. &amp; R. 41; Laughlin v. Lorenz, <a href="/pa/48/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="48 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="422226" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0275-01">48 Pa. 275</a>, and Leaf’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="105 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="454273" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0505-01">105 Pa. 505</a>, as analogous in principle to the case at bar. In the first case cited, it was held that by express agreement a partnership may continue after the death of one of the partners, and further, that upon the assignment by the survivor of the firm effects for the benefit of creditors, the whole partnership fund including what was contributed thereto by the deceased partner’s estate, passed to the assignee and was applicable to the partnership debts. Laughlin v. Lorenz decided that the legal representatives of a deceased partner may carry on the business for, and bind the estate, where a covenant to that effect existed in the articles of copartnership, or he directed by will that it should be done. Leaf’s Appeal recognized the validity of a stipulation in the copartnership articles for the continuance of the firm after the death of a member, and enforced the principle that during the continuance of it real estate constituting a part of the partnership fund must be regarded as personalty, subject, however, to the qualification that one partner cannot dispose of the firm interest in it, unless specially author<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>ized to do so. These cases acknowledge and sustain the power to create a partnership which may survive the death of one of its members. The exercise of the power may postpone the recovery by the estate of the deceased partner of a possible asset ascertainable on the dissolution of the partnership and the liquidation of its affairs, and it may perhaps, diminish the same, but such asset when recovered is on the footing of other assets of the estate, as regards distribution among creditors. It is believed therefore that the cases cited do not govern the case at bar, nor afford material assistance, in the decision of the question involved in it. The distrainors had no lien on the goods, for rent, in the lifetime of the decedent, and at his death they passed to his administrator as other assets of the estate did. His custody of them was lawful, and for the purposes of administration. It was his duty to apply them to the payment Of the decedent’s debts in the order prescribed by the statute. In this order, funeral expenses, medicine furnished and medical attendance given during the last illness of the decedent, and servants’ wages not exceeding one year, constitute the first class and have precedence; rents not exceeding one year form the second class, and all other debts belong to the third class, “ except debts due to the commonwealth which shall be last paid.” It is possible that the order thus prescribed may be qualified as to assets on which there are liens acquired in the lifetime of the decedent, but as no liens of this character appear in the case before us, the qualification suggested does not require present consideration. Our conclusion is, that the distress of which this litigation is the outcome was not warranted by the lease, and was in plain violation of the laws governing the administration and distribution of .the estates of decedents.</p>
