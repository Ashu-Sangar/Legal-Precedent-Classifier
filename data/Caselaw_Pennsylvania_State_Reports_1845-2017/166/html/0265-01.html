The extra ten per cent was to be refunded to Matchette when the company had received $5,000. On April 27, 1893, Matchette executed an assignment in writing of all bis rights in the contract of April 20, 1893, to J. H. Dilworth &amp; <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>Co. Arthur Colburn, the defendant, was the surety of J. II.

The affidavit further averred that defendant objected to a settlement between the parties on any other basis, as soon as lie learned that they were settling on a different basis, and .that prior settlements could not be used against him as an interpretation of the contract.</p>

The construction now contended for by defendant was an after-thought, unwarranted by the language employed in the agreement. There was therefore no error in sustaining the construction contended for by plaintiff, and entering judgment in his favor for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</p>
