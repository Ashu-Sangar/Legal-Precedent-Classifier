Hayes a portion (18 feet <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>front) of this lot. The bargain was not then concluded because Hayes said there were parties who would want to occupy rooms if they would erect a building properly (the post office and secret societies) and that he would look it up. When he returned he proposed that we build one building together, alike in every particular, building material, windows, style of architecture and everything, and that the societies would take the third story if it was all in one room. Baldwin replied that he could not accommodate them on his side without limiting his own space for business, unless they put in but one stairway, and on his (Hayes) side. Hayes then said that if Baldwin would deed him 20 feet he would put in the stairway for the use of the whole building, that it would be for the benefit of themselves and the tenants they would have in common and in that way the post office could be accommodated on his, Baldwin’s side. This proposition was agreed to; they prepared their own plans, and the building was commenced the last of April or first of May, 1872, and finished in the fall of that year.</p>

Campbell et al., <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Pa.%20252" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="32 Pa. 252">32 Pa. 252</a>: ‘ The administration of both legal and equitable principles through the medium of legal forms, which has so long prevailed in this state, has given rise to some mistaken impres-. sions. There are not a few cases in which, in a common law proceeding, a plaintiff sets up a simple equity; and with equal frequency an equity is the sole defence. The principle, however, does not change because it is applied in a strange forum and in a new form of proceeding. It has sometimes been thought that, when an equitable case is to be adjudicated in a tribunal composed of both a judge and a jury, the latter are to determine what the equities between the parties are. This is a mistake. The judge alone is the chancellor. It is in his discretion whether he will send an issue to a jurjn And if he does, their verdict is only advisory. It is not conclusive upon him. Whenever, therefore, upon the trial of an ejectment, founded upon an equitable title, the court is of opinion that the facts proved do not make out a case in which a chancellor would decree a conveyance, it is their duty to give binding instructions to that effect to the jury. The responsibility belongs to the judge, -and he may not throw it off upon those whose only duty is to aid him in ascertaining disputed facts.’</p>

But the conscience of the judge as chan-, cellor must be satisfied of the sufficiency of evidence if believed. If it be too vague, uncertain or doubtful to establish the equity set up, it is his duty to withdraw it .from the jury by a non-suit or a binding instruction in his charge, as the case may require.’</p>
