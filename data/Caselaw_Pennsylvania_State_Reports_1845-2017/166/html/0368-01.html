In the meantime plaintiff made an examination of the record to ascertain the description of the property and to learn who was the owner, and found that the title was in defendants. He then prepared an agreement, which he gave to Atkinson to have defendants sign. This agreement is like the one which is Exhibit A to the bill, except that it did not contain the words and figures in brackets in the eighteenth line thereof, as printed, viz: ‘ (537 <em>4" </em>front and <em>53' 1" </em>deep),’ and it did contain the words ‘and a good and sufficient deed for said premises shall have been executed and tendered for delivery by said parties of the first part,’ which words are not in Exhibit A. A day or two after the plaintiff had given this agreement to Atkinson, Mr. Charles H. Downing, a member of the bar, with William E. Cunningham, came into the plaintiff’s office, having this agreement with them. Mr. Downing objected to the words relating to the tender of a deed by defendants, last quoted, and plaintiff assented that they should be stricken out, and it was done. Mr. Downing also insisted that the size of the lots be inserted and with a pencil he wrote the words ‘ 53' <em>4" </em>front and 53' 7// deep,’ in one of the blank spaces of the paper, and indicated to Mr. Everitt, the plaintiff’s clerk, where words should be inserted in the new written agreement, which the plaintiff had instructed him to prepare.</p>

When he subsequently signed the agreement he had an opportunity, and it <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>was his duty, to read it. The referee finds no evidence of fraud on which the agreement could be reformed, and, indeed, though so much was made of it in the evidence, the bill does not pray for its reformation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[262,582,1168,860]]]'>“ It is to be observed, however, that no mention was made in this conversation by any one of the projecting portion of lot No. 928. Mr. Everitt wrote the new agreement, conforming to the suggestions made by Mr. Downing, and took it to his office. It was there executed and acknowledged by the defendants, and on the next day Mr. Downing and one of the defendants brought it to the plaintiff’s office. He only looked at the paper to see that it was executed and acknowledged, and without reading it executed it and paid Mr. Downing the money and took his receipt for it. The paper then executed is Exhibit A to the bill and was retained by the plaintiff who procured it to be recorded. During all of this transaction Mr. Downing considered himself as representing the defendants, and the plaintiff certainly had a right to assume that he did. He also represented a building association, which held a mortgage of 16,000 on these lots, together with the lot on Darien street, which mortgage is still unsatisfied.</p>

In this interview it was agreed that everything of a technical nature connected with the proceedings to be instituted to enforce the agreement should be waived.

The plaintiff stated that at that late hour he did not have the purchase money to pay, but refused further to consummate the transaction because of the mortgage upon the property and because the description did not conform to the agreement. The defendants offered to have the incumbrance removed at the time of the settlement, if he would accept the deed as they had tendered it, and offered to meet him the next day or any reasonable time to make settlement. The plaintiff declined and stated to them that he was ready to make settlement at any time that they tendered a deed with proper description.

The subject of the contract was ‘ all that certain lot . . known as Nos. 928, 930 and 932 North Eighth street,’ and the proof is that the entire lot as claimed by the plaintiff was occupied as one lot and used for one purpose without any fence separating the piece of ground in dispute from the rest of the lot, and that the deed by which the defendants obtained title conveyed the entire lot by metes and bounds, as one tract, and described it as ‘being premises No. 928 North Eighth street.’ In view of these facts and the wording of the whole contract do the words, 53' <em>4" </em>front and 53' <em>7" </em>deep, manifest an intent to convey a rectangular lot of these dimensions rather than the whole lot as occupied by the defendants and described in the deed to them.</p>

The same result was reached by that method as was reached in the case of the land described by its occupancy, bjr showing just what land was occupied. The court was thus made acquainted with the subject-matter about which the parties were contracting, and enabled to fit the contract to the subject-matter. The court in Flanigen v. The City, ut <a href="/mo/48/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="48 Mo. 325" data-case-ids="8851572" data-case-paths="/mo/48/0325-01">supra,</a> had said the same may be done with reference to a lot in this city, and it seems to follow as an irresistible conclusion that if the contract in this case had only described the lot as No. 928 North Eighth street, without adding the front and depth, the whole lot, as it was occupied, would have been included in the description.</p>

It is to be observed, however, that they are not strictly repugnant to prior descriptions of the lot by its number. The lot is fifty-three feet four inches front and fifty-three feet seven inches deep. Its front and depth could not be otherwise truthfully described. These words and figures do not purport to describe the full dimensions of the lot to be conveyed, and therefore the referee is of opinion that they cannot be held to limit the clear meaning of the words ‘all that certain lot . . . known as No. 928,’ etc. If the contract had called for a lot situate three hundred and twenty-five feet north of Poplar street, having a front of fifty-three feet seven inches and a depth of fifty-three feet four inches, it would be clear that a rectangular lot of those dimensions was intended, but the use of the words ‘lot ... . known as No. 928,’ etc., makes a very different case. The defendants’ claim requires that these words (53' 4// front 53' <em>1" </em>deep) should be construed as equivalent to the words: ‘ having a front on said Eighth street of 53' 4' and extending west<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>ward between parallel lines at right angles with said Eighth street to a depth of fifty-three feet seven-inches.’ If the contract did contain these words it would manifesjb a clear intention of the parties to pass only the rectangular lot. Such a description would limit the former description of the full lot, but as the contract does not contain them it is not admissible to add them by construction. Construed as the referee suggests, every word of the contract has its full operation. The thing conveyed was the lots No. 928, 930, 932 North- Eighth street. The length of the front and depth lines are merely added by way of further description. Even if this description was false it would not affect the true description by the lot number, under the authority of the maxim above quoted from Dart on Vendors, <em>Falsa demonstratio non noeet.</em>
