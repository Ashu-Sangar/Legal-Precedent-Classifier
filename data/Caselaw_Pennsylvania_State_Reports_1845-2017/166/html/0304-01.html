In the event of the death of Charles without issue, his share was given to testator’s then surviving children and the issue of any deceased children, in the shares and proportions and for the estates they would have taken under the intestate law of Pennsylvania, if Charles had died seized in fee simple of such estate without any wife surviving. Charles had one child, Charles R., who executed a deed of trust of “one half part of the estate, real and personal, in which he (Charles R.) wall or may become entitled in case of his surviving the said father, Charles, under the provisions of the said will of his grandfather, the said George, deceased.” The trustee was to hold the estate in trust for Charles R. for life, and after his decease in trust for his children and issue, “and in default of lawful issue him surviving, then in trust to grant, convey, assign and pay the said trust estate and premises unto such person or persons as would have been entitled to the same under the will of the said George, deceased, and for such estates and interest and with and under the same powers, conditions and limitations, as far as subsisting and applicable, and with the same effect as if the said Charles R. had never been born.” Charles died without having validly exercised his power of appointment. Subsequently Charles R. died unmarried, and without lawful issue, but leaving a will by which he gave his estate to a stranger. <em>Held, </em>that upon the death of Charles R. the share covered by the deed of trust passed under the will of George to George’s then surviving children, and the issue of deceased children.</p>

Our examination of the record, with reference to the specifications of error, has failed to convince us that there is anything in either of them that requires a reversal or modification of the decree; nor do we think that either of the questions involved requires further elaboration. All that is necessary to be said in relation to any- of them will be found in the learned auditor’s report; and on it the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>
