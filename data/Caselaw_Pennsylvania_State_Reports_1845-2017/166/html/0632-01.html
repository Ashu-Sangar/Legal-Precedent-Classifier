The principle is familiar: See Painter v.

No doubt the commissioners directed that the dirt should not be thrown upon the grass, for this was a mere repetition of one provision in the contract; and thejr probably furnished boards upon which the dirt might be temporarily deposited, doing this as one witness said (p. 29) ‘ to protect the pavement,’ but this was in no sense an interference with the contractors’ control. In the ordinary course this dirt would be put upon the pavement, since it was forbidden to go upon the grass, and the commissioners simply recognized that fact when they took the proper steps to protect the pavement from injury. Even if this be regarded as acquiescence by the commissioners in the temporary use of the pavement, acquiescence is by no means control or direction, and in this instance it brought no liability upon the county. Certainly it could not be regarded as consent that the dirt should lie on the pavement after dark unguarded and unlighted, and these alone are the acts or omissions of which the plaintiff has a right to complain.</p>

If they thought it would be better they would give different directions. ... If anything did not suit them they would tell us in what way it didn’t suit them and then of course we changed it. . . . (p. 30) I remember their giving instructions once: I remember that we had to tear a part of it down ; ’ but obviously such testimony is of little value. What were the ‘certain things’ which did not suit? What kind of ‘directions ’ did the commissioners give ? What changes were made ? Was the tearing down of part the result of the commissioners’ caprice, or was it because the work was not properly done ? Nothing is said on these matters, and without much more light than the plaintiff saw proper to furnish it would be a mere guess to affirm such interference by the commissioners as made the county liable.</p>
