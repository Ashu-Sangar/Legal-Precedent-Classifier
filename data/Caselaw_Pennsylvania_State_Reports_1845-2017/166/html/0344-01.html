An examination of the record of deeds at any time after September 26, 1877, would have disclosed the conveyance by Bardsley to Gannon which was therefore notice to all the world of Gannon’s title. That title devolved upon the present plaintiff by virtue of the will made by Gannon October 3, 1880, and duly proved on October 27,1880. The plaintiff’s title was therefore disclosed by the record from the latter date. The defendant’s title was acquired by deed from White-side and Hall, trustees, dated March 7, 1890, at which time <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>plaintiff’s titlg had been nearly ten ¿tears of record, and with nothing showing any r(^oilve-/Snce from Gannon to Bardsley.</p>

There is no act of bad faith on the part of Gannon alleged in the offer. He was a mere grantee of the ground rents without consideration and subject to' an agreement to sell them for the exclusive use of Bardsley, according to the offer. The absence of consideration would be of no moment of itself, and, in point of fact, Gannon never sold the ground rents to any one. On the contrary it is a part of the offer of proof that Bardsley received the interest for his own use after the assignment. It was not proposed to prove that Gannon ever denied the alleged parol agreement or that he made any effort to prevent Bardsley from taking the rents, or that he ever asserted title in himself, lor did any act in contravention of the agreement offered in evidence. He simply continued to hold the title which Bardsley voluntarily gave him, until his death. As his death did not occur until nearly four years after the inception of his title, Bardsley had ample opportunity to assert, and secure, <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>his claim of title, during Gannon’s life, but it does not appear that he ever did so.

Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=83%20Pa.%20158" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="83 Pa. 158">83 Pa. 158</a>, we held that a promise to purchase real estate at a sheriff’s sale, and to convey it to the defendant in the execution, whenever he should repay to the purchasers their advances to him, does not raise a resulting trust in favor of the defendant. Strong, J., delivering the opinion, said: “ When the purchaser at a sheriff’s- sale promises to hold for the debtor, and afterwards refuses to comply with his agreement, the fraud, if any, is not. at the sale, not in the promise, but in its subsequent breach. That is too late. It is abundantly settled that equity will not decree such a purchaser to be a trustee, unless there is something more than the mere violation of a parol agreement. ... It may in all cases be assumed that when a promise is made to buy or hold for another, confidence is invited and more or less reposed. So it is in every parol contract for the purchase of lands; but the statute of frauds would be worse than waste paper if a breach of the promise created a trust in the promisor, which the contract itself was insufficient to raise.”</p>

Said Agnew, J., in an opinion reviewing the cases, “ The language of the cases rvas almost run into a formula in .which it is said, ‘ but Avhere there is nothing more in the transaction than is implied the violation of a parol agreement, equity will not decree the purchaser a trustee.’ ”</p>

A mere refusal to perform the trust is undoubtedly not enough, else the statute which requires a will of lands to be in writing would be altogether inoperative.”</p>
