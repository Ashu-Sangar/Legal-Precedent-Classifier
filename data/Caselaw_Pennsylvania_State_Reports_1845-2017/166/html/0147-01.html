The thought of the testator expressed in the last paragraph of the 19th section does not seem to have been to withdraw any of his real estate from the direction to sell, but to express his wish as to the time when the unimproved portions of it should be sold. He had already in the 18th section directed a conversion as soon as practicable, and in the first paragraph of the 19th section given a full and express power of sale. The authority to lease in the meantime would indicate a doubt on Lis part whether it would be practicable to sell all at once, and from it also would be inferred a discretion as to the time of sale. Having then expressly directed a sale of all as soon as practicable, and in the meantime authorized a leasing until sold, which applied only to the productive part, he expresses a wish as to his unproductive real estate. That wish, coupled with a direction, was that “ as soon as may be for the best interest of my estate ” the executors “ shall convert into money and productive securities all my unimproved real estate.” From this direction he excepted (1) portions specifically devised, (2) such <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>portions as in the opinion of the executors would be likely in the near future to enhance in value, (3) the eight acre lot in Pittsburg, (4) the real estate in Cook county, Illinois.</p>

The others are of unproductive real estate from the general direction “ to sell as soon as may be ” all of that class; and they were relegated to the other class, the productive real estate, which was to be sold when practicable under the authority conferred by section 18 and the first clause of section 19. The exception was not from the authority to sell but from the direction to sell.</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[214,949,1170,764]]]'>It is manifest that the testator had a clearly defined wish with regal'd to the time of the sale of his real estate, which he directed his executors to carry out. Having given a direction for the sale of all as soon as practicable, he directed a sale of the unimproved parts “ as soon as may be,” and from this last direction he excepts those parts which his executors might think would improve in the near future, and those which be was of opinion would improve, the Pittsburg and Chicago properties. These though unimproved were not to be sold under the specific direction as to that class, but to be retained by the executors with the productive real estate and sold when pi’acticable. The power of sale as to all remained in the executors, and we find in the will no evidence of an intention that their judgment as to the time of sale was to be controlled except by the direction which the testator gave.</p>
