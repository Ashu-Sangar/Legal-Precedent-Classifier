N. 41, where the Supreme Court say that Gross’s Estate had been a rule of property for so many years that they did not like to disturb it, and that if it operated unjustly and disappointed <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>the intention of testator, the remedy must be found in the legislature. In Diemer’s Est., 2 Dist. It. 543, and in other cases, the doctrine of Gross’s Estate has been applied by this court, but it will be observed that in all these cases the bequest was to collaterals and not to lineals, to brother’s or sister’s children, and not to the children or grandchildren of the testator, and therefore the question was not considered or passed upon, whether the rights of lineals, notwithstanding the bequest may be to them as a class, are not preserved by the act of April 8, 1833. This act provides that ‘ no devise or legacy in favor of a child or other lineal descendant of any testator shall be deemed or held to lapse or become void by reason of the death of such devisee or legatee in the lifetime of the testator, if such devisee or legatee shall leave issue,’ etc., but shall be good and available for the issue of such devisee or legatee. And the act of May 6, 1844, which extended the provisions of this act to brothers and sisters and their children, expressly provided that it was to apply only in cases where the testator left no lineal descendants. Thus is shown a clear intention to preserve the rights of lineal descendants to their ancestor’s property, whether the bequest was to them as a class or by name. Why should there be a difference in the result because one testator gives his estate to be divided equally among all his children, and another gives it to them by name; or why should a grandchild be excluded from participation in its grandfather’s estate because its father happened to die in his grandfather’s lifetime, while all the other grandchildren take their shares ? In a recent case in this court the testator left his whole estate to his wife for life, and after her death to be equally divided among his children. One of the children died in his lifetime and another during the life tenancy, both leaving children. If Gross’s Estate is to be followed in a case like this, one set of grandchildren take their parent’s share and the others take nothing, simply because their father happened to die a few months sooner than the father of their'cousins. Such a result is manifestly unjust and inequitable, and while we must follow' Gross’s Estate in cases like it, we do not feel obliged to do so in cases from which it can be distinguished. The act of legislature before referred to provides that ‘no’ devise or legacy to a lineal descendant in the case mentioned shall lapse, and makes no exception even where the gift is to a class.</p>
