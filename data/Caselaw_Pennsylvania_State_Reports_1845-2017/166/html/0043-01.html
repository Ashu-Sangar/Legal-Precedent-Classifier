In 1894, William Anderson, Alexander Stewart, James Little, Edward Werneberg and James S. Kidd, the trustees of the church, conveyed the lot to the corporation known as the United Presbyterian Church at Fleming Station. On June 25, 1894, the church presented a petition praying for leave to sell the lot to John S. Robb, Esq., for $1,200. William Teuteberg filed an answer to the petition in which he averred that the title to the <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>lot still remained in the original trustees under his deed, their successors and assigns : that the congregation of Fleming station had abandoned the lot, and had built a church on another lot, and were now trying to sell the original lot without any sufficient or legal title haying ever been given to them. He further averred that the trust was a special one for the use of the church worshiping in the building erected on the lot.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b69-3" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[249,753,829,42]]]'>The court below filed the following opinion :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b69-4" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[201,802,1168,912]]]'>“ The answer of William Teuteberg is evasive in this: He denies that the original trustees named in the deed from William Teuteberg had made a conveyance to the corporation, but the deed from himself makes the successors of the original trustees the persons who hold, that is, the acting trustees at any given time. It is not denied that the trustees who would have any power over the land at the time of conveyance made the conveyance to the corporation, as alleged in the petition. We are of the opinion that when William Teuteberg made his conveyance to the trustees and their successors for the sole use and behoof of the congregation, organized for the purpose of building on said lot and worshiping in said building, he parted with all his interest therein except as a member of the congregation. He has no interest affected by this provision; we are of the opinion that the proposed sale is within the proper power of the congregation and is for its interest in furtherance of the purposes of the deed.
