The sheriff, however, being under the impression that the mortgage was not divested by the sale,, did not appropriate any moneys to the Campbell mortgage, but appropriated this sum to the lien of A. J. Scott, upon which the execution was issued and sale made, although Scott’s lien was subsequent to that of Campbell.
