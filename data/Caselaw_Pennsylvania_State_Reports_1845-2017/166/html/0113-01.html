The manifest purpose was to give Mrs. Berg an absolute estate, but to protect her in its use from the influence of the husband during coverture. A trust was therefore necessary, the powers incident to ownership were suspended, and her beneficial use insured during that period.</p>

The idea of protection of a daughter’s share against the influence of her husband, out of which ‘ separate use trusts ’ arise, is veiy simple and common, and is so expressed here as to be within the understanding of the most ignorant.</p>
