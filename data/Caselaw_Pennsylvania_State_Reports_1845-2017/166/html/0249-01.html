An aunt of testator’s wife lived in his family and cared for the children during the life of both the testator and his wife, and after the death of the wife continued in charge of them. Testator was a Protestant, and there was evidence that he had requested the two friends who were to succeed his wife as guardians, to bring up his children in the Protestant faith. Testator’s wife was a Roman Catholic, and during her life the children were brought under Roman Catholic influences, and after her death remained so under the care of their aunt. The wife by her will appointed the aunt guardian of the children. The wife had no separate estate of her own. The evidence showed that the minors, who were eight, fourteen and sixteen years of age respectively, were happy in their relations with their aunt, and the oldest declared that she would not live with her guardians, and that she would not go to a Protestant school. <em>Held, </em>that, únder the circumstances, the custody of the children should be awarded to the aunt.</p>
