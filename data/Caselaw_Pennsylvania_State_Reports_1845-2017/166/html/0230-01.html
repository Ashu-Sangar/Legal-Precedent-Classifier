      <em>■ </em>By' an agreement in writing defendant and wife sold to plaintiffs all the stocks, fixtures, merchandise and good will now owned and conducted” at a certain store “ in the hair goods business and all the branches thereto appertaining.” Defendants further covenanted not to engage in the said business of “hair dealing, or any of the branches thereof, sold as aforesaid, within eight squares of said place of business.” Defendant subsequently opened a hair dressing establishment within two squares of then-former store. There was evidence that, at the time <em>the </em>contract was <em>made, </em>the business of a retail artificial hair store included ladies’ hair dressing and hair cutting. There was also evidence, and the master so. found, that hair dressing was a part of the business of the shop which was sold to plaintiff. The master found that the business was really owned by the husband, and that the wife was merely his agent. <em>Held, </em>that defendants should be restrained by injunction from conducting the business of ladies’ hair dressing in the new shop which they had opened.</p>

It was not incorporated in the written agreement, but was simply allowed by mutual understanding. Such waiver does not, in the master’s opinion, tend to render obscure or uncertain the rights reserved by the covenantees under the agreement. It is confined solely to the business done at that particular store, and as such it is clear and precise in its nature, the testimony of all the parties to the contract being singularly in accord with regard to it. The evidence in this respect, therefore, does not offend against the rule that the contract should be clear and distinct and established by satisfactory evidence.</p>

The case upon which such ruling was founded, however, is Turner v. Evans, 2 D. M. &amp; G., 740, where one who had contracted not to ‘ carry on ’ business within certain limits afterwards went about within those prescribed limits soliciting orders for his stand, situated outside the limits. Lord Cranworth, in declaring the breach too doubtful to warrant an injunction, expressed the opinion that in the case of a business which consists of keeping a store as distinguished, for instance, from a milk route, a man can only be said to ‘ carry it on ’ at his stand or place of business. The distinction between that case and this is that here a new stand or place of business was selected within the prescribed limits, and the very thing that was wanting to warrant the injunction <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>in that' case is thus supplied here. Moreover, the agreement here extended to the indirect as well as direct carrying on of the business, which would seem to cover this method of selling the goods of the Front street store. Nor does the sale of the goods at the Sixth street store come within the waiver or exception allowed to the business of the Front street store. Consequently the sale by sample constitutes in the present case a breach of the agreement.</p>
