L. 227, for taking an appeal to the Supreme Court for the purpose of delay, will be imposed where it appears that, after verdict and judgment, defendant offered to settle for an amount less than the judgment, and threatened to appeal if his offer was not accepted; that, after his offer was declined, he took the record of the case out of the common pleas, but never filed it in the Supreme Court, that he never printed any paper-book and made no apparent effort to prepare the case for argument.</p>

Plaintiff further averred “ that, notwithstanding defendant’s affidavit, said cause was appealed to this court solely and entirely for the purpose of delaying plaintiff in recovering the amount justly due him. In support of <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>said allegation plaintiff is informed by his counsel, and believes and so avers that the record of said suit, although taken out of the court of common pleas by defendant, has never been filed of record in the Supreme Court. Defendant is therefore unable to set out the exceptions taken or the reasons assigned by defendant for his appeal. That plaintiff is also informed by his counsel, believes and avers, that defendant has never printed any paper-book or made any effort to prepare the case for argument before your honorable court. That plaintiff’s counsel was present on the first day of the present term of court when the list was called and that notwithstanding the fact that defendant’s attorney had not served any paper-book on plaintiff’s counsel, defendant’s attorney answered argument on the call of the case. That since then and up to the time of the entry of the non pros., Jan. 23, 1895, no paper-book has been served on plaintiff’s counsel, nor has defendant’s attorney manifested any intention to argue the case when called. Plaintiff av.ers that this de^ has worked great hardship upon him, has caused his counsel to attend the several sittings of your honorable court, and in other ways has greatly embarrassed deponent.”</p>
