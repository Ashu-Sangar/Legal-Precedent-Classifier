    <p class="summary" id="b524-11" data-blocks='[["BL_524.16",524,[269,1526,1164,503]]]'>“My father died in our house September 5, 1892. I paid certain funeral expenses from my wife’s funds.

($44.36.) For the ninety meals furnished 25 cents was charged for each. Thirty-six horses were fed and twenty cents was charged for each feed. I paid Thomas Grier the carriage hire.

(Check for $100 indorsed by decedent and by witness, shown witness) : That is a check he gave on our disputed account.
