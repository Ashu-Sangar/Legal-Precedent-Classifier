The other exceptions we will not dispose of now, they may be submitted to the auditor for his consideration.’ The auditor has made his report, in which he has charged a portion of the expenses to each fund. The counsel for the assignee claims that no part of the expenses of administration should be charged against the proceeds of stock which had been levied on by the sheriff, because, by the agreement between the judgment creditors and the assignee, the proceeds were to be paid to the sheriff in satisfaction of his executions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[216,1154,1169,1160]]]'>“ In Kent’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="87 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1057817" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0165-01">87 Pa. 165</a>, the power of the assignee to make such assignment was recognized, but we find no case in which the question of the expenses of such transaction has been considered. The parties must have known that the sale of the goods would involve considerable expense, and when they speak of ‘ proceeds <em>’ </em>it may be assumed that they meant the amount of money produced, less the costs of sale. If there were no other fund it would scarcely be contended that under such an agreement the assignee would not have the right to retain his costs and expenses. There being another fund upon which the judgment creditors had no special claim cannot change the effect of the agreement. We doubt if the assignee could agree to impose the costs of selling the goods subject to lien upon the general fund. It would be unjust to take the fund applicable to general creditors to pay the costs of increasing the fund applicable to preferred creditors, though the general creditors might be incidentally benefited by paying those claims, and thus to a certain extent relieving the general fund. But the assignee in this case did not attempt to make such an agreement, and it certainly cannot be implied. We are therefore of the opinion that the fund derived from sale of goods should be charged with the expenses attending its administration.</p>

The appraisement of book accounts must have-taken but little time. Upon a careful examination of the items of expense which the auditor has charged to the stock accounts, we find but one item which is not clearly due to that part of the business. This is the allowance for counsel fee, $500. We think a fair proportion of this should be charged to the general fund, say $250. As the stock does not fully pay the first judgments, ‘and as they are entitled to pro rata with other creditors upon the general fund until paid, it makes no practical difference, but in order to make it accord with principle we charge that much to the general fund.</p>

These watchmen were first employed by the sheriff, and they remained some time after the agreement by which the goods were turned over to the assignee. The auditor allowed pay for ten daj's and surcharged the balance. In this we think he was right. But in this report he has made an <em>error. </em>In the first report he was dealing with a balance shown by the account. As these sums were improperly credited it could only be corrected by surcharging it, and thus increase the balance. In this report the auditor deals with funds as a whole, and deducts expenses to obtain a balance. In the matter of appraisers’ fees he credits the whole amount paid, and it would be proper to place the excess on the other side. But he has also surcharged $127.50 excess of watchmen’s pay, though he had taken it out of the costs, and $30.00 probate fee, to Schmidt, though it is not included in expenses, and $15.71 excess in commission, though he had alreadj'- eliminated this by allowing the proper amount as credit.
