    <p class="syllabus" id="b53-10" data-blocks='[["BL_53.10",53,[215,1712,1171,459]]]'>Testator by will devised real estate to a trustee in trust for his daughter Lydia to permit her “to occupy and enjoy the same for her separate use, not to be under the control or subject to the debts of her husband, but to enjoy all the rents, issues and profits during her natural life, and at her death to descend to the issue of her body; but if the said Lydia should die leaving no issue, then the said estate to revert back to and be a part of my residuary estate.” By a subsequent clause the trustee was authorized to surrender and assign the entire trust to the daughter if he should deem it advisable. Held, that the trust was an active one; that the testator contemplated a definite failure of issue; and that the children of Lydia took no title or interest in the estate until after her death.</p>

    <p id="b56-7" data-blocks='[["BL_56.8",56,[273,678,1164,1267]]]'>In the case of Wallace v. Denig, <a href="/pa/152/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="152 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="838180" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0251-01">152 Pa. 251</a>, we decided that the children of Lydia Wallace took no estate whatever in the land devised in trust for her separate use, until after her death and upon condition of surviving her. The daughter of Lydia Wallace having died during the life of her mother, the father claimed title to a life estate in the share of the daughter as her statutory heir. But we held that this claim could not be sustained under the will by which the land was devised. Paxson, C. J., said,, “ The trustee had the power, as before observed, to surrender the entire trust, and by this one act to put an end to the interest of any one else. It is not to the purpose that the trustee never exercised this power. The will speaks from the death of the testator and the power remained in the trustee up to the death of Lydia Wallace. The whole legal title was put in the trustee to preserve the estate for Lydia, and for such issue as she may leave surviving her at the time of her death, and in default of issue living at that time then to carry it back to the testator’s residuary estate.” This disposes of the present contention. During the life of his mother James S. Wallace had no estate whatever in this land and therefore nothing passed by the sale in bankruptcy which took place during the lifetime of the mother. His title which accrued at her death became subject to the lien of a judgment under which it was sold by the sheriff and passed to the defendant Savings Fund Association and this was the ruling of the court below.</p>
