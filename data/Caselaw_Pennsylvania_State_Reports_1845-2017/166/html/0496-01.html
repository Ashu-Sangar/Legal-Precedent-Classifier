The sale was made under an order of court giving plaintiff leave to sell the property as a whole or in part. The advertisement of sale was submitted to defendant’s counsel, and modified by them, and then published in its modified form. Real estate experts differed in their testimony as to the adequacy of the price realized by the sale. Exceptions to the confirmation of the sale were dismissed by the court.</p>
