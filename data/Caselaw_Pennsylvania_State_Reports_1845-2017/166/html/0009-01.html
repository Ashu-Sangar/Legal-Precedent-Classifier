Finally defendant, as he testified, said to plaintiff: “ If you will not sell me flour I will sell you some. I will sell you all the flour you want at $4.00.

Now I believe the letter in evidence would require the flour to be delivered in Pitts-burg. Take this then as the place of delivery. The time would be every day after the day of notice to begin shipment, and that would take; say fifty days, that is week days, or very nearly two months altogether, and that would run until the middle of October. Now during that time, from the middle of August to the middle of October, flpur fluctuated, sometimes selling at $4.45, sometimes at $4.60, and sometimes at $4.65, and some said at $4.70.</p>

If at the time of the sale the existence of a subcontract is made known to the seller, the buyer, on the seller’s default in delivering the goods, has two courses open to him : (1) He may elect to fulfill his subcontract, and for that purpose go into the market and purchase the best substitute obtainable, charging the seller with the difference between the contract price of the goods and the price of the goods substituted. (2) He may elect to abandon his subcontract, and in that case he may recover as damages against the seller, his loss of profits on the subsale, and any penalties he may be liable to pay, for breach of his subcontract. ... If at the time of the sale the existence of a subcontract is not made known to the seller, a knowledge on his part that the buyer is purchasing with the general intention to resell, or notice of the subcontract given to him subsequent to the date of the contract, will not render him liable for the buyer’s loss of profits on such subcontract; the buyer may either procure the best substitute for the goods as before, and fulfill his subcontract, charging the seller with the difference in price, or abandon his subcontract and bring his action for damages, when the ordinary rule, it would seem, will apply, and the jury must estimate, as well as they can, the difference between the contract price <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>and the market value of the goods, although there is no market price in the sense that there is no place where the buyer can readily procure the goods contracted for.

Value and price are, therefore, not synonymous, or the necessary equivalents of each other, though commonly market value and market price are legal equivalents.” Citing the rule as stated in Sedgwick on Damages, 4th. ed. 260, that the true measure of damages in such cases is the difference between the contract <em>price </em>and the market <em>value,, </em>and “ that this is the plaintiff’s real loss, and that, with this sum, he can go into the market and supply himself with the same article from another vendor,” the opinion further proceeds, quoting from Smethurst v. Woolston, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20109" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 109">5 W. &amp; S. 109</a>, “The <em>value </em>of the article at or about the time it is to be delivered, is the measure of damages, in a suit by the vendee against the vendor for a breach of the contract. ... It is therefore proper to inquire into the true legal idea of damages in order to determine the proper definition of the term value. Except in those cases where oppression, fraud, malice <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>or negligence enter into the question, ‘the declared object (says Mr. Sedgwick in his work on Damages) is to give <em>compensation </em>to the party injured for the actual loss sustained,’ 4th ed., pp. 28, 29, also pp. 36, 37. Among the many authorities he gives he quotes the language of C. J. Shippen, in Bussey v. Donaldson, 4 Dallas, 206, ‘as to the assessment of damages (said he), it is a rational and legal principle, that the compensation should be equivalent to the injury.’ ‘ The rule,’ said C. J. Gibson, ‘ is to give actual compensation, by graduating the amount of the damages, exactly to the extent of the loss: ’ Forsyth v. Palmer, 2 Harris, 97. Thus compensation being the true purpose of the law, it is obvious that the means empkyed, in other words, the evidence to ascertain compensation, must be such as truly reaches this end. It is equally obvious, when we consider its true nature, that, as evidence, the market price of an article is only a means of arriving at compensation; it is not itself the value of the article, but is the evidence of value. The law adopts it as a natural inference of fact, but not as a conclusive legal presumption. . . . But to assert that the price asked in the market is the true and only test of value, is to abandon the proper object of damages, viz., compensation, in all those cases where the market evidently does not afford the true measure of value.”</p>

Then comes the question whether this defendant, in obtaining these goods from other people, did lessen his damages, whether he made them any less than the difference between the price agreed upon in the contract and the market price at the date of the breach. ... If you find for the plaintiffs you will find for this amount, $151. If, on the other hand, you find for the defendant, you will give him a certificate of the amount that he actually paid out, that is the difference between the alleged contract price and the market value of that amountj 340 tons of cork, on the day of the breach of the contract, unless you find from the evidence that what he bought cost him less than that, in which case you will find for the lesser sum.” This ruling was affirmed by this court in a per curiam opinion in which we said we found no error on the part of the court.</p>
    <p id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.5",43,[179,1710,1170,503]]]'>And the ruling was manifestly correct, because, while it is true that the ordinary rule of damages in such cases would have entitled the defendant to recover the entire difference between the market value of the cork and the contract price, yet as the proof was t-hat he had supplied himself with cork at a less cost than the market price, he could recover only for his actual loss. This is in accord with all the authorities above cited and is perfectly sound law. The rule of actual compensation for the loss of the goods to be delivered, requires that the actual loss only should be allowed to be recovered..</p>

The case necessarily had to go to the jury on the main questions of the condition of the defendant at the time he signed the contract in suit, and whether it was a mere bantering proposition, never intended to be carried into execution; and the learned court below fairly and correctly left these questions to the jury. The verdict was against the defendant and after reading carefully the whole of the testimony, we feel constrained to say that we regard the verdict as against the weight of the evidence on this latter question. The case, in its circumstances, is very much like the case of Brown v.

On the contrary his partner, who was present, refused to become a party to such an act of drunken folly, but after that refusal the defendant did consciously and knowingly put his name to the paper, with a recklessness, and a silly disregard of consequences, which no doubt, he has bitterly regretted ever since.</p>

It was perfectly evident and was abundantly proved, that the defendant, who was a small retail dealer with limited means, was utterly unable to carry out such a contract, even if the flour could have been obtained in sufficient quantity, and was also unable, without a large advance in the price, to make deliveries at the rate of 400 barrels daily for fifty consecutive days. There is very grave reason to doubt <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>the correctness of the plaintiff’s statement that he immediately-called upon the defendant to perform the contract, in view of the defendant’s positive denial, and, what is more important, the continuance of their ordinary business relations and the customary purchases by the defendant from the plaintiff, of flour at the regular market rates which were considerably above four dollars per barrel. One of- the witnesses present, and entirely disinterested, testified that he heard and saw the whole transaction, that the defendant’s statement to the plaintiff that he would sell him the flour was made in a bantering, joking way,,and that his understanding was that the plaintiff regarded it as a joke.</p>
