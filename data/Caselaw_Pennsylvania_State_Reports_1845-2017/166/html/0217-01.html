A careful examination of these cases will show that they may be reduced to two classes, one in which the goods have been bailed to the defendant, with the right in him to purchase them during the continuance of the bailment or at its termination, and the other, in which the goods have been delivered to the defendant, under a contract of sale, and the seller has sought to retain a lien on them for the price. In the former, the goods are not subject to the levy during the existence of the'contract of bailment, nor until the title has actually vested in the bailee; in the latter they are subject to the levy so soon as they reach the possession of the purchaser, though no part of the price has been paid. The reason for the distinction is that, in a bailment, by the change of possession, no title to the goods passes, and the necessities of life require that bailments should be allowed and enforced; but where the possession of goods changes, under a contract which is essentially one of sale, the title does pass, though conditionally, and, as to an execution creditor of the buyer, will be held to have passed absolutely, and the seller will not be allowed to enforce the condition, as a lien for the price, because a secret lien on personal property is against public policy. The courts in determining whether or not the contract was one of bailment, or one of sale with an attempt to retain a lien for the price, have not considered what name the parties have given to the contract, but what was its essential character.”</p>

But there are exceptions; there are certain necessary and lawful contracts by which the owner parts with the possession, and yet fraud cannot be presumed. Such are the contracts of lending and hiring, both very useful, and without which society could not well exist; it is of the essence of these that the owner should give up the possession for a time. Such, too, are contracts by which an artisan or manufacturer has the possession of materials belonging to another, for the purpose of making them up or repairing them for the owner; no suspicion of fraud can fairly arise, where the transaction is in the usual course of business. But the case is very different where it is intended that the property should be apparently in one, while it is in fact in another; this is out of the usual course of business, unnecessarily and directly tending to the’ injury of those who are not in the secret.’</p>

He was to receive for manufacturing the paper the difference between what the rags were worth at the rate of five cents a pound, and what the paper would be worth at the rate of ten cents a pound. He took no risk of the market. Whether or not the transaction was a device to conceal a sale, was submitted to the jury. As appears (p. 218) the court below left it to the jury to say ‘ whether the rags of Humphreys were delivered to the paper-maker in sale or exchange for paper. In other words, were they to be paid for in paper, either by way of payment or as an exchange of commodities ? If so, then the creditor might attach the paper in question.’ The court further charged: ‘ But if the rags and shavings were delivered to the artisan in bags, with the name of Humphreys marked on them, to he worked.into paper for Humphreys, in such event, the identical paper made from these materials was not subject to attachment. . . . The creditors might have attached the debt or price of manufacturing the article in the hands of Humphreys, but cannot attach the article itself.’ The jury found for Humphreys, thus determining as a fact that a sale or an exchange was not intended.</p>

So far the transaction appears distinctly in the garb of a sale, at a profit of five per cent and a credit of six months. The plaintiff would doubtless have been willing to sell without stipulating for a re-sale, provided the purchaser had substituted <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>cash for it or satisfactory security. What had he principally in view ? Undoubtedly to part with the property at a given profit; to effect which required but an ordinary sale ; and the transaction certainly took that shape in the first instance, the ulterior arrangements having respect but to security for the price. Annexed to the principal contract was an accessory agreement, that the hides when tanned should be returned to the plaintiff and re-sold by him, and that the proceeds should be paid to the manufacturer, “ the price agreed upon for the hides,” as it was aptly but significantly called, together with five per cent for commission and guaranty being first deducted. Now, what was the purpose of all this ? Not to give the plaintiff the rise in the market, for he was to have no interest in it. If it were anything but security for the price of the raw material, what was it? Not to reserve a further profit in the shape of commission for re-sale and guarantee of solvency, for that was ostensibly to be but compensation for the risk and trouble. But why a commission for selling the plaintiff’s goads; and why a guarantee of solvency if the sale were not on account of the party to be secured by it? The very provision indicates not only that the sale was to be on account of the manufacturer, but that it would otherwise have been at his risk.’</p>

Had there been nothing of this kind in view, no one would have hesitated a moment in pronouncing the transaction a sale. The hides were charged, the debt or price to bear interest, and when leather was returned it was to be sold by the plaintiffs, charging commissions for sales and guaranty and expenses, and crediting the proceeds to the defendant’s account. It would be strange to hear of a man charging interest against his own goods, and more strange to charge commissions for sales and guaranties of sales of them.

In the former case, Wilson came into possession of the piano, under an agreement called a ‘lease,’ but which was actually an agreement of hiring, so that he was a bailee; and though hé had the right to purchase the piano, still that right did not convert the bailment into a sale; while, in the latter case, Russell had obtained possession of the billiard tables, under a written agreement, signed by the company, stating that he had ordered the tables of the company at a given price, to be paid in installments, the agreement further providing: ‘ payment to be secured by first lease- and fire insurance on said tables.’ The ‘ lease ’ was executed after Russell had come into actual possession of the tables, and was, as the agreement stated, made for the purpose of securing to the company the price for which the tables were sold. The Supreme Court therefore held that the tables were liable to execution on a judgment against Russell. In deciding the case the court said, p. 512: ‘ The feeble attempt to prove that the tables were delivered under the lease, and not under the contract, will not avail, for the reason among others, that the two papers must be regarded as one transaction. Taken together they amount to a sale of the billiard tables upon credit, accompanied with a lease thereof as a security for the payment, of the price. Such a contract, while good between the parties, will not keep creditors at bay. It is worthless as to them. There is no principle of law better settled in Pennsylvania than that a sale and delivery of personal property, with an agreement that the ownership shall remain in the vendor until the purchase-money is paid, enables creditors of the vendee to seize and sell the same for the payment of his debts. . . . There is not a single element of a bailment in this transaction. It is immaterial what the parties call it; the law pays little heed to the label; it looks beneath and examines the nature and character of the contract between the parties.’</p>

It is clear from this language that the ‘ refrigerating-machinery and plant ’ were to become an integral part of Leiling’s brewery.

The words ‘ construct and erect ’ are the usual words employed in a building contract, and we do not recall that it has ever been doubted that they are effective words of sale, to pass the title to the building materials, when erected, from the builder to the owner of the land. The words ‘ construct and erect ’ are used evidently in the present contracts with the same meaning as they are used in ordinary building contracts. Such words do not imply that a bailment is being created; neither do the words, ‘it is understood that the machinery and refrigerating plant stay the property of George F. Ott until fully paid for.’ The latter words rather signify an intention to preserve a lien for the price.</p>

He, however, very strenuously and very ably argued that the contract of March 12, 1890, created a bailment, as to the machinery delivered before and after that date. We, however, do not agree with him. The contract of March 12,1890, was simply an amplification of that of Sept. 21, 1889, but with no essential difference. It provided that Ott should ‘ erect ’ ‘ the refrigerating machinery and plant ’ at Leiling’s brewery, upon foundations and supports to be built and furnished by Leiling, ‘ready to be connected with steam and water connections, for the sum of $6,000, payable in instalments, Ott to take Leiling’s notes for part of the price and renew them, the title, ownership or possession of said machinery and plant ’ not to ‘ pass from said George F. Ott to said Lorenzo Leiling until all of the said payments have been paid in full,’ when, ‘ and not until then,’ the said George F. Ott will execute and deliver to said Lorenzo Leiling a bill of sale for said machinery and plant, the consideration whereof shall be the said $6,000, Leiling to keep the machinery and plant insured in the name of Ott in such companies as Ott shall determine, Ott to hold the policies ‘ until all the covenants of this agreement shall have been complied with,’ when they shall be assigned to Leiling; upon Leiling’s default in making payments or in keeping ‘any of his covenants,’ Ott to have the right to enter the premises and take away the machinery, sell the same at public or private sale, appropriate the proceeds to the contract price, Leiling to pay the deficiency, if any, and the agreement not to be ‘a con-<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>tract of sale.’ Though the agreement states that neither ‘ the title, ownership or possession of the said machinery’ should pass to Leiling, its actual possession did pass to him, and it became a part of the machinery used by him in his brewery. This last above-mentioned provision, and' that relating to the execution of a bill of sale, are merely the mode adopted to preserve the lien for the price. The provision for insurance was to insure Ott’s lien. The provision allówing Ott to enter and take away the machinery and to sell it, was to enforce his lien, and gives him no greater right, except the right to sell without notice to Leiling, than the contract of Sept. 21, 1889, for there is no other way in which the lien could be amicably enforced. Under either contract, if Leiling had refused to allow Ott to remove the machinery, the lien could have been enforced only by an action of replevin or by a bill in equity. The covenant requiring Leiling to pay any deficiency, between the contract price and the amount realized from a sale by Ott, after an entry and retaking possession of the machinery by him, for condition broken, is important in determining whether or not the transaction was a sale. If the machinery had been bailed there would have been no reason for covenanting that the title should not pass, for the goods being Ott’s he could have enforced his rights without a covenant. The provision that the agreement should not be considered a ‘ contract of sale,’ is of no effect, for the law ascertains the character of a contract, and we consider that both of the said agreements are contracts of sale. They are almost identical with that in Forrest v. Nelson, <a href="/pa/108/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="108 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="539268" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0481-01">108 Pa. 481</a>,. which this court and the Supreme Court held was a contract of sale. The said machinery, therefore, could not be claimed by Ott as against an execution creditor of Leiling, and the trial judge was right in charging the jury to find for the defendant in the issue.</p>
