The annuity was paid to Mrs. Schott until Daisy attained her majority, since which time, it being recognized by the trustees that the latter’s interest in the annuity ceased, she has been paid her legacy of $7,000. But if is now contended that Mrs. Schott’s interest in the annuity also ceased upon Daisy reaching lawful age, and she is therefore no longer entitled to it, although it is expressly directed to be paid to her ‘in equal quarterly payments .... during the. term of her natural life.’ But we cannot agree with this construction of the language of the will. And although the clause quoted is not skillfully prepared, we fail to discover that it admits of any ambiguity. In the first place, there is a clear and unequivocal gift of one eighth of the income to the extent of four hundred dollars per annum. And in the next place, in equally clear and express terms, it is directed to be paid to Mrs. Schott ‘ during the term of her natural life.’ Again, the object of the gift is stated to be for her maintenance and that of Daisy R. Schott as long as she remained a minor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[198,1964,1165,450]],["BL_306.1",306,[257,379,1161,1265]]]'>“ But it was to be applied in her discretion, and for which she was not called upon to account, unless she should be guilty of malversation.

Now, while it cannot be disputed that Daisy R. Schott having survived her minority is entitled to her legacy, where is there anjr expression in the will showing the intention of testatrix to be in that event Mrs. Schott shall no longer continue to receive her annuity? After a careful consideration of the clause of the will above quoted and all the provisions of the will, we are unable to ascer<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>tain any such intention. It is, however, thought to be shown by the expression used by testatrix in connection with the indication of her wish that Daisy be maintained also out of the annuity until she reached the age of 21 years, viz: ‘ and thereupon her interest in this annuity ceasing,’ she shall be paid the sum of $7,000. And that the pronoun <em>Tier </em>referred to Mrs. Schott, and not to Daisy. But this view is clearly in violation of the rule of grammatical construction; and the proper antecedent referred to is Daisy R. Schott, not Mrs. Rebecca Schott. The latter did not have any interest in the annuity. It was given to her absolutely for life. But Daisy had that which was recognized by testatrix as an ‘ interest ’ therein, viz : ‘ maintenance during her minority,’ and this interest in the annuity the testatrix undoubtedly intended to cease when Daisy reached her majority. The reason no doubt was that then she could be maintained by the income from her legacy and would no longer need for this purpose any portion of the annuity. That this is the proper conclusion we think is shown by the clause in the will immediately preceding the one in question. There testatrix gives a similar annuity to Mrs. Ridgely Schott to be applied by her, without the duty of accounting, to the maintenance and education of Charlotte Engles Schott, until she shall have reached the age of 21, and thereupon (this annuity ceasing) to pay to Charlotte Engles Schott $7,000, and Mrs. Ridgely Schott $2,000.</p>

Thus she was abundantly able to express her intention. And when in the next item of her will she gives an annuity, expressed in correct and technical language, for the life of the annuitant, charged with maintenance during minority only, and at the expiration of which bequeaths to the late minor a pecuniary legacy without in any way disturbing the annuity she had previously given, the natural conclusion is, such was her intention, and the annuitant was to receive her annuity during life, irrespective of the fact that the pecuniary legatee lived to be entitled to her legacy. And this construction is not to be affected by the fact that the income of the residuary legatee will be diminished. The latter cannot well complain, as by the will she is only <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>given the income from that which is left after the payments previously directed. Both pecuniary legacies and annuities are clearly to be preferred.</p>

After a careful analysis of the other provisions of the will, with the clause in question, we are confirmed in the view that Mrs. Schott is entitled to the annuity during her natural life. We do not remember that it was suggested at the argument, but we may suppose the contingency foreseen and provided for by testatrix had occurred, viz.: the death of Daisy in her minority. Would it then be doubted that Mrs. Schott is still entitled to the annuity? We think not. Then why, in the absence of any clear and explicit direction that it is to cease, upon Daisy attaining the age of 21 years, should the annuitant be deprived of the contribution towards her maintenance, intended by testatrix?</p>
