The act provides not only that illegitimate children shall take, and be known by the name of their mother, but they shall respectively have capacity to take or inherit from each other personal estate as next of kin, and real estate as heirs in fee simple; and, as respects said real or personal estate so taken and inherited, to transmit the same according to the intestate laws of this state. It will thus be observed, the act is general and comprehends all illegitimates, and makes no distinction between residents or non-residents within the state. If such had been the intention of the legislature, it certainly would not have been left the subject of conjecture nearly forty years. And in the absence of any such-expressed intention, it is not within the province of the courts to assume that the act was intended to apply to and include only illegitimate children living within the commonwealth. As we cannot so construe the act the award was properly made.</p>
