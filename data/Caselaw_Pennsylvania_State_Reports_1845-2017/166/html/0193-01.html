He might as well have said he shot to scare and did not intend to hit her, and that the injury was the result of a mistaken aim ; or that the difference between the line of fire and the line of sight in his pistol was responsible for the death of Lizzie Smith, and that he should, therefore, be relieved from the natural and probable consequences of his own voluntary act.</p>

Having made all things ready to leave Jumbo, and the time of his departure having arrived, he armed himself and then selected his position to await the appearance of her against whom, according to his own declarations, he had a grievance and with whom he wished to square accounts before he left; she appeared; he allowed her to walk a few feet past (him; then he deliberately, at close range, fired a shot into her back; she cried ‘I am shot;’ notwithstanding this cry he, as deliberately, fired a second shot, when she passed out of the range of his pistol; then he walks away, coolly reloading his pistol, and to one to whom in the morning he had said, ‘I will get her when she comes back; you watch me and see if I don’t get her,’ he says, ‘ I got her that time ; ’ he then immediately carries into execution his previously declared purpose to leave the place, and is not heard of until his presence is discovered in West Virgiuia, where he was arrested.</p>
