L. 374) was authorized to become a trustee, assignee, guardian, etc., became by appointment of the orphans’ court of Lebanon county, trustee of Eliza Palm, and as such trustee received certain moneys in trust for its cestui que trust.

It was deposited in the general fund of the bank and entered to the credit of the trustee on the books as a depositor,’ is the language of the only witness called. If the money of the cestui que trust had been invested in specific property or securities, although included with other moneys of the trustee, so that it could be followed into the specific property or security, and traced and earmarked by the claimant, he would undoubtedly be entitled to recover the full amount of his claim even as against other creditors, in the distribution of the estate of such trustee; nor could the right to recover his claim in full be disputed in a controversy between the bank if solvent, and the present trustee, but the bank has admitted its insolvency by an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and in a controversy where the rights of other creditors intervene, the party claiming a preference must follow the fund and earmark it, before he is entitled to a preference as against other creditors.”</p>
