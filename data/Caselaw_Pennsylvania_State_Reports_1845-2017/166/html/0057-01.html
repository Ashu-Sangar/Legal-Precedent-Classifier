That clause is merely declaratory of the common law of the state as recognized in Forbes Street, <a href="/pa/70/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="70 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1028215" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0125-01">70 Pa. 125</a>, and other cases. In that case it was held that damages could not be assessed for improvements made, within the lines of a located but unopened street, after approval of the plans of which the street in question was part; and this court said: “ The leading object of laying out the city district, which was intended finally to become a part of the city of Pitts-burg, was that the owners of ground within it should know what portion of their property would be taken for streets and other public purposes. The portions laid out for streets were to be deemed taken and adjudged as public highways. If buildings were erected on ground to be taken for streets of the first class, previously to the plan and survey, then they were to be paid for as well as the ground taken, when the streets were opened; but if built after the survey and plan, of which map or plan all the freeholders owning property in the said district had notice under the provisions of the sixth section of the act of June 16, 1836, then it is clear such buildings were not to be paid for, for otherwise the map or plan would be entirely nugatory.
