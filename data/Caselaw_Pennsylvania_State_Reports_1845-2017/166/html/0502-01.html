Moreover,'none of these exceptants, other than the Folsom Land Company, are “resident freeholders,” and it is doubtful whether, in view of this fact, they have any standing in court as exceptants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[204,1304,1166,135]]]'>The petitioners for exclusion are Charles Leedom, estate of Thomas T. Tasker, The Folsom Land Company, estate of William F. Simes and A. A. Hirst and others.</p>

Unless it is clearly shown that lands used exclusively for farming purposes do not properly belong to the town or village to be incorporated the court has no power to exclude them : Borough of Collingdale, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Del.%20Co.%20595" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Del.

    <p class="summary" id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[261,850,1165,605]]]'>“ Under a careful consideration of the testimony, and a view of the premises, the master is forced to the conclusion that it would not be' proper to exclude these several tracts of land from the proposed borough, especially in view of the fact that the grand jury, after a careful consideration of the matter, have recommended its incorporation as petitioned for. The action of the grand jury is not controlling upon the court, but it is to be taken as a very great assistance in determining disputed questions of facts. Although not conclusive, the action of the grand jury is not by any means to be disregarded as of little weight or importance to the court in reaching its judgment: Edgewood Borough, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20Pa.%20354" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="130 Pa. 354">130 Pa.

    <p class="summary" id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[262,1463,1165,195]]]'>“ The Leedom and Tasker tracts have, it is true, been used to a certain extent for farming or grazing purposes. The testimony does not satisfy the master that the Simes and Folsom Land Company tracts are used for farming purposes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.7",528,[261,1666,1165,604]]]'>“ The Leedom and Tasker tracts should become a part of the proposed borough because they are necessary to its symmetry, because they afford outlets to the creek, because they would shut off streets and give them dead ends, and because in the Leedom case the borough should have control at Darby creek in order to regulate nuisances alleged to exist there. If the Tasker tract were excluded it would become detached territory and shut off on all sides. On the east it would be bounded by lands of Norwood borough, on the west and north by lands included within the lines of the proposed borough and on the south by Darby creek, upon the other side of which is the township of Tinicum.</p>

As before stated, the testimony does not satisfy the master that this is used exclusively for farm land. If it were, <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>however, it should not be excluded because it is necessary to the street system of the borough and is undoubtedly necessary to its symmetry. Moreover if the Tasker property is to be included in the borough the exclusion of the Simes tract would leave it a piece of detached and isolated territory right in the centre of the borough.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b529-3" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[204,681,1170,651]]]'>“ The Folsom tract, as before stated, has not been shown to the satisfaction of the master to be used exclusively for farming purposes. Upon viewing it it is difficult to see how it could be farmed, that is, at least so far as tillage is concerned. It appears to have been used some for pasturage. It is detached from the main Folsom tract on the north by the Baltimore &amp; Phila. Railroad, and from the other part of the Folsom lands lying south of said railroad by Stone creek. If excluded it would cut off the Kedron avenue front for a considerable distance, and the borough would be deprived of the control of the avenue at that point. In view of all the facts touching this piece of land, the master is of the opinion that it should not be excluded.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[207,1350,1170,915]]]'>“ As to the Woodlawn tract it was urged that it did not properly belong to the proposed borough, and that between it and the village of Moores, farm lands intervened. The master is of opinion that this tract properly belongs within the limits of the proposed borough, and is necessary to its general symmetry. On its east is the Amosland road and beyond this road lies the borough of Norwood. It is separated from the upper portion of Ridley by the Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia Railroad, and on its south and west it is bounded by lands to be included within the limits of the proposed borough. It is argued that the territory on the south and west is farm land. The testimony shows however that this territory is laid out in building lots and streets, some of which are opened. If this tract were excluded the borough would to a considerable extent be deprived of the control of its streets in that section, and its general street system would be materially disarranged. It would also be hindered in making provision for proper access to Holmes station by the way of the Amosland road.</p>
