That is what the contract sajrs; but all the other people to the contract agree that as to Richard he was not to pay the $2.50 ; that he did chores about the house.] [3] [In fact there has not been a witness upon the stand but what admits that he did something. Even the plaintiff herself says so; and the washerwoman thought that she had a right, or at least thought that she was not transcending her power when she suggested to him that he might bring up coal. These things are straws which show which way the wind blows, and are proper to be considered by you in coming to a conclusion. That same good woman said that he complained when he had to answer the bell, which would seem to my mind to carry the idea that it was somewhat incumbent upon him to answer the door bell. This washerwoman, who was there as general house cleaner, testifies as to many other things; she says that when she went there in the mornings she would find the fires made ; she did not know who did it; the defendant says he did it and the plaintiff herself says that sometimes he did it. The other sisters who were living in the house say that he always did it, and that he acted the part of, perhaps, waitress and chambermaid around that house. It is for you to determine whether he has shown to you that that is what he did do, and that in consideration of those services he was not to pay any board. If you find that that is true, your verdict ought to be for the defendant.] [4] If you find it is not true, your verdict ought to be <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>for the plaintiff.
