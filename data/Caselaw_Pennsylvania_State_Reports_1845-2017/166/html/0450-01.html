Kline, high sheriff of said county, acknowledged and delivered to him a deed poll for said premises, which deed is recorded in said court in Sheriff’s Deed Book, “ I.,” page 161, etc. That sometime afterwards, the decedent, Francis Morgan, who was his brother, desired to purchase said property for the benefit of the children of a deceased sister, Mrs. Daniel Crowley, some of .whom were minors, and your affiant agreed to sell and convey said premises, but nothing was put in writing concerning the same. Subsequently, your affiant and said Francis Morgan, at the suggestion of the latter, called on C. Henry Stinson, Esq., a member of this bar, and the said Francis directed him to prepare a bond and mortgage of said premises to secure the sum of $5,000 with interest, which was to be executed by your <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>affiant, and also to prepare a deed for the same premises from your affiant to Daniel Crowley, father of said children aforesaid, the plan being, as your affiant understood it from said Francis, to have the title of said premises placed in said Daniel Crowley, under and subject to the lien of said mortgage, so that after the title was so vested in said Crowley, he, the said Francis, could foreclose said mortgage and compel a sale if occasion should demand it for the interest of said children.</p>
