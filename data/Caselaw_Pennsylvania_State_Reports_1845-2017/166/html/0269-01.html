To sustain this view of the law; it is only necessary to refer to the recent cases of Yaux’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/156/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="156 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="844935" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0194-01">156 Pa. 194</a>, and Gray’s Estate, <a href="/pa/147/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="147 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="829776" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0067-01">147 Pa. 67</a>, where this whole subject is fully considered. In the case now under consideration, the testator gave her residuary estate to four persons, to <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>be equally divided between them. One of them died in her lifetime, and her share lapsed. There was no provision for survivorship among the residuary legatees or gift over in case of the death of any of them, and therefore, under- the law as above stated, there was an intestacy as to this share.</p>

But the testatrix does not say this in her will, and, in the absence of any declaration upon her part, we cannot so conclude. While it is no doubt the fact that for the reason which she states she did not intend that this niece should share in her estate, jret it is also a fact that by reason of the death of one of the residuary legatees there is an intestacy as to one share of the residue of her estate, and this niece is the person entitled thereto.</p>

One of them did pre-decease her, and the court, rightly holding that there was a lapse as to that share, awarded the same to a niece who was entitled to take under the intestate law. This, as is clearly shown in the opinion of the orphans’ court, is' in accordance with the well settled law of this state, that, as to a lapsed devise or bequest contained in a residuary clause, the testator must be regarded as having died intestate. There is nothing in the will under consideration to take this case out of the general rule. For reasons given in the opinion referred to, the decree should not be disturbed.</p>
