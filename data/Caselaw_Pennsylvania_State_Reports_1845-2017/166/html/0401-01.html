We decided that the special law of March 12, 1869, P, L. 344, “ regulating the election of burgess and town council of the boroughs of Indiana and Brookville,” so far as the election of burgess was concerned, was repealed by the general law of May 23, 1893, P. L. 113. We held that the special repealing clause of the act of 1893 .was an express repeal of the act of 1869, with which it was so inconsistent that they could not stand together. The same repealing clause of the same'general law (act of 1893), is now invoked as having the same effect in this case upon the law which, prior to 1893, regulated the election of burgess of the borough of Bridgeport in the county of Montgomery. The points of difference are not identical with those appearing in the former case, but they are of the same character and are sufficiently inconsistent with the provisions of the former law in this case to bring it within the operation of the repealing clause of the act of 1893.</p>
