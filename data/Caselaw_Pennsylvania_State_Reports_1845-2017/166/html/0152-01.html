City of Pittsburg, involving about the same issue as this, asked leave to submit their paper-books without oral argument, as if the questions at issue were the same. To this the Court consented. Apparently, both parties assumed the judgment in that case would end this, and the decree was accordingly prepared, to be handed down at Pittsburg, at October Term. We were then informed by counsel for complainant that other questions were involved in this appeal, than those in Brooke v. Phila., on which they desired to be heard. In the meantime, the decision in the Philadelphia case had been handed down in June, at Harrisburg. We are now confronted with new and different questions to be answered before final decree. No exigency exists, calling for the assumption of original jurisdiction, in this case, as we were led to believe, when the paper-books were submitted at Philadelphia. The parties have opened their case here, on elaborate paper-books, in which are printed local statutes, ordinances and <em>assessments; </em>these involve the labor of a critical examination, before there can be an approach to deliberation and judgment. We are without the aid of the learning and thorough knowledge of the court below, as to local legislation, state and municipal, and without their enlightened judgment on the issue. Having assumed jurisdiction, however, we are impelled by a sense of duty to dispose of the case, but we desire it to be understood that if we had known there was no great necessity for a speedy decision, we would have remitted the parties, on their first application, to the appropriate tribunal, the court of common pleas, to file their bill, and then we would have heard the appeal, if one had been taken, on review, as in other eases.</p>

That, by the plain terms of the act, is to be deemed the valuation. That the system prescribed by the act is liable to abuse, in no way affects its legality. That the power thus conferred may be used to evade the constitutional restriction as to the limit of municipal indebtedness, is no reason why the courts should declare the valuation for county purposes is to be taken as the valuation of the taxable property of the city. Nor is there any proof here that this valuation was raised for any such unlawful purpose. The inference, from the fact that it is much higher than the valuation in previous years, is just as strong that the former valuations were absurdly low, as that this is much too high.</p>

It is entitled : “ An act providing for the classification of real estate for the purpose of taxation, and for the appointment of assessors in cities of the second class.” The subject announced is the classification of real estate. Where? In cities of the second class. For what purpose? For taxation. How? By the appointment of assessors. Then what is the obvious inference? The assessors are to assess. The very term implies particular duties with reference to the subject. It was not necessary to enumerate these duties in the title, because the title would suggest that the act itself would specify them. We are of opinion that the title does sufficiently express the purpose of the act.</p>

    <p id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[200,1416,1172,457]]]'>The authority to incur this debt, is derived wholly from the act of 1874. The forms to be observed, preliminary to the issuing of the obligations, have been somewhat modified by subsequent legislation, but the mandate concerning provision for payment, has not been changed. Could language be plainer than is used in the second, fourth and seventh sections? An annual tax must be levied, which “ shall be equal to at least eight per centum of the amount of such increased debt.” And this levy must precede the issue of the bonds or certificates.</p>

It is said, the ordinance pledges the faith and credit of the city to levy a tax sufficient to redeem the bonds within thirty years. That is not to the point; the obligation and promise of every debtor, is to pay as nominated in the bond; but in the case of a municipal debtor, which is without power to borrow, except as authorized by the statute, it must not only promise, but make provision to pay, as enjoined by the statute. And that eight per cent annually will more than pay this loan within thirty years, is no reason for disregarding the mandate. Whether it will be more <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>than sufficient, depends altogether on whether the securities be sold on terms favorable to the borrower. If taken at par, on the maximum rate, six per cent, fixed by the statute, a tax equal to eight per cent of the debt, would probably not pay the loan within thirty years. If the rate be four per cent, it will more than pay it. But it must be paid in thirty years, and at least eight per cent must be levied.</p>

The contention, that the loan must be issued, redeemable by annual installments, the last not deferred more than thirty years, cannot be sustained by anj' reasonable interpretation of the act. Whether the loan be payable by installments, or tiie whole of it be made to mature in ten, twenty, or thirty years, is in the discretion of councils, who, it must be assumed, will use their best judgment in the interest of the city.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[255,1096,1170,1120]]]'>Nearly all the legislation with reference to the monetary affairs of municipalities, since the adoption of the constitution, recognizes “ sinking funds ” as aids or instruments in municipal fiscal operations. The primary object of the statute, is to compel annual collection and saving of revenues to meet obligations incurred. If these cannot be judiciously paid before maturity, because too high premiums be demanded, then, through a “sinking fund,” the money can be invested to be forthcoming at maturity of the bond. Article 15, sec. 3 of the constitution, declares that: “ Every city shall create a sinking fund, which shall be inviolably pledged for the pajunent of its funded debt.” The annual tax, when collected, must be paid into this fund, where it is inviolably pledged for the payment of this loan. What earning power it shall have when there, awaiting maturity of the loan, depends much on the sagacity and business management of the trustees of the fund. The plain intent of the act is, that a certain sum shall be annually raised in.anticipation of payment; and whether paid out in redemption of the bonds annually, or paid into the inviolably pledged fund annually, to be paid out for the bonds in thirty years, it is, within the meaning of the act, applied annually to the redemption of the bonds.</p>

It is contended, the local act of April 6, 1850, which limited the debt of the city to $1,150,000, is not repealed, and therefore this increase of indebtedness is illegal. Both the constitution and the act of 1874, conflict with this local law by <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>plain implication; both provide expressly for an increase of indebtedness by all cities, and limit the amount only by a percentage on the valuation, while this act arbitrarily limits it to a comparatively small fixed sum. There is consequently such a repugnancy, in this particular legislation as to municipal debt, between the two, as plainly indicates an intention to repeal the local act. But however this may be, the act of 14th June, 1887, which is in harmony with the act of 1874, prescribes that any increase of debt of cities of the second class, shall first be approved by a majority of the electors. That act is entitled, “ An act in relation to the government of cities of the second class,” and it is enacted that “ Any increase of the interest-bearing bonded indebtedness of cities of the second class, is hereby prohibited, unless the same shall be approved by an affirmative vote of the qualified electors voting thereat, at an election provided for by ordinance of councils.” An increase of the interest-bearing bonded indebtedness of this city of the second class, was so approved. If it cannot be increased, it is because of the local act of 1850; then one or the other must give way. Which shall, is pointed out in Commonwealth v. Macferron, <a href="/pa/152/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="152 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="838153" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0244-01">152 Pa. 244</a>. Our brother WILLIAMS, in pronouncing the judgment of the court, says : “ Whenever, therefore, any law regulating the municipal affairs of cities of a given class, shall be found to conflict with a previous local statute applicable to any member of the class, relating to the subject, the latter must give way, bjr reason of the nature and purposes of class legislation. In this manner, existing diversities will disappear, and uniformity throughout the class will be finally secured.” It was manifestly the intention of the legislature that this act should operate upon all cities of the second class; it cannot apply to Pittsburg if the local act stands; they are plainly in conflict; therefore the local act must give way. We speak now only of that part of the act of 1850 which limits the indebtedness of the city. The other provisions of the act are not in question in this case, and we express no opinion as to them.</p>
