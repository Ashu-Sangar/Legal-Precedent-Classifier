      <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>On February 28, 2002, seventeen-year old Dion Johnson, walking down a street near his home in Philadelphia, was hustled by two gun-wielding men into a waiting car. One of the two men was Appellant. A third assailant then drove the group to a telephone booth from which Johnson’s father was called and informed of the kidnapping. Then, blindfolded, Johnson was then taken to an unfamiliar house.</p>

Ransom demands were repeatedly made of Johnson’s father, and the men threatened to cut off one of Johnson’s fingers. At one point, Johnson was driven back to the phone booth so that his father could hear Johnson’s voice, presumably to prove that his son remained alive. The captors demanded $50,000 from Johnson’s father. After Johnson was taken back to the house, only one of the captors remained with Johnson; the other two men left the premises for reasons explained below. Eventually, the sole remaining captor grew bored and left Johnson by himself. Once alone, Johnson broke free, left the house, and contacted police. <em>Commonwealth v.

Following the ransom calls, Johnson’s father arranged to pay the kidnappers a total of $27,000. A bag containing the purported ransom money was then dropped off by Johnson’s father at á ■ prearranged location. Although the bag had only seven dollars and police forms in it, Appellant and one of his partners picked up the bag shortly after it was dropped off. When the police announced themselves, a foot chase ensued, during which both suspects dropped handguns. Appellant’s partner was observed to have dropped the ransom bag. Both men were arrested; each made incriminating statements while being held in neighboring cells at the police station. <em>Id. </em>at 3.

Therefore, Appellant’s arguments are limited to illustrating why Section 9714 requires more than simply ascertaining the existence of predicate convictions. In other words, Appellant insists that the determination of whether prior convictions arose from <em>separate </em>criminal transactions is a question of fact that falls within the net circumscribed by the line of cases led by <em>Apprendi, </em>and that the exception carved out for “the fact of a prior conviction” does not save Section 9714 from his challenge. “The fact of a prior conviction is considerably narrower than facts about this conviction.” Brief of Appellant at 10. Rather, “[t]he fact ‘of a prior conviction only contemplates recognition of the bare existence of the conviction. Facts going beyond the bare existence of the prior conviction, such as the relatedness of one criminal conviction to the other, are a wholly different matter.” <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>

This requires the sentencing court to assess the relationship between those convictions in order to determine if they are, indeed, separate criminal transactions. The Appellant insists that the need to consider the logical and temporal relationship between the predicate convictions takes Section 9714 outside the scope of the exception to <em>Apprendi:</em>

As Appellant ably points out in his Reply Brief, the federal statute requires only that the predicate crimes occurred on different dates. The terminology at issue in these statutory interpretation cases is necessarily not instructive on the matter before this Court, which interprets only Section 9714. <em>Shepard </em>makes clear that the determination required under the federal statute there at issue is one that falls within the fact of a prior conviction exception to the <em>Apprendi </em>rale.

I certainly agree that a valid <em>Apprendi </em>claim does not implicate discretionary sentencing. Moreover, there is precedent from this Court which supports the Majority’s broad statement. <em>See Commonwealth v.

However, in my Concurring Opinion in <em>Roney, </em>I noted my disagreement with the notion that a new constitutional sentencing rule from the U.S. Supreme Court, which the High Court says is not to apply retroactively, should operate to make a waived <em>Apprendi-type </em>claim non-waivable. I continue to believe that the <em>Roney </em>footnote obviously was wrong. <em>Apprendi </em>claims are not claims implicating the “legality” of a sentence, at least for purposes of waiver. <em>See id., </em>at 362-63 (Castille, J., concurring).</p>

Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault upon Officer Reigle under 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(2), which is classified as a felony of the first degree. <em><a href="/a2d/722/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="722 A.2d 203" data-case-ids="11767476" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0203-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 2702(b). The Crimes Code permits a sentence of no more than twenty years of imprisonment for a first-degree felony. See 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103(1). Thus, the 25 to 50 year sentence imposed by the trial court for this offense would exceed the statutory limit and be illegal unless the “three strikes” provision of Section 9714 applies. Under these circumstances, we conclude that appellant’s claim implicates the legality of his sentence. Accordingly, he may raise the question as a matter of right and our jurisdiction over the claim is correspondingly secure. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9781(a) (“The defendant or the Commonwealth may appeal as of right the legality of the sentence.”).</blockquote>

      <em>Id. </em>at 1131 (emphasis added). The analysis in <em>Bradley </em>only focused on whether there was “necessary proof’ of separate criminal transactions after first considering whether the sentence exceeded the statutory limit in the first instance.
