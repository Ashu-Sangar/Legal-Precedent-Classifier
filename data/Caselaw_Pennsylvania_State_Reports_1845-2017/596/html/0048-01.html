Ruling in favor of Employer, the WCJ found that appellee was performing a “traditional maritime function” over the “navigable waters of the United States” as defined under the LHWCA, and therefore, held LHWCA’s jurisdiction to be exclusive. The WCJ found appellee’s work not to be “land-based” and considered the circumstance indistinguishable from <em>Wellsville, </em>where this Court found exclusive LHWCA jurisdiction in a case where a welder was injured on a barge on the Ohio River that was tethered to shore.

Though “dry dock” was included in the original language of the LHWCA, it is undoubtedly -within the scope of <em>Sun Ship’s </em>application of the statute as amended, <em>i.e., </em>as an “area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel.” <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20903" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="33 U.S.C. § 903">33 U.S.C. § 903</a>(a). A graven dry dock, by definition, is cut and dug out of the land. This is sufficient to make it “land-based.” The periodic and artificial flooding of the graven dry dock with water is insufficient to divorce the site from land and render it exclusively within the limits of the “navigable waters of the U.S.” If a wharf and a pier, which extend out over the water, are within <em>Sun Ship’s </em>zone of concurrent jurisdiction, then so too should an area of land that is carved out of the terrain and periodically and deliberately flooded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Furthermore, a contrary holding' would allow for concurrent jurisdiction over injuries occurring during the construction of a graven dry dock, but would prohibit concurrent recovery to workers injured on the same site once the dry dock is complete.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Finally, this holding is in keeping with what the U.S. Supreme Court described as Congress’ remedial intent behind the 1972 amendments.

Unlike the Commonwealth Court, however, we do not find the fact that the vessel in this case was resting “on land” at the time of injury to be dispositive. A graven dry dock is land-based regardless of how much water has been flooded into it when a vessel enters or exits, and an injury occurs. The reason for this conclusion is also practical; to accept the analysis of the Commonwealth Court would cause concurrent jurisdiction to ebb and flow with the rising and receding waters within the graven dry dock — concurrent when the ship is resting on the floor of the dry dock, but exclusive when the vessel is afloat within the confines of the dry dock. Additionally, where the injury occurs within the dry dock is insignificant.

      <blockquote id="b116-7" data-blocks='[["BL_116.7",116,[356,1130,1095,497]]]'>[FN6] Most often, state workmen’s compensation laws will not be treated as making awards thereunder final or conclusive. Admittedly, if a particular state compensation law provision does indisputably declare its awards final, a conflict with the LHWCA may possibly arise where a claimant seeks inferior state benefits in the first instance. But the consequences to the claimant of this error would be less drastic than those of a mistake under the rule appellant contemplates — under which a misstep could result in no benefits. At any rate, although the question is not directly before us, we observe that if federal preclusion ever need be implied to cope with this remote contingency, a less disruptive approach would be to pre-empt the state compensation exclusivity clause, rather than to pre-empt the entire state compensation statute as appellant suggests.</blockquote>

Mandating exclusive jurisdiction will not relieve employers of their distinct obligations under state and federal compensation law. The line that circumscribes the jurisdictional compass of the LHWCA — a compound of "status” and "situs” — is no less vague than its counterpart in the pre“twilight zone” <em>Jensen </em>era. Thus, even were the LHWCA exclusive within its field, many employers would be compelled to abide by state-imposed responsibilities lest a claim fall beyond the scope of the LHWCA. Our observation about exclusive jurisdiction in <em>Davis v. Department of Labor, </em>is apt whether jurisdictional barriers are erected on land or at the water's edge: "The horns of the jurisdictional dilemma press as sharply on employers as on employees.” <a href="/us/317/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="317 U.S. 249" data-case-ids="304034" data-case-paths="/us/317/0249-01">317 U.S. at 255</a>, <a href="/us/317/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="317 U.S. 249" data-case-ids="304034" data-case-paths="/us/317/0249-01">63 S.Ct. at 228</a>.</blockquote>

Diy dock construction is certainly not over “the navigable waters of the U.S.,” so it is not excluded from state jurisdiction, and at least one other court has found injuries to workers constructing a dry dock to be within the purview of the LHWCA. <em>See, e.g., Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v.

Justice Burton's belief that all dry docks be treated similarly‘would appear to be administratively convenient. However, due to the unfixed nature of floating dry docks, <em>Wellsville </em>could easily be applicable, which would bar concurrent recovery for injuries occurring on floating dry docks. Nonetheless, that issue is not before the Court and we do not reach it.</p>
