We hold that the van, and not merely the wheelchair lift and modifications installed in the van, may qualify as an indispensable device necessary to accommodate this sort of catastrophic work injury, and thus, may fall within the definition of an orthopedic appliance. We also hold, however, that the extent of an employer’s obligation in this regard will depend upon the specific facts of the case. We further hold that the cost containment provision of the Act does not apply in the instant case. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the Workers’ Compensation Judge for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>

(Employer) when he was struck by a bale of hay that fell from overhead, rendering him a C-5 <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>quadriplegic and confined to a wheelchair. Following a four-month hospital stay, appellant was discharged. Appellant’s wife, Edith Griffiths, testified that she needed to transport appellant not only home from the hospital, but to and from follow-up medical appointments. Mrs. Griffiths rented two different vans for one month each, thus providing an opportunity to compare model layouts, features, and comfort before buying an appropriate model and design. Employer’s insurance carrier representative was advised of the van rental in advance, being told that it was necessary to transport appellant home, to take him to medical appointments, and “to get out a ‘little bit’ and enjoy ‘a little quality of life after being in the hospital [for] four months.’ ” WCJ Decision at 1.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[292,1016,1163,569]]]'>Mrs. Griffiths noted that she and appellant ultimately purchased a third model van, a 2000 Ford Windstar. Appellant was more comfortable in the Windstar than in the rental vans: the Windstar had no mechanical lifts and its design was very simple, as entry is made by opening the back door, folding out a ramp by hand, and driving the wheelchair straight in. The cost of the van was $28,500, consisting of $18,000 in base costs, $10,000 in conversion costs, and $500 for shipping and handling. Other models the Griffiths had considered would have cost $40,000 or more, and were more complicated. The van was purchased with funds from a family friend. <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[124,503,1156,968]]]'>The WCJ granted the penalty petition. The WCJ first noted the undisputed point that modifications to the van to make it wheelchair accessible were an expense for “orthopedic appliances” under Section 306(f.l)(l)(ii) of the Act, which provides, in pertinent part, that the “employer shall provide payment for medicines and supplies, hospital treatment, services and supplies, and orthopedic appliances, and prostheses in accordance with this section.” 77 P.S. § 531(l)(ii). The WCJ next concluded that the cost containment provision in Section 306(f.l)(3)(i) applies only to a health care provider. Because the relevant provider in this case was the employer and its insurer, and no health care provider was involved, the WCJ found that Employer was responsible to pay the full rental costs of the prior vans and the full cost of modifying the Windstar. Finally, the WCJ concluded that “a reasonable cost to purchase the van [was] recoverable under the circumstances of this case.” The WCJ explained his reasoning on this point as follows:</p>

    <p id="b382-6" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[293,506,1166,1013]]]'>Employer appealed to the Board, renewing its twin positions that it was responsible for making the van accessible by wheelchair, but not for its original purchase price, and that, in any event, its liability was capped at eighty percent of the cost. The Board affirmed in part (concerning cost containment) and reversed in part (concerning liability for the purchase price of the van). Citing the <em>Petrilla </em>case, the Board held that the van itself is not an orthopedic appliance under the Act, and therefore, Employer is not obliged to pay for it. The Board rejected the WCJ’s distinction of <em>Petrilla, </em>which was based upon appellant’s specific financial circumstances, noting that <em>Petrilla </em>did not consider the claimant’s financial circumstances, “and we do not see how the source of the funds that Claimant used to purchase the van brings it within the definition of an orthopedic appliance.” The Board summarily concluded, on this point, that the <em>Petrilla </em>Court “determined that the base price of a vehicle that is retrofitted for a claimant’s use is not recoverable and we are bound by that determination.” Board Op. at 3-4.</p>
    <p id="b382-7" data-blocks='[["BL_382.7",382,[290,1547,1165,678]]]'>With respect to the cost containment provision, the Board acknowledged that where no governing fee schedule has been established, Section 306(f.l)(3)(i) caps a provider’s obligation at no more than eighty percent of the charge most often made by providers in a given geographic area. The Board determined, however, that the term “provider” meant a “health care provider,” and because no health care provider was involved here, the cost containment provision simply did not apply. The Board therefore agreed with the WCJ that Employer was required to reimburse appellant for one hundred percent of the costs of renting a van for two months and modifying the purchased van to make it wheelchair accessible. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>

The majority deemed <em>Petrilla </em>to be controlling on the question of whether Employer was responsible for the cost of the van. In <em>Petrilla, </em>the claimant was rendered paraplegic and confined to a wheelchair due to a work injury. Although the employer had offered to retrofit the claimant’s vehicle with hand controls and other modifications, the employer maintained that it was not obligated to provide the vehicle itself. The <em>Petrilla </em>court agreed, finding that a vehicle is not an orthopedic appliance under the statute:</p>
    <blockquote id="b383-4" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[172,960,1115,470]]]'>The general use of a vehicle must, of course, be distinguished from the retrofitting of that vehicle, without which the vehicle could not be operated by the claimant. It is the modifications and additional “appliances,” not the vehicle itself, which are necessary to accommodate the claimant’s work-related injury. Thus, the special retrofitting is an “orthopedic appliance” [citing <em>Rieger v. Workmen’s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Barnes &amp; Tucker Co.), </em>104 Pa.Cmwlth. 42, <a href="/pa-commw/104/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="521 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="1356675" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/104/0042-01">521 A.2d 84</a> (1987)], while a van itself is not.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.6",383,[175,1448,1114,417]]]'>Second, by analogy, while the special remodeling of an injured worker’s home to make it wheelchair accessible might be analogous to the cost of retrofitting a motor vehicle so that the vehicle is accessible to a paraplegic, the cost of the van itself might also be analogized to the cost of purchasing the home itself, which is noncompensable; to argue that these latter costs should be compensable is simply untenable.</blockquote>

The majority below then concluded that the interpretation of the Act in <em>Petrilla </em>was proper, and therefore, <em>Petrilla </em>controlled. Finally, the majority rejected appellant’s argument premised upon the remedial nature and humanitarian purpose of the Act, opining that appellant’s inability to purchase the van was “a product of his own financial circumstances, not his work-reiated injury.” <em>Griffiths, </em><a href="/a2d/861/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="861 A.2d 424" data-case-ids="9188223" data-case-paths="/a2d/861/0424-01">861 A.2d at 429</a>.

      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>The majority then turned to Employer’s cost containment claim. The majority noted that the Board had concluded that the eighty percent cap provided in Section 306(f.l)(3)(i) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531(3)(i), did not apply because the provision spoke only to health care providers, and Employer was not acting in that capacity. The majority disagreed, explaining as follows:</p>

It is undisputed that there is no Medicare calculation applicable here. For any reimbursement the wheelchair lift must be classified as a product and the van rental as a product or service under the Act. If the retrofitting of the Van and the van rental do not qualify as “treatment, accommodation, product or service” subject to the cost containment provisions of Section 306(f.l)(3)(i) of the Act, then there is no basis for any reimbursement whatsoever under the Act because there was no medical provider involved. This Court is constrained to agree that under the Act Employer’s obligation is capped at eighty percent of the cost to retrofit the Van and for the van rental.</blockquote>

Appellant argues that the cost of the van itself, no less than the cost of conversion, is encompassed by the Act’s reference to “orthopedic appliances” and that the contrary conclusion reached by the <em>en banc </em>majority below, and the panel majority in <em>Petrilla, </em>should be disapproved.

If he is to be mobile, appellant stresses, he has no choice but to secure a van, since a standard-sized automobile cannot accommodate his wheelchair and lift. Absent the van, the wheelchair lift (a conceded orthopedic device here) is useless to him. Appellant asserts that the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of the term orthopedic appliance leads to an arbitrary result, as only those quadriplegic claimants wealthy enough to afford a van on their own will be able to avail themselves of the Act’s provision for reimbursement for the cost of a wheelchair lift and the cost of converting a van to make it wheelchair accessible.</p>

However, appellant submits that, when a van becomes necessary as a result of a work injury which renders a person quadriplegic, it is indeed an orthopedic appliance.

Although the cost of the vehicle itself was not an issue in <em>Rieger, </em>appellant invokes the broad assertion in Judge Colins’ opinion that, “a device specifically designed for the particular use of allowing the handicapped to travel as necessary without aid,” qualifies the van as an orthopedic appliance. <em>Rieger, <a href="/pa-commw/104/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="521 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="1356675" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/104/0042-01">521 </a></em><a href="/pa-commw/104/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="521 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="1356675" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/104/0042-01">A.2d at 86</a>.

For appellant, the need for the modified van is a direct result of his work injury and, in his circumstances at least, it directly addresses the lack of mobility caused by that work injury. Without his wheelchair, appellant would be confined to a bed or a room; without a van equipped to handle his wheelchair, appellant would be confined to the limited area he could travel in that wheelchair. Whatever a van may represent to others fortunate to have unrestricted powers of ambulation, in circumstances such as these, the van indeed is an appliance that addresses and is directly responsive to the permanent orthopedic issue brought on by appellant’s work injury.</p>

The -wheelchair and the modified van appellant has sought from Employer do not begin to “compensate” appellant for the quadriplegia that resulted from his work injury. Appellant has lost the ability to stand, to walk, to run, to operate an ordinary vehicle, to ride in a friend’s car, to hail a cab. He has lost the free mobility he had, and that others take for granted. To a person in appellant’s condition, the van is crucial to restore some small measure of the independence and quality of life that existed before the work injury. Because the present restrictions on appellant’s life and mobility were caused by his service to his employer, and a modified van directly addresses and helps to remediate that very harm, we conclude that a wheelchair accessible van qualifies under the broad definition of orthopedic appliances employed in the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The parties agreed that the cost of retrofitting a van to be wheelchair accessible must be borne by the employer as a compensable orthopedic appliance. Therefore, as the dissenting opinion below recognized, a holding that the employer is never responsible for the cost of the van that would be retrofitted would result in two classes of claimants: those claimants who can afford to purchase a van will receive the retrofitting benefits that allow them to become mobile, while those less financially fortunate, who lack the funds to purchase a van, cannot avail themselves of the retrofitting benefit. The suggestion in the majority opinion below that this disparity “is a product of [the claimant’s] own financial circumstances,” and not the injury, ignores that the very nature of the claimant’s work injury severely restricts the type of vehicle he can operate. A person such as appellant cannot simply purchase the smallest and most economical vehicle, much less the vehicle of his choice. Instead, as a direct result of his work-caused quadriplegia, appellant is constrained to driving only a large, specially modified van that allows him to enter while seated in his wheelchair and to remain seated in the wheelchair while driving. Put another way, appellant may only avail himself of a vehicle specifically chosen for its capacity to be retrofitted to accommodate his other indispensable prosthetic device — -his wheelchair. A claimant such as appellant therefore faces an unavoidable cost which is not a product of his economic circumstances, but of his work injury. We agree with the dissent below that the disparity that the Commonwealth Court majority deemed tolerable requires an unreasonable reading of the Act, one that is at odds with the Act’s remedial purpose.</p>

Nothing in the Act, for example, requires that an orthopedic appliance— the van here — be brand new. In addition, the claimant’s prior lifestyle and resources may be relevant in fixing the appropriate expense owed by the employer to secure an appropriate vehicle. Thus, the circumstances of a claimant who already owned a van prior to his injury will be different from the circumstances of a claimant who owned a smaller vehicle not suitable for wheelchair-accessible modification (but perhaps suitable for trading-in to offset the cost of a van), or a claimant who owned no car at all, but relied upon walking, public transportation or other means of travel. We agree with those courts that, while recognizing that a modified van is a necessary appliance or apparatus for some claimants, concomitantly recognized that the particular circumstances of the claimant must be considered in determining the precise obligation of the employer.</p>

Respecting the statement in <em>Fumival </em>that Section 306(f.l)(3)(i) applies to medical providers only, Employer argues that the statement was purely <em>dictum </em>because the issue in <em>Fumival </em>was whether that Section superseded Section 319 of the Act, which pertains to subrogation. Employer argues that the <em>Villanova </em>case is similarly inapplicable because that case also posed a subrogation issue. Employer contends that both cases held that Section 306(f. 1)(3)(i) did not limit subrogation of payments made by an employer or insurance company on the basis that an injury or disability was not compensable, because Section 319 specifically states that such payor “shall be subrogated ... to the amount so paid.” 77 P.S. § 671.

Employer argues that the majority below was correct that, if the fee cap provisions do not apply, there is no basis for any reimbursement whatsoever under the Act because there was no medical provider involved.

The only caveat to the imposition of the reimbursement schedule was the situation where a particular treatment, accommodation, product or service was not calculated under the Medicare program. In that case, the amount of the payment may not exceed eighty percent of the charge most often made by providers of similar training, experience and licensure for a specific treatment, accommodation, product or service, in the geographic area where the treatment or service is provided. PDI states that compliance with these medical reimbursement provisions are mandatory and are placed upon the provider of the service.

    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.5",404,[291,1246,1160,513]]]'>PDI further notes that appellant sought and purchased his new van for retrofitting without consideration of the medical fee reimbursement requirements of the Act.

Thus, whereas the provision of the Act requiring employers to pay for orthopedic appliances does not require the existence of a health care provider, the cost containment provision of the Act clearly does.
