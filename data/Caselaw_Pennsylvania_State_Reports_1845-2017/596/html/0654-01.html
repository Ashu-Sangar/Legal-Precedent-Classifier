McElwee &amp; Son, Inc., on the 6200 block of Market Street in West Philadelphia. The business had existed in that location since the 1950s, and McElwee had taken over management of it from his father, Thomas McElwee, in 1998, although the latter stayed on as a part-time <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>employee. Also in 1998, Appellant, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (“SEPTA”), notified West Philadelphia landowners that extensive construction activity was required in the area as part of the ongoing reconstruction of the city’s Market Street elevated commuter line. SEPTA scheduled outreach meetings and established a community information center to address the concerns of area landowners and to resolve complaints related to the project.</p>

In September 2003, Appellees petitioned the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas for the appointment of a board of viewers pursuant to Section 502(e) of the Eminent Domain Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>26 P.S. § l-502(e)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (repealed and recodified as amended at 26 Pa.C.S. § 502(c)), claiming that SEPTA’s actions had effected a <em>de facto </em>condemnation by causing the closure of the business. SEPTA filed preliminary objections, but the trial court ultimately granted Appellees’ petition and entered an order appointing a board of viewers to determine condemnation damages. On SEPTA’s motion for reconsideration, however, the trial court vacated its prior order and, <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>pursuant to an agreement by the parties, directed that further evidence be taken in the form of depositions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b717-4" data-blocks='[["BL_717.5",717,[119,432,1155,456]]]'>Counsel for Appellees deposed several individuals, including McElwee, Thomas McElwee, two former company employees, two former customers, and the company’s accountant. Although SEPTA engaged in extensive cross-examination of Appellees’ witnesses, it did not call any witnesses of its own to be deposed or offer any other contrary evidence. The following is a summary of the underlying events as alleged by Appellees and developed through their deposition testimony and exhibits.</p>
    <p id="b717-5" data-blocks='[["BL_717.6",717,[118,921,1155,896]],["BL_718.1",718,[296,316,1163,575]]]'>A driveway on the subject property ran from the street to the back of the building, and the business relied on this driveway to receive raw materials and deliver finished products to customers because there was no other way to reach the rear of the property and such items could not be loaded or unloaded at the front of the building. SEPTA began work in January 2000 by closing off access to the 6200 block of Market Street from 68rd Street during most of the day and commencing excavations for the installation of utilities. Intermittently throughout the year, these excavations blocked the entrance to Appellees’ driveway during construction hours — approximately 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. SEPTA crews would install metal plates over the excavations at the end of the workday to allow vehicular access to the driveway, but the excavations often interfered with daytime deliveries to and from the shop. Although SEPTA workers would sometimes lay the plates down to allow for a particular delivery when asked to do so, it <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>was frequently difficult to locate personnel who could perform the task. Delivery persons were therefore required to park on 62nd Street and manually wheel pallets of supplies to the shop. However, even in these instances, utility pipes sometimes blocked the driveway entrance, and, at such times, McElwee and his employees had to suspend their printing work for as much as an hour to assist with a delivery. Similar problems were encountered with respect to the delivery of the shop’s finished products to customers, and McElwee therefore frequently took it upon himself to make deliveries and to pick up supplies before and after work.</p>
    <p id="b718-5" data-blocks='[["BL_718.5",718,[294,914,1164,736]]]'>In 2001 and early 2002, SEPTA’s construction work near the printing shop decreased, although SEPTA workers nevertheless would frequently block the driveway entrance with personal and construction vehicles. In doing so, the workers ignored pavement markings indicating that vehicles should not be parked so as to block the entrance to the driveway. Locating the owner of a vehicle so that it could be moved and access to the driveway restored, moreover, proved time consuming and, in some instances, impossible. Additionally, William Noris, one of the company’s employees, regularly attempted to complain about the situation to SEPTA by calling the phone number SEPTA had provided for this purpose. He was generally unable to reach SEPTA’s contact person, however, and usually did not receive a return call.</p>
    <p id="b718-6" data-blocks='[["BL_718.6",718,[293,1674,1165,676]]]'>The situation then worsened again in the summer of 2002, when SEPTA closed the entire 6200 block of Market Street to regular traffic in order to create a construction staging area and parking place for its personnel. Appellees were permitted to utilize the street for vehicular access to the driveway, but construction and other vehicles routinely blocked the driveway for several hours at a time throughout the day (although full access was restored each evening once construction was completed). Although Appellees’ main supplier continued to make deliveries to the shop throughout the period of SEPTA’s work, the needed materials had to be brought to the shop manually from the delivery truck’s location on an adjacent block.</p>
    <p id="b719-4" data-blocks='[["BL_719.4",719,[117,318,1159,1053]]]'>
      <a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>These conditions, which continued until the business closed in May 2003, dramatically curtailed printing work at the shop. Additionally, there were numerous occasions when a printing job could not be completed on time because a particular item specific to the job had to be purchased; under ordinary circumstances, McElwee would drive to a supply store to purchase it and return immediately, but without ready egress and ingress to his property, he had to await the end of the day when construction vehicles would be moved so he could exit the property. In these instances (which numbered over one hundred, according to McElwee), the print job would be delayed, causing customer dissatisfaction and/or cancellation of the work order. This, in turn, ultimately led to a substantial loss of revenue. In this regard, McElwee and his father testified that SEPTA’s activity caused the business to lose at least three large printing jobs due to the unpredictability of driveway access after the 6200 block of Market Street was closed to traffic in 2002, and a former customer verified that the business declined his purchase orders due to SEPTA’s activities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In support of their testimony, Appellees introduced an exhibit setting forth the company’s profits and losses from 1999 to 2003. <em>See </em>Exhibit No. 9, RR. at 250a. Based on tax documents, the exhibit reflected that, although the business generated a profit in 1999, it sustained increasing losses once SEPTA’s work began in 2000. In terms of specific revenue <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>sources, Thomas McElwee testified that twenty percent of the company’s revenue derived from walk-in trade prior to 2000, but that this percentage dropped off almost completely after SEPTA’s activities commenced. John McElwee indicated that the decline in walk-in trade resulted in a decrease of approximately $60,000 in gross receipts in 2000 alone. Finally, after the business closed, McElwee testified that, as a result of his remaining debt, he lacked the funds to have the heavy printing .equipment removed from the premises, which in turn interfered with his ability to generate income by leasing the building out. <em>See </em>Deposition of John McElwee, March 31, 2004, at 41-44, 94.</p>
    <p id="b720-5" data-blocks='[["BL_720.5",720,[298,983,1160,690]]]'>The trial court sustained SEPTA’s preliminary objections, dismissed Appellees’ petition with prejudice, and entered judgment in favor of SEPTA. Appellees lodged their appeal and filed a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal. In their statement, Appellees repeatedly asserted that the trial court had erred in view of their “overwhelming and uncontradicted testimony and exhibits” tending to show that SEPTA substantially interfered with access to their property and that this caused their business to fail. Thereafter, the trial court explained its ruling in a published opinion filed pursuant to Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a). <em>See McElwee v.

Applying these principles, the court reasoned that Appellees had not demonstrated that the closure of the business was the necessary consequence of SEPTA’s activity, and that they had therefore failed to carry <a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>their burden. Furthermore, the court stated that, although access may have been temporarily limited during construction, “the circumstances were not exceptional, and SEPTA did not unreasonably interfere with [Appellees’] access to their property.” <em>Id. </em>at 416.</p>
    <p id="b722-5" data-blocks='[["BL_722.5",722,[297,611,1164,525]]]'>In a published opinion a divided Commonwealth Court panel reversed the trial court’s order and determined that there had been a <em>de facto </em>taking by SEPTA. <em>See Thomas A.

Nevertheless, because of the nature of the business, Appellants’ need to make alternate arrangements to accommodate the lack of direct access severely curtailed productivity, which, eventually, led to the loss of clients and income and, ultimately, caused the business to fail. We conclude that this level of deprivation of use, where the ability to get raw goods to run a business is compromised for such a lengthy period, constitutes more than a “temporary inconvenience”; rather, these facts constitute exceptional circumstances that deprive the property owner of the beneficial use and enjoyment of his property.</blockquote>

By contrast, Appellees maintain that they have averred a loss of direct access that ultimately became a permanent loss of access by forcing them to close the printing business.

The Commonwealth Court discounted the present applicability of this restriction on the basis that <em>Truck Terminal </em>did not involve a failed business, and the construction at issue there caused mere inconvenience to the subject business’s patrons by forcing them to travel along a circuitous route to reach the company; whereas here, there was virtually no access during <a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a>business hours on a substantial number of occasions over a three-year period, and the business failed as a result. <em>See McElwee, </em><a href="/a2d/896/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="896 A.2d 13" data-case-ids="8424869" data-case-paths="/a2d/896/0013-01">896 A.2d at 21</a>. A close reading of <em>Truck Terminal, </em>however, reveals that the denial of compensation did not hinge so much on the fact that the business stayed open or that the detour constituted reasonable access, as it did upon the Court’s evaluation of the language of the Eminent Domain Code as failing to change the long-standing common-law rule that, in general, no cause of action exists for a temporary loss of access to one’s property. <em>See, e.g., Truck Terminal, </em><a href="/pa/486/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="486 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1757603" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0016-01">486 Pa. at 22</a>, 408 A.2d at 988-89 (“Since there was no cause of action at common law for the temporary deprivation of access caused by the work of making a public improvement, such temporary inconvenience not being deemed to constitute a ‘taking’ of a 'property right, appellant’s contention boils down to the proposition that the legislature intended to create a compensable property right hitherto unknown to Pennsylvania.... ”).

On appeal, the Commonwealth Court recognized the precept announced in <em>Track Terminal </em>concerning temporary interference with property access, but ultimately reversed the trial court, reasoning that, although the obstacles to, and rerouting of, vehicular and pedestrian traffic may have been temporary from the city’s point of view, once the business was destroyed those obstacles became permanent insofar as the business was concerned.
