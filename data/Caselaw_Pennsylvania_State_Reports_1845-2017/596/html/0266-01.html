    <p id="b324-11" data-blocks='[["BL_324.11",324,[291,1121,1157,202]]]'>AND NOW, this 29th day of February, 2008, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal and the Joint Petition for Expedited Decision on Review are GRANTED. The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:</p>
    <blockquote id="b324-12" data-blocks='[["BL_324.12",324,[334,1345,1115,364]]]'>1. Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the decision of the Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Appeals Board, which held that [Petitioner’s] 2005 Street Resurfacing Projeet[,] which included milling and road resurfacing, constituted alteration and not maintenance, and was therefore subject to the payment of prevailing minimum wages under the Act?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b324-13" data-blocks='[["BL_324.13",324,[330,1730,1117,528]]]'>2. Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that [Petitioner] was not justified in relying upon a memorandum of understanding, promulgated by and between two state agencies, namely the Department of Labor and Industry (“DLI”) and its Bureau of Labor Law Compliance (the “Bureau”) and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (“PennDOT”), and not withdrawn in writing until after the Project was completed, to determine that the 2005 Street Resurfacing Project was a maintenance project, and not a repair project?</blockquote>
