The bid proposal for the project bore the title “Youngwood Borough 2005-3 Street Resurfacing and Improvement Project” (the Project). The Project had an estimated cost of $183,209, with $71,000 of the cost coming from PennDOT’s Liquid Fuels Tax Funds, and the remainder coming from Appellant’s general fund.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>advertised by Appellant, the Project consisted of (1) resurfacing portions of five streets by milling approximately 11,000 square yards of cartway and paving with 1270 tons of ID#2 binder or wearing course and approximately 11,600 square yards of surface material; (2) the surface treatment of 9800 square yards of two streets; (3) minor drainage of one street; (4) patching approximately 1300 square yards of one street; (5) constructing six catch basins; (6) replacing approximately 570 linear feet of existing piping and approximately 650 linear feet of French drains; (7) raising a manhole cover with a one-inch spacer ring; and (8) additional labor to treat and finish the work. The resurfacing work involves a process called “milling,” whereby between l<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>// and <em>3Hi' </em>of the existing street is “cut” or ground down prior to application of the new surface.

Additionally, Appellant estimated that the milling and repaving of the five streets constituted 40% of the total estimated Project cost. Appellant determined that only 11.3% of the estimated Project cost was for non-maintenance work, and that the remaining 88.7% was for maintenance work as defined by the Act. For this reason, Appellant determined that the Project did not require the payment of prevailing minimum wages, and solicited bids for the Project as a “mainte<a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>nance” project not subject to the Act.

In arriving at its determination, the Bureau specifically rejected Appellant’s reliance on a publication issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) entitled “Policies and Procedures for the Administration of the County Liquid Fuels Tax Act of 1931 and The Liquid Fuels Tax Act 655” (Publication 9), effective January 2003. Publication 9 included the information contained in an unsigned and undated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) prepared by PennDOT and the Department of Labor and Industry (DLI) that incorporated PennDOT’s interpretation of the term “maintenance” under the Act. Significant to the instant case, the MOU provided that replacement in kind of guide rail, curb, and pipes was maintenance, as was “black top paving (laid on asphalt pavement, cement concrete, or other hard surface) [u]p to three and a half inches thickness or up to 420 pounds per sq. yd.” MOU at 1, submitted as Exhibit BLLC-1 at the Board hearing.

The court had not previously ruled on whether the milling of a roadway in anticipation of repaving is maintenance or construction, and therefore whether the activity is subject to prevailing minimum wages. Accordingly, the court began its analysis with a review of analogous case law, principally, <em>Kulzer Roofing, Inc. v. Department of Labor &amp; Industry, </em>68 Pa.Cmwlth. 642, <a href="/citations/?q=450%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="450 A.2d 259">450 A.2d 259</a> (1982). In <em>Kulzer Roofing, </em>the court held that the re-roofing of eight buildings was repair rather than maintenance, subject to prevailing minimum wages, because the entire roof of each building was replaced, rather than simply being partially overhauled or patched. , In the present matter, the court observed that under <em>Kulzer Roofing, </em>the replacement of an old roof with a new roof constituted a change in type, and therefore constituted “repair work,” not “maintenance work” under the Act. Accordingly, the court concluded that the replacement of an old road top with a new road top is in similar manner a change in type, and therefore it was “repair work,” not “maintenance work” under the Act. <em>Borough of Youngwood v.

This Court does not consider such reliance justifiable.” <em>Borough of Youngwood, supra </em>at 1202. The court further held that “just as the demolition and reconstruction of the curb in <em>Ebensburg </em>was found to be construction and subject to prevailing minimum wages, this Court believes that grinding away the top three and one half inches or more of roadway and the laying down of new road, adding materials like Petromat which was not included in the first iteration of the roadway, constituted non-maintenance activity subject to prevailing minimum wages under the Act.” Id<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Appellant also disagrees with the Commonwealth Court majority’s conclusion that the Project resulted in a replacement of old road with new, contending that the old road never ceased to exist; it was simply “maintained” by the only generally accepted industry standard now existing: that of milling and repaving.

Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). As previously stated, this Court has already ascertained the clear intent of the Act: “[T]he primary underlying policy of the Act is to protect work[ers] employed on public work projects from [receiving] substandard pay by ensuring that they receive prevailing minimum wage[s].” <em>Pennsylvania National Mutual, supra </em>at 394, <a href="/a2d/715/1068-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="715 A.2d 1068" data-case-ids="11709730,559522" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/1068-01,/pa/552/0385-01">715 A.2d at 1072</a>. Indeed, the Act imposes a duty upon every public body (43 P.S. § 165-4), every contractor and subcontractor performing public work (43 P.S. § 165-6), and the Secretary of Labor and Industry (43 P.S. § 165-7) to implement by different means the specific mandate of the Act that “[n]ot less than the prevailing minimum wages as determined hereunder shall be paid to all work[ers] employed on public work.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> 43 P.S. § 165-5.

This section defines “maintenance work” as “repair of existing facilities when the size, type or extent of such facilities is not thereby changed or increased.” The Act does not define “size, type, or extent” or indicate examples of same. However, given the clear purpose of the Act to protect workers from receiving substandard wages on public works projects, these modifiers cannot be interpreted to mean that only when a structure or other facility is, through a public works project, enlarged, reduced, or replaced with an entirely new material is the project non-maintenance, no matter how extensive the work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Such an interpretation would be <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>completely incompatible with the clear and significant legislative intent of ensuring that workers on public works projects be paid at least the prevailing minimum wage.

That subset was maintenance work. Our decision in <em>Kitson Brothers, </em>if extended, would hold that repairs to any part of a building which did not change the type or size of the building would be maintenance work. Under such a holding, however, it is difficult for us to envision any repair, as that word is popularly recognized, which would change the size or type of a building and all repair work would therefore be included within the term “maintenance work.” Such a result is unacceptable.

Except perhaps for the component of the Project involving the patching of one street, all components of the Project are plainly “public works” requiring the payment of prevailing minimum wages under the Act. Interpreting the Act in accordance with its plain language, the street resurfacing component of the Project, involving the physical removal of several inches of road surface, subsequent treatment of areas of the roadway, and complete resurfacing with several <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>inches of new material, plainly involves “construction, reconstruction, demolition, alteration and/or repair work,” not the minor repairs constituting “maintenance work.” Accordingly, we determine that the Commonwealth Court correctly held that the Project was subject to the prevailing minimum wage requirements of the Act.</p>

Appellant argues that it “is patently unfair” for the Bureau to require Appellant to pay additional monies now that the Project has been completed.

Moreover, the Act’s focus is placed squarely on protecting workers on public works projects from receiving substandard wages, including those workers who live and/or engage in commerce in the municipalities that contract for public work projects. Although we recognize that the budgeting concerns of public bodies are highly important, the Act does not provide that its mandate to protect workers on public works projects from receiving substandard wages is to be subservient to budgeting matters. In fact, it would appear that the opposite is true. Appellant, as a public body contracting for public works projects, has an express duty under the Act to implement the Act’s mandate of ensuring that workers on such projects be paid prevailing wages, not substandard wages. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 165-4. Therefore, it is irrelevant that Appellant in good faith had determined that the Project was not subject to the Act. The Act provides that the worker is not to be “punished” by payment <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>of substandard wages. Appellant’s duty, as expressly provided in the Act, is to ensure that workers are paid prevailing wages for public works.

In making this argument, Appellant relies on the MOU contained in Publication 9, which states in pertinent part that if non-maintenance items exceed 15% of the total project cost, the project is to be treated as a non-maintenance contract <em>(i.e., </em>a “public work” as defined by the Act), thus subject to prevailing minimum wages. Appellant concedes that if the resurfacing portion of the Project, consisting of 40% of the Project, is determined by us to be a “public work” rather than "maintenance” as defined by the Act, the Project is subject to the prevailing minimum wage requirements of the Act. However, nothing in the Act or in any regulation promulgated under the Act specifically provides that the prevailing wage requirements of the Act apply only when a public project consists of a particular percentage of "public work.” Because our resolution of this case does not require that we decide the issue of whether a public works project requires a certain percentage of “public work” in order for the prevailing minimum wage requirements of the Act to apply, we need not address that issue now.</p>
