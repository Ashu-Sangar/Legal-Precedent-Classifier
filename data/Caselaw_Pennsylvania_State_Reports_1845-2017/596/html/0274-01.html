A year later, his son, Appellee John Andrew Gregg, as executor for his father’s estate, filed a product liability complaint naming more than seventy defendants and alleging civil liability on their part for Mr. Gregg’s death due to his exposure to asbestos-containing products and resultant pleural mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lungs. Appellee averred that Mr. Gregg was exposed to asbestos throughout a forty-year history of employment with telecommunications companies as a cable splicer and line man; over a four-year period in which he worked as a gas station attendant; and during a three-year period while serving in the United States Navy. The complaint also alleged that, throughout his lifetime, Mr. Gregg installed and removed brake linings and clutches on cars and trucks, and that he was exposed to asbestos in these activities as well. By virtue of this last 'set of averments, Appellee included as defendants Allied-Signal, Inc., a successor corporation to Bendix Corporation, which manufactured brake products in the relevant time frame, and Appellant, V-J Auto Parts Company, a supplier of automobile parts.</p>

Further, Appellee furnished a modified version of Dr. Spector’s report, in which the pathologist revised his opinion to attribute Mr. Gregg’s disease to “occupational and non-occupational” asbestos exposures, indicating that the change resulted from his review of the depositions of the product identification witnesses. Appellee also submitted documents attributable to Allied Signal, Inc. and Raybestos-Manhatten, Inc., supporting the claim that the brake products manufactured by these companies (or their predecessors) in the 1950s and 1960s time frame contained asbestos. Further, Appellee relied on expert affidavits of a chemist, an occupational disease physician, and an epidemiologist to establish that mesothelioma may be caused by even a small exposure to asbestos.</p>

    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[127,619,1157,1539]]]'>The common pleas court (per Judge Tereshko) granted summary judgment in Appellant’s favor, on the ground that Appellee’s product identification testimony was inadequate. <em>See Gregg v.

Initially, the court accepted Appellant’s argument that the frequency, regularity, proximity analysis discussed in <em>Eckenrod </em>should apply. <em>See id. </em>at 3 (“The courts in Pennsylvania have been consistent in requiring the plaintiff to produce evidence that he frequently and regularly used, or worked in sufficient proximity to, a specific defendant’s asbestos-containing product, and that he inhaled asbestos fibers shed therefrom in order to overcome a motion for summary judgment.”). The common pleas court recognized that there was sufficient evidence that Mr. Gregg was exposed to asbestos at some point during his lifetime, and that this exposure caused his illness, but it found insufficient evidence linking the exposure to either Allied Signal, Inc. or Appellant to create a triable issue. In this regard, the court observed that the product identification witnesses were unable to confirm that Mr. Gregg specifically used brakes manufactured by Bendix Corporation and sold by Appellant, or more broadly, that Bendix Corporation manufactured, and Appellant distributed, the asbestos-containing product that was the cause of Mr. Gregg’s disease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The court’s opinion elaborated fairly extensively concerning the vagueness of the recollections of the product identification witnesses concerning circumstances and events from thirty-five to forty years earlier. <em>See id. </em>at 3 — 5.</p>

The panel concluded that the common pleas court erred because, regardless of whether there was sufficient evidence to identify a particular manufacturer, there was enough evidence to show brake products containing asbestos were purchased from Appellant’s store. The Superior Court panel indicated, however, that it was unclear whether Appellee could present sufficient evidence to show that the amount of Mr. Gregg’s exposure to asbestos in the relatively few times that he was shown to have changed asbestos-containing brakes, as compared to the forty-plus years of occupational exposure to asbestos containing products asserted in the complaint, was a substantial contributing factor to his disease. <em>See id. </em>at 3, 7.

Appellant regards the analysis as a straightforward application of the requirement for plaintiffs to prove substantial-factor causation as an essential element of a negligence or strict liability claim. Appellant traces the history of the frequency, regularity, proximity test to <em>Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp., </em><a href="/f2d/782/1156-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="782 F.2d 1156" data-case-ids="1552352" data-case-paths="/f2d/782/1156-01">782 F.2d 1156</a> (4th Cir.1986), in which a federal court formulated a <em>de minimus </em>rule by which the viability an asbestos product liability claim is assessed according to the frequency of the use of the product and the regularity or extent of the plaintiffs (or decedent’s) employment in proximity to the product. <em>See <a href="/f2d/782/1156-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="782 F.2d 1156" data-case-ids="1552352" data-case-paths="/f2d/782/1156-01">id. </a></em><a href="/f2d/782/1156-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="782 F.2d 1156" data-case-ids="1552352" data-case-paths="/f2d/782/1156-01">at 1162</a>. Appellant highlights that, in <em>Lohmiann, </em>the plaintiff presented evidence that he was exposed to a specific asbestos-containing product ten to fifteen times for a duration of one to eight hours over a thirty-nine year period, which was held to be insufficient to raise an inference that the exposure was a substantial factor in the development’of his disease.

According to Appellant, the frequency, regularity, proximity test has been adopted in a majority of jurisdictions in evaluating whether there is sufficient proof to support a reasonable inference of substantial-factor causation in an asbestos product liability case. <em>See generally Slaughter v. Southern Talc Co., </em><a href="/f2d/949/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="949 F.2d 167" data-case-ids="11933442" data-case-paths="/f2d/949/0167-01">949 F.2d 167</a>, 171 (5th Cir.1991) (“The most frequently used test for causation in asbestos cases is the ‘frequency-regularity-proximity’ test announced in <em>Lohrmann[.]”).</em>

Appellant urges that their application should not <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>depend on what type of evidence is adduced, but instead, upon whether the evidence, be it direct or circumstantial, creates a genuine issue of material fact concerning the cause of the plaintiffs (or decedent’s) disease. Appellant observes that a plaintiff’s burden of proof to demonstrate factual and proximate causation does not depend on whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial. Further, Appellant contends that plaintiffs rarely are able to offer evidence that is exclusively direct or circumstantial — most commonly, a plaintiff offers a combination of both categories of evidence. Moreover, Appellant develops that Pennsylvania courts do not place more or less weight on direct versus circumstantial evidence by reason of the character of the evidence alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

In particular, Appellant believes that the application of any looser test yields unfair results. For example, viewing the circumstances of the present case, Appellant believes that it is unfair for Appellee to hale a peripheral defendant, such as a retailer of automobile parts, into court based on direct evidence of minimal exposure, while ignoring Mr. Gregg’s forty-some-year history of occupational exposure to asbestos as asserted in the complaint. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for Appellant at 20 (“The plaintiff expected the trial court to turn a blind eye to all of the decedent’s occupational exposure in favor of placing liability on a party unlikely to have caused decedent’s illness.”). According to Appellant, permitting plaintiffs to pursue wholesale liability based on minor or infrequent exposure is out of sync with all reasonable probabilities concerning causation and creates a perverse incentive for plaintiffs to most aggressively <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>pursue those with the least possible culpability.
