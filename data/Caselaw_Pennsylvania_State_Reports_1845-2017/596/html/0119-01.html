    <p id="b185-7" data-blocks='[["BL_185.7",185,[128,1450,1155,744]]]'>The evidence at trial revealed the following facts. On February 3, 2002, at 1:27 a.m., police officers responded to a report of burglary in progress at the Empeñan Towers apartment building in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. Upon arrival they met William Cooper, appellant’s brother, who took the officers to his apartment. When first entering the apartment, the officers found the entryway closet open and its contents disturbed. Inside, the officers discovered Ms. House lying face-down in the hallway. There were no apparent signs of forced entry and no indications of a struggle. Nothing of value appeared to be missing and only a sofa cushion had been disturbed. The victim’s pocketbook was on a couch and a diamond ring and credit card were lying on the floor. The victim had not been sexually assaulted.</p>
    <p id="b185-8" data-blocks='[["BL_185.8",185,[131,2224,1149,149]],["BL_186.1",186,[284,324,1159,198]]]'>An autopsy indicated that Ms. House had been strangled to death. The medical examiner testified that there were no signs of a defensive struggle. A mark on her forehead was <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>consistent with a fall to a carpeted surface. The medical examiner likened his findings in this case to other post mortems where large men were quickly subdued by a strangulation attack from behind.</p>
    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[281,561,1164,844]]]'>William Cooper and Sherita House had been dating for over a year and Ms. House Was three and one-half months pregnant with William’s child at the time of her death. According to William, appellant had stayed at the couple’s apartment for two nights prior to the killing. Appellant was a temporary guest, who did not possess a key to the apartment, or a security card to the building. However, appellant was aware of a side exit-door which typically was propped open by those using it to leave and then reenter the building. On the afternoon of the murder, Ms. House was getting ready for her 4:00 p.m. shift at Boscov’s department store. William and appellant left the apartment at about 2:30 p.m., as Ms. House was preparing for work. The brothers intended to take a train into Center City Philadelphia. They used the side exit-door when leaving the apartment complex on their way to the train station.</p>
    <p id="b186-6" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[281,1444,1164,365]]]'>When the train arrived, William began to board the train, but appellant did not. Appellant explained to William that he had changed his mind, and had decided to catch a bus to his former girlfriend’s house in order to visit his child. William got on the train and appellant walked away from the station. William’s cellular phone records for the afternoon and evening substantiated his account of his activities that day.</p>
    <p id="b186-7" data-blocks='[["BL_186.7",186,[278,1841,1165,528]]]'>Following the discovery of the victim and as the criminal investigation progressed, police sought to interview appellant. Detectives went to the home where appellant had been living with his girlfriend, but before they could speak to him, he jumped out a back window and fled. For the next twelve days, police attempted to locate appellant, without success, and appellant made no attempt to contact detectives. On February 18, 2002, armed with a search warrant, detectives went back to the same house, found appellant, and transported him to police headquarters for an interview.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[134,323,1156,681]]]'>
      <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>Once in custody, appellant told police that after William boarded the train, he went to a doughnut shop several blocks and several bus stops away from the train station. He then took a bus to his former girlfriend’s house, arriving there at about 4:30 or 4:45 p.m. A detective retraced appellant’s purported route at the same time and day of the week, finding that it took 45 minutes to arrive at the girlfriend’s house, leaving a period of at least an hour when appellant’s whereabouts were unknown. Ms. Danine Cox, appellant’s former girlfriend and the mother of his child, testified that appellant arrived at her home at about 4:00 p.m. that Saturday afternoon. Earlier, she told police that appellant could have arrived after 4:00 p.m.</p>
    <p id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[134,1030,1156,522]]]'>On February 26, 2002, William Cooper began to cooperate more fully with police. He admitted that he had been selling marijuana, and had purchased a pound of marijuana the evening prior to Ms. House’s death. William explained that appellant was with him when he bought the drugs. Appellant saw William place the marijuana in a “City Blue” bag, hide the bag in the closet by the front door, and place appellant’s red and black gym bag on top of the drugs in the closet. William also hid his gun, a .380 semi-automatic, beneath the sofa cushion, while appellant was present that night.</p>
    <p id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[132,1578,1159,791]],["BL_188.1",188,[288,319,1161,204]]]'>Upon receiving this information from William, police went to the home where appellant lived and interviewed Christina Shaird, the mother of appellant’s girlfriend. Ms. Shaird told police that in the days following the murder she had seen appellant with a “City Blue” bag containing marijuana and also had observed a black and red gym bag with a “lot of weed” in it, beneath Willie’s bed. Ms. Shaird’s son, Antwan, who also lived at the residence, sold marijuana for appellant and had been arrested for drug sales shortly after Ms. House’s murder. During this same time period, Ms. Shaird’s other son, Dwaine, observed Antwan return marijuana to appellant and saw that appellant possessed a gray, dark colored gun with a clip. Antwan also saw appellant with a gun at that time; he described the weapon as a green and brown automatic, with a nine round clip. Ms. Shaird consented to a <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>search of her home, where police retrieved a black gym bag with red trim from a closet. No drugs were found in the bag, but a canine sniff test resulted in a positive indication for illegal drugs.</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[289,552,1158,530]]]'>At trial, appellant defended the matter by placing blame for the murder on his brother William. Several defense witnesses testified that William and Ms. House had been in a violent relationship, that Ms. House had shown them burn marks and bruises on her body some months earlier, and that she had said she intended to leave William. Appellant also suggested that perhaps the murder had been committed by William’s rivals in the drug trade. The jury rejected both defense theories and accepted the Commonwealth’s version of events, finding appellant guilty of all charges.</p>

We must determine whether the evidence admitted at trial, and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, supports all of the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

Further, all of the other evidence recited above, albeit primarily circumstantial, was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the murder.

We observe, however, that even if we assume that the evidence should have been admitted, we would conclude that its exclusion was harmless here. The record reflects that defense counsel was successful in presenting to the jury evidence of William’s physically abusive relationship with the victim. The jury heard testimony from her co-workers, and defense counsel engaged in zealous cross-examination of William at trial. Further, and perhaps most important, the prosecution conceded this aspect of the couple’s relationship in his closing argument. Thus, the jury was aware that the couple’s relationship was a stormy one, and that William abused the victim some months prior to her murder.

You don't have to be expert, I submit, in the field, if you will, because every juror is permitted to use their common sense, their intellect, their wisdom, their human experiences, and their knowledge of human behavior, and you can apply that to the facts of this case, and any of you people-and I'm sure that all of you people have heard numerous situations, or seen them on TV, or read about them, of domestic murders. I submit to you that a domestic murder-I assume that they are trying to get you to believe that in order to take the heat off Willie, and take the focus off him, and put it on his <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>brother, William, but it doesn’t fit what happened to Sherita. The domestic type of murder is almost like a script. It is orchestrated like a dance. It starts with words, yelling, screaming, taunting, cursing, and putting the person down. That turns into a shove; it turns into a push; it turns into a kick; it turns into a stomp; it turns into a beating; and the woman invariably is beaten, and bruised and battered, because that’s part of the psychology of an abuser. It wouldn’t be good enough to just come up behind her, catch her unaware, off guard, put your fingers around her neck, and strangle her to death, because the abuser would want to humiliate her, would want to see fear, would want to subject her to his will. In a domestic murder, there are loud voices, yelling, screaming, things getting thrown, things getting broken, things getting pulled apart, people getting hit, people getting punched, people getting stomped. There is bruising and battering, and then the killing. This is not what happened to Sherita House. Nobody heard a thing inside that apartment, because it happened quietly. It happened quickly. She was caught off guard and unaware. That type of murder is not consistent with someone like William Cooper killing his own girlfriend.” Trial Court Opinion at 10-11.</p>

Further, even if the claim had merit, we nonetheless would conclude that appellant failed to meet the second prong of ineffectiveness. At the evidentiary hearing on this issue, defense counsel testified that he did not object to the charge after it was given because he believed it was appropriate under the Commonwealth’s theory of the case. N.T. 4/8/04 at 15-16. More importantly, counsel explained that the charge perhaps would be helpful to the defense, in that it required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant used trickery or subterfuge to gain entry. Where counsel employs a reasonable strategy designed to advance his client’s interests, he will be deemed effective. <em>Commonwealth v.

The very purpose of such an improper invitation is to prejudice the opposition by introducing an irrelevancy as if it were a proper penalty argument.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Such attempts to circumvent the statutorily mandated sentencing scheme should be disapproved in the strongest terms. Nevertheless, the fact that the attempt here was pitifully botched does not prove that, had the argument not been made, the jury probably would not have returned the death penalty. In my judgment, it is a very close question whether any actual prejudice arose from counsel’s improper invitation. The Majority concludes that “it is inconceivable to suggest that the statement had no effect on the jury” because, upon deliberation, the jurors immediately requested that the trial judge provide them with a Bible. Majority Op. at 666. The trial judge, however, just as promptly denied the request, telling the jurors that doing so would be “inappropriate” and reminding them that they must “decide the penalty based on the facts as you find them, and the law as I gave it to you.” Notes of Testimony, 10/3/03, at 3. Moreover, the jury in this case found no mitigating circumstances and a single aggravating circumstance (that appellant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony), and the botched improper argument had nothing to do with that aggravating circumstance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Counsel’s improper “eye for an eye” biblical reference was irrelevant and, being irrelevant, it is hard to see specific prejudice.</p>
