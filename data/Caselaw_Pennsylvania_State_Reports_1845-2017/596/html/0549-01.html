While this argument has some facial appeal, on closer examination it is unavailing. Article II of the Pennsylvania Constitution is entitled, “The Legislature,” and the first six sections deal exclusively with the two Chambers of that body — the Senate and the House of Representatives. Section 7, by contrast, applies more broadly as, by its own terms, it pertains to eligibility both to the General Assembly and to <em>“any </em>office of trust or profit in this Commonwealth” (emphasis added). Respondent does not offer any explanation of why a judicial office should not be considered an office of trust within the Commonwealth. Indeed, consistent with the sweeping nature of the text, Section 7 has been broadly applied to other offices besides Member of House or Senate. <em>See, e.g., Hughes, </em>516 Pa. at 95, 582 A.2d at 300 (applying Section 7 to preclude the defendant from holding office on the Philadelphia City Council); <em>Bolus v. Fisher, </em><a href="/a2d/785/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="785 A.2d 174" data-case-ids="9457071" data-case-paths="/a2d/785/0174-01">785 A.2d 174</a>, 175-76 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) (applying the provision to restrain the litigant from seeking mayoral office). We find, therefore, that the placement of Article II, Section 7 within the portion of the Constitution generally addressed to the Legislature does not prevent its application to officers of the judicial branch of government.</p>

As for the portion of this claim sounding in estoppel, the doctrine contains three elements: “1) misleading words, conduct, or silence by the party against whom the estoppel is asserted; 2) unambiguous proof of reasonable reliance upon the misrepresentation by the party asserting the estoppel; and 3) the lack of a duty to inquire on the party asserting the estoppel.” <em>Chester Extended Care Ctr. v. Department of Pub. Welfare, </em><a href="/pa/526/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="526 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1825871" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0350-01">526 Pa. 350</a>, 355, <a href="/pa/526/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="526 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1825871" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0350-01">586 A.2d 379</a>, 382 (1991). Respondent does not identify these factors or make any effort to satisfy them. As her brief contains no substantive argument pertaining to estoppel as such, any claim based upon the estoppel doctrine is waived. <em>See Commonwealth v.
