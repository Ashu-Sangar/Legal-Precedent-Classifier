She subsequently brought a civil action seeking damages against the individual defendants and the Philadelphia Phillies, Inc., which was also named as a party to this action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The individual defendants defended, in part, by asserting that T.G. consented to sexual activities with them and, therefore, there was no sexual assault. There is no dispute that, given T.G.’s age, 11, consent would not be available as a defense if the individual defendants were charged criminally.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The question before us <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>regarding the individual defendants is whether the defense of consent may be asserted in this civil action. The trial court and the Superior Court concluded that, in the context of a civil trial, defendants are permitted to raise a minor victim’s consent. For the following reasons, we conclude that, where the victim is less than 18 years of age, evidence of the victim’s consent to sexual contact, like in criminal proceedings, is not an available defense in determining a defendant’s civil liability. Accordingly, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court affirming the trial court with respect to the individual defendants, and remand the matter to the Superior Court with instructions to remand to the trial court for a new trial. Moreover, the Phillies contend that, through special interrogatories, the jury determined that it was not negligent, and therefore, the issue of consent is irrelevant to it, and the jury verdict in its favor should stand. We agree, and affirm that portion of the Superior Court’s decision.</p>

On August 9, 2000, T.G. was attending a Phillies baseball game at Veteran’s Stadium in Philadelphia with an adult family friend (hereinafter, “guardian”). At some point during the game, T.G. was separated from her guardian and became lost inside the stadium. T.G. asserts that she then sought help from the Phillies’ security personnel, who T.G. alleges failed to assist her in finding her guardian, in contravention to the team’s “Lost People Policy.” <em>See </em>Appellants’ Brief at 6. It is undisputed, however, that she eventually encountered the individual defendants, who were then 15 and 16 years old and <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>employed at a concession stand at the stadium. According to T.G., these defendants offered to help her locate a telephone, but instead led her to a secluded area outside the stadium where they forcibly removed her clothes and sexually assaulted her. <em>Id. </em>As explained below, while the parties disagree on whether intercourse occurred, they all agree that some type of sexual contact took place.</p>
    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[131,734,1158,1012]]]'>T.G. was eventually reunited with her guardian and the incident was reported to the police, after which T.G. explained to the responding officers that she had been raped by the individual defendants. Fabrizzio, Searuzzi, and Ibbetson were then charged as delinquents in juvenile court, with Searuzzi and Ibbetson ultimately being found guilty and adjudicated delinquent, while Fabrizzio was found not guilty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thereafter, T.G. and her parent, C.C.H., (collectively, “Appellants”) filed a civil complaint in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas against the individual defendants, claiming that they committed a battery against T.G. by forcibly removing her clothing and, <em>inter alia, </em>engaging in vaginal and anal intercourse with her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellants alleged in their complaint that T.G. suffered physical trauma as well as mental anguish from the incident. Finally, as noted earlier, Appellants also named the Phillies as a defendant for its alleged negligence in failing to follow the team’s “Lost People Policy” which, according to Appellants, required security personnel to escort T.G. to safety and assist her in locating her guardian.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

N.T., 2/25, 2005, at 44. Fabrizzio’s counsel then stated that T.G. had been “flirting with the boys” at the stadium, and that she engaged in sexually explicit conversations with the individual defendants prior to the sexual contact. <em>Id. </em>Counsel for defendant Scaruzzi, during her opening statement, emphasized to the jury that her client was not denying that he had sexual contact with T.G., but was arguing that no intercourse had occurred. N.T., 2/25/2005, at 27, 38-39. Scaruzzi’s counsel then stated that T.G. voluntarily went with the boys outside the stadium, where the sexual contact later occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28.</p>

N.T., 2/28/2005, at 26-29. Appellants had requested an instruction based on the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 101 <em>et seq., </em>for rape of a child under the age of 13, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(c), which, as noted, makes it a crime to engage in intercourse with a minor under 13 irrespective of the minor’s consent. <em>'See </em>R.R. at 211a. As will be discussed, the trial court ultimately did not provide the requested instruction, <em>see </em>N.T., 3/17/2005, at 53-54, and in addition, made a general ruling during the colloquy that T.G.’s consent to sexual contact was relevant and could be introduced at trial as a defense to T.G.’s claims of negligence and battery involving a sexual assault. N.T., 2/28/2005, at 26-27. Appellants’ counsel objected, alleging that consent was not relevant because T.G. was under 13 years of age and, as such, sexual contact with her is considered a crime regardless of her purported consent. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29. The trial judge then explained to T.G.’s counsel that, although consent is not an <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>available defense in the criminal context, the instant matter was a civil proceeding and, as such, evidence of T.G.’s consent is not precluded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

During questioning, the individual defendants denied engaging in sexual intercourse with T.G., but admitted that sexual contact had occurred and asserted that T.G. had consented to such contact. With respect to Fabrizzio, Appellants’ counsel asked him whether T.G. was a willing participant in the sexual conduct, to which Fabrizzio responded in the affirmative. Similarly, when asked whether T.G. had mentioned anything sexual in her conversations with him prior to engaging in the sexual contact, Scaruzzi stated that T.G. had been very “flirty” with him. N.T., 2/28/2005, at 18. Finally, the Phillies called a witness who testified that she observed T.G. approach the individual defendants and offer to perform sexual favors for them.</p>

Thus, the court did not provide the jury with any guidance on the relevance of T.G.’s age in relation to the alleged sexual contact.

Appellants then appealed to the Superior Court and filed a timely concise statement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), wherein Appellants claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in denying them a new trial because the court improperly permitted defense counsel to raise the issue of T.G.’s alleged consent to sexual activity. In response, the trial court issued an opinion in which it opined that, unlike in a criminal proceeding, in a civil proceeding, consent is at issue even where the minor is under 18 years of age. The court further stated that it was Appellants’ counsel, and not defense counsel, that had introduced the issue of consent when he called Fabrizzio and Scaruzzi to the stand and questioned them on whether T.G. had acted voluntarily in participating in the sexual encounter. Accordingly, the court concluded that it acted within its discretion in permitting the issue of consent to be introduced in this manner.</p>

In regards to rape, the court opined that the individual defendants were entitled to explain their side of the story by alleging that no intercourse had, in fact, occurred. The court also acknowledged that there is an age of consent to sexual contact provided in the Crimes Code, but stated that it did not necessarily apply in a civil battery case.

Appellants begin their argument by noting that various statutes under the Crimes Code criminalize sexual contact with minors under 13 irrespective of the minor’s consent. In this regard, Appellants point out that consent is not a defense to rape of a child, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(c), aggravated indecent assault of a child, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3125(b), indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3126(a)(7),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Appellants also note that some of these statutes impose harsher penalties when the victim is less than 13 years of age. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 3125(b), 3126(a)(7). Appellants claim that, by precluding the defense of consent for minors under 13 in a variety of contexts, and by imposing harsher penalties in some scenarios, the legislature has implicitly recognized that persons under 13 are incompetent to consent to sexual contact. More importantly, Appellants argue that, by creating stricter standards when dealing with young children, these statutes reflect a legislative intent to protect persons under 13, as a class, from sexual exploitation. Accordingly, Appellants assert that it would be inconsistent with this intent, and contrary to public policy, to preclude the defense of consent in criminal cases but to allow the defense in civil matters.</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.7",92,[285,1213,1162,850]],["BL_93.1",93,[129,316,1153,95]]]'>Appellants emphasize that this Court has previously recognized that statutes setting forth what conduct is criminal, and hence, socially unacceptable, can be used to set the legal parameters for establishing both criminal and civil liability. For instance, Appellants note that this Court has relied upon the criminal prohibition against persons under 21 years of age from consuming alcoholic beverages in defining an adult social host’s duty of care in furnishing alcohol to minors. <em>See Alumni Association v. Sullivan, </em><a href="/pa/524/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="524 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1822828" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0356-01">524 Pa. 356</a>, <a href="/pa/524/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="524 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1822828" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0356-01">572 A.2d 1209</a>, 1212 (1990) (explaining that the consumption of alcohol by persons under 21 violates the Criminal Code and, therefore, an adult social host serving alcohol to minors is negligent <em>per </em>se). Consequently, Appellants urge this Court to recognize that, by deeming persons under 13 years old incompetent to consent to sexual contact, and by criminalizing sexual contact with such persons irrespective of their consent, the legislature has de<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>fined a standard of conduct that applies generally in defining liability in both criminal and civil contexts.</p>
    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[127,454,1156,1189]]]'>Appellants also rely on cases from other jurisdictions that have applied a criminal bar to the defense of consent in civil proceedings. For example, Appellants note that Minnesota has a criminal statute providing that consent is not defense to a charge of statutory rape when the victim is between the ages of 13 and 16 and the perpetrator is 48 months older than the victim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> In determining whether a victim’s consent was also precluded as a defense in civil proceedings, the Minnesota Court of Appeals interpreted this statute as evincing a legislative intent to protect a class of minors of certain ages from sexual contact in general, irrespective of consent. <em>Bjerke v. Johnson, </em><a href="/nw2d/727/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="727 N.W.2d 183" data-case-ids="8331905" data-case-paths="/nw2d/727/0183-01">727 N.W.2d 183</a>, 193 (Minn.Ct.App.2007). The court then concluded that it would be contrary to this intent to allow the defense of consent to be admitted to negate civil liability, where the same defense would be precluded in the criminal context. <em>Id.; see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 892C(2) (1965) (“If conduct is made criminal in order to protect a certain class of persons irrespective of their consent, the consent of members of that class to the conduct is not effective to bar a tort action.”).

The defendants suggest that, had the legislature intended to establish 13 as the age in which a minor is deemed legally capable of consenting to sexual contact, it would have enacted legislation to that effect.

In defining these crimes, a common thread throughout these'statutes is that, if the Commonwealth proves that a victim is under the age of 13 and the defendant engaged in the prohibited conduct, criminal liability is established, and the victim’s consent is not an available defense. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(c) (rape of a child); 18 Pa.C.S. § 3125(b) (aggravated indecent assault of a child), 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123(b) (involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a child); 18 Pa.C.S. § 3126(a)(7) (indecent assault). By imposing liability whenever the victim is below a certain age threshold, the legislature has in essence made it a crime <em>per se </em>for defendants to have sexual contact with minors under a certain age, irrespective of whether the minor putatively consented to such contact.

(2) To be effective, consent must be (a) by one who has the capacity to consent or by a person empowered to consent for him, and (b) to the particular conduct, or to substantially the same conduct.” Respectfully, the citation to the Restatement supports our position by recognizing that, before consent can be asserted as an affirmative defense, the person purportedly consenting must "halve] the capacity to consent ...". <em><a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20356" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="188 A. 356">Id.</a> </em>In this case, T.G., as an 11-year-old child, simply did not have the capacity to consent to sexual contact.
