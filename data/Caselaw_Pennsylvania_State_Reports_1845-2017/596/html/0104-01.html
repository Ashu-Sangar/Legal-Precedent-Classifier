Nevertheless, in terms of the overall reasonableness of enforcing the time limitation on state collateral review, it bears mention that the sentencing jury did initially note the absence of prior offenses as a mitigating factor on the verdict slip, but subsequently rejected it by drawing a line through the words “first offense” in the mitigation category. It seems implausible that jurors who considered but rejected the notion that Appellant’s lack of a criminal history represented meaningful mitigation would find that this factor offset the substantial aggravation that was established by the Commonwealth. Further, I remain of the view that the time bar is a rational and perhaps necessary legislative response to serial challenges raised by prisoners that undermine finality and tax government resources, and to effectively implement a limitation, exceptions by their nature must contain effective boundaries. <em>See Bennett, </em>593 Pa. at 407-08, 930 A.2d at 1279 (Saylor, J., dissenting).
