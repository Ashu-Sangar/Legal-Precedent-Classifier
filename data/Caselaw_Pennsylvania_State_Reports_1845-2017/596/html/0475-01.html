    <p id="b536-8" data-blocks='[["BL_536.8",536,[297,827,1160,788]]]'>In this appeal, we are asked to determine whether the Commonwealth must prove that an offender acted with intent to cause substantial “public” harm or serious “public” inconvenience in order to grade the offender’s disorderly conduct conviction as a misdemeanor of the third degree pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503(b). Because we determine that 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503(b) requires the Commonwealth to prove in a third-degree misdemeanor disorderly conduct prosecution that the offender acted with intent to cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, rather than to prove substantial “public” harm or serious “public” inconvenience, and because the Commonwealth did prove in this case that Appellee, Jennifer Ann Fedorek, acted with intent to cause substantial harm, we reverse the Superior Court’s reversal and reinstate the judgment of sentence.</p>

On the evening in question, the victim was approached at the club by Schmader, Appellee, and Appellee’s boyfriend, Eric Hutchinson. Schmader asked the victim to talk with him outside of the club, the victim agreed, and all four left the building together.</p>

Schmader repeatedly poked the victim in the <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>chest as he yelled, and the victim continued to back away as Schmader advanced. This went on for some time; indeed, Schmader backed the victim 25 to 30 feet along the front length of the club and then around the building’s corner for another 10 to 15 feet toward its delivery entrance. The victim later testified that Appellee stood behind Schmader during this time yelling “Come on, Jack, hurt him. F-him up. Hurt him.”</p>
    <p id="b537-7" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[134,757,1156,681]]]'>The victim and Schmader continued to argue. When the victim interjected words questioning Schmader’s ability as a parent, Schmader grabbed the victim about the shoulders and Hutchinson grabbed the victim around the neck. The victim began to have difficulty breathing and felt a sensation of panic. When the grip on his neck slackened, the victim yelled out for help. Eventually, the victim fell or was pushed to the ground, hit his head, and was kicked by one of his assailants in the left side. The victim then saw Appellee in the driver’s seat of Schmader’s Jeep. She had the driver’s door open and yelled for Schmader and Hutchinson to “get in and get the hell out of here.” Appellee, Schmader, and Hutchinson left the scene in that vehicle.</p>

Thus, the court held that although the word “public” is absent from Section 5503(b), the clear intent of the statute compelled the conclusion that a third-degree misdemeanor conviction for disorderly conduct must be based on evidence of the offender’s intent to cause substantial “public” harm or serious “public” inconvenience.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

These individual acts focus upon the offender’s <em>behavior. </em>One such act, pertinent to the instant case is “engaging] in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503(a)(1). Significant is the fact that the General Assembly did not require that this prohibited act be directed at a certain number of persons that could qualify as “the public.” Therefore, when an offender engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior in a public arena, even when that conduct is directed at only <em>one other person, </em>the offender may be subject to conviction for disorderly conduct. <em>Hock, supra </em>at 420, <a href="/a2d/728/0943-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="728 A.2d 943" data-case-ids="11626823,607149" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0943-01,/pa/556/0409-01">728 A.2d at 948</a> (Castille, J, dissenting).

The evidence in support of Appellee’s conviction for disorderly conduct is that Appellee observed her brother in a verbal confrontation with the victim concerning a domestic dispute, placed herself in close proximity to the action, and exhorted her brother to “hurt” and “f- up” the victim. Immediately thereafter, the brother and Appellee’s boyfriend assaulted the victim. Clearly, Appellee intended “harm” by her actions: she forthrightly encouraged one person to “hurt” another. Just as clearly, Appellee intended that this harm be “substantial.” “F-up” has relevantly been defined as “to ruin or spoil.” <em>Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary </em>470 (10th ed. 1996). In the context of Appellee’s use of the phrase and under the circumstances of the roiling confrontation between Appellee’s brother and the victim, one may certainly conclude that the harm Appellee intended against the victim in the public arena was “substantial.” Indeed, it is difficult to envision an opposite conclusion. Therefore, we hold that the evidence fully supported the jury’s finding of guilt on the charge of disorderly conduct as a misdemeanor of the third degree.

The Superior Court majority also found support for its conclusion after examining several additional factors. One factor was that Section 5503 is included in Article F of the Crimes Code, entitled “Offenses Against Public Order and Decency,” which Article, the court noted, involves crimes protecting the public against antisocial acts that violate standards of public decency and order, such as public drunkenness. <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>Another factor was the majority's interpretation of commentary to Section 250.2 of the Model Penal Code, from which Section 5503 was adopted. <em>See </em>Official Comment' — 1972 to 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503 (stating that "[tjhis section is derived from Section 250.2 of the Model Penal Code”). The court reasoned that because the Model Penal Code commentary emphasized that the crime of disorderly conduct is intended to penalize <em>public </em>nuisance, the more severe punishment provided for in 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503(b) was "clearly intended” to be imposed only for substantial <em>public </em>harm or serious <em>public </em>inconvenience. <em>Commonwealth v.

The neighbor was hosting a birthday party for his son at the time of the incident. The Superior Court first determined that the Commonwealth had failed to establish the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for disorderly conduct because the neighbor’s home did not constitute a public place. The court further stated that even if the area where the defendant had discharged his gun could be considered "public," the Commonwealth still had failed to prove the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for misdemeanor disorderly conduct because the defendant "denied any intent to cause serious public inconvenience or substantial harm to the public,” and the circumstances indicated that the defendant's actions "were directed at [only] a lone individual.” <em><a href="/a2d/695/0794-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="695 A.2d 794" data-case-ids="11972645" data-case-paths="/a2d/695/0794-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/695/0794-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="695 A.2d 794" data-case-ids="11972645" data-case-paths="/a2d/695/0794-01">at 798-99</a>.
