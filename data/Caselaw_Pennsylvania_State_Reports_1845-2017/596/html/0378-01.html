On June 3, 2007, Judge Hoover entertained oral argument on petitioners’ filings.

An order in connection with a Grand Jury is renewable under Pa.R.A.P. 3331(a), <em>supra, </em>but under subsection (d) of that rule, which we have quoted above, review is limited to final orders.

Specifically, petitioners note that Section 1402(a)(4), which addresses costs reimbursement incurred by the State Police and Attorney General while carrying out their responsibilities under the Act, fails to mention district attorneys. Petitioners extrapolate from this funding gap that the General Assembly must have intended to subordinate the authority of county district attorneys to that of the Attorney General. Along similar lines, petitioners note the absence of any mention of county district attorneys in Section 1207(14), which describes the Gaming Board’s power to consult with the State Police and the Attorney General, and Section 1408(c), which provides for local law enforcement grants. In petitioners’ view, this silence should be interpreted as <em>sub silentio </em>indication of a fixed legislative intent to subordinate local district attorneys’ prosecutorial authority under the Act. <em>See </em>4 Pa.C.S. §§ 1207(14), 1408(c).</p>

The Attorney General first cites the plain language of Section 1517. The Attorney Gener<a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>al also notes that Section 1517 creates two “in-house” investigative and enforcement entities — the Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement, and the Office of Enforcement Counsel— but expressly limits these entities to noncriminal matters. The Attorney General'then cites Section 1517(d), which speaks directly to the investigative authority of both the Attorney General and local district attorneys. Based on this plain language, the Attorney General echoes the view of the District Attorney, that Section 1517(d) controls. Furthermore, in the view of the Attorney General, the Sections of the Gaming Act that petitioners cite as indicative of a different legislative intent are unrelated to the question of prosecutorial authority.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[291,977,1164,626]]]'>The Attorney General further notes that nothing in the Act renders the authority of district attorneys subordinate to that of the Attorney General, and therefore, prosecutorial authority under the Act is patently concurrent. The Attorney General notes that if the General Assembly wanted the Attorney General to have exclusive or primary authority over criminal violations of the Gaming Act, it easily could have done so explicitly. Thus, for example, the Attorney General notes that the General Assembly could have acted as it did when drafting the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which has a provision specifically granting the Attorney General exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute criminal violations of that Act. <em>See </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 13A09(h).</p>

The Attorney General notes that this attenuated statutory construction argument cannot overcome the plain language of Section 1517(d)(1). In the Attorney General’s view, the financial provisions address the practical realities of administering the Office of Attorney General as an agency with statewide jurisdiction. In contrast, the jurisdiction of a county district attorney is limited to a single county, and the resources for conducting such localized investigations typically exist in place. Furthermore, the Attorney General highlights the necessity of additional dedicated funding for his office because Section <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>1517(c.l) of the Gaming Act mandates the creation of a gaming unit within the Office of Attorney General. Additionally, the Attorney General notes that the language of Section 1207(14) permitting the Board to seek necessary advice does not speak exclusively to the Attorney General; county district attorneys could certainly constitute the “other persons” the Board deems necessary to consult for advice.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[132,711,1156,839]]]'>We agree with the Attorney General’s straightforward and comprehensive analysis. Section 1517 of the Act plainly confers authority upon county district attorneys to prosecute violations of the Act and does not subordinate that authority to that of the Attorney General. Nor does Section 1517 purport to limit that authority to post-licensing crimes. Just as importantly, nothing in the Act purports to remove or limit the existing general authority of county district attorneys to investigate crimes occurring in their jurisdiction. The unrelated Sections of the Act relied upon by petitioners, which speak to issues other than prosecutorial authority, simply cannot negate by inference the plain and unambiguous language of the Act. It is also notable that the Office of Attorney General, the very Commonwealth Officer whose authority petitioners claim the District Attorney is usurping, argues in favor of concurrent jurisdiction under the Act.</p>

A district attorney is the chief law enforcement officer in the county in which he or she is elected. 71 P.S. § 732-206(a). A district attorney is charged with prosecuting all criminal and other prosecutions occurring in his or her county, in addition to all other duties prescribed by other statutes. <em>See </em>19 P.S. § 1402(a); 16 P.S. § 9952. The types of possible criminal violations being investigated by the District Attorney in this case — false statements/perjury related to the licensing process, which occurred within his territorial jurisdiction — are clearly within the scope of veracity-based crimes recognized by the Gaming Act. <em>See </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1518(a)(1) (veracity-based crimes defined in Chapter 49 of Title 18 of the <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (the Crimes Code) have been made applicable to “any person providing information or making any statement ... to the board, the bureau, the department, the Pennsylvania State Police or the Office of Attorney General, as required by [the Act]”). As governed by the Pennsylvania Investigating Grand Jury Act, an investigating Grand Jury is one of the tools Pennsylvania law provides to prosecutors. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 4541 <em>et seq. </em>Nothing in the Gaming Act or the Grand Jury Act appears to limit a county district attorney’s use of an investigating Grand Jury in the present circumstances.</p>

The essentially political points that petitioners allege — a runaway district attorney unhappy with the Board’s licensing decision, pursuing an agenda — are not relevant to the task of interpretation. The Gaming Act, as written, authorizes the investigation here. Accordingly, we hold that county district attorneys share concurrent jurisdiction with the Attorney General to investigate criminal violations of the Gaming Act, and that the Gaming Act does not limit the existing authority of local prosecutors. Because the Grand Jury investigation in this case falls within the District Attorney’s powers, this Court, exercising plenary review, rejects petitioners’ challenge to the authority of the Dauphin County District Attorney.</p>

By subpoenaing documents relating to Petitioners’ gaming application and license, the District Attorney is attempting to unravel the extensive proceedings that have been conducted by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board after an exhaustive investigative and adjudicatory process and which were affirmed by this Court in <em>Pocono Manor Investors, L.P. v. Gaming Control Board, </em><a href="/pa/592/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="592 Pa. 625" data-case-ids="3555692" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0625-01">592 Pa. 625</a>, <a href="/pa/592/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="927 A.2d 209" data-case-ids="3555692,8396986" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0625-01,/a2d/927/0209-01">927 A.2d 209</a> (2007). The Legislature surely could not have contemplated such a distorted application of Section 1517 of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[290,994,1167,581]]]'>A more prudent scheme would designate the Office of Attorney General as the sole prosecutorial body to <em>uniformly </em>enforce the comprehensive statutory scheme for gaming license approval. In my view, the General Assembly envisioned such an approach and merely intended for Section 1517 to afford local district attorneys the authority to carry out their traditional role of investigating and prosecuting crimes that may occur on the premises of a gaming facility. However, because my view is not supported by the Legislature’s use of broad statutory language in Section 1517, I am constrained to join in the Majority’s result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

This smacks of a personal quest of someone either seeking personal aggrandizement or a vendetta against a family or an ethnic group. Whatever the motive, it is intolerable that what goes on in a confidential grand jury is published the next day by the media.</p>
