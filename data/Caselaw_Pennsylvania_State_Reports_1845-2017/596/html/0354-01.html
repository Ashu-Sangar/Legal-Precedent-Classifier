In May 2001, the trial court imposed a sentence of incarceration spanning from four to eight years. Appellant secured substitute counsel, who sought to make an oral post-sentence motion; further, counsel indicated that he intended to file written post-sentence motions identical to those that had been filed by a codefendant. Counsel, however, failed to follow through on this commitment, and written post-sentence motions were never filed. The trial court nevertheless issued an order purporting to deny Appellant’s post-sentence motions in April 2002, eleven months after sentencing.</p>

At a hearing on the petition, the Commonwealth stipulated that Appellant’s appellate counsel was ineffective in his failure to file a timely post-sentence motion or notice of appeal. The PCRA court reinstated Appellant’s direct appeal rights but denied relief on the merits of the substantive challenges that Appellant had presented. Appellant lodged an appeal in the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[130,946,1160,1230]]]'>In a divided memorandum opinion, a panel of the Superior Court quashed the appeal, holding that the post-conviction court lacked jurisdiction to reinstate Appellant’s direct appeal rights or to otherwise adjudicate his claims for relief, in light of the PCRA’s timing provision requiring that any post-conviction petition be filed within one year of the date when the judgment became final. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b). Initially, the lead author observed that compliance with the one-year timing limitation has been construed by this Court to be a jurisdictional requisite to post-conviction review. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The author reasoned that, in the absence of a timely written post-sentence motion, Appellant’s judgment of sentence became final in June 2001, thirty days after sentence imposition; thus, to implicate a PCRA court’s jurisdiction, any post-conviction petition was due to be filed by June 2002. In a footnote, the lead author recognized this Court’s decision in <em>Murray, </em><a href="/pa/562/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="562 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="225995" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0001-01">562 Pa. at 1</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="753 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="11205468,225995" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0201-01,/pa/562/0001-01">753 A.2d at 201</a>, and the Superior Court’s in <em>Commonwealth v.

Further, he observes that, under the Commonwealth’s theory, by the time counsel’s dereliction was discovered by him <em>(i.e., </em>when the Superior Court quashed his initial appeal from the judgment of sentence), the one-year period for the filing of a timely post-conviction petition already would have expired. Thus, he asks this Court to apply the approach from <em>Murray </em>to conclude that his petition was not jurisdictionally precluded. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, supports the reasoning of the lead author of the Superi- or Court panel. Further, it requests that we take this opportunity to modify <em>Murray, </em>since it is in clear conflict with the language of Section 9545(b)(3), which prescribes that the one-year time period for filing a PCRA petition commences upon the expiration of the period allowed for filing a direct appeal, where no such appeal is timely filed. According to the Commonwealth, to rule otherwise would not only disregard an express legislative prescription, but also, would permit defendants to extend the time for asserting PCRA claims by merely lodging untimely submissions in the appellate courts.</p>

Notably, the Court’s error in this regard was not significant to the outcome of <em>Mum-ay, </em>as the petitioner’s post-conviction submission was untimely utilizing either the correct and earlier date of December 1995 (thirty days after imposition of sentence) in the calculation or the later date that <em>Murray </em>employed. <em>See Murray, </em><a href="/pa/562/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="562 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="225995" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0001-01">562 Pa. at 5</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="753 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="11205468,225995" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0201-01,/pa/562/0001-01">753 A.2d at 203</a>.

With respect to the 1995 PCRA amendments, it is worth noting that there is nothing unconstitutional, or even unwise, about the General Assembly’s concern with finality. Like various pieces of legislation, the 1995 amendments were a response to existing abuses. Not coincidentally, the federal habeas statute was amended around the same time, and Congress likewise adopted a time-bar as well as other restrictions, similar to those found in the PCRA, designed to curb abuses and to bring finality to criminal cases. Prior to the PCRA amendments which included the one-year time-bar, Pennsylvania capital defendants tended to sit on their collateral review rights, except in the rare instance where the Governor signed a death warrant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>
      <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>Meanwhile, non-capital defendants were free to file for collateral review early and often, and many abused the indulgence. Indeed, it was not uncommon to see an appeal involving a sixth or seventh collateral attack, which required an absurd waste of resources. The abuse was so rampant in serial petition cases that this Court, well in advance of the legislative reaction, itself adopted a significant, non-statutory restriction upon the prospect for post-conviction relief. Thus, in <em>Commonwealth v. Lawson, </em><a href="/pa/519/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="519 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1813563" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0504-01">519 Pa. 504</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="519 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1813563" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0504-01">549 A.2d 107</a>, 112 (1988), the Court unanimously declared that, “[a] repetitive or serial [post-conviction] petition may be entertained only for the purpose of avoiding a demonstrated miscarriage of justice, which no civilized society can tolerate.” Finality in criminal cases does properly trump other considerations, in certain circumstances. By the same token, rights, including constitutional rights, may be waived; there is nothing inherently wrong in procedural regulation of the exercise of rights. Some may believe that criminal cases are different and convictions should never be deemed final; but the citizens, through their duly elected representatives, are not obliged to share that view.</p>

At least in the context of being employed as a vehicle to challenge a criminal conviction, the historical writ was not such a “great” thing for Pennsylvania criminal defendants. Unlike a person who had yet to be tried, a convicted criminal obviously was well aware of the cause of his detention. Common law habeas corpus afforded convicted criminals very little prospect of relief until the sudden criminal procedure revolution engineered by the Earl Warren Supreme Court in the early 1960s. In the wake of those federal decisions, this Court reworked and expanded the scope of the historical writ as a matter of defensive necessity, <em>i.e., </em>to accommodate the flood of petitions <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>generated by brand new (and often retroactive) federal imperatives in criminal procedure.

As this Court’s own contemporaneous authority demonstrates, the legislative contribution was not designed to restrict or eliminate that which had been afforded to convicted prisoners under common law habeas coipus; rather, the statute addressed the necessity for a new review paradigm in response to new and literally unprecedented federal commands in matters affecting criminal procedure, many of which were deemed retroactive, thus unsettling final convictions. A proper historical understanding, then, requires recognition that the PCHA, and now the PCRA, is remarkable not in how it restricts convicted criminals, but in the broad avenue of collateral attack it accommodates and permits. Given this history, there is nothing at all improper in the General Assembly attempting to normalize, regularize, and expedite review. Even with the time-bar, statutory post-conviction review in this Commonwealth is expansive, not cramped or unduly restrictive. The statute need not apologize for itself; and we need not construe it to mean something other than it says to accommodate a lachrymose outlier situation.

The time-bar is found in a section of the PCRA entitled, “Jurisdiction and proceedings.” The provision is written in mandatory terms (“Any petition ... shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final ...”), and it includes a finite number of cognizable exceptions to the mandate (“... unless the petition alleges and the petitioner proves...,”). 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1). There is no basis in the text for the notion that the statute contemplates judicial improvisation of other exceptions — such as the “equitable tolling” doctrine espoused in federal jurisprudence which makes a mockery of the federal limitations period.

When the error finally was discovered and brought to the attention of the sentencing court, an arrest warrant was issued. Soon thereafter, petitioner was taken into custody, whereupon he challenged his incarceration based upon what he averred were violations of his substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The trial court's eventual order purporting to deny Appellant's oral post-sentence motion was a nullity and does not alter this analysis. Presumably effective counsel would have understood that post-trial motions must be in writing, and would have filed at least a protective PCRA petition within the one-year time limit.</p>

Of course, the PCRA does provide enumerated exceptions to its one-year time limit, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1), but they must be pleaded and proved; this Court does not raise any exception <em>sua sponte </em>on behalf of litigants. Appellant pleads no exception, maintaining instead and exclusively that this Court's decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Murray, </em><a href="/pa/562/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="562 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="225995" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0001-01">562 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="753 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="11205468,225995" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0201-01,/pa/562/0001-01">753 A.2d 201</a> (2000), renders his petition timely within the one-year time limit, thus requiring no exception. Accordingly, I need go no further in concluding that Appellant's petition was untimely under the PCRA, subject to no raised exception, and that the courts below therefore lacked jurisdiction to address it on the merits.</p>

While this occurrence is too common, it is not so common that it will be unduly burdensome to determine where such a claim has merit and where it does not. Courts are quite practiced at identifying and swiftly dispensing with frivolous petitions. Indeed, this is what we do when we regularly dismiss untimely multiple PCRA petitions.</p>
