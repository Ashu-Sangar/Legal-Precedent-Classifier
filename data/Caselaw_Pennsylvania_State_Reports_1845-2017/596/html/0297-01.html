The docket sheet reflects no progress of the case until February 17, 2005, when the trial court held a status conference at which the court merely scheduled a telephone conference for April 13, 2005. The April telephone conference primarily addressed certain documents in the possession of the DOC that the Commonwealth had asserted were protected by attorney/elient privilege. After agreeing to provide the parties with forty-five more days to brief the issue, the court proceeded to address the issue of the yet-to-be scheduled examination of appellee by forensic psychiatrist Timothy Michals, M.D., the Commonwealth’s psychiatric expert. It was in this context that defense counsel asserted “a right to be present” during the Commonwealth’s psychiatric examination as well as “the light to have a mental health person present.” Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 4/13/05, at 17. Neither counsel for the Commonwealth nor the court commented upon the supposed “rights” asserted by defense counsel. Instead, the court merely direct<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>ed the parties to schedule the examination within ten days. <em>See id. </em>at 18.</p>

Accordingly, on July 25, 2005, this Court <em>sua sponte </em>entered a <em>per curiam </em>order directing the trial court to hold the hearing on or before October 3, 2005. The trial court ultimately scheduled the hearing for October 3rd, the last day permissible under our order. The hearing, however, did not take place as scheduled, apparently because appellee was supposedly suffering from a contagious skin condition. Because it appeared that the hearing had been postponed indefinitely, this Court entered yet another <em>sua sponte </em>order on October 4, 2005, directing the trial court to determine the extent of the skin condition and to reschedule the competency hearing.</p>

The parties met as scheduled on Monday, October 24th. Instead of holding the scheduled hearing, the court indicated that, based on the physician’s affidavit, the competency hearing would be continued until it could be held at SCI-Graterford. After stating that it would then proceed to conduct a telephone conference with the warden of SCI-Graterford to discuss the logistics of holding the hearing there, the court asked the parties whether they wished to place anything else on the record. In response, defense counsel informed the court that, <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>on September 23rd, Dr. Michals “went and saw [sic] Mr. Banks without any notice to any of us, no notice to defense counsel, no opportunity for us to be there, no opportunity for us to either observe or advise Mr. Banks in any way or participate in any way.” N.T., 10/24/05, at 4-5. Defense counsel further advised the court that he anticipated that he would be requesting that Dr. Michals be stricken as a witness, to which the court responded simply, “Well, file your motion, I’ll be happy to respond to it.” <em>Id. </em>at 5. Finally, the court proceeded to the telephone conference, during which it contacted the warden of SCI-Graterford and secured his assurances that the competency hearing could be held there for four days beginning January 31, 2006.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In the interim, on December 19, 2005, the trial court held a hearing on appellee’s motion — a motion never authorized by this Court — to preclude Dr. Michals from testifying at the competency hearing based on defense counsel’s absence at Dr. Michals’ brief contact with appellee on September 23rd. Throughout the hearing, defense counsel alleged that the trial court had previously “ordered” that defense counsel be present during any contact between Dr. Michals and appellee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In reality, as the Commonwealth notes <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>in its Brief to this Court, the trial court never entered such an order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In fact, prior to Dr. Michals’ contact with appellee on September 23rd, the court gave no record indication whatsoever that the Commonwealth was barred from arranging for such contact outside the presence of defense counsel. <em>See </em>N.T., 4/13/05, at 17-18 (making no comment upon defense counsel’s assertion at the April 2005 telephone conference of “a right to be present” and “the right to have a mental health person present”). Moreover, the docket sheet does not reflect the existence of such an order. As explained below, there is simply no support, either in case law or in a statute, for the “rights” asserted by defense counsel. More importantly, this Court, the court exercising original jurisdiction, did not impose any such restriction upon the Commonwealth’s expert when we ordered the trial court to simply hold an expeditious <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>competency hearing.

The court further ruled that it would “allow the Commonwealth, though to re-hire a new expert if they can prior to the hearing, assuming that the terms and conditions of my original order [sic] are met with and that defense counsel be present at all future interviews of Mr. Banks and/or any people from the DOC.” N.T., 12/19/05, at 39. In precluding Dr. Michals from testifying at the scheduled competency hearing, the trial court stated that it “relied on relevant principles of law, and the parties’ own pre-hearing recognition that this [c]ourt expected contacts with Banks by Commonwealth experts to be only in the presence of the defense.” Trial Ct. Op., 2/27/06, at 3. The only authority cited by the court is <em>Ford v.

      <em>Estelle v. Smith </em>concerned a Texas prisoner’s petition for .federal <em>habeas corpus </em>relief. Before Smith’s trial, once the prosecution announced that it would seek the death penalty, the trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the prosecution to arrange a psychiatric examination of Smith by a court-appointed psychiatrist. The trial judge ordered the examination “to determine Smith’s competency to stand trial” even though the defense had not alleged that Smith was incompetent to .stand trial. <em>Smith, </em><a href="/us/451/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="451 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="6187407" data-case-paths="/us/451/0454-01">451 U.S. at </a>457 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, <a href="/us/451/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="451 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="6187407" data-case-paths="/us/451/0454-01">101 S.Ct. 1866</a>. After the psychiatrist determined that Smith was competent, the case proceeded to trial, resulting in Smith’s murder conviction. During the penalty phase that followed, the prosecution presented testimony from the psychiatrist as proof of Smith’s future dangerousness, an aggravating circumstance under the Texas statute. The psychiatrist was the prosecution’s only witness at the penalty hearing, and his testimony was based on information derived from his examination of Smith. <em><a href="/us/451/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="451 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="6187407" data-case-paths="/us/451/0454-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/451/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="451 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="6187407" data-case-paths="/us/451/0454-01">at 458-60</a>, <a href="/us/451/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="451 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="6187407" data-case-paths="/us/451/0454-01">101 S.Ct. 1866</a>.

For one thing, the examination in <em>Smith </em>occurred at the pre-trial stage, where there was a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Equally important, in explicitly disclaiming the holding for which appellee’s counsel cites it, the High Court noted the very same concerns articulated by Dr. Weiner in the instant matter in declining to conduct the interviews under the conditions ultimately imposed by the trial court. Nor does <em>Smith </em>suggest that the Commonwealth here committed a constitutional violation by failing to notify defense counsel before, on September 23, 2005, Dr. Michals attempted to examine appellee and questioned DOC personnel in response to a claim of incompetency raised by the defense, not by the Commonwealth. Volunteer defense counsel was well aware of exactly who would be examining appellee and questioning the personnel <em>{i.e., </em>Dr. Michals), exactly for what limited purpose <em>(i.e., </em>to determine whether appellee was incompetent to be executed, as counsel claimed), and, with respect to the personnel, exactly which questions would be asked. <em>Compare with Smith, supra-, see also Satterwhite v.

The Majority grants a new competency hearing merely because the trial court precluded the testimony of the Commonwealth’s psychiatric expert, Dr. Michals, six weeks before the competency hearing was conducted. Contrary to the Majority, my examination of the record leads me to conclude that the Commonwealth created its own predicament when it failed to abide by the trial court’s directive and failed to refute the overwhelming evidence establishing George E. Banks’ incompetence. Accordingly, I would affirm the findings and conclusions of law of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, establishing that Banks is incompetent to pursue clemency proceedings and incompetent to be executed.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth never proceeded on the theory that it was uninformed of the trial court’s directive. At the hearing on the motion to exclude Dr. Michals’ testimony, the Commonwealth did not assert that it was unaware that defense counsel had to be present for interviews of Banks. Instead, counsel for the Commonwealth apologized for her “oversightedness” in failing to advise defense counsel that Dr. Michals was going to see Banks a third time.

Notwithstanding the fact that the trial court permitted the Commonwealth to utilize Dr. Michals in preparing for the hearing, the Commonwealth did not in any way challenge the reliability of the expert opinions on cross-examination or rebut the substantive evidence presented on behalf of Banks. Further, the Commonwealth had another expert, Dr. Steven Samuel, who did not have improper contact with Banks.

The trial court concluded that there was a lack of diligence on the part of the Commonwealth in preparing Dr. Weiner for the hearing and a lack of diligence on the part of Dr. Weiner in failing to review the records he possessed and/or interview Banks prior to the hearing. These conclusions are supported by the record. At the outset of the competency hearing, the Commonwealth noted that its “participation in this hearing will be in a limited fashion, as the Court will.observe when we proceed.” N.T. 1/31/2006 at 10.

    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[127,701,1156,1262]]]'>The trial court found that under any evidentiary standard of proof, the records and testimony established that Banks lacks the capacity for rational and factual understanding of his death sentences and of the actual reasons for and implications of those sentences. The trial court engaged in a comprehensive analysis of the evidence presented and its findings are not only clearly supported by the record, but are undisputed. Three expert witnesses diagnosed Banks with psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified. N.T. 1/31/2006 at 17 (testimony of Dr. John Sebastian Obrien, II); <em>Id. </em>at 152 (testimony of Dr. Richard G. Dudley, Jr.); <em>Id. </em>at 251 (testimony of Dr. Jethro W. Toomer). The experts explained that Banks is delusional, suicidal, refuses to eat, and speaks of devils and demonic spirits torturing him. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 37. The experts further explained that Banks’ delusions go directly to the issue of his death sentence as he believes that he has been pardoned, that he is no longer facing execution, and that he is awaiting release. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 186. The evidence established that Banks self-mutilated his body, referred to his resultant skin disorder as a “flesh-eating demon,” and refused medical treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 210. The experts agreed that Banks is not malingering. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 219, 331.
