The Commonwealth Court, sitting en banc, determined that Stilp had taxpayer standing to bring this action, but ultimately concluded that no constitutional or statutory authority existed to support a declaration that the Auditor General possesses the authority to audit the financial accounts of the General Assembly. For the following reasons, we find that the Commonwealth Court erred regarding the question of standing. This finding, in turn, makes it unnecessary to pass upon Stilp’s <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>merits claim.

Moreover, Stilp requested that the Court: (1) compel the Auditor General to audit the General Assembly; (2) compel the General Assembly’s leadership and members of the Commission to cooperate with such an audit; (3) award him the costs of the lawsuit; and (4) grant him further equitable or declaratory relief as deemed necessary by the Court. Following the filing of preliminary objections by the governmental parties,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Stilp filed an amended petition for review on November 29, 2005.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The governmental parties responded by filing amended preliminary objections arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that: Stilp lacks standing to bring this action; an attempt by the Auditor General to audit the General Assembly would violate the doctrine of separation of powers; and the yearly audit conducted by the auditing firm retained by the Commission satisfies the constitutional auditing requirement set forth in Article VIII, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The Commonwealth Court initially determined that Stilp possessed the requirements for taxpayer standing to bring this action, citing <em>Consumer Party of Pennsylvania v.

The court ultimately concluded, however, that Stilp failed to provide either constitutional or statutory authority supporting the position that the Auditor General can, and must, audit the General Assembly. In addition, the court concluded that the separation of governmental powers doctrine prohibits such an audit.</p>
    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.9",124,[285,1147,1160,687]]]'>In support of these conclusions, the Commonwealth Court relied heavily on an official opinion issued in 1966 by Edward Friedman, the Acting Attorney General of Pennsylvania at that time. Specifically, the opinion addressed a question posed to the Attorney General by the Auditor General at that time: whether the Department of the Auditor General had the authority to audit the appropriations for employees of all legislative departments. The Attorney General’s opinion concluded that the Auditor General did not have that authority because there was no constitutional or statutory provision permitting such an audit. The opinion further concluded that such action by the Auditor General would violate the separation of powers doctrine:</p>

The court noted, however, that the reasoning supporting the Attorney General’s opinion is not contravened by Article VIII, Section 10 because the constitutional provision does not specify who is to conduct the audits of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth’s departments and, notably, “does not give any inherent power to the Auditor General to audit the General Assembly.” <em>Stilp, </em><a href="/a2d/898/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="898 A.2d 36" data-case-ids="8416076" data-case-paths="/a2d/898/0036-01">898 A.2d at 41</a>. Relying on the legislative history of Article VIII, Section 10, the Commonwealth Court determined that the delegates of the Constitutional Convention consciously decided to leave open the details of what party could audit the financial accounts of the General Assembly. Therefore, according to the court, the General Assembly properly filled that void by enacting 71 P.S. §§ 1189.1-1189.2.</p>

He additionally declares that the current Auditor General and the General Assembly benefit from the current system of auditing, but he does not explain that assertion. Stilp argues that judicial relief is appropriate because this is a case of first impression. Furthermore, he feels that redress through other channels is functionally unavailable because the Auditor General refuses to disrupt the current auditing process of the General Assembly, and the General Assembly permits only the accounting firm chosen by the Commission to audit its financial records, an arrangement Stilp feels is unconstitutional. Lastly, in a political rather than a legal argument, Stilp intemperately declares that he is best suited to bring this action because he has experience in filing lawsuits against the General Assembly, and because he “is one of few active reformers who have the best interest of the people in mind as he challenges the corrupt status quo.” Stilp’s Brief at 8.</p>

      <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>While <em>Biester </em>curtailed the concept of standing based solely upon taxpayer status, it also recognized that one who was not “aggrieved” so as to satisfy standing requirements might nevertheless be granted standing as a taxpayer if certain preconditions were met.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[327,584,1117,573]]]'>This exception’s relaxation of the general rules regarding standing and their requirement of a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the challenge, is policy driven. This policy, as expressed in <em>Biester, </em>revolves around the concept of giving standing to enable the citizenry to challenge governmental action which would otherwise go unchallenged in the courts because of the standing requirement. “Such litigation allows the courts, within the framework of traditional notions of ‘standing,’ to add to the controls over public officials inherent in the elective process the judicial scrutiny of the statutory and constitutional validity of their acts.”</blockquote>

For purposes of decision, we need only focus on the fifth factor. Certainly, the Auditor General, an elected official, is a far-better situated party to bring an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Department of the Auditor General does, or does not, have the authority to audit the financial accounts of the General Assembly. The fact that Stilp has a different view of the Auditor General’s authority, or the role of the office, does not make him better situated than the official. Nor do Stilp’s self-serving assertions of his own status, and his gratuitous denigration of elected officials, make him an appropriate party to litigate any question concerning the duties attendant upon an elective office. The discretion to bring such an action lies with the current Auditor General, or a future Auditor General, but no other party. The proper recourse available to Stilp, or other persons similarly situated, is to ask the Auditor General to seek to audit the General Assembly. Beyond that, Stilp’s remedy, like that of all citizens, is at the ballot box.</p>

This Court determined that the petitioners did not have taxpayer standing to challenge the constitutionality of the provision because they did not satisfy three of the <em>Biester </em>requirements, including the fifth factor. Concerning this factor, we determined that legislators who would be prevented from amending the statute would be better situated to raise a constitutional challenge. <em>Pittsburgh Palisades, </em><a href="/pa/585/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="888 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="2471785,8997954" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0196-01,/a2d/888/0655-01">888 A.2d at 662</a>.

In this regard, the <em>Biester </em>Court simply noted that taxpayer suits have been permitted by the courts out of a concern that judicial review might otherwise be unavailable, and then observed that this “will most often occur when those directly and immediately affected by the complained of expenditures' are beneficially affected as opposed to adversely affected.” <em>See Biester, </em><a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">487 Pa. at 445</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">409 A.2d at 852</a>. Significantly, however, the Court did not state that this scenario constituted a factual prerequisite for instituting a taxpayer <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>suit. Similarly, the <em>Biester </em>Court merely indicated that, in examining whether taxpayer standing should be afforded in a given case, “[cjonsideration must be given to other factors such as, for example, the appropriateness of judicial relief, the availability of redress through other channels, or the existence of other persons better situated to assert the claim.” <em><a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">487 Pa. at 446</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">409 A.2d at 852</a> (internal quotation marks, citations, and emphases omitted). Again, however, the Court did not imply that all of these factors must be present in a taxpayer suit. Indeed, it is only in subsequent cases that a conjunctive test has been construed from this language. <em>See, e.g., Pittsburgh Palisades, </em><a href="/pa/585/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="585 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="2471785" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0196-01">585 Pa. at 207</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="888 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="2471785,8997954" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0196-01,/a2d/888/0655-01">888 A.2d at 662</a>; <em>Consumer Party of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/510/0158-02" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="510 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1796968,1796992" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0158-02,/pa/510/0158-01">510 Pa. at 170</a>, <a href="/pa/510/0158-02" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="507 A.2d 323" data-case-ids="1796968" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0158-02">507 A.2d at 329</a>. In my view, the earlier and less rigid standard announced in <em>Biester </em>presents a more appropriate means of effectuating the policy underlying the taxpayer exception to traditional standing requirements. <em>See Biester, </em><a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">487 Pa. at 445</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">409 A.2d at 852</a>; <em>Faden v.

For instance, use of this model would permit citizen-taxpayer challenges in situations such as that presented by the present controversy, where, although a government official might be better positioned to challenge a particular governmental action, he or she is unwilling to do so.</p>
