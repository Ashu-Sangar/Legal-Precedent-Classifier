Even once accepted by the Supervising Judge, a presentment has no binding effect and it settles no disputes or claims as to any parties. It is a recommendation that the District Attorney or the Attorney General, as the case may be, can accept or reject as a matter of independent prosecutorial judgment. <em>See Commonwealth v.
