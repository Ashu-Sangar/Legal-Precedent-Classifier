Initially, the trial court denied the motions verbally, indicating that they were frivolous. Petitioner filed a notice of appeal and stay motion with the Superior Court, and the trial court subsequently issued a written order including its finding of frivolousness.

The Superior Court’s order, however, suggests that it may have relied solely on the fact that there was a finding of frivolousness to support the dismissal of the appeal. In this regard, the intermediate appellate court’s order merely references the trial court’s finding of frivolity, but contains no suggestion of any appellate evaluation. <em>See Commonwealth v. Green, </em>851 EDA 2008 n. 1 (Pa.Super.Apr.4, 2008) <em>(per curiam) </em>(“The trial court ... provided this Court with a written finding that the double jeopardy motion is frivolous and without arguable merit, and this finding is recorded on the trial docket.”).</p>

In my view, the trial transcript suggests that the trial judge overreacted to counsel’s question concerning a statement by petitioner, particularly since the police-officer witness denied that such statement was given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> To the degree that a curative instruction was <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>even implicated under the circumstances, our case law accepts the effectiveness of such instructions in a wide range of circumstances carrying far greater potential for prejudice than those presented here. Moreover, petitioner’s counsel repeatedly assured the trial judge that his client intended to testify, <em>See </em>N.T., April 1, 2008, at 25, 28 (“Well, Your Honor, he is going to be testifying, and, you know, that has been clear between us from the beginning.”), and, therefore, under the terms of the court’s order, petitioner’s statement could have been admitted in any event. Thus, at a minimum, the trial court could have simply precluded any further reference to the statement pending the defense case and deferred her ruling concerning a mistrial until after such presentation.</p>

Additionally, failure to consider if there are less drastic alternatives to a mistrial creates doubt about the propriety of the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion and is grounds for barring retrial because it indicates that the court failed to properly consider the defendant’s significant interest in whether or not to take the case from the jury. Finally, it is well established that any doubt relative to the existence of manifest necessity should be resolved in favor of the defendant.</blockquote>
