Appellant was originally represented by Thomas Ciccone, Esq., a court-appointed attorney. A few days before trial, Appellant retained Oscar Gaskins, Esq. to represent him. Given that he was hired only a short time before Appellant’s trial was set to begin, Gaskins claims to have filed a motion for a continuance, which, according to Gaskins, the trial court denied. The case proceeded to trial as scheduled on October 3, 1991, and the jury returned a guilty verdict against Appellant late in the afternoon of October 9, <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>1991. Appellant’s penalty phase hearing began first thing the following morning, for which Gaskins readily admits he was unprepared. In his aflldavit/declaration attached to Appellant’s PCRA petition, Gaskins states point-blank that he “did not have time to investigate the penalty phase.” Affidavit/Declaration of Oscar Gaskins at 2. Nor was Gaskins able to rely on previous preparation done by Appellant’s prior trial counsel as Ciccone states in his own affidavit/declaration that “at the time that I turned the case over to Gaskins, I had not investigated or prepared a penalty phase defense.” Affidavit/Declaration of Thomas Ciccone at 1.</p>
    <p id="b61-4" data-blocks='[["BL_61.5",61,[127,915,1157,1327]]]'>Appellant now claims that had trial counsel conducted any kind of investigation for the penalty phase, he would have discovered valuable evidence of mitigation, including evidence of Appellant’s severe mental health impairments and dysfunctional family life. In support of his claim, Appellant points to, among other things, a mental health evaluation conducted three years before, an affidavit from a forensic psychiatrist outlining evidence of Appellant’s mental impairment, and evidence of Appellant’s dysfunctional family history, including the fact that both of Appellant’s parents abused alcohol, that Appellant’s father beat his mother, and that Appellant made suicide threats as a child. Given counsel’s clear admission that he did not even attempt to investigate whether this or any other potential evidence of mitigation existed, and given that such evidence did in fact exist, it is clear, at least to me, that Appellant has demonstrated on the record before us that his ineffectiveness claim has arguable merit. <em>See Commonwealth v. Malloy, </em><a href="/pa/579/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="579 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1370995" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0425-01">579 Pa. 425</a>, <a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">856 A.2d 767</a>, 787-88 (2004) (appellant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present certain mitigating evidence, including evidence that appellant suffered an abusive childhood and was abandoned by his drug-addicted mother, had arguable merit where appellant established that such evidence was discoverable and could have been forwarded in mitigation had counsel undertaken even a minimal investigation).</p>

In finding otherwise, the PCRA court below first noted that Gaskins actually presented nine witnesses at Appellant’s penalty phase hearing, who basically testified that Appellant was well-liked, respectful, a good student, and a good father. One of the nine witnesses, Appellant’s mother, also testified that Appellant had been left by his father at a young age and grew up in a bad neighborhood. The PCRA court found, in effect, that the presentation of this testimony constituted a reasonable strategy on the part of Gaskins. However, as the trial investigator hired by Gas-kins states in his own affidavit/declaration:</p>
    <blockquote id="b62-5" data-blocks='[["BL_62.5",62,[336,910,1122,411]]]'>I did not conduct a penalty phase investigation. Mr. Gas-kins and I got a list of names from [Appellant] of people who could “cry and beg” the jury not to sentence [Appellant] to death. I never had time to interview any of these witnesses.

In any event, in light of counsel’s admission that he conducted no investigation whatsoever for the penalty phase, it is clear to me that counsel’s decision not to present the mitigating factors Appellant cites to here was <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>not one based upon a reasonable strategy. <em>See Wiggins v.

Indeed, in support of his claim, Appellant has furnished this Court, as he did the PCRA court below, with what really amounts to a “smoking gun,” a signed statement from his attorney all but conceding that he was ineffective by failing to conduct any investigation or meaningful preparation whatsoever for Appellant’s penalty phase hearing. Appellant has also provided this Court, again as he did the PCRA court below, with evidence of mitigation that was discoverable and could have been presented at his penalty phase hearing had his counsel undertaken even a minimal investigation.

Instead, as this Court explained in <em>McGill, </em>in collateral cases involving layered claims of ineffectiveness, the only viable ineffectiveness claim is that related to the most recent counsel, usually, as in this case, appellate counsel. Thus, <em>McGill </em>made clear that a petitioner’s ineffectiveness claim must focus on appellate counsel’s representation and to that end, he must plead appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness in his PCRA petition, which Appellant has done here, <em>and </em>present argument in his brief on all three prongs of the ineffectiveness test as it relates to appellate counsel’s deficient representation. <em>McGill, </em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">832 </a><a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">A.2d at 1021-1022</a>.

However, in presenting his argument regarding appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness, Appellant has failed to develop the second and third prongs of the ineffectiveness test as it relates to appellate counsel. Significantly, such an omission is not fatal to Appellant’s claim as <em>McGill </em>recognized that in light of the previous confusion regarding the mechanics of preserving layered ineffectiveness claims, a remand may be necessary to give a petitioner the opportunity to properly develop his claims of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness. <em>See <a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">at 1024</a>.

Counsel in this case offered a viable approach, seeking to cast the most favorable light on his client for the jury — an effort which included nine witnesses who <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>testified about the positive and human aspects of appellant’s life. I believe, as the PCRA court found, counsel’s chosen path was a reasonable strategy, highlighting the beneficial aspects and accomplishments of appellant’s life rather than belaboring the factors that purportedly made him a killer, and would affirm the order below.</p>
    <p id="b66-5" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[289,654,1164,679]]]'>The jury found the mitigation presented did not outweigh the aggravating factors in this double homicide. The argument that inevitably follows such a result is that choosing a different course at the penalty phase could not have led to a worse result; therefore, it should have been chosen in the first place. This is flawed logic, for it necessarily presumes that a successful strategy is available in the first place; such is not always the case. Reasonableness of a strategy is not measured by its success any more than is the reasonableness of a search. We cannot review in hindsight and say the result determines whether the means chosen were reasonable; we review the means chosen and determine whether they reflect a valid strategy.</p>
    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.6",66,[288,1357,1165,733]]]'>Hindsight often reveals inadequacies and missteps, but this Court reviews whether counsel’s chosen course was reasonably designed to serve the client’s interest. <em>See Commonwealth v. Meadows, </em><a href="/pa/567/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="567 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="404512" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0344-01">567 Pa. 344</a>, <a href="/pa/567/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="787 A.2d 312" data-case-ids="404512,9454581" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0344-01,/a2d/787/0312-01">787 A.2d 312</a>, 320-21 (2001). As is often the case, trial counsel had two competing types of potential “mitigation” evidence. The focus could center on how appellant had accomplished things despite his hard background, and hence had potential value to society; this would suggest the murder was an aberration, a contrast to his positive side. Alternatively, he could have stressed those factors which offer an explanation of why he turned out to be a murderer. These suggest the crime was almost inevitable; they could also suggest that he will always be a dangerous product of those factors.</p>
    <p id="b66-7" data-blocks='[["BL_66.7",66,[286,2113,1162,253]],["BL_67.1",67,[133,327,1156,357]]]'>Counsel admittedly did not investigate or present the latter, but he did present the former, in detail. Counsel called nine witnesses to testify to appellant’s good character: his mother, grandmother, grandfather, uncle, two aunts, a long-time friend, the mother of his daughter, and a family friend. <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>Counsel admitted he did not know exactly what each witness would testily to, but it is clear he sought to and succeeded in making a contrast to the damaging testimony of appellant’s actions suiTOunding the murders. This was done with testimony showing appellant manifested decency and goodness in his life, and hence desexved to be spared from the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[132,710,1157,892]]]'>For example, appellant’s mother testified her son was a good student, senior class president, and went to college. N.T. Trial, 10/10/91, at 7-9. Appellant’s mother also offered the jury some insight into appellant’s troubled youth,' such as his upbringing in a rough, drug-infested neighborhood, and that his father left when he was 21 months old. <em>Id., </em>at 11-12. This testimony was elicited to show how appellant overcame these setbacks and became a respected member of the community, rather than characterizing him as a corrupted individual. This chosen path painted appellant in the most positive light, instead of trying to explain why he was a bad person now seeking gratuitous mercy. This was a viable approach, particularly since appellant steadfastly maintained his innocence throughout trial; it expanded on appellant’s lack of pxlor criminal involvement. <em>See Commonwealth v. Baez, </em><a href="/pa/554/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="554 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="765941" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0066-01">554 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="720 A.2d 711" data-case-ids="11806067,765941" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0711-01,/pa/554/0066-01">720 A.2d 711</a>, 734-35 (1998) (counsel not ineffective for continuing to paint consistent picture).</p>
    <p id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[131,1627,1158,466]]]'>It is not ineffective representation for counsel, having chosen the first path, to keep from the jury the prejudicial evidence now said to be mitigation: appellant’s intoxication, historical addiction, and unstable mental state. Ironically, if the prosecution sought to introduce these same factors, appellant would cry foul and claim they were being offered merely to smear his character and prejudice the juxy <em>against </em>him. They are traits of bad character. Now, through some alchemy of logic, they are said to be mitigators.</p>
    <p id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.7",67,[129,2118,1156,256]],["BL_68.1",68,[296,334,1159,313]]]'>There will be cases where addiction, intoxication, and mental instability may mitigate a murder, but it simply is not an automatic conclusion. It cannot be the law that failure to seek out and present evidence of bad chai’acter is deemed ineffectiveness — how can we condemn counsel for not telling the jury <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>“my client is not just a killer, he’s a mentally unstable drug addict too, and probably will be forever — but have mercy on him anyhow.” A life of dysfunction may explain a murderer’s disposition to commit the crime, but it may also make the jurors conclude that his future is as dangerous as his past and there is every reason to fear and worry about him.</p>

    <blockquote id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.6",68,[335,1032,1119,579]]]'>Although we recognize that the unpursued evidence in this case is not the strongest, we further note that trial counsel’s presentation at the penalty phase included no affirmative evidence <em>at all, </em>but only a brief argument and a stipulation. Such a performance, which was not motivated by any strategic decision, left the jury with a dry assessment of appellant’s individual circumstances. In short, it is not just the failure to present evidence of appellant’s background which concerns us, but the fact that the failure occurred in a case where there was little effort to personalize appellant for the jury.</blockquote>
