Responding to a report of a domestic disturbance at the apartment on February 1, 2000, Harrisburg Police found appellant and Sacha engaged in an argument. When appellant would not leave, the police escorted him from the apartment to his place of residence. Later that evening, Sacha left the apartment, leaving behind Swanson, Swanson’s thirteen-year-old son, Maurice, and Sacha’s two infant children, Basil and Aliya. Appellant later returned to the apartment to <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>retrieve some clothing. Appellant also repeatedly telephoned the apartment asking to speak with Sacha. Fearful of further confrontations or telephone calls, Swanson had a friend, Garth George, stay with her until Sacha returned. Swanson also spoke with Sacha and informed her that appellant had been to the apartment.</p>

Leaving George with the children, Swanson and Maurice went to a nearby phone booth to call the police, who said that they would “keep an eye on the place.” <em>Id. </em>at 550. Sometime thereafter, George left the apartment, and as he left, Swanson asked him to call the police again.</p>

Appellant jumped on the bed where Swanson and the children were gathered, grabbed Swanson by the arm, and dragged her from the bed. Maurice ran from the room and was immediately pursued by appellant, who had released Swanson to give chase. When Maurice reached the rear door he opened it to find Harrisburg Police Officer William Vernouski standing in the threshold with his gun drawn. Officer Vernouski, who was responding to a pending call, had arrived at the residence and approached the rear door after hearing a woman inside screaming for help.</p>

The two began to struggle, causing Swanson additional injuries to her hands. Appellant continued to try to stab Swanson while Officer Vernouski repeatedly told him to drop the knife.

Officer Vernouski, who was now accompanied by other police officers, attempted to reason with appellant, but appellant refused to put the infant down and walked into a rear stairwell. Appellant then cut Basil’s throat with the butcher knife in a back-and-forth sawing motion, cutting the child’s neck down to the bone and producing a gaping stab wound. Appellant relinquished control of the child only after Officer Vernouski shot him three times. The officers attempted to revive the infant, but were unsuccessful. Basil was rushed to the hospital where it was determined that he died from the wounds inflicted by appellant. The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy of Basil described the wound as “a huge stab wound in the neck” made by “multiple cuts ... down into the bone,” and that “[i]t appeared [appellant] was trying to cut the poor child’s neck off.” N.T., 8/6/02, at 649-51.</p>

Appellant then relayed that his <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>stand-by counsel, the Chief Deputy Public Defender of Dauphin County, had contacted a psychologist who was willing to examine appellant over the weekend in time for the penalty phase, for a fee of $3,000. Appellant requested that the court authorize payment of that fee from public funds. Other than noting his “desire,” appellant cited no authority or theory, constitutional or otherwise, in support of the request for funds; nor did he allege any factual circumstances or issues that might require appointment of a mental health expert. The next day, then-President Judge Joseph H. Kleinfelter denied the motion, “but without prejudice of [sic] the Public Defender to retain an expert out of the P.D.’s budget.” Apparently, the Public Defender elected not to retain the expert. At the commencement of the penalty phase, after appellant announced that he did not wish to pursue any mitigating circumstances, standby counsel reminded the court of appellant’s pre-trial request for funds for a psychological examination. Appellant responded, however, that he “would like to withdraw that motion.” N.T., 8/9/02, at 924-25. After further discussion between stand-by counsel and the trial court, appellant again urged the court to “move on.” <em>Id. </em>at 925-26.</p>

Instead, appellant’s argument is absolutist.

Moreover, although appellant cited no authority or theory in support of his pre-trial petition for fees, and did not specifically claim that a due process value was at stake, we deem the petition sufficient to preserve the claim presently forwarded.

We emphasize the lateness of appellant’s request, and the fact that he sought a certain amount to retain a particular psychologist only because, even if the broad general right appellant advocates — the right of a capital defendant to the assistance of a psychological expert in all capital cases — were accepted, it does not follow that the timing of the request, the amount of money to be paid, and the identity of the expert would be entirely within the capital defendant’s control. <em>See Ake, </em><a href="/us/470/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="470 U.S. 68" data-case-ids="11298833" data-case-paths="/us/470/0068-01">470 U.S. at 83</a>, <a href="/us/470/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="470 U.S. 68" data-case-ids="11298833" data-case-paths="/us/470/0068-01">105 S.Ct. 1087</a> (where right of access to psychiatric assistance exists, it does not mean "that the indigent defendant has a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own”; "we leave to the States the decision on how to implement this right.”).</p>

With regard to Appellant’s claim that the common pleas court erred by denying funds to retain expert psychiatric assistance (Part IV), I would remand for a fuller explanation concerning the reasons supporting the denial, but for Appellant’s indication at the sentencing hearing that he did not wish to pursue the matter further. In my view, the circumstances of Appellant’s offenses themselves implicate the possibility that mental and/or emotional issues may have been relevant to sentencing. The trial court’s explanation for the denial of funding, however, as set forth in its Rule 1925 opinion, goes only to the issue of constitutional entitlement to funds, not to the discretionary <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>authority to allocate them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Further, in terms of reasoning, the motions judge’s order suggests at most a concern pertaining to the appropriate source of funding, as between the court’s budget and that of the public defender. Since I do not believe that decisions concerning funding for the development of defenses to the imposition of the death penalty should turn on budgetary disputes, some further explanation would be beneficial.</p>
    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[293,781,1165,528]]]'>Nevertheless, at trial, Appellant’s standby counsel attempted to put the funding issue before the trial judge at the outset of the penalty hearing, when the court could have taken measures to address it if warranted, such as by allocating funds and granting a continuance to secure an examination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Representing himself, however, Appellant stated that he wished to withdraw the motion and asked the trial court to move on. In these circumstances, I agree with the Commonwealth’s position that the claim, at this juncture, is appropriately treated as unpreserved for our review.</p>

I have previously expressed difficulty with the reasoning supporting the prevailing constitutional interpretation of this Court. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/560/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="560 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="95785" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0500-01">560 Pa. 500</a>, 524-25, <a href="/a2d/746/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="746 A.2d 592" data-case-ids="11471757,95785" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/0592-01,/pa/560/0500-01">746 A.2d 592</a>, 605 (2000) (Saylor, J., concurring). While I recognize that I am bound by the precedent concerning the constitutional dynamic, I do not read the constitutional decisions as foreclosing all review of the discretionary aspect of funding decisions pertaining to indigent capital defendants.</p>

Although the motions judge’s position may have remained controlling, the trial judge had the benefit of observing Appellant's behavior throughout trial, and therefore, it is possible that a different decision might have been appropriate, in light of new circumstances. In my view, the salient fact is that the trial judge was never required to make this decision, on account of Appellant’s decision to forego the issue.</p>
