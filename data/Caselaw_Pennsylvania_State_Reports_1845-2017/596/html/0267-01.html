Stewart (collectively, the “Candidates”) be removed from the November 6, 2007 general election ballot for the office of Supervisor of Bear Creek Township. Because of the exigency associated with the ensuing election, the Court considered the matter on an expedited basis, issued a <em>per curiam </em>order, and indicated that an opinion was to follow. This opinion provides the rationale for the Court’s previous order in this matter and clarifies the application of Section 976(e) of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 2936(e), to nomination papers where a candidate’s nomination petition to appear on the ballot for the primary election had been judicially set aside.</p>

Cmwlth.2007). After discussing the analysis of <em>Lachina, </em>the court held that the prior cases on the subject did not specifically address the meaning of the term “filed” in Section 976(e). The court reasoned that Section 977 of the Election Code provides that all nomination petitions are deemed valid unless a timely objection is made, <em>see </em>25 P.S. § 2987, and reasoned that “the setting aside of the nomination petition or paper, ‘undoes’ ab initio the initial filing of a candidate’s petition or paper.” <em>Benkoski, </em><a href="/a2d/932/1023-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="932 A.2d 1023" data-case-ids="8350154" data-case-paths="/a2d/932/1023-01">932 A.2d at 1026</a>.

Objectors argue that the plain language of Section 976(e) precludes a candidate, who has previously filed a nomination petition, from filing nomination papers for the same public office in the same election cycle. They maintain that the Commonwealth Court has previously interpreted this prohibition, which has been <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>referred to as a “sore loser” provision, as preventing a candidate stricken from the primary ballot from thereafter submitting nomination papers. <em>See Lachina, </em><a href="/a2d/887/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="887 A.2d 326" data-case-ids="8999356" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0326-01">887 A.2d at 329</a>; <em>Oliviero v.

Candidates argue that the relevant inquiry should focus upon whether, at the time the nomination papers are filed, the individual is actually a candidate of another political group, in which case, Section 976(e) would preclude the nomination papers. <em>See Packrall, </em>192 A.2d at 706.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Candidates maintain that, because their nomination petitions had been stricken, they were not Democratic candidates for the office of Township Supervisor, and consequently, Section 976(e) did not bar their nominating papers as Independent candidates for that position.</p>

In <em>Packrall, </em>this Court explained that the purpose of Section 976(e) is to prevent “party raiding” through the cluttering of the election ballot by candidates seeking to have their names listed multiple times. <em>See Packrall, </em>192 A.2d at 706.

The court explained that, in the former case, the voluntary withdrawal of the nomination petition within the open window allowed for filing “ ‘undoes,’ <em>a,b initio, </em>the filing because a person gets to choose whether he or she wants to go through the primary process to seek an office.” <em>Lachina, </em><a href="/a2d/887/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="887 A.2d 326" data-case-ids="8999356" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0326-01">887 A.2d at 329</a>.
