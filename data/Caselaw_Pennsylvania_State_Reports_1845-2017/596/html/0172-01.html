After their direct appeals were unsuccessful, each appellant later filed a petition seeking collateral relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546. Each appellant alleged, among other claims, that his trial lawyer was ineffective in failing to challenge the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his jury trial waiver, noting that the trial court, without objection from counsel, had failed to conduct an on-the-record, oral jury waiver colloquy as is contemplated by Pa.R.Crim.P. 620. Following hearings at which appellants and their former counsel testified, the PCRA court held that appellants had proven their claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and granted each appellant a new trial. On the Commonwealth’s appeal, the Superior Court reversed, holding that appellants had failed to establish prejudice. Specifically, the Superior Court, citing the lead opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Lassiter, </em><a href="/pa/554/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="554 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="765973" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0586-01">554 Pa. 586</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0657-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="722 A.2d 657" data-case-ids="11773788,765973" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0657-01,/pa/554/0586-01">722 A.2d 657</a> (1998) (Opinion Announcing Judgment of the Court, or “OAJC”), found that they had failed to show that the outcome of their joint trial would have been more favorable if it had been conducted before a jury.

Appellants were later arrested and charged with multiple crimes arising from the incident. On September 15, 1998, appellants appeared for trial before the Honorable Rayford A. Means. Attorney David Mischak represented Mallory, Attorney Tariq El-Shabazz represented Braheem Lewis, and Attorney Guy Sciolla represented Hakim Lewis.

Each written colloquy was signed by the respective appellant, his counsel, and the prosecutor. Each appellant initialed each page of his written waiver colloquy, and each signed a declaration on page four of the colloquy confirming that: “I have answered the questions on the above Defendant Information Sheet and I have reviewed this entire matter with my attorney and I understand all of the information given above.” Each of those certifications was followed by the signature of defense counsel as a witness.</p>

The prosecutor responded in the affirmative. After discussion of an unrelated issue, the court then noted that it had signed each of the written jury waivers. <em>Id. </em>at 8. None of the appellants or their counsel objected to the jury waiver process. Although the trial court acknowledged on the record that the waivers had been signed by each appellant, the trial court did not conduct an on-the-record oral waiver colloquy for appellants.

Mallory further claimed that he had signed his written jury waiver only because he thought he had to sign because his co-defendants had already signed their waiver documents when he arrived in the courtroom. Mallory also testified that: he reviewed the written waiver colloquy for approximately ninety seconds prior to signing; he did not actually read the waiver colloquy during those ninety seconds; his trial counsel did not review the waiver colloquy with him; <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>and he and his trial counsel never discussed a bench trial. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 16.

Furthermore, El-Shabazz testified that, after speaking with Attorney Sciolla, he believed that a bench trial offered his client a better prospect of a favorable verdict. El-Shabazz thus recommended to his client that he should waive a jury. He further testified that he explained the written colloquy to his client, who understood what he was waiving. El-Shabazz added that he believed his client “was waiving his right to a jury definitely knowingly and intelligently, meaning he understood what was going on.” El-Shabazz acknowledged that his client wavered “back and forth,” but voluntarily “submitted to” his recommendation.

In Sciolla’s view, a non-jury trial was preferable because, in a joint trial, there was a greater risk that a jury would fail to render an individual verdict after hearing about the bad acts of his client’s co-defendants. Seiolla stated that he would never intentionally overrule his client’s decision to elect a jury trial. Seiolla also testified that he went over each question on the waiver form with his client before his client signed the form.

The opinions made clear that the key to the PCRA court’s thinking was its belief that the absence of on-the-record oral waiver colloquies rendered the jury waivers invalid as a matter of law. Thus, in each opinion, the court began its discussion with this analysis: “[ajfter reviewing the <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>available record, this Court finds that the trial court erred in not conducting an on-the-record colloquy of Petitioner’s waiver of a jury trial, and therefore Petitioner’s waiver was not knowing and intelligent and was in violation of the Sixth Amendment.” <em>Commonwealth v. Mallory, </em>PCRA Ct. Op. at 2; <em>Commonwealth v. Braheem Lewis, </em>PCRA Ct. Op. at 2; <em>Commonwealth v. Hakim Lewis, </em>PCRA Ct. Op. at 2. The PCRA court then discussed the particulars of each case. With regard to Mallory, the PCRA court noted that it accepted his testimony regarding his belief that he was required to agree to a waiver trial because his co-defendants had signed waiver forms. The PCRA court also accepted each appellant’s testimony that he had insufficient time to comprehend the written waiver form and that each did not realize that the ultimate decision of whether to proceed with a bench or jury trial was his individual choice. The court also observed that Braheem Lewis’s waiver form was not signed by the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[131,1288,1155,1087]],["BL_242.1",242,[290,326,1158,95]]]'>Furthermore, the PCRA court rejected the Commonwealth’s contention that the written waiver forms were sufficient without an oral colloquy. In the PCRA court’s view, Pennsylvania case law requires a written jury waiver form to be supplemented with an oral colloquy. The PCRA court reasoned that appellants’ faulty understanding of their jury trial rights could have been remedied with an oral colloquy and that an oral colloquy would have given them an opportunity to explain that their written waivers were not voluntary. In sum, the PCRA court determined that appellants’ ineffectiveness claims had merit because their counsel were ineffective in failing to object to the absence of on-the-record, oral waiver colloquies, which rendered appellants’ waivers not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent as required by the Sixth Amendment. The court further found that appellants’ trial lawyers lacked reasonable bases for failing to object to the absence of oral colloquies. With respect to the Lewises’ direct appeal counsel, the court found that Attorney Fitzpatrick’s failure to raise the issue of trial counsel’s failure to object to the absence of oral colloquies lacked a reasonable basis. The <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>PCRA court then concluded that counsel were ineffective, and therefore awarded a new trial to each appellant.</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[283,445,1168,1529]]]'>On the Commonwealth’s appeal, the Superior Court reversed in a published opinion. <em>Commonwealth v. Mallory, </em><a href="/a2d/888/0854-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="888 A.2d 854" data-case-ids="8999339" data-case-paths="/a2d/888/0854-01">888 A.2d 854</a> (2005). The panel noted that appellants’ jury waiver claims were embedded in prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance and, therefore, the claims were subject to the traditional ineffectiveness test. The panel emphasized, inter alia, that to prevail on an ineffectiveness claim, the PCRA petitioner must show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s action or inaction. The panel then noted that none of the witnesses at the PCRA hearing offered testimony regarding any prejudice suffered and that the PCRA court’s opinion contained no analysis regarding the prejudice suffered by appellants. The panel determined that, under' the <em>Lassiter </em>OAJC, prejudice is established only where there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s ineffectiveness, the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em><a href="/a2d/888/0854-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="888 A.2d 854" data-case-ids="8999339" data-case-paths="/a2d/888/0854-01">Id.</a> </em>at 859-60 (citing <em>Lassiter, </em><a href="/a2d/722/0657-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="722 A.2d 657" data-case-ids="11773788,765973" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0657-01,/pa/554/0586-01">722 A.2d at 662-63</a>). In the panel’s view,’ appellants pointed to nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court had improperly weighed evidence or that a jury would have viewed the evidence more sympathetically. The panel found, therefore, that appellants had failed to establish that the alleged ineffectiveness of their trial counsel resulted in prejudice. Moreover, the panel observed that there is no compelling Pennsylvania case law to suggest that a court may presume prejudice when a defendant alleges an ineffectiveness claim in the context of a violation of Criminal Rule 620. Accordingly, the panel vacated the PCRA court’s new trial order and remanded for consideration of appellants’ remaining claims.</p>

Following a bench trial, the appellant was found guilty of second-degree murder, criminal conspiracy, robbery, and possession of an instrument of crime. A mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was imposed for murder. After the judgment of sentence was affirmed on direct appeal, the appellant sought collateral relief under the PCRA, which was denied by the PCRA court. The Superior Court affirmed and this Court granted further review. The question on appeal, as pertinent here, was whether Lassiter’s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advise her that the Commonwealth’s promise not to seek the death penalty if she agreed to a waiver trial was illusory because there was a strong argument to be made that the case was not death-eligible. This was so, the appellant argued, because the only alleged aggravating circumstance — that “[t]he defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6) — should be deemed inapplicable because she was an accomplice to the murder and not a principal. <a href="/a2d/722/0657-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="722 A.2d 657" data-case-ids="11773788,765973" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0657-01,/pa/554/0586-01">722 A.2d at 658-59</a>.

Or, imagine a reasonably intelligent client whose lawyer informed him, off the record, of the three basics of a jury trial. The record colloquy contemplated by Pa.R.Crim.P. 620 serves a salutary prophylactic purpose, as it makes it plain that a jury waiver is knowing and voluntary, and it creates a record in the event of a later, collateral attack upon the waiver. For the same twin reasons, an on-the-record colloquy is a useful procedural tool whenever the waiver of any significant right is at issue, constitutional or otherwise, <em>e.g., </em>waiver of a trial, waiver of the right to counsel, waiver of the right to call witnesses, waiver of the right to cross-examine witnesses, waiver of rules-based speedy trial time limits, etc. But the colloquy does not share the same status as the right itself.</p>

If this case involved direct governmental denial of an explicit request for a jury — if appellants had demanded a jury and the trial judge said, “No” — appellants would have a valid claim that they were denied their constitutional right to trial by jury. But that is not the claim presented here. Appellants explicitly waived their rights to a jury, in writing, on the record. Appellants’ shared collateral claim (the Lewises have an added burden concerning appellate counsel which we will address below) is that, notwithstanding their explicit written waiver colloquies, which were attested by their lawyers, the prosecutor and (in two of three cases) the trial judge, those waivers were the product of the ineffectiveness of their trial counsel.

Of course, lawyers have an obligation to counsel their clients in conjunction with the waiver of basic rights, including the waiver of a jury; but the mere absence of a record oral waiver colloquy does not automatically prove that a right was relinquished unknowingly or involuntarily and that the trial lawyer was ineffective for causing the waiver. When a presumptively-valid waiver is collaterally attacked under the guise of ineffectiveness of counsel, it must be analyzed like any other ineffectiveness claim. Such an inquiry is not resolved by the mere absence of an oral waiver colloquy; instead, the analysis must focus on the totality of relevant circumstances.

The <em>Smith </em>Court began by recognizing that the defendant’s understanding of the essential elements of a jury trial was not reflected in the oral waiver colloquy that was conducted. Specifically, the colloquy addressed that the jury would be chosen from members of the community, but did not explore the defendant’s understanding that the jury’s verdict <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>had to be unanimous, or that he could participate in jury selection. Notwithstanding this defect, the Court emphasized that the trial court record revealed that the defendant had executed a written waiver of his right to a jury trial, that the waiver form addressed the points not addressed in the oral colloquy, and that the written waiver reflected the defendant’s full awareness of the essentials of a jury trial. In reversing the grant of ineffectiveness relief, the Court stressed that the written waiver “must be accorded <em>prima facie </em>validity,” and that the defendant had not challenged the validity of the written waiver. On that record, the Court concluded that the defendant “was aware of his rights, and that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to defects in the colloquy.” <a href="/pa/498/0661-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="498 Pa. 661" data-case-ids="1776277" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0661-01">450 A.2d at 974</a>.</p>

Therefore, contrary to the conclusion of the PCRA court, the absence of an oral jury waiver colloquy alone does not prove that counsel were ineffective. Rather, to prove trial counsel ineffective, each appellant must show that his understanding of the written waiver was constitutionally impaired by his lawyer’s deficient performance, as well as proof that he would have elected a jury but for his lawyer’s performance. Thus, we affirm the <em>Lassiter </em>OAJC to the extent it determined that, in circumstances like these, actual prejudice must be shown.</p>

In addition to the fact that <em>McGurk </em>is not binding upon this Court, it is distinguishable from the present case. Counsel in <em>McGurk </em>failed to inform his client of an important constitutional right.

Accepting that actual prejudice must be proven in an instance involving a claim of counsel ineffectiveness causing an invalid jury waiver, the focus turns to <em>Strickland’s </em>requirement that the defendant prove “prejudice” by demonstrating that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a>.

The <em>Lassiter </em>OAJC posited that “the result of the proceeding” meant the ultimate outcome of the defendant’s trial. In light of intervening precedent, this Court’s further experience in this area, and the focused arguments we have been provided in this case, we now hold that, when a defendant claims that his jury waiver was not knowing and voluntary due to his counsel’s ineffectiveness, to prove actual prejudice the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the waiver proceeding would have been different absent counsel’s ineffectiveness; he does not have to demonstrate that the outcome of a jury trial would have been more favorable than the bench trial.</p>

In this respect, the analysis is not confined to <em>Strickland </em>prejudice for, as we have outlined earlier, the Commonwealth has forwarded an alternative argument challenging the PCRA court’s evaluation of the Strickland performance inquiry.

As we have explained above, the absence of an oral colloquy alone does not prove that a jury waiver was in fact unknowing or involuntary; rather, the PCRA court must look to the totality of the circumstances. This is especially the case when there was a detailed, written waiver signed, presented, and accepted in open court — a waiver which, under <em>Smith, </em>should be accorded <em>prima facie </em>validity.
