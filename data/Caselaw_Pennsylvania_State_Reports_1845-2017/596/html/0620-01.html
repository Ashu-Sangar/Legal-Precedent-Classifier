Tamika Johnson was present in the home while the two men discussed their strategy and brandished weapons; Black flaunted a 9 mm handgun and Appellant held a .357 magnum revolver. Black stated that Bolton had 48 hours to live. A short time later, Tamika Johnson left the home and Wilson Melendez, who had sold drugs for Black, arrived. Black introduced Appellant to Melendez and directed the men to go to the grocery store down the street. En route, Melendez saw Bolton walking with another man, Tyrone Bryant. Melendez then entered the grocery store, while Appellant ran back to the house to tell Black of Bolton’s whereabouts.</p>

By this time, it was mid-afternoon and there were children playing and people walking on the street. Melendez, Black, and Appellant caught up with Bolton and his companion, Bryant, and began to follow them. <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>When they reached Sixth and Chestnut Streets, Appellant and Black told Melendez to look around the corner to determine Bolton’s exact location. Melendez told the men that Bolton was near. Appellant then reached into his back pocket for his gun, which accidentally discharged. Appellant immediately walked around the corner, pulled the gun out of his pocket, and began firing at Bolton. At the same time, Black shot twice at Bolton. Bolton and Bryant then ran away from their perpetrators into a vestibule of a nearby building, and quickly closed the door. Appellant followed them and attempted to open the door to the building. As Bolton and Bryant struggled to stop the door from opening, Appellant reached his gun into the doorway, and fired into the vestibule, killing Bolton. Bryant was not shot, but was injured when the window glass in the vestibule shattered from the gunfire.</p>

After Appellant assured Black that he had shot Bolton, the men celebrated Bolton’s death. By this time, Tamika Johnson had returned. Appellant and Black told Tamika Johnson that they had killed Bolton. Appellant and Black gave their weapons to Melendez, who hid them in the backyard of another house in the neighborhood.</p>

Also, the police recovered the murder weapons which had been hidden by Melendez. Appellant was thereafter charged with criminal homicide. At trial, Appellant claimed that Black and Melendez had killed Bolton, and that he had not been involved in the murder. The Commonwealth presented testimony from several witnesses, establishing Appellant’s involvement in the crime. Further, medical expert testimony demonstrated that Bolton died from a gunshot wound to the chest and ballistics evidence established that bullet fragments found at the murder scene had been fired from Appellant’s .857 revolver.</p>

By order dated June 21, 2004, the trial court scheduled jury selection for the penalty hearing to commence on August 19, 2004. On that date, as fully explained in the argument section of this opinion, Appellant’s counsel sought a continuance, arguing that he desired to take six continuing legal education credits to comply with the not-yet-effective requirements of Rule 801.

As discussed in detail <em>infra, </em>in support of the grave risk of death aggravator, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Tyrone Bryant, who had been with Bolton when he was murdered, and the testimony of several neighbors who observed adults walking and children playing on the street where the shots were fired.

In support of these arguments, Appellant argued that Bolton put himself in a precarious situation by being involved in the drug trade and by engaging in a prior shootout with Black. He further presented the testimony of Lori Monroe, an expert in the field of clinical social work, who detailed Appellant’s life experiences, including his prison life following his 1986 and 1987 robbery convictions and his 1994 conviction of possession of a weapon. Monroe additionally testified as to Appellant’s difficult childhood and his later role as a loving father and family man.</p>

On November 3, 2004, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.1925(b), the trial court ordered Appellant to file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal within fourteen days. Appellant failed to file a timely 1925(b) statement. On June 8, 2005, the trial court issued a memorandum opinion, requesting that Appellant’s appeal be denied on such ground. Appellant, however, subsequently filed a 1925(b) statement <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Therein, he argued that the trial court erred by failing to grant him a continuance to allow counsel to comply with the educational requisites of Pa.R.Crim.P. 801. He further contended that the trial court erred in allowing testimony regarding Appellant’s conviction for possessing an instrument of crime when such crime does not constitute a crime of violence. <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>Finally, Appellant challenged the weight of the evidence supporting the two aggravating circumstances found by the jury.</p>

The trial court held that it did not err in denying Appellant’s request for a continuance based on Pa.R.Crim.P. 801 because the rule was not effective at the time the penalty hearing was scheduled. It found Appellant’s claim that the court improperly admitted evidence of his 1994 weapons conviction to be “moot” because such evidence was never presented to the jury. Finally, the trial court held that the two aggravating circumstances were not against the weight of the evidence.</p>

The trial court emphasized that Appellant’s counsel was a “learned and highly competent attorney who has previously tried death penalty cases in Berks County.” Trial Court Opinion at 4. It found that Appellant was invoking Rule 801 to gain a last-minute continuance of the August 19, 2004 proceeding, which had been scheduled by court order dated June 21, 2004. The court noted that Appellant’s counsel could have completed six hours of education in the more than two months that had passed between the June 4, 2004 adoption of Rule 801 and the August 19, 2004 penalty hearing. Finally, the court explained that the District Attorney’s Office, the witnesses, the jurors, and the court were all prepared to proceed and that the grant of a continuance would have caused much difficulty for all those involved. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Under these circumstances, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant’s motion for a continuance.</p>

Commonwealth Exhibit 55, which is a certified record of the weapons conviction, was admitted into evidence, but was never shown to the jury. During the Commonwealth's direct examination of Officer Cruse, the parties met at sidebar and Appellant objected to the admission of the introduction of the 1994 weapons conviction to support the significant history of violent felonies aggravator because it was not a crime of violence. N.T. dated 8/26/2004, at 298. The Commonwealth explained to the court that it was not presenting Officer Cruse to testify about Appellant’s weapons conviction, but, as noted, only to testify about Appellant's two prior robbery convictions, which it was using to support the aggravator. <em>Id. </em>at 299.</p>

In his 1925(b) statement, Appellant challenged the weight and not the sufficiency of the evidence supporting both aggravating circumstances. The trial court addressed and rejected the claims, utilizing a weight of the evidence analysis. Appellant, however, has abandoned any weight of the evidence claim in his brief to our Court and therefore we shall not address such issue. While Appellant's instant challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the aggravating circumstances are technically waived, we shall address them pursuant to our statutory obligation to reverse a sentence of death if "the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d).” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(h).</p>
