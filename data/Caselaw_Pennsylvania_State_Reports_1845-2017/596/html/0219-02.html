After the judgment of sentence was affirmed on direct appeal and the defendant’s first PCRA petition was denied on its merits, the defendant filed a second PCRA petition that was untimely. He argued the petition fell within § 9545(b)(l)(i)-(ii)’s timeliness exceptions because the Commonwealth violated <em>Brady </em>by withholding impeachment evidence that the witness was a drug dealer who colluded with the police. In support of this claim, the key witness signed an affidavit stating he was a gang member and the police came to him for information. This Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition as untimely, holding there was no <em>Brady </em>violation because the information the defendant cited was available to him and could have been discovered with reasonable diligence. <em>Johnson, </em>at 426-27. We rejected the defendant’s argument that even if the information was available to him prior to execution of the affidavit, the witness’s subsequent admission to the facts transformed them into newly-discovered evidence: “a witness’ admission of evidence previously available to a petitioner cannot resurrect an untimely PCRA claim.... ” <em><a href="/pa/580/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="863 A.2d 423" data-case-ids="1100666,9167059" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0594-01,/a2d/863/0423-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/pa/580/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="863 A.2d 423" data-case-ids="1100666,9167059" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0594-01,/a2d/863/0423-01">at 427</a>.</p>
