To participate in this “Line of Credit” Appellant also charged consumers a “monthly participation fee” of $149.95.

The Department maintained that, pursuant to Section 201 of the LIPL, 41 P.S. § 201, Appellant was prohibited from charging more than six percent annual interest on its line-of-credit product. The complaint alleged that the monthly participation fee ($149.95) was actually interest on the sum loaned.

    <p id="b701-5" data-blocks='[["BL_701.6",701,[116,1040,1163,1149]]]'>A three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court granted the Department’s motion and issued a permanent injunction preventing Appellant from charging Commonwealth consumers the monthly participation fee. <em>See Pennsylvania Dep’t of Banking v.

On the choice-of-law issue, the court concluded that Pennsylvania law applied because the Department brought the action pursuant its statutory police power. The court acknowledged the parties’ arguments favoring application of Section 187 of the Second Restatement of Conflicts of Laws. Since the Department was not a party to any contract with Appellant, however, the court concluded that the terms of Appellant’s contracts with Commonwealth consumers were not binding on the Department. The court also explained that, although a consumer’s claim against a lender might be subject to the contract’s choice-of-law provision, the Department’s enforcement action was not subject to the agreement in the present situation where the agency filed an action in its own name to enforce a statutory provision. <em>See <a href="/a2d/931/0771-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="931 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="8350215" data-case-paths="/a2d/931/0771-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/931/0771-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="931 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="8350215" data-case-paths="/a2d/931/0771-01">at 778</a>.

Under Section 3.A of the CDCA, the court observed that the test is whether the interest and any other “ ‘discounts], bonus[es], fees, fines, commissions, charges or other considerations,’ in the <em>aggregate, </em>exceed the six percent [allowable] annual simple interest.” <em>NCAS, </em><a href="/a2d/931/0771-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="931 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="8350215" data-case-paths="/a2d/931/0771-01">931 A.2d at 779</a> (emphasis in original) (quoting 7 P.S. § 6203.A). Using an APR rate calculator, the court determined that the $149.95 monthly participation fee in combination with the 5.98 percent interest rate aggregated into an annual interest rate of approximately 368 percent. The court concluded that Appellant violated the CDCA because it was required to be licensed to charge interest in excess of the six percent rate authorized by Section 201 of the LIPL. <em>See <a href="/a2d/931/0771-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="931 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="8350215" data-case-paths="/a2d/931/0771-01">id.</a> </em>(citing 41 P.S. § 201). In response to Appellant’s argument that the fee should not be considered because it was not charged “on the amount actually loaned” as required by Section 3.A, the court explained that the charge was “inextricably related” to the amount loaned because it was a necessary condition to be fulfilled before Appellant would provide any loan. <em><a href="/a2d/931/0771-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="931 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="8350215" data-case-paths="/a2d/931/0771-01">Id.</a></em>

The court observed that Section 201 of the LIPL provides that “the maximum lawful rate of interest for the loan or use of money in an amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less in all cases where no express contract shall have been made for a less rate shall be six per cent (6%) per annum.” <em>NCAS, </em><a href="/a2d/931/0771-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="931 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="8350215" data-case-paths="/a2d/931/0771-01">931 A.2d at 780</a> (quoting 41 P.S. § 201). Section 201 only refers to a “lawful rate of interest” not an aggregation of fees and interest as in the CDCA; thus, the court concluded that, without a further development of the record, it could not determine whether the fee constituted disguised interest that would bring the total interest rate over the six percent limit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>On appeal to this Court, Appellant argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in holding that Pennsylvania law rather than Delaware law regulates its conduct. Appellant asserts that Section 187 of the Second Restatement of Conflicts of Law sets forth a prudential rule that applies to all controversies, because it protects the interests of both contracting parties and the Commonwealth by requiring application of Pennsylvania law only where Pennsylvania has a materially greater interest in the controversy and a fundamental policy at stake. If it did not, Appellant maintains that private parties and the courts would have no guidance for determining whether and when Pennsylvania statutory law should apply. Appellant also contends that the court erred in concluding that Pennsylvania law would apply in the event Section 187 governed because Appellant had substantial contacts with Delaware, its state of incorporation. Further, Appellant argues that Pennsylvania does not have a fundamental policy prohibiting the fees and interest charged under its Revolving Credit Agreement because there are exceptions to the six percent interest rate within other Pennsylvania statutes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b703-4" data-blocks='[["BL_703.6",703,[122,1460,1158,579]],["BL_704.1",704,[300,323,1155,150]]]'>Appellant next argues that the Commonwealth Court misinterpreted the plain language of the CDCA by determining that the monthly participation fee was within the scope of Section 3.A of that statute. Appellant maintains that the plain language of Section 3.A indicates that it applies only when interest and other charges “on the amount actually loaned or advanced” exceed the interest the lender may otherwise charge. 7 P.S. § 6203.A. Since the fee was a fixed amount levied regardless of the amount that the consumer is loaned or advanced, Appellant contends that it is not subject to aggregation under Section 3.A. Additionally, Appellant highlights <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>that the fee was charged regardless of whether the customer ever “actually” obtained a loan, a fact the Department acknowledged.</p>
    <p id="b704-4" data-blocks='[["BL_704.5",704,[297,498,1163,687]]]'>Appellant also contends that the Commonwealth Court could not find a CDCA violation where it held that there was insufficient evidence to determine if the LIPL had been violated. According to Appellant, a violation of the LIPL is a necessary condition for determining whether Pennsylvania’s usury laws have been breached. Under Appellant’s theory, if there is no violation of the six percent interest rate cap in Section 201, 41 P.S. § 201, then a lender need not turn to the CDCA exception permitting a higher interest rate if the lender obtains a license. <em>See </em>7 P.S. § 6213.E (authorizing a licensed lender to charge up to 9.5 percent annual simple interest for the first two years in which the contract is repayable).</p>

Moreover, the Department contends that the contractual choice-of-law provision cannot limit its police power authority to enforce Pennsylvania law, and, alternatively, that Appellant cannot use such a provision to avoid the state’s usury laws. <em>See Carlino v. Whitpain Investors, </em><a href="/pa/499/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="499 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="1778931" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0498-01">499 Pa. 498</a>, 504, <a href="/pa/499/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="499 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="1778931" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0498-01">453 A.2d 1385</a>, 1388 (1982) (“[Ijndividuals cannot, by contract, abridge police powers which protect the general welfare and public interest.”). The Department also asserts that Pennsylvania law would apply even under the Second Restatement of Conflicts analysis, because Pennsylvania’s prohibition against exploitative lending is a fundamental public policy. According to the express language of Section 187 of the Second Restatement of Conflicts, the Department observes, a fundamental public policy of the forum cannot be contravened by a choice-of-law provision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Additionally, the Department notes that this sec<a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>tion has been adopted by Pennsylvania courts. <em>See Miller v.

In response to Appellant’s argument that the participation fee should not be considered under the CDCA because it is not charged “on the amount actually loaned,” the Department contends that, although hypothetically a consumer could pay the fee without actually obtaining a loan, it strains the bounds of reason to conclude that persons whose financial circumstances are such that they would resort to a payday lender would pay $145.95 per month for the supposed convenience of being able to later borrow a maximum of $500, but not actually obtain such a loan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Notably, the terms of Appellant’s agreement provided that Appellant would close any line of credit <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>account that had no principal balance for one monthly billing cycle. <em>See </em>NCAS Revolving Credit Agreement, R.R. at 182a-183a. Accordingly, the Department asserts that, even drawing reasonable factual inferences in Appellant’s favor, the unavoidable conclusion is that the fee was charged on the actual loans advanced, in violation of the CDCA. Moreover, both the Department and the <em>amici </em>observe that Appellant’s interpretation would inhibit the CDCA from serving its purpose, to prevent exploitative lending.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The LIPL sets “the maximum lawful rate of interest” that may be charged in Pennsylvania at six percent annual simple interest, 41 P.S. § 201, whereas the, CDCA caps not only “interest” but also the amount of “discount, bonus, fees, fines, commissions, charges, or other considerations” that a non-bank lender may charge without a license at the equivalent six percent annual simple interest. 7 P.S. § 6203.A. The CDCA, therefore, regulates costs associated with a loan more broadly than does the LIPL. Accordingly, the Department concludes that one may violate the CDCA without violating the LIPL.</p>

In materially distinct clauses, Section 3.A first describes the broad range of subject charges (“No person shall ... charge, collect, contract for or receive interest, discount, bonus, fees, fines, commissions, charges, or other considerations”), then sets a benchmark against which such charges are to be assessed (“which aggregate in excess of the interest that the lender would otherwise be permitted by law to charge if not licensed under this act on the amount actually loaned or advanced”). 7 P.S. § 6203.A. The proviso “on the amount actually loaned or advanced” attaches quite logically to the noun “interest” as utilized in the benchmark clause; indeed, it is common usage when discussing interest to specify the principal amount upon which it is calculated.
