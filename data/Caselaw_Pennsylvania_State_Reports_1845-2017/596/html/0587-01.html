To reinforce his interpretation of the notes, Appellant invoked a videotape of a training seminar on jury selection, which had been given in 1987 by Jack McMahon, who was then a Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney. In the tape, Mr. McMahon explicitly advocated the use of discriminatory practices during jury selection. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Because Appellant’s petition was filed within 60 days of Mr. Sagel’s testimony as to Mr. Lentz’s authorship of the notes, Appellant contends that his petition was therefore timely. Appellant merely states — without benefit of supporting argument — that, even if he had exercised due diligence, he could not have obtained the notes and thus could not have presented his claim prior to Mr. Sagel’s testimony. Appellant provides no evidence or argument that Mr. Sagel refused to divulge the information that he possessed regarding the identity of the author of the notes prior to his testimony on November 28, 2005.

The after-discovered “fact” on which Appellant relies is the contention, based on the Sagel and McMahon lectures, of a policy of racial discrimination in jury selection in the District Attorney’s Office. The investigative report that discussed both lectures and concluded therefrom that a discriminatory policy was extant in the District Attorney’s Office, was published in Philadelphia Magazine in June 1997, and thus was public knowledge prior to the filing of Appellant’s supplemental petition on October 24, 1997, in support of his first request for PCRA relief, some eight years before Appellant filed the instant PCRA petition. Contrary to Appellant’s assertion, Mr. Lentz’s lecture notes are properly characterized as another source for the claim of a racially discriminatory policy in jury selection in the District Attorney’s Office.

Appellant’s implication that Mr. Lentz's notes were comparable to the evidence of racial bias in jury selection in <em>Miller-El </em>is untenable. The <em>Miller-El </em>Court noted the “extensive evidence” relating to jury selection procedures offered by the appellant to support his contention of racial discrimination in jury selection, both during his individual prosecution and as a general policy in the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office. <em><a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">at 330</a>, <a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">123 S.Ct. 1029</a>.
