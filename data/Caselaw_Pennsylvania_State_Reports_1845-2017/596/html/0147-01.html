He was thereafter charged with various narcotics-related offenses. Prior to trial, Appellant moved to suppress the seized narcotics.

We do not seek to minimize the experience gained through years serving on the police force. Quite to the contrary, we recognize that many officers, particularly those with specialized training, are able to recognize trends and methods in the commission of various crimes. For instance, an officer who has specialized in drug crimes may be more suspicious that a package contains illegal narcotics because of the form of packaging used to conceal those drugs. <em>See Evans, infra. </em>He or she may recognize criminal activity where a non-police citizen may not. However, a court cannot simply conclude that probable cause existed based upon nothing more than the number of years an officer has spent on the force. Rather, the officer must demonstrate a nexus between his experience and the search, arrest, or seizure of evidence. By doing so, a court aware of, informed by, and viewing the evidence as the officer in question, aided in assessing his observations by his experience, may properly conclude that probable cause existed.

However, although I recognize that reasonable minds may differ concerning outcomes, the majority appropriately develops that this Court has not been comfortable with a general rule crediting an aggregation of a few circumstances that, independently and collectively, are also consistent with legitimate behavior. Rather, in determining probable cause, the Court has generally looked for the presence of some factor more distinctly associated with the criminal offense or offenses under observation or investigation to elevate reasonable suspicion to the necessary reasonable belief. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

For example, if an officer at a hearing on a motion to suppress were to say that he made the arrest because he saw what he as an expert recognized as a marijuana cigarette, this is not a showing of probable cause. Under the probable cause standard, it must be possible to explain and justify the arrest to an objective third party, and this is not accomplished by a general claim of expertise. On the other hand, if the officer testifies fully concerning his prior experience with marijuana cigarettes and explains in detail just how it is possible to distinguish such a cigarette from other hand-rolled cigarettes, this testimony cannot be disregarded by the judge simply because it involves expertise not shared by the judge.</blockquote>

Without further development, the mere fact that the arresting officer could attest to training and experience with prior drug arrests seems to me to add very little to the circumstances that were before the Court in <em>Banks. Accord </em>William E. Ringel, 2 Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions § 23:8 (2004) (“Even in the presence of a trained officer ... gestures and motions commonly associated with drug use may also be so well associated with innocent activities that they do not <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>suffice to establish probable cause.”).

Davis, </em><a href="/f2d/458/0819-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="458 F.2d 819" data-case-ids="728401" data-case-paths="/f2d/458/0819-01">458 F.2d 819</a> (D.C.Cir.1972) (“A delicate balance must be struck between the right of the often-victimized innocent ghetto inhabitant to adequate, unhampered police protection and the rights guaranteed to him under the Fourth Amendment.”). Concerning this factor, Professor La-Fave has suggested that due recognition can be afforded to it, while appropriate perspective is maintained, by “cautiously using the crime problem in the area only to give meaning to highly suspicious facts and circumstances.” <em>See </em>2 LaFave, Search and Seizure § 3.6(g), at 369. I am in accord with this observation. Thus, in the absence of some particular circumstance that does not substantially overlap with legitimate behavior, I do not believe that the high-drug-activity location factor should be given the sort of weight which would tip the totality scales in favor of finding probable cause to arrest.</p>

      <em>Banks </em>did not exhaust the variety of circumstances that attend street drug sales. This ease is identical to <em>Banks </em>in that it involves the common, surreptitious exchange paradigm, but it is different in other material respects. Weighing against probable cause is the absence of flight. The factors weighing in favor of probable cause here, which were absent in <em>Banks, </em>include the fact of the officer’s training in narcotics investigation, his hands-on experience, which included his experience in this very neighborhood, and the high volume of drug dealing in this particular neighborhood. In my view, even accepting <em>Banks’ </em>unwisely hostile rule, these factors justified the suppression judge in concluding that the experienced police officer here acted upon probable cause.</p>

I confess that I do not understand the distinction. Indeed, the value of importing concepts from optometry escapes me. Moreover, this sort of post-New Age speak is contrary to the manner in which the law generally treats those with special expertise. When a doctor testifies as an expert witness in a medical malpractice action, he is not providing a “lens” by which to view his conclusions: he is offering relevant testimony that may be accepted for its factual truth.

To declare that the Majority feels practical police experience is only a “lens” through which to view probable cause factors provides no useful guidance to reviewing courts or police officers. Stating that an officer’s training and experience are a “lens” does not provide an analytical framework so much as a Rorschach test. How, and to what extent, the courts are to consider the “lens of experience” in reviewing an officer’s conduct remains open to infinite permutations. The Commonwealth entrusts the protection of the public to police officers, and to ensure that they discharge their duty effectively, and fairly, provides them with specialized training, which is further enhanced by their on-the-job experience.

Maj. Op. at 153, 941 A.2d at 675. In a totality analysis, most factors, standing alone, will not satisfy the governing test. The proper analysis of probable cause looks for all relevant factors, in their totality. The officer here testified that he had personally made between 15 and 20 drug arrests in this area. He knew from his experience that the neighborhood was one plagued by a high number of drug crimes; intelligent policing, of course, targets high crime areas. The officer’s relevant experience, to which he testified, well positioned him to understand the significance of appellant’s conduct. That conduct led him to conclude that this surreptitious transaction on this notorious street corner was likely to involve the sale of drugs. That, of course, is the single most likely explanation.

A weapons frisk is of no avail when the object being sought is not a weapon, but a tiny vial or packet of drugs, or drug transaction proceeds. To conclusively confirm or dispel a reasonable belief that a suspect was dealing illegal narcotics, police need to see the goods. That is all the officer did in this case. The search was targeted and minimally intrusive. Such a limited search immediately confirms or dispels suspicion. The Fourth Amendment admits a more flexible analysis.</p>
