    <p id="b509-6" data-blocks='[["BL_509.7",509,[134,1113,1157,636]]]'>Under the unique circumstances of this case, and after review of Section 2937 and the limited caselaw, we are persuaded that Appellants’ objections were timely filed. Section 2937 indicates by its unambiguous language that objections may be filed (and served) until the seventh <em>day </em>following the date for filing nomination papers. It does not specify hours. Further, the section requires the prothonotary’s office be open until 5 p.m. on the last <em>day </em>for filing objections. Combining these two features, we conclude that, regardless of the <em>time </em>of the day on which nomination papers are due, the statute by its terms contemplates objections may be filed until the <em>end </em>of the seventh day.</p>

To yield a deadline at February 21 at noon, as James proposes, would require the seven-day “clock” start at February 14 at noon, a premise which Section 2603 forbids. Under Section 2603, “the day upon with the act <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>is done” — the filing of the nomination papers — must be excluded from the seven-day period dictated by Section 2937. The resulting calculation yields a deadline of February 21 at 5 p.m. Accordingly, having filed and served their objections before February 21 at 5 p.m., we conclude that Appellants’ objections were timely.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
