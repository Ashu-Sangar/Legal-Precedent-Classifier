Section 1738 concerns the stacking of uninsured and underinsured motorist insurance (“UM/UIM”) coverage and the waiver of stacked coverage. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1738. <em>Sackett </em>/ held that, even where stacked coverage has been previously waived under Section 1738(b) via the execution of a valid waiver form as contemplated by Section 1738(d), upon the addition of a new vehicle to a multi-vehicle automobile insurance policy, the carrier must secure a new signed waiver form on pain of a default to stacked UM/UIM limits. <em>See id. </em>at 427-29, <a href="/pa/591/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="919 A.2d 194" data-case-ids="3014050,3017123,8325205,8325246" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0416-01,/pa/591/0416-02,/a2d/919/0194-01,/a2d/919/0194-02">919 A.2d at 201-02</a>.

    <p id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[293,548,1158,630]]]'>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, which was the appellee, filed an application for reargument. While the application was under consideration, this Court invited the Insurance Commissioner, the cabinet-level official charged with the administration and enforcement of the MVFRL, to file an <em>amicus </em>statement. In response, the Commissioner filed a statement supporting reargument. The Court then granted Nationwide’s application, permitted the respondents to file an additional responsive submission, and took the matter under advisement on a submitted basis. Madame Justice Baldwin dissented, taking the position that reargument was unwarranted under the applicable Rule of Appellate Procedure.</p>
    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[291,1200,1162,1004]]]'>In his statement, the Insurance Commissioner offers his respectful disagreement with <em>Sackett I’s </em>central conclusion that that the addition of a new vehicle to an existing multivehicle policy unambiguously constitutes a new purchase of coverage. The Commissioner observes that the Insurance Department enforces the MVFRL’s requirement that, as a precondition for automobile insurers to issue policies with unstaeked UM/UIM coverage, the carriers must first obtain written waivers from the policyholders. However, the Commissioner explains that, throughout Section 1738’s seventeen-year history, once policies have been put into place, the Department has not treated the addition of a new vehicle, known in the industry as an “add-on,” as a new purchase of coverage. Rather, the Department has deemed this to be an extension of pre-existing coverage. Thus, the Department has not required carriers to issue, or policyholders to execute, serial waivers when vehicles are added to multi-vehicle policies in order to reaffirm the continuation of unstacked UM/UIM coverage.</p>

The clause explicitly permits consumers to extend existing coverage, with the same applicable types of coverage and limits, to new and/or substitute vehicles, with coverage applying automatically upon acquisition, subject to various conditions, including a requirement of timely subsequent notice to the insurer. According to the Commissioner, this procedure facilitates immediate consumer transactions and affords predictability and certainty in terms of the availability and scope of coverage. The Commissioner argues that <em>Saekett I </em>effectively nullifies the newly-acquired-vehicle clause in policies and strips policyholders of the associated benefits.</p>
    <p id="b73-4" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[128,1165,1157,583]]]'>The Commissioner expresses further concern that insurers have relied for seventeen years on its interpretation as developed above, and that the invalidation of thousands of policyholders’ UM/U1M stacking waivers may retrospectively render existing premium rates “inadequate” under various regulatory statutes,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> because those rates were based on unstacked coverage. The Commissioner notes that attendant costs may be added back into rate bases and passed on to consumers, which is antithetical to the central purpose of Section 1738, namely, cost containment and the availability of automobile insurance at competitive, affordable rates.</p>
    <p id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.6",73,[127,1791,1158,421]],["BL_74.1",74,[296,323,1162,202]]]'>The Sacketts differ substantially with the Insurance Commissioner’s portrayal of <em>Saekett I’s </em>import. According to their brief, there will always be “lag time” between the purchase of a new vehicle and the issuance of an updated policy and execution of an appropriate waiver, because, regardless of what is required of insurers upon a policyholder’s addition of a vehicle to a multi-vehicle policy, the insurer must always obtain a waiver upon the addition of a vehicle to a single-<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>vehicle policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus, the Sacketts believe that the provision of serial waiver opportunities is merely a matter of administration that is made necessary by the MVFRL and can readily be managed by insurance companies.</p>

The Sacketts claim, however, that coverage under such clauses persists only for the duration of the period within which the policyholder is required to provide notice to the insurer. <em>See id. </em>at 5-6 (“The contractual relationship of the parties [during the reporting period] is merely that the insured has agreed to accept and the insurer has agree to afford coverages during the reporting period for this new vehicle equal to the coverage on his existing vehicles in exchange for the luxury of delaying the arrangement for formal coverage at a later date.”). Thus, the Sacketts concede that, during this reporting period, the insured would retain unstacked UM7UIM coverage on the new vehicle if a valid waiver was previously executed in connection with the policy. <em>See id. </em>at 6. It is the Sacketts’ position, however, that upon the arrangement for formal coverage during the reporting period, new UM/UIM insurance is purchased on the vehicle, and thus, Section 1738 requires insurers to provide the opportunity to accept or waive stacked UM/ UIM coverage. The Sacketts believe that automatic coverage <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>under a newly-acquired-vehicle clause extends only during the reporting period, and Department’s assumption that such coverage continues throughout the life of the policy represents a fatal fallacy in its argument.</p>
    <p id="b75-4" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[131,551,1156,636]]]'>The parties and the Insurance Commissioner pursue several other lines of argument, touching on public policy, further effects of the <em>Sackett I </em>decision on the insurance industry, and points that were ably developed by Justice Castille in his dissenting opinion upon our initial review. Our interest in reargument, however, is focused on the contention that <em>Sackett I </em>can be read as negating the effect of after-acquired-vehicle clauses of automobile insurance policies, particularly since the mechanics of such provisions were not meaningfully developed in the initial proceedings in this case, and as we are aware that our initial decision has a broader effect than merely resolving the dispute between the present parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Under the Statutory Construction Act, words and phrases are to be construed according to the rules of grammar and their common and approved usage; however, technical words and phrases, and such others as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning, are to be construed in accordance with such peculiar and appropriate meaning or definition. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). The Insurance Commissioner’s submission makes plain that the “purchase” of UM/ UIM coverage under Section 1738(c) is a term of art in the automobile insurance arena that does not subsume the extension, under a contractual after-acquired-vehicle provision, of <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>the pre-existing policy terms of a multi-vehicle policy to a newly-acquired automobile.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Indeed, as noted, the Sacketts’ present argument expressly concedes this point, albeit while offering a contrary perspective concerning the duration of the extended coverage (a matter that we address further below). Thus, we clarify that <em>Sackett I </em>does not preclude the enforcement of an initial waiver of stacked UM/UIM relative to coverage extended under after-acquired-vehicle provisions of an existing multi-vehicle policy.</p>

Decisions from other jurisdictions suggest that both varieties of after-acquired-vehicle clauses (those that afford closed-term coverage solely during the reporting period and those that contemplate continuing coverage) are utilized in automobile insurance policies. For example, in <em>Bird v.

Russ, 8A Couch on Insurance § 117:25 (3d ed.2007) (characterizing continuing coverage under an after-acquired-vehicle clause upon notice of acquisition to the insurer as effecting “an extension [of coverage] beyond the initial automatic period”). To the degree that coverage under a particular after-acquired-vehicle provision continues in effect throughout the existing policy period, subject only to conditions subsequent such as notice and the payment of premiums, again, we clarify that <em>Sackett I </em>should not disturb the effect of an initial UM/UIM stacking waiver obtained in connection with a multi-vehicle policy.

Therefore, even in the aftermath of <em>Craley, </em>the Sacketts continue to regard stacking waivers secured in connection with a single-vehicle policy to be ineffective relative to intrapolicy stacking upon the addition of a second vehicle to the policy.</p>

Nor would I afford appellants the windfall of stacking coverage they expressly rejected and for which they paid no premiums. As I stated in my Dissenting Opinion (joined by Mr. Justice Eakin) in <em>Sackett I, </em>“appellants did not purchase a new policy, but simply added a vehicle to an existing policy.

Certainly, the majority decision in <em>Sackett I </em>did not discuss the issue. The issue in <em>Sackett I </em>was simply whether a new waiver of stacking of UM/UIM coverage is required when an insured adds an additional vehicle to an existing multi-vehicle policy. I would retain that primary focus.

The Majority thus notes that, based upon decisions from other jurisdictions, there may be two types of after-acquired vehicle provisions in Pennsylvania automobile insurance policies, offering different durations of “automatic coverage.” One type of coverage “afford[s] closed-term coverage solely during the reporting period” while the other type “contemplate^] continuing coverage.” The Majority suggests that a new rejection of stacking may be required “where coverage under an after-acquired-vehicle clause is expressly made finite by the terms of the policy.” Maj. Op. at 18, 940 A.2d at 334. Thus, the scope of coverage, and the prospect of recovery for future litigants, will depend upon which type of provision is in the policy. We do not know the answer to that question in this case — because it was not an issue until now — and so appellants are awarded coverage by default, coverage for which they never paid.</p>

Section 1738 contains no language requiring an additional waiver upon the purchase of an additional vehicle. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738. Further, Section 1791 of the MVFRL specifically provides that an opportunity to reject coverage must be given “at the time of application for original coverage, and no other notice or rejection shall be required.... ” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1791 (emphasis supplied). In my view, this appeal remains one involving a simple issue of statutory construction that is easily resolved by resort to the MVFRL, specifically Sections 1738 and 1791. The plain language of those two Sections, as well as nearly two decades of Insurance Commissioner-approved industry practice, compels a conclusion that no new waiver of stacking is required when an insured adds an additional vehicle to an existing multi-vehicle policy. I would not alter the issue on appeal and make the result depend upon the language of an after-acquired vehicle provision.</p>
