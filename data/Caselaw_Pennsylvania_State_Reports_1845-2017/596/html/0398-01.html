      <em>Gwynn, </em>at 150 (citations omitted). Despite appellant’s previous argument that his intoxication precluded him from making a voluntary <em>Miranda </em>waiver, he now asserts counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence that his withdrawal symptoms made a voluntary waiver impossible. We addressed the voluntariness of appellant’s <em>Miranda </em>waiver in his direct appeal, and determined the record demonstrated it was made consensually. Appellant fails to demonstrate the arguable merit of this claim of error; therefore, he fails the <em>Pierce </em>test. In addition, appellant’s argument he was suffering from withdrawal at the time of his waiver is incompatible with his previous assertion that he was under the influence of drugs at that time. Appellant has not demonstrated counsel lacked a reasonable basis for failing to present evidence of appellant’s withdrawal at the time of his waiver, or that counsel’s inaction prejudiced him. Counsel’s failure to present withdrawal evi<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>dence appears reasonable in light of the fact that he had filed a motion to suppress based on the contrary allegation of appellant’s intoxication at the time of his waiver.

For example, Appellant’s younger sister indicated as follows:</p>

It fails, however, to address the substance of Appellant’s associated claim that his counsel on direct appeal rendered deficient stewardship by failing to investigate and adduce the life-history and mental-health mitigation which he now seeks to present to a fact finder. Under the <em>Collins </em>decision, which the majority references, this is a separate and distinct claim that is not subject to the previous litigation bar and warrants independent treatment. <em>See Commonwealth v.

There has always been a conceptual tension involved in such conclusions, since a primary method of demonstrating deficiencies in the stewardship of appellate counsel lies in demonstrating the obviousness and strength of the underlying claim that such counsel is alleged to have overlooked. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="566 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="706331" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01">566 Pa. 553</a>, 567 n. 5, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d 517</a>, 526 n. 5 (2001). Indeed, viewed from this perspective, Appellant in fact has advanced a <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>substantially developed argument concerning his appellate counsel’s performance in his appellate brief. For this reason, I generally had favored affording a degree of leeway in the application of the waiver doctrine in such situations, particularly given the significance of the petitioner’s interests involved. <em>See Commonwealth v. Marinelli, </em><a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="589 Pa. 682" data-case-ids="2574600" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01">589 Pa. 682</a>, 714, <a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="910 A.2d 672" data-case-ids="2574600,8448803" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01,/a2d/910/0672-01">910 A.2d 672</a>, 690-91 (2006) (Saylor, J., concurring). I recognize, however, that the Court adopted a more formalistic approach to derivative claims in <em>Commonwealth v. McGill, </em><a href="/pa/574/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="574 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="588049" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0574-01">574 Pa. 574</a>, <a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">832 A.2d 1014</a> (2003), as a compromise designed to overcome various differences among Justices concerning the degree of required development. Nevertheless, I also have favored the allowance of some time for <em>McGill </em>to become institutionalized among the capital bar, as we certainly have not seen immediate, consistent, or even ordinary compliance. However, my personal tolerance expired in November 2006, with the issuance of <em>Marinetti, </em>in which I indicated that I would no longer maintain a minority position supporting temporary leeway for briefs failing to meet <em>McGill’s </em>specific requirements. <em>See Marinelli, </em><a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="589 Pa. 682" data-case-ids="2574600" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01">589 Pa. at 714-15</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="910 A.2d 672" data-case-ids="2574600,8448803" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01,/a2d/910/0672-01">910 A.2d at 691</a> (Saylor, J., concurring).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> In this regard, however, the present matter was submitted well before <em>Marinetti </em>was rendered.
