Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issue, as stated by Petitioner, is:\nDoes the acquittal of the possession charge here require acquittal of the greater offense of possession with intent to deliver? Should the contrary rule stated and restated by some Pennsylvania cases, which has been criticized in other jurisdictions, be reconsidered by this court because inconsistent verdicts by a judge are not entitled to the same tolerance given to those by juries?",
