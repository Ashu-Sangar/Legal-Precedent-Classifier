If it is determined that the absence is attributable to the failure of Appellant to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure, the October 24, 2006 order of the Superior Court shall be reinstated. If it is determined that the absence is attributable to court personnel, the Superior Court shall resolve on the merits the issues raised in the appeal, which were previously treated as waived.
