        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nThe single issue before the Court is: when is an injured worker entitled to concurrent compensation under both the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq., and the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cPWCA\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7 1 et seq. Resolution of this issue turns on the construction of terms in the LHWCA, specifically, whether the worker was injured while performing a \u201ctraditional maritime function\u201d and whether the situs of the injury was \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States.\u201d See Wellsville Terminals Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Zacharias), 534 Pa.333, 632 A.2d 1305 (1993). For the reasons that follow, we find that appellee was not injured \u201cupon the navigable waters of the U.S.\u201d and therefore, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nAppellee Daniel McElheney was employed as a pipe fitter welder by appellant Kvaerner Philadelphia Shipyard (\u201cEmployer\u201d). On November 13, 2002, appellee suffered injuries to his shoulder and ankle when he tripped and fell on an electric wire while working on a ship in a \u201cgraven dry dock.\u201d On February 26, 2003, employer issued a \u201cPayment of Compensation without Award\u201d and appellee received benefits under the LHWCA, which provides compensation to maritime workers for injuries occurring upon the \u201cnavigable waters of the United States.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a). Those payments ceased on June 11, 2004, when Employer\u2019s insurance carrier stopped payments after determining that appellee had sufficiently recovered and was able to return to work. Because he believed that his injuries continued to prevent him from returning to work, appellee then filed a petition seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the PWCA.\nAt the hearing before a Worker\u2019s Compensation Judge (\u201cWCJ\u201d), appellee cited the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, et al., 447 U.S. 715, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980) and argued that the LHWCA does not preempt state workers\u2019 compensation laws. Appellee claimed that there is concurrent state and federal jurisdiction when a worker\u2019s injury occurred on land while performing traditionally maritime functions. Employer countered, citing this Court\u2019s decision in Wellsville and claiming that the injury occurred over the \u201cnavigable waters of the United States,\u201d therefore precluding the application of Pennsylvania workers\u2019 compensation law. Ruling in favor of Employer, the WCJ found that appellee was performing a \u201ctraditional maritime function\u201d over the \u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d as defined under the LHWCA, and therefore, held LHWCA\u2019s jurisdiction to be exclusive. The WCJ found appellee\u2019s work not to be \u201cland-based\u201d and considered the circumstance indistinguishable from Wellsville, where this Court found exclusive LHWCA jurisdiction in a case where a welder was injured on a barge on the Ohio River that was tethered to shore. The Worker's\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (\u201cWCAB\u201d) affirmed.\nUpon appellee\u2019s appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed in a published opinion, holding that concurrent state and federal recovery was available under the present circumstances. McElheney v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Kvaerner Philadelphia Shipyard), 908 A.2d 960 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006). The panel analyzed the relevant section of the LHWCA, as amended, which reads as follows, with the 1972 amendments/additions in bold:\n.... [Compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death ... if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel).\n33 U.S.G. \u00a7 903(a) (emphasis added). Citing Sun Ship, the panel agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Congress\u2019 intent that the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA supplemented, rather than supplanted, state workers\u2019 compensation law, and held that there is concurrent jurisdiction over the \u201cadjoining\u201d land-based maritime sites included in the 1972 amendments. McElheney, 908 A.2d at 964-65. Referring to Justice Burton\u2019s Avondale Concurring Opinion describing different types of dry docks, the panel below acknowledged that recovery is barred under the PWCA when an injury occurs on a floating dry dock, pursuant to Wellsville. This was so because Wellsville held that concurrent jurisdiction existed only over land-based injuries to workers performing traditionally maritime functions where the injuries occurred within the landward extension of the LHWCA. The panel considered concurrent recovery available in the present case because appellee was injured on a ship that was not afloat, but \u201cin a physical sense on land.\u201d McElheney, 908 A.2d at 965-66 (internal quotations omitted). We granted Employer\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to consider the question of concurrent versus exclusive jurisdiction.\nIn workers\u2019 compensation appeals, this Court will affirm the adjudication below unless we find that an error of law was committed, that constitutional rights were violated, that a practice or procedure of a Commonwealth agency was not followed, or that any necessary finding of fact is not supported by substantial evidence of record. See Hannaberry v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Snyder, Jr.), 575 Pa.66, 834 A.2d 524, 527 (2003). Here, because appellee was undoubtedly engaged in a traditionally maritime function, the precise issue before the Court is whether a graven dry dock is within the \u201cnavigable waters of the U.S.\u201d and thus within the exclusive purview of the LHWCA, or whether it is land-based and within the judicially recognized zone of concurrent state and federal workers\u2019 compensation jurisdiction.\nOn appeal, Employer claims that appellee\u2019s work was not land-based and that his injuries, which were suffered while on a dry-docked vessel, occurred over the \u201cnavigable waters of the United States.\u201d Employer claims that appellee\u2019s benefits are therefore limited to those provided under the LHWCA and that, pursuant to the reasoning of the WCJ, appellee is barred from recovering under the PWCA. Employer argues that the Commonwealth Court erred when it distinguished between a graven dry dock and a floating dry dock. Employer also posits that the Commonwealth Court incorrectly construed Justice Burton\u2019s Avondale concurrence describing different dry docks. Employer argues that the sentence following the one relied upon by the Commonwealth Court in support of its differential treatment of dry docks directly contradicts the court\u2019s conclusion:\n[a] ship is no more or less on land when it rests on a graven dry dock than when it rests on a marine railway. The three types of dry docks are not different in kind; functionally they are the same. And I see no basis for concluding that Congress treated one differently from the others for the purposes of [the LHWCA].\nSee Avondale, 346 U.S. at 367, 74 S.Ct. 100 (Burton, J., concurring).\nAppellee, on the other hand, urges this Court to affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court. Appellee argues that because his injuries occurred on land, they therefore fall within the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d which allows a claimant to recover under both state and federal workers\u2019 compensation law. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the decision of the Commonwealth Court that, under the circumstances sub judice, recovery is available under both the LHWCA and the PWCA.\nPrior to passage of the LHWCA, the U.S. Supreme Court drew a jurisdictional fine at the water\u2019s edge, barring the application of state workers\u2019 compensation laws to maritime workers under the Admiralty Clause of the U.S. Constitution. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 214-15, 218, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1917) (citing U.S. Const, art. III \u00a7 2). The Court reasoned that this distinction was in the national interest of promoting the uniformity of national maritime law. Id. at 216, 37 S.Ct. 524. A very short time later, however, the Court narrowed the application of Jensen and allowed maritime workers to recover under state workers\u2019 compensation law when their employment was \u201clocal\u201d in character. See Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U.S. 233, 242, 42 S.Ct. 89, 66 L.Ed. 210 (1921).\nIn 1927, Congress, in an apparent effort to protect maritime workers excluded by Jensen, enacted the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, providing compensation for maritime workers injured on the navigable waters of the United States. The relevant text of the 1927 act is as follows:\nCompensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\n33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (1927). Hence, recovery was available to workers injured upon the navigable waters of the U.S. who did not otherwise have a remedy through state workers\u2019 compensation law.\nThere was, however, still confusion in the \u201cmaritime but local\u201d context. Thus, in Davis v. Department of Labor and Industries of Washington, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246 (1942), the U.S. Supreme Court alluded to a \u201ctwilight zone\u201d where jurisdiction was difficult to determine, and acknowledged concurrent jurisdiction between state and federal workers\u2019 compensation law under certain circumstances. See id. at 256-58, 63 S.Ct. 225. As this Court noted, at that time, \u201c[wjorkers who fit into the Davis \u2018twilight zone\u2019 would be entitled to a claim under either the LHWCA or the state workmen\u2019s compensation program.\u201d Wellsville, 632 A.2d at 1307.\nIn Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., 370 U.S. 114, 82 S. Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962), the High Court widened the zone of concurrent jurisdiction further, concluding that Congress\u2019 use of the phrase \u201cif recovery ... may not validly be provided by State law\u201d was meant to apply the LHWCA to all injuries occurring on navigable waters, without regard to the \u201cmaritime but local\u201d concern. Id. at 126-127, 82 S.Ct. 1196. The Sun Ship Court later noted, however, that in the period where the LHWCA did not cover injuries to traditional maritime workers that occurred while on land:\nBefore 1972, then, marine-related injuries fell within one of three jurisdictional spheres as they moved landward. At the furthest extreme, Jensen commanded that nonlocal maritime injuries fall within LHWCA. Maritime but local injuries upon the navigable waters of the United States could be compensated under the LHWCA or under state law. And injuries suffered beyond navigable waters \u2014 albeit within the range of federal admiralty jurisdiction \u2014 where remediable only under state law.\nSun Ship, 447 U.S. at 719, 100 S.Ct. 2432 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nWith the 1972 amendments, Congress expressly extended the LHWCA\u2019s jurisdictional reach landward, by including the following land-based sites along with dry docks, as within the applicable scope of \u201cthe navigable waters of the United States\u201d: \u201cany adjoining pier, wharf, ... terminal, building, way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel.\u201d See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a).\nThe U.S. Supreme Court first interpreted the significance of the \u201cland-based\u201d amendments in Sun Ship when it was asked to decide whether a state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law could apply to land-based injuries falling within the coverage of the amended LHWCA. 447 U.S. at 716, 100 S.Ct. 2432. Answering in the affirmative, the Court concluded that the amendment \u201csupplements, rather than supplants state compensation law[,]\u201d and found concurrent jurisdiction over the amendments\u2019 land-based sites, further expanding the zone of concurrent jurisdiction. Id. at 716, 720, 100 S.Ct. 2432. Writing for the majority, Justice William Brennan considered the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA to be remedial in nature and concluded that Congress extended federal jurisdiction landward, as \u201ca source of relief for injuries which had always been viewed as the province of state compensation law.\u201d Id. at 719, 725-26, 100 S.Ct. 2432.\nOn the practical implications of concurrent jurisdiction, the Court in Sun Ship found that workers who initially filed claims under state law could make up the difference between the state remedy and the federal minimum standard by seeking relief under the LHWCA. Id. at 724, 100 S.Ct. 2432. Additionally, the Court recognized that concurrent jurisdiction could result in more favorable awards if state remedies were more generous than federal. The Court, however, did not believe that \u201cCongress was concerned about a disparity between adequate federal benefits and superior state benefits.\u201d Id. The Court thus reaffirmed the Davis Court\u2019s rejection of the notion of exclusivity of jurisdiction under the LHWCA. Id. at 724-25, 100 S.Ct. 2432.\nThis Court considered the application of the 1972 amendments and the Sun Ship decision in Wellsville. Wellsville involved a welder who was injured while repairing a barge on the Ohio River that was tethered to land. 632 A.2d at 1306. Although significantly narrowed over the years, this Court found that Jensen had not been affected by Sun Ship, and thus, it still constitutionally bars maritime employees who are injured over navigable waters while performing traditionally maritime functions from recovering under state workers\u2019 compensation law. Id. at 1807. Interpreting Sun Ship, the Wellsville Court considered concurrent jurisdiction to exist \u201cover injuries that fall within the coverage of the LHWCA which had been slightly extended onto land as a result of the 1972 Congressional amendments.\u201d Id. at 1307. The Court found the fact that the barge was held in position by a cable attached to land was too tenuous a connection to make it land-based and within the concurrent purview of state law. Id. at 1308. We therefore concluded that recovery under the LHWCA was exclusive and that the Commonwealth Court had erred in applying \u201cthe Davis and Sun Ship \u2018twilight zone\u2019 exceptions to the Jensen doctrine\u201d premised upon its finding that the claimant\u2019s work was \u201csufficiently land-based.\u201d Id. at 1307, 1309.\nIn reaching its conclusion, the Wellsville Court relied on the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Flowers v. Travelers Insurance Co., 258 F.2d 220 (5th Cir.1958). Flowers held that exclusive LHWCA jurisdiction existed where a welder was injured on a floating dry dock in a shipyard in Galveston Harbor. Wellsville, 632 A.2d at 1308 (citing Flowers, 258 F.2d at 221, 228). The Fifth Circuit found that the LHWCA provided the exclusive remedy and that the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d exception did not apply because, although the injured worker had some land-based duties, his injury occurred over navigable waters while repairing a ship, a traditional maritime activity. Id. at 1308-09 (discussing Flowers, 258 F.2d 220). (Flowers, of course, was decided prior to the enactment of the 1972 Amendments.)\nTurning to the case at bar, as a pipe fitter welder working aboard a dry-docked vessel, appellee was clearly performing a traditionally maritime function. See Wellsville, 632 A.2d at 1308 (\u201cship repair is clearly a traditional maritime activity\u201d). Thus, the situs of the work injury is the central issue before the Court. More precisely, we must determine within which category graven dry docks fall \u2014 are they within the \u201cnavigable waters of the United States\u201d and thus within the exclusive jurisdiction of the LHWCA, or are they land-based and covered concurrently by state and federal law?\nWe hold that a graven dry dock is a land-based site within the scope of the 1972 land-based amendments to the LHWCA. Though \u201cdry dock\u201d was included in the original language of the LHWCA, it is undoubtedly -within the scope of Sun Ship\u2019s application of the statute as amended, i.e., as an \u201carea customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel.\u201d See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a). A graven dry dock, by definition, is cut and dug out of the land. This is sufficient to make it \u201cland-based.\u201d The periodic and artificial flooding of the graven dry dock with water is insufficient to divorce the site from land and render it exclusively within the limits of the \u201cnavigable waters of the U.S.\u201d If a wharf and a pier, which extend out over the water, are within Sun Ship\u2019s zone of concurrent jurisdiction, then so too should an area of land that is carved out of the terrain and periodically and deliberately flooded. Furthermore, a contrary holding' would allow for concurrent jurisdiction over injuries occurring during the construction of a graven dry dock, but would prohibit concurrent recovery to workers injured on the same site once the dry dock is complete. Finally, this holding is in keeping with what the U.S. Supreme Court described as Congress\u2019 remedial intent behind the 1972 amendments. Therefore, we hold that the LHWCA and the PWCA share concurrent jurisdiction over graven dry docks.\nFurthermore, we agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s distinction of Wellsville, where the barge the welder was injured on was floating on a river, and \u201cits only \u2018nexus\u2019 to land was a cable holding the barge in position.\u201d Wellsville, 632 A.2d at 1308. Unlike the Commonwealth Court, however, we do not find the fact that the vessel in this case was resting \u201con land\u201d at the time of injury to be dispositive. A graven dry dock is land-based regardless of how much water has been flooded into it when a vessel enters or exits, and an injury occurs. The reason for this conclusion is also practical; to accept the analysis of the Commonwealth Court would cause concurrent jurisdiction to ebb and flow with the rising and receding waters within the graven dry dock \u2014 concurrent when the ship is resting on the floor of the dry dock, but exclusive when the vessel is afloat within the confines of the dry dock. Additionally, where the injury occurs within the dry dock is insignificant. There is concurrent LHWCA and PWCA jurisdiction whether the injury occurred on the dry-docked vessel or on the dry dock apparatus itself.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that a graven dry dock is a land-based site within the jurisdiction of both the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The decision of the Commonwealth Court is hereby affirmed.\nFormer Chief Justice CAPPY and former Justices BALDWIN and FITZGERALD did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustices SAYLOR, EAKIN and BAER join the opinion.\n. A \"graven\u201d or \"graving\u201d dry dock has been described as:\n[AJ fixed basin usually of stone masonry, concrete, or piling cells adjacent to the water\u2019s edge. It can be closed off from the waterway by a moveable watertight barrier.... It can there be pumped dry, allowing a ship to settle down on blocking set on the dock floor.\nDepartment of Defense, \"Maintenance of Waterfront Facilities,\u201d (June 1978), at \u00b6 1.4.2.5.1, available at http://www.usace.army.mil/ publications/armytm/tm5-622/c-l.pdf; see also, Department of Defense, \"Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC), Maintenance and Operation: Maintenance of Waterfront Facilities,\u201d (June 19, 2001), at \u00b6 2-2.4, available at http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOD/UFC/ufc \u2014 4\u2014150\u201407.pdf, (same). Justice Harold Burton's often cited description of the three different types of dry docks is as follows:\n[TJhere are three kinds of dry docks. (1) A floating dry dock, as its name makes clear, floats on the water, the vessel resting on the bottom of the dry dock after the water has been removed. (2) A graven dry dock is dug into the land. The vessel floats in but rests on land once the water has been pumped out. (3) Finally there is the marine railway, on which the vessel is drawn out of the water, instead of the water being drawn away from the vessel.\nAvondale Marine Ways, Inc. v. Henderson, 346 U.S. 366, 367, 74 S.Ct. 100, 98 L.Ed. 77 (1953) (Burton, J., concurring).\n. This fact and conclusion are not disputed by the parties.\n. The Admiralty Clause reads as follows:\nThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; ... to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction....\nU.S. Const art. Ill \u00a7 2.\n. Describing the uncertain definition of \"maritime but local,\u201d the Court in Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962), stated:\nNo dependable definition of the area \u2014 described as \"maritime but local,\u201d or \"of local concern\u201d \u2014 where state laws could apply ever emerged from the many cases which dealt with the matter in this and the lower courts. The surest that could be said was that any particular injury might be within the area of \"local concern,\u201d depending upon its peculiar facts. In numerous situations state acts were considered inapplicable because they were thought to work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, particularly in cases of employees engaged in repair work. On the other hand, awards under state compensation acts were sustained in situations wherein the effect on uniformity was often difficult to distinguish from those found to be outside the purview of state laws.\nId. at 119, 82 S.Ct. 1196 (footnote omitted).\n. The title of the Act was changed to the \"Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d in 1984. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq., amended by Pub.L. 98-426.\n. In explaining why its conclusion was consistent with previous decisions, the Court in Calbeck, for example, discussed Avondale, supra, and noted that the claimant\u2019s injury, which occurred on a marine railway, occurred \u201cupon navigable waters\" and was therefore within the LHWCA. The Court noted that, \u201d[a]t the same time, since the injury did, in a physical sense occur on land, there is little doubt that a state compensation act could validly have been applied to it.\u201d Calbeck, 370 U.S. at 129, 82 S.Ct. 1196.\n. \u201cDry dock\u201d was included in the original language of the statute. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (1927).\n. Like appellee, the injured workers in Sim Ship were injured while building or repairing ships on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River. 447 U.S. at 716, 100 S.Ct. 2432.\n. Addressing the possible conflict within a concurrent jurisdiction scheme, and consistent with its remedial interpretation of the amended LHWCA, the Court in Sun Ship noted:\n[FN6] Most often, state workmen\u2019s compensation laws will not be treated as making awards thereunder final or conclusive. Admittedly, if a particular state compensation law provision does indisputably declare its awards final, a conflict with the LHWCA may possibly arise where a claimant seeks inferior state benefits in the first instance. But the consequences to the claimant of this error would be less drastic than those of a mistake under the rule appellant contemplates \u2014 under which a misstep could result in no benefits. At any rate, although the question is not directly before us, we observe that if federal preclusion ever need be implied to cope with this remote contingency, a less disruptive approach would be to pre-empt the state compensation exclusivity clause, rather than to pre-empt the entire state compensation statute as appellant suggests.\ns}: % }\u00a3 \u00edfc sj: >\u00a1c\nFinally, we are not persuaded that the bare fact that the federal and state compensation systems are different gives rise to a conflict that, from the employer's standpoint, necessitates exclusively for each compensation system within a separate sphere. Mandating exclusive jurisdiction will not relieve employers of their distinct obligations under state and federal compensation law. The line that circumscribes the jurisdictional compass of the LHWCA \u2014 a compound of \"status\u201d and \"situs\u201d \u2014 is no less vague than its counterpart in the pre\u201ctwilight zone\u201d Jensen era. Thus, even were the LHWCA exclusive within its field, many employers would be compelled to abide by state-imposed responsibilities lest a claim fall beyond the scope of the LHWCA. Our observation about exclusive jurisdiction in Davis v. Department of Labor, is apt whether jurisdictional barriers are erected on land or at the water's edge: \"The horns of the jurisdictional dilemma press as sharply on employers as on employees.\u201d 317 U.S. at 255, 63 S.Ct. at 228.\nSun Ship, 447 U.S. at 724 n. 6, 725, 100 S.Ct. 2432 (internal citations omitted).\n. We also find it significant that all these areas are included in the same descriptive parenthetical in the Act. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (\"... the navigable waters of the United States (including any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel\u2019\u2019)).\n. Diy dock construction is certainly not over \u201cthe navigable waters of the U.S.,\u201d so it is not excluded from state jurisdiction, and at least one other court has found injuries to workers constructing a dry dock to be within the purview of the LHWCA. See, e.g., Brown & Root, Inc. v. Joyner, 607 F.2d 1087, 1090 (4th Cir.1979).\n. We emphasize that this analysis does not necessarily extend to floating dry docks. Justice Burton's belief that all dry docks be treated similarly\u2018would appear to be administratively convenient. However, due to the unfixed nature of floating dry docks, Wellsville could easily be applicable, which would bar concurrent recovery for injuries occurring on floating dry docks. Nonetheless, that issue is not before the Court and we do not reach it.",
