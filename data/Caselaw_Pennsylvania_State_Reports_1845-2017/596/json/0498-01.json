The issue, rephrased for clarity, is:\nWhether the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that an administrative agency\u2019s notice that clearly advises the recipient of the effective date of the agency\u2019s action, but that does not specifically designate a \u201cdate of mailing,\u201d is insufficient to begin the appeal period? If the notice is sufficient, is the recipient entitled to an appeal nunc pro tunc?",
