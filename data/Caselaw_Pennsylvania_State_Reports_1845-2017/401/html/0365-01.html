The County Board of Elections thereafter adopted two resolutions, one on September 6, and the other on September 8, 1960, ordering and directing that the electors of the portions of Barry Township which were annexed to Butler Township, as hereinabove stated, should continue to vote in Barry Township as they did prior to the annexation, that the County Registration Commission should forthwith return the registrations of such electors or any new registrations for the area, to the Barry Township Election Districts for voting purposes as theretofore and, further, that the County Board of Elections should prepare the ballots for the Barry Township Election Districts accordingly.</p>

The plaintiffs sought thereby to restrain the defendants from carrying out the intent and purpose of the above mentioned resolutions of the County Board of Elections of September 6 and 8, 1960. The plaintiffs also prayed issuance of a preliminary injunction in the premises pending final hearing and determination of their complaint. A rule was granted on the defendants to show <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue as prayed for. The defendants promptly filed preliminary objections to the complaint. Argument was duly had thereon before the court en banc with the result that, on September 26, 1960, the court (one judge dissenting) entered the following order: “The preliminary objections are dismissed; the rule is made absolute. The preliminary injunction shall issue.”</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.5",388,[265,836,1145,650]]]'>On September 29, 1960, the County Commissioners of Schuylkill County, acting as the County Board of Elections, appealed the order to this court and filed a bond, thereby making the appeal a supersedeas as provided by statute. The next day (viz., September 30th) the plaintiffs filed a bond in the sum of $1,000 and the Prothonotary issued a writ of injunction based on the court’s order of September 26, 1960. Because of the public interest involved and the urgent necessity for an early decision on the merits, we advanced the appeals for disposition on submitted briefs and record, which are now before us.</p>
    <p id="b388-5" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[263,1505,1144,477]]]'>The questions of law raised by the appellants may be summarized as follows: (1) Can a preliminary injunction issue until the applicant files bond to indemnify the defendant against consequent damages? (2) Did the court of equity have jurisdiction of this proceeding? (3) Can a board of county commissioners or a court of equity transfer a portion of one legislative voting district to another legislative voting district?</p>

In the meantime, the defendants had appealed to this court on September 29th. There is no question about the correctness of the rule <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>of law relied upon by tbe defendants. See <em>Surco Products, Inc. v.

However, tbe court order of September 26, 1960, making absolute tbe rule for a preliminary injunction and directing that such injunction should issue, was misunderstood by tbe appellants as constituting tbe injunction which, actually, did not issue until September 30, 1960, when the protlionotary executed tbe writ of injunction and the plaintiffs filed tbe required security bond. An order making absolute a rule for judgment or an order directing tbe entry of judgment by tbe protbonotary is interlocutory. Cf. <em>Magaro v.

But where, as here, tbe court does no more than make absolute a rule for a preliminary injunction and directs that such injunction shall issue, it is tbe carrying out of tbe order by tbe issuance of an injunction that becomes appealable. Tbe fact is that tbe defendants’ appeal in this case preceded tbe definitive injunction by a day. In any event, tbe prematurity of tbe appeal by one day could be readily remedied by tbe filing of another appeal, but that would be time consuming and only entail further delay in tbe final disposition of tbe pending matter on tbe merits. Tbe complete record of tbe case is now before us with extensive briefs of counsel and exhaustive opinions for tbe court below and tbe dissenting judge. <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>We shall, therefore, treat the record as amended so as to show that the appeal was taken on September 30th instead of September 29 th. That is not a matter of assuming to extend the time xvithin which an appeal can be taken, but quite the contrary. The time for appeal has not yet run.</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[241,732,1147,1480]]]'>The court below had jurisdiction of the proceeding. As we recently pointed out in <em>McGinley v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/401/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="401 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="1294471" data-case-paths="/pa/401/0310-01">401 Pa. 310</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.2d%20424" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="164 A.2d 424">164 A. 2d 424</a>, the general equity jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas of the Commonwealth by virtue of Section 13 of the Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 784, 17 PS §281, embraces the power to prevent or restrain “the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community, or the rights of individuals,” citing <em>Zerbe Township School District v. Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/353/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="353 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="465981" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0162-01">353 Pa. 162</a>, 168, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20566" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="44 A.2d 566">44 A. 2d 566</a>, and cases there cited. The complaint in this case avers that the action of the Board of County Commisioners of Schuylkill County, sitting as the County Board of Elections, contravened Section 2 of the Legislative Apportionment Act of July 29, 1953, P.L. 956, 25 PS §2216, and further, that the action of the defendants constitutes a disfranchisement of the plaintiffs and all other electors in the portions of Barry Township annexed to Butler Township. Neither the fact that the complainants may prove unable to sustain the allegations of their bill nor the fact that the court may be without power to grant the relief sought, does not serve to deny equity’s jurisdiction in the first instance. Unquestionably equity would have had jurisdiction to enjoin the County Board of Elections from attempting to transfer a portion of one legislative election district to another.</p>

The answer to that question is simply and definitely “No”.</p>

Section 2 of the Legislative Apportionment Act, 25 PS §2216, then provided, in presently material connection, that “The foregoing apportionment is based on the United States decennial census of one thousand nine hundred and fifty. . . . and any township, borough, city or ward, or any portion thereof, annexed to any other township, borough, city or ward since such census, shall form a part of the district to which the territory comprised within such township, borough, city or ward, or portion thereof, is allotted by the provisions of this act, according to the political division existing at the time of such census.” That disposes, adversely to the plaintiffs, of the barrier which they sought to erect by their complaint.</p>

This is the first time that such <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>a question lias been brought to this court under any of the apportionment acts passed pursuant to the constitutional direction of Article II, §18, that “The General Assembly at its first session after the adoption of this [1874] Constitution, and immediately after each United States decennial census, shall apportion the State into senatorial and representative districts . . . .”</p>

Commissioners, </em>5 Lehigh County Law Journal 183 (1912). In each of these cases the court recognized that the annexations could not operate to change the boundaries of the representative districts as prescribed by the legislature pursuant to the provision in Article II, §18, of the Constitution. Incidentally, the restrictive j&gt;rovision of Section 2 of the Act of 1906, supra, was not nearly as specific as Section 2 of the presently pertinent Act of 1953 with respect to the annexation of a part of one legislatively apportioned area to another.</p>

The function of dividing the State into senatorial and representative districts is, by virtue of Arti<a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>ele II, §18, of the Constitution,' so exclusively the province of the legislature alone, that an apportionment once made, <em>as the Constitution prescribes, </em>is not subject, in any way, to alteration or control by any other governmental branch or department; nor is it amenable to judicial review or interference even negatively exerted, as here, by injunctive restraint.
