In reversing the judgment in favor of the mother, this Court, at page 525, made the following significant comment: “The right to recover for loss of companionship is confined to cases where a husband sues for injuries to his wife. The law does not recognize loss of companionship as an element of damage in any other relation.” In <em>Donoghue v.

At common law the husband had an action for damages for injury to the wife whereby he lost her services, because he had the right to her services, including her earnings. The right arose from the common law relation of unity of person, the husband as to personal property and services being the <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>person. But marriage is a civil contract involving rights under the control of the lawmaking power. The legislature may sever the unity of person, and as to property, the right to separate earnings of the wife, and the damages for personal injury to her, it has already done so to a very great extent. It would be but a step farther in the same direction to take away altogether the husband’s action for loss of services of the wife.”</p>

But it is only after an historical inquiry is made into the ancient origins of the gander’s sauce, as it were, and as it is applied to the situation at hand, that one can conclude, as we do, that either 1) the sauce was never a proper ingredient of the diet or 2) however indispensable it may have been in decades past, it has no place in that diet today.

Of that we have been aware. The roots which at one time, if ever, gave nurture and a legitimate birth to the husband’s right to assert a claim for loss of consortium have long since wizened and died. They owe their origin to a seed of thought which, when viewed by the eyeglass of the present day, none should accept, much less implant anew. In St. Matthew’s Gospel, Chapter XIX, we find the precept that “a man shall leave [his] father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh.” The lawyers at early common law seem to have developed this into the legal principle that “by marriage the husband and wife are one person and the husband is that one.” Sir William Blackstone declared that “Upon this principle of a union of person in husband and wife depend almost all the legal rights, duties and disabilities that either of them acquire by the marriage” and that “the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband under whose wing, protection and cover she performs everything” : Book I, Chap. 15, Blackstone’s Commentaries, 1 Lewis 411. In effect, the woman spouse was her husband’s chattel, his property. She owed him duties much the same as did a servant his master. If he by injury to her suffered a loss of some feudal service owing to him by her, he and he alone — for she was too inferior a subject to have any such right, much less the privilege to assert it — was allowed to sue to recover, just as he would sue for injuries done to his cattle. He, for all technical purposes, owned her at common law and, consistent with that now universally rejected theory, he was accorded the right to recover for “loss of consortium”. That the woman today is not regarded as she was at common law is too obvious for comment. <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>The husband’s right to recover on this theory is without present day justification. The historical fictions have been shattered. The pillars which for decades had been regarded as lending support to this monument to the lord are today so effectively undermined by remedial legislation which recognizes the status of the wife as equal to that of her spouse that, in an increasing number of jurisdictions, they are being razed rather than looked to for further and extended service. As stated in <em>Kaczorowski v. Kalkosinski, </em><a href="/pa/321/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="321 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1165873" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0438-01">321 Pa. 438</a>, 444, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%20663" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="184 A. 663">184 Atl. 663</a> (1936), in speaking of the long established legal prohibition of tort actions between spouses, “When the policy behind a rule no longer exists, the rule should disappear.” In this connection we note the following language of the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Kronenbitter v. Washburn Wire Co., </em><a href="/ny-2d/4/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 N.Y.2d 524" data-case-ids="2248447" data-case-paths="/ny-2d/4/0524-01">4 N.Y.2d 524</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20N.E.2d%20898" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="151 N.E.2d 898">151 N.E. 2d 898</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20N.Y.S.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="176 N.Y.S.2d 354">176 N.Y.S.2d 354</a>, 355 (1958) : “To decide otherwise would be contrary to principle . . . The argument that equality of the sexes calls for a change overlooks that the husband’s right to damages for loss of consortium is based on outworn theory.” .Then, quoting from 18 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 219, 229, the court adopting the language of Professor Jaffe continued : “ ‘More persuasive is the argument that since the husband has an action, so should the wife. But his action is a fossil from an earlier era. It is one of a group of archaic actions based on the notion that the paterfamilias was alone competent to sue for losses suffered by the family unit . . . When to the husband’s action there is now added the wife’s action for negligent injuries (which being emancipated she is .entitled to bring) there is a danger of duplicating elements of damage. Ingenious efforts must be made to disentangle from the wife’s recovery the constitutents of the husband’s cause of action. Indeed, <em>the emancipation argues for the restriction or abolition of these </em>

It is feared that absurd results, already promised by the following cases, would but spread epidemically were we to create in the wife a right which we have already seen she never had at common law. In the very recent case of <em>Anderson and Wheeler v. Rogers, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/21/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="21 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 13" data-case-ids="1647305" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/21/0013-01">21 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 13</a> (1959), we see this anomalous situation. A married woman was injured on April 21, 1956. She sued on March 5, 1957. She was divorced very shortly thereafter. She was remarried in June of 1957. On April 11, 1958, a motion was made to amend the complaint so as to plead a cause of action in favor of her former husband who the attorneys and court believed was still married to her. This was allowed after her divorce and remarriage. Later, on August 4, 1959, a petition was made to amend the amended complaint so as to substitute the name “Barnes” (the name of her second husband) wherever the name “Wheeler” had appeared, thus seeking to afford the second husband recovery for <em>his </em>loss of consortium. This was denied on the sole ground that the Statute of Limitations had barred his claim. The following interesting discussion appears in that opinion: “The case at bar presents the possibility of a unique circumstance. Had Pearline Wheeler informed counsel of the change in her marital status at the time when it occurred or prior to the <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>expiration of the Statute of Limitations, both the former and present husbands might have appeared in this case as parties-plaintiff with separate causes of action for medical expenses and loss of consortium suffered by each while married to the plaintiff-wife and resulting from her alleged injuries caused by the alleged negligence of the defendants. There does not appear to be any reason preventing such an inclusion of parties plaintiff if each of their actions were to be filed timely.” This case relied on <em>Orga v. Pittsburgh Railways Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/155/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="155 Pa. Super. 82" data-case-ids="1056988" data-case-paths="/pa-super/155/0082-01">155 Pa.

There a woman was injured five weeks before her marriage to plaintiff. The lower court had charged the jury that the husband was entitled to damages, present negligence, for loss of consortium and the jury so found. No objection to this charge was made at the trial and the issue was held improperly raised for the first time on appeal to the Superior Court. But that court, referring to the husband’s right to recover under those circumstances had timely objection been made, said at 85: “As to compensation for the loss of his wife’s services, there is very respectable authority in other jurisdictions to support a verdict for that, too.” This bit of dictum in <em>Orga </em>was specifically rejected by a court of inferior jurisdiction in <em>Donough v.

Rather do we share President Judge Henninger’s thoughts as expressed in <em>Mlynek v. Yarnall, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/19/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="19 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 333" data-case-ids="1643142" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/19/0333-01">supra,</a> in the following language: “If, as contended, the husband’s right to recover for loss of consortium is based upon the wife’s lowly status as a servant or as a chattel, then to grant the wife a right to so recover does not lift the wife to the status of her husband, but it reduces the husband to the outworn concept of the wife’s lowly status. Rather than grant to the wife the right to damages for loss of consortium, the logical solution would be to terminate the husband’s claim on the theory that the wife is no longer the servant and chattel.”</p>

In <em>Karchner v.

That right is preserved to the wife in <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>many jurisdictions which disallow recovery by her as against a negligent defendant for loss of consortium. Said Cohen, L. J., in Best, supra, “. . . in the enticement cases intentional infringement of the rights of the consort is an essential ingredient in the cause of action. The remedy in that case may therefore be treated as a natural extension of the principle. . . . Moreover, no injustice can be done to the defendant since, ex hypothesi, his action was malicious. . . In cases such as the one before us, however, it is impossible to suggest any malice against the wife on the part of the defendant or any intentional interference with her right of consortium. . . It seems to me, therefore, that it would be an extension of a line of decisions in itself anomalous if we were, in such cases as the present, to recognize a right of action in a wife corresponding to that which the courts have recognized as vested in the husband. . . . True it is . . . that this involves the recognition of a distinction between the respective rights of a husband and of wife which is contrary to current <em>opinion; </em>but it has never been held that the wife has any right of servitium from the husband, and an extension of the principle to actions by the wife seems to me to involve real hardship on a defendant who will have already paid damages to the husband, in assessing which, allowance will, I think, have been made for the impairment of his ability to perform his obligation to support his wife.” The opinion of another Justice sitting in the same case reads, in part, as follows: . . if the husband’s own right had first come in question as res integra today, it would probably have been negatived. As it is, the husband’s right being deeply entrenched in authority and the wife’s, never having been affirmed, I think that the intervention of the legislature would be needed to produce equality either by abolishing the husband’s cause of action or by retaining it and <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>conferring a similar cause of action on the wife. I do not believe that at present the wife has such a cause of action as is claimed. Whether she ought to is, of course, quite another question.” Our thinking is in accord with this approach to the question presented. Believing the cause of action for “loss of consortium” to be an anachronism, we are unwilling to extend the rule allowing it to another line of cases. Accordingly, we hold that a married woman has no cause of action in Pennsylvania in trespass for the loss of her husband’s consortium caused by the negligent act of a third party.</p>

It was in fact based on the same ground as gave a master a right to sue for an injury to his servant if the latter was thereby unable to perform his duties.

To begin with, there was very definite physical work performed by Mrs. Spangler, for which no sums were drawn from the family budget. . .

I would, however, invite attention to the monumental decision of the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, in the case of <em>Hitaffer v. Argonne Co., Inc., </em><a href="/citations/?q=87%20U.S.%20App.%20D.C.%2057" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="87 U.S. App. D.C. 57">87 U.S. App. D.C. 57</a>, where the Court, after learnedly and exhaustively considering the principal decisions on the subject, said: “The husband owes the same degree of love, affection, felicity, etc., to the wife as she to him. He also owes the material service of support, but above and beyond that he renders other services as his mate’s helper in her duties, as advisor and counselor, etc. Under such circumstances it would be a judicial fiat for us to say that a wife may not have an action for loss of consortium due to negligence.”</p>

It is appropriate in this day, when human rights are on the tongues and in the hearts and minds of men, women and children everywhere, and when the very existence of civilization depends on whether fundamental human rights shall survive, for this court to recognize and enforce this right of a wife, a right based on the sacred relationship of marriage and home. Answering the defendant in error’s argument, ive do indeed have a ‘charge to keep,’ but that charge is not to perpetuate error or to allow our reasoning or conscience to decay or to turn deaf ears to new light and new life.”</p>
