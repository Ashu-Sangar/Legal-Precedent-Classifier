    <p id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[137,758,1151,757]]]'>The basic facts are that between 4:30 and 5 o’clock in the afternoon of October 3, 1956, plaintiff was busy at his job for the State Highway Department filling and lighting the type of round lantern that marks the presence of road construction. This was on Route 80 in Indiana County. These lanterns burn kerosene, and after plaintiff blew, one out and was filling and lighting it, it exploded and set him on fire. It was later established by test that the liquid which he had put in the lantern was not kerosene, as he believed from long usage, but was a mixture, about half and half, of kerosene and gasoline. The question in the case is how and by whose fault the gasoline came to be mixed with the kerosene.</p>
    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.6",657,[133,1536,1152,869]],["BL_658.1",658,[245,371,1144,369]]]'>Plaintiff filled the lantern that exploded from one of two empty five-gallon cans which he had had filled just before by an attendant at the Highway Department’s maintenance barn. It was his job to call at the barn with his own truck and cans, to get the cans filled, to sign a slip for the kerosene, to drive to the road construction, and there to fill the lanterns. At the barn there were four pumps, the first holding diesel oil, the second kerosene, and the last two gasoline; the matching tanks were underground. The attendant filled plaintiff’s cans from the second, or kerosene, tank, but did not inspect what emerged from the hose. He testified that the kerosene tank held 564 gallons; that defendant delivered only diesel oil and kerosene and the Atlantic Refining Company delivered gasoline; and that the opening of the kerosene tank was at least' <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>an inch smaller than that of the gasoline tank. He heard of the accident later and on October 6th a supervisor came and tested the kerosene with a match; it lighted explosively, unlike kerosene. On instructions the attendant called defendant, who was the kerosene distributor, and he came and pumped the tank out and replaced it with kerosene.</p>
    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[239,754,1149,977]]]'>The Highway Department records show a delivery of 500 gallons of kerosene on October 2nd from the Sherer Oil Company, additional defendant, per Carmen Dick, defendant; also a delivery of 2384 gallons of gasoline by Atlantic Refining Company on October 3rd, which the attendant said arrived between 8 and 10 o’clock in the evening; and 69 gallons of kerosene by Sherer Oil on October 6th. Between October 2nd and 6th there were five withdrawals of kerosene. The kerosene that was used and tested after the accident, all of it drawn from the tank at the barn, did not look or smell or ignite like kerosene. A mechanic testified that shortly after the accident on October 3rd he took a sample from both the gasoline and kerosene tanks at the maintenance barn, that they both had the same pinkish color and ignited explosively, unlike kerosene. This indicates that the mixture had been put in both the gasoline and kerosene tanks at the barn.</p>
    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[236,1743,1146,428]]]'>Defendant delivered the 500 gallons of kerosene between 2 and 6 a.m. on October 2nd. No one measured or inspected the delivery, nor did anyone know whether the delivery filled the tank. A Highway caretaker requisitioned a 50-gallon drum of kerosene between October 3rd and 5th but was suspicious of its smell and made a fire test of samples, with the result that they flared up and he returned the drum as defective.</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.7",658,[233,2183,1145,210]],["BL_659.1",659,[128,385,1146,265]]]'>Two factual stipulations were made. One, before plaintiff’s case went on, was that a delivery was made to the maintenance building of the Highway Department on October 2nd, and that defendant Carmen Dick <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>denies that the delivery was anything other than kerosene. The other, at the end of plaintiff’s case, was that Sherer Oil Company had an exclusive contract with the Highway Department to supply it with kerosene and fuel oil for the maintenance barn in question.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[125,661,1149,1153]]]'>The foregoing is a résumé of the plaintiff’s evidence. Had a nonsuit been asked for it should have been granted, as there is no shred of evidence impugning the conduct of the defendant. Nothing more than his delivery of 500 gallons of kerosene has been shown, with his denial that it was anything other than kerosene. Between 2 and 6 o’clock on the morning of October 2nd, when defendant delivered the kerosene, until 4:30 to 5 o’clock in the afternoon of October 3rd, when the attendant filled plaintiff’s cans, it is as possible that someone else put gasoline in the kerosene tank as it was that defendant did. Two caretakers testified to their hours of work at the barn: Adamson, who worked from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on October 2nd, and from 4 p.m. to midnight on October 3rd, testified that a delivery of gasoline was made by the Atlantic Refining Co. between 8 and 10 p.m. on October 3rd; and Shirley, who worked from midnight of October 1st to S a.m. on October 2nd, and signed for defendant’s delivery of kerosene, but was not asked about gasoline deliveries.</p>
    <p id="b659-6" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[126,1825,1147,484]]]'>It is obvious that there are twenty-four hours, from 4 p.m., October 2nd, to 4 p.m., October 3, not covered by anyone’s testimony. Gasoline could have been put in the kerosene tank during those hours by anybody after defendant had put in pure kerosene; there is no evidence in the plaintiff’s case that his delivery filled the tank. It is also possible that gasoline was put into the kerosene tank before midnight of October 1st. This in itself would have justified a nonsuit.</p>
    <p id="b659-7" data-blocks='[["BL_659.7",659,[127,2321,1145,103]],["BL_660.1",660,[246,381,1142,819]]]'>Binding instructions would later have been justified as well by the uncontradicted testimony of defend<a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>ant. ' He was a commission agent who worked all alone with his truck delivering kerosene and fuel oil for Sherer Oil Co., the additional defendant. He did not make gasoline deliveries. He had two orders for kerosene on October 2nd, 500 gallons to the Highway Department and 130 gallons to a man named Cunkelman. He had a tank truck with four separate compartments in it, and it took three compartments to carry 618 gallons. For some reason best known to himself he didn’t put an extra 12 gallons in the fourth compartment on October 2nd, but set out with 618 gallons in three compartments. After delivering 500 gallons to the Commonwealth he drove back to Sherer’s base of supplies, took on the few extra gallons he needed, and returned to Cunkelman, where he delivered 130 gallons.</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[245,1210,1144,474]]]'>Cunkelman testified that he used the kerosene as furnace oil, regulated by a pilot light, and that he had no trouble with the 130 gallons delivered by defendant. This puts a stopper on the case because Cunkelman’s kerosene came from the same bulk as the Commonwealth’s, and if defendant delivered innocuous kerosene to Cunkelman he must, out of the same truck, have delivered innocuous kerosene to the Highway Department’s maintenance barn.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[244,1704,1144,537]]]'>Defendant specifically said that he drained his truck to make sure it was empty and then loaded it with 618 gallons in three of its compartments; that he had no gasoline on that load and no order for any; that he delivered no mixture of kerosene and gasoline; that before delivery the Commonwealth’s janitor measured the kerosene tank and found 64 gallons in it; that defendant ran 500 gallons of kerosene into it at 6:45 a.m., October 2nd, which filled it; and that he went directly from there to fill the Cunkelman order.</p>

Its <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>witnesses described its four distribution tanks holding four combustibles, showing that these products are brought to the tanks by one pipe-line and there put in the right tanks by a complex set of gate valves, and that anyone drawing off the product in any tank would have to climb to its top and manipulate the proper valve handles. It was from the kerosene tank here that defendant drew the kerosene that he delivered to the Commonwealth’s barn.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[130,883,1146,750]]]'>• Plaintiff makes two arguments for liability. One is that defendant may have' put the mixture of gasoline and kerosene in the Commonwealth’s tank. He makes the .argument very softly and then runs from it, since it would put all the blame on defendant and none on the additional defendant and hence would let the latter out of the case. The legal answer is that there are too many other possibilities of equal validity, such as other people adding gasoline or kerosene during the twenty-four hours unaccounted for or before the morning of October 2nd, and too many mysteries, such as the testimony of the mechanic indicating a mixture of fluids in both the gasoline and kerosene tanks at the Commonwealth’s barn.</p>

The trouble with this reference is that plaintiff is not offering circumstantial evidence in the instant case but only circumstantial supposition, such as the “less useful hypotheses” of <em>Garter. </em>The distinction appears in <em>Giordano v.

Plaintiff relies upon the <em>positive evidence </em>produced by him to establish the cause of the accident. Conrad testified that when he looked up, at the moment of the occurrence, the end of the plank held by the colored man was <em>right in the open space where the stone had been before it fell, </em>and, while no one actually saw the plank touch the stone, the conclusion is not only possible, if that testimony is true, but almost irresistible, that the fall of the stone was caused by the plank coming in contact with it. All other human agencies were excluded as causative factors because, according to Conrad, <em>there was no other person around there besides the negro.” </em>(Original emphasis)</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[237,1095,1145,640]]]'>The best that plaintiff has done is to suppose that defendant may have done all manner of negligent things, without any evidence, direct or circumstantial, that he actually did any of them. As we said in <em>Smith: </em>“Therefore, when a party who has the burden of proof relies upon circumstantial evidence and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom, such evidence, in order to prevail, must be adequate to establish the conclusion sought and must so preponderate in favor of that conclusion as to outweigh in the mind of the fact-finder any other evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom which are inconsistent therewith.”</p>

The simple answer is that he has shown no need to inspect out of which a duty could arise. He does not argue that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur or of exclusive control should apply, and hence he must prove, or at least suggest by the legal measure of suggestion, that more than the mere happening of an accident took place.

The system of tanks and valves was adequately described, but it does not show negligence to argue that such a system was capable of negligent use; there must be some showing, directly or circumstantially, that it was in fact abused. These ideas apply alike to active negligence and to its passive counterpart, the failure to inspect. The jury had no option but to guess what the defendant might have done.</p>

Johnston, the plaintiff in this case, was employed as a caretaker by the Department of Highways, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. One of his duties was to light and maintain warning lanterns and pot torches at danger spots along the State highways in his district.

Here he picked up a lantern whose fuel was about spent, lifted the globe, blew out the dying flame, and proceeded to pour the supposed kerosene into the fuel reservoir. Immediately the lantern exploded, his clothes caught fire, and before he and his co-workers could extinguish the flames he had sustained serve burns on the chest, neck, face, and left arm. He was taken to a hospital where he suffered excruciating pain. In describing the burns to his face, the plaintiff said: “It was a solid scab the whole way down around here, it just was cracked open and bled for I would say three weeks after I was burned, blood would seep right out of it.” When the wounds finally healed they turned into scars which will remain with the plaintiff for the rest of his natural life.

Is that impossible? Why must the Majority assume conclusively that Dick got the right handle when the facts could be otherwise? Certainly there was a mistake somewhere. The Majority wants to rule out all the understandable, palpable human errors and conjure up all the improbable, mysterious possibilities to explain away an error. This, in spite of the fact that twelve men and women, after a trial in which they saw the witnesses, appraised their credibility, and discussed the probabilities and improbabilities of the case, concluded that Dick was the man who was responsible for the confusion of gasoline and kerosene in the maintenance tank from which the plaintiff drew the fluid <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>which exploded in his face, inflicting scars which he will carry to his grave.</p>

It says that there are “too many other possibilities of equal validity.” It speaks of “mysteries”, it says that other people may have added “gasoline or kerosene during the twenty-four hours unaccounted for or before the morning of October 2nd.” Of course, it is a proverbial saying that everything is possible. It is even possible that some sprite blew gasoline into the kerosene tank. There is no limit to what can be fantasied, but an appellate court is supposed to be bound by a court record and is not to fly into the spaces of unlimited imagination.</p>

And it was from this kerosene tank that the plaintiff drew the gasoline-kerosene mixture which exploded. Are we to ignore these proved facts, especially when they have been vouched for by a jury, and decide a case on mere abstraction?</p>

The Majority seems to find in the plaintiff Johnston some devious intent in seeking redress for his injuries. The Majority almost treats Johnston as if he were some malefactor trying to unjustly fasten liability upon the defendant and additional defendant. Thus, the Majority says that the plaintiff argues the defendant “may have put the mixture of gasoline and kerosene in the Commonwealth’s tank,” but that he “makes the argument very softly and then runs from it, since it would put all the blame on defendant and none on the additional <a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>defendant and hence would let the latter out of the case.”</p>

He simply tells how, while faithfully attending to his job as an employee of the Commonwealth, a lantern exploded and disabled him. And then he lets the circumstances speak for themselves. Those circumstances do not speak softly. They shout the negligence, the almost criminal negligence of Carmen Dick in delivering a dangerous compound without exercising care. Those circumstances speak of equally culpable negligence of the Sherer Oil Company in allowing huge tanks of highly inflammable liquids to stand in the country unattended and unguarded, the prey not only of evildoers but to the greatest destroyers of all, mischance.</p>

The Majority admits that these two decisions are formidable ones. In fact it calls them “our recent siege guns on circumstantial evidence.” However, after calling them siege guns it proceeds to treat them, so far as this case is concerned, as if they were cap pistols. I am willing to accept those two cases in the terminology used by the Majority, as “siege guns” and will accord them <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>the respect which goes with such high-caliber legal artillery.</p>

The facts are for the jury in any case whether based upon direct or circumstantial evidence where a reasonable conclusion can be arrived at which would place liability on the defendant. It is the duty of plaintiff to produce substantial evidence which, if believed, warrants the verdict he seeks. The right of a a litigant to have the jury pass upon the facts is not to be foreclosed just because the judge believes that a reasonable man might properly find either way. A substantial part of the right to trial by jury is taken away when judges withdraw close cases from the jury.”</p>

This Court affirmed the verdict awarded her in the trial court. Justice Bok, writing for this court, cited with approval the <em>Smith </em>decision and then said: “The jury was therefore free to discard less useful hypotheses, such as a slight earthquake, the jarring of a passing truck, a small boy with <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>a slingshot, or a clumsy fellow customer.

The Majority Opinion, however, endeavors to differentiate the <em>Smith </em>and <em>Garber </em>cases from the one at hand by saying that: “the plaintiff is not offering circumstantial evidence in the instant case but only circumstantial supposition, such as the dess useful hypotheses’ of Garber.’ ” But this is merely a re-stacking of words. To refer to circumstantial evidence as “circumstantial supposition” does not change the facts which, taken in their entirety, justified the jury in concluding that the defendant was negligent in delivering the wrong kind of fuel. The “less useful hypotheses” referred to by Justice Bok in the <em>Garber </em>case, such as “a slight earthquake,” or “a small boy with a slingshot” certainly can have no application to the positive evidence submitted by the plaintiff here in proof of the negligence of the defendant, Dick.</p>

To take away that verdict on the strength of the numerous uninhibited possibilities indulged in by the Majority is, in my estimation, to mix theory with speculation, which is a highly dangerous compound to place in the lantern of law and justice.</p>
