With that conclusion we cannot agree. Article II, Section 4, restricts the type of “laws” that may be enacted by <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>the legislature at a regular session in an even-numbered year. It has no reference to, nor does it limit, any power of either House of the General Assembly except in respect of the enactment of laws. For example, this constitutional provision does not, as counsel for the plaintiff concedes, restrict the power of the Senate to approve appointments made by the Governor. Neither does it limit the right of the legislature to authorize committee investigations for any proper purpose. The right to investigate in order to acquire factual knowledge concerning particular subjects which will, or may, aid the legislators in their efforts to determine if, or in what manner, they should exercise their powers, is an inherent right of a legislative body, ancillary to, but distinct from, such powers. It is immaterial that laws drafted as a result of the legislative investigation can not be passed at the session at which the committee was constituted.</p>

A law is a bill that has been passed by a majority of the members of both Houses of the General Assembly and has either been signed by the Governor or has not been acted upon by him within the time prescribed by the Constitution after its passage by the legislature, or if it has been vetoed by the Governor, has again been passed by both Houses with an approving vote of at least two-thirds of the members of each House. Resolutions, on the other hand, may be adopted by either one, or both, of the Houses of the General Assembly and do not require the Governor’s signature or approval to validate them and are not subject to veto by the Governor.

An “act” is the appropriate term for it after it has been acted on by, and passed, the legislature. It is then something more than a draft or form. It has a legal existence as “an act” of the legislative body, because it becomes a law, without further action from any other branch of the government, if the executive takes no measures to prevent it.’ A ‘Bill’ has been defined to be ‘a form or draft of a law presented to a legislature for enactment’: Webster’s New International Dictionary. A ‘Joint Resolution’ has been defined by the same authority to be ‘A resolution adopted jointly by the two branches of a legislative body.’ A ‘resolution’ by the same authority has been defined as ‘A formal expression of the opinion or will of an official body or a public assembly, adopted by vote; as a legislative resolution.’ When the Constitution provided that ‘no law shall be passed except by bill,’ it meant by ‘a form or draft of a law submitted to the legislature for enactment’; it did not recognize a mere ‘formal expression of opinion’ as adequate to the <em>creation of a law.”</em>

Such is the predominant legally permissible purpose of a legislative investigative committee. There are, however, several ancillary purposes. For instance, the Senate may properly, as it sometimes does, constitute a committee of its members to investigate the qualifications of gubernatorial appointees whose confirmation requires Senate approval. The House may also investigate the conduct of any governmental official in furtherance of a possible exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction to institute impeachment proceedings. Article VI, Section 1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution expressly provides that “The House of Bepresentatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.” And, in this same connection, Section 2 of Article VI provides that “All impeachments shall be tried by the Senate ... [and] no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.” Thus, the members of the Senate actually sit in judgment on the truth or falsity of impeachment charges.

There is little force in this suggestion. While the legislature may not abolish the office, it can control the officer. They can regulate the performance of his duties, and punish him for misconduct, as in the case of other officers.

Havrilla, </em>38 Pa. Superior Ct., supra. In that case the Court dismissed a motion to quash the indictment because it was signed by a special district attorney who had been appointed by the attorney general to supersede the elected district attorney. This supersession was authorized by the Act of May 2, 1905, and it was unsuccessfully contended that this Act was unconstitutional. The Superior Court said (page 295) : “It is claimed that as the district attorney is a constitutional officer this act deprives him of his power. The argument presents the distinction between elected and appointed officers and contends that elective officers can only be removed by the governor for reasonable cause after due notice and full hearing on the address of two-thirds of the senate, and that because the district attorney is recognized in the constitution as a county officer his duties may not be controlled by the legislature. This view of the case overlooks the fact, however, that the constitution does not prescribe the duties of the district attorney. The legislature may not abolish the office, <em>hut it may regulate the method </em>

      <em>of its administration. </em>Cases may arise where by reason of personal interest or relationship or other sufficient consideration it would be highly improper for the district attorney to act. This has been taken notice of by the legislature and provision made for conducting the prosecution in such cases. This does not violate any right of the district attorney, nor impinge against any provision of the constitution. Such was the decision in Commonwealth v. McHale, <a href="/pa/97/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="97 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="444787" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0397-01">97 Pa. 397</a>.”</p>

Under the theory of the majority opinion, the legislature either could not enact any laws prescribing or regulating the powers, duties and limitations of a district attorney because of the fact that he is a constitutional officer, or the legislature could not investigate any actions or conduct of district attorneys even for the purpose of legislation. It seems absolutely clear to me that if the legislature has a right to legislate on a subject it has a right to investigate that subject, and if it has, as we have seen it does have, the right to legislate with respect to the powers, privileges and duties of a district attorney it necessarily follows that in the interest and for the purpose of wise legislation and good government it possesses and must possess the inherent basic fundamental right of investigation.</p>
