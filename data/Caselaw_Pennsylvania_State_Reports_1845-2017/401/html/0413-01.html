The record is otherwise devoid, undoubtedly because of the admission, of any evidence which shows the assertion to be the fact. Even though the admission here is made in an adversary proceeding, still the state’s interest in seeing that unlawful price fixing is not indulged in is of such importance that the mere admission by the adversary is not sufficient to provide the essential prerequisites necessary to invoke the statutory rights and exemptions provided by the act.</p>

Eminent authorities are highly critical of this exempting legislation on the grounds that it relieves distributors whose inventory consists largely of “fair-trade” products from the pressures and tribulations of price competition, and in general facilitates price fixing efforts on the manufacturing and distributive levels, contrary to the most elementary principles of a dynamic free enterprise system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The inclusion in the Fair Trade Acts of the provisos that the commodity must be “in free and open competition” with similar products and that competitors could not enter into fair trade agreements was to assure that these dangers of horizontal price fixing would be held to a minimum. Accordingly, in order to protect the consuming public from any possible price exploitation, it is of the utmost importance that the distributor seeking the benefits of fair trade establish in fact that he has complied with these statutory prerequisites.</p>
    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[120,1372,1145,814]]]'>So far as gasoline distributors are concerned, such proof is not without difficulties. In <em>Esso Standard Oil Company v. Secatore’s, Inc., </em>supra, the gasoline company not only supplied its gasoline to retail dealers but also sold direct to some ultimate consumers consisting mostly of operators of fleets of trucks. The court concluded that the gasoline company was in competition with the “non-signer” retailer defendant who also did substantial business with operators of fleets of motor vehicles, and held that retail price maintenance agreements between the gasoline company and third parties were illegal under the federal legislation and could not therefore be enforced under the “non-signer” provision of the State Fair Trade Act against the defendant.</p>

      <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>It also seems that in a given geographic area practically all the major brands of gasoline are sold at the same price. The federal courts have long held that business behavior which results in approximating competitor’s prices is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact-finder may infer agreement between the parties. <em>Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Filming Distributing Corp., </em><a href="/us/346/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="346 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6931622" data-case-paths="/us/346/0537-01">346 U.

If there is so-called “conscious parallelism” in fixing gasoline prices, it is certainly probative evidence that in fact gasoline is not sold in free and open competition. Since these conditions and circumstances prevail at least to some extent in the distribution of gasoline products, it is incumbent upon the appellee here to prove to the satisfaction of the court that it is not engaged in competition similar to that in <em>¡Secatore’s, Inc., </em>and that it is not a party to any agreement or conspiracy to fix prices.</p>

By its very nature, the gasoline industry does not clearly appear to be appropriately suitable for fair-trade usages. Virtually all retail service stations sell but one brand of gasoline, which, for all practical purposes, is their major product. There is little possibility of “loss-leader” selling by single product retailers. Apparently, gasoline companies buy and sell each other’s gasoline when temporary shortage conditions prevail, or to shortcut transportation costs, or to remove “wildcat” surpluses from the market, or for sundry other reasons. If the gasoline sold is other than that of the company’s whose name appears on the pump, little argument can be made that the prestige of the trade mark or brand is being protected. When these two basic reasons for fair trade are removed from consid<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>eration, the result is that the price and not the product is being protected. In such circumstances, grave problems arise as to whether a “non-signer” can constitutionally be bound to follow fair-trade restrictions. See <em>Burche Co. v. General Electric Company, </em>supra, wherein this Court sustained the constitutionality of the “non-signer” provision on the basis of the <em>Old Dearborn </em>decision.</p>
    <p id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[126,822,1149,1420]]]'>It is quite true that this Court has decided that “gasoline” as a commodity is within the protection of our Fair Trade Act under a literal reading of its provisions: <em>Sinclair Refining Company v. Schwartz, </em>supra. Indeed, the addition to our act of the phrase “or the vending equipment from which that commodity is sold to the consumer bears,” by separate amendment in 1941, Act of June 12, 1941, P. L. 128, leaves little doubt that our legislature intended fair-trade coverage to include the gasoline industry. We did not, however, decide in the <em>Sinclair </em>case whether consistently with the Constitution a “non-signer” could be forced to obey a fair-trade program set by a gasoline company, nor did we investigate whether the overriding federal legislation exempted gasoline from antitrust condemnation. The <em>Sinclair </em>decision went only so far as to dissolve a preliminary injunction pending a full hearing because the gasoline company did not show irreparable harm and failed to advance sufficient evidence showing that its product was “in fair and open competition with” gasoline of other producers. Before lending the power of equity to a program protecting resale prices of a product, widely used by the consuming public, the court below must thoroughly examine this problem of whether a gasoline company may validly resort to fair trade privileges.</p>

Mays, trading' as Mays Gulf Service (Mays), with the financial assistance of Gulf Oil Corporation (Gulf), purchased a gasoline service station in Reiffton, Berks County. To finance this transaction Mays borrowed $25,000 from the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. This loan was evidenced by two notes signed by Mays: one note for $6928.75 payable in five years and another note for $18,071.25 payable in fifteen years, both notes bearing interest at three and one-half (3%%) percent annually. Mays’ obligation to the Mellon Bank was unconditionally guaranteed by Gulf.</p>
    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.8",440,[247,1166,1145,801]]]'>To secure Gulf’s guaranty, Mays and his wife gave Gulf a mortgage, with accompanying bond, for $25,000 covering the gasoline station. On the same date, Mays and Gulf entered into two other separate agreements: a <em>sales </em>agreement and a <em>lease option </em>agreement. Under the <em>sales </em>agreement Mays agreed to purchase over a period of fifteen years <em>all </em>his requirements of “Gulf motor fuels” for resale at his gasoline station but not “less than 90,000 gallons of such motor fuels per annum”. Under the <em>lease option </em>agreement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Mays and his wife gave to Gulf “an irrevocable option” to lease the gasoline station for $200 per month, the option being for a fifteen year period and to be exercised upon the happening of any one or more certain specified conditions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

      <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>On March 26, 1959 Gulf filed an equity action against Mays in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County seeking to enjoin Mays from continuing to sell Gulf motor fuels at less than the stipulated prices. After a preliminary hearing, a preliminary injunction was denied. The matter then went to final hearing and, on December 30, 1959, a permanent injunction was granted by a divided court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> This decree permanently enjoined Mays from selling Gulf motor fuels at less than the stipulated prices.

In other words, the generally accepted principle that a properly alleged fact averred in a complaint and admitted in the adversary’s answer must still be proved if the Commonwealth— although not a party to the litigation — has a paternal interest therein.</p>
