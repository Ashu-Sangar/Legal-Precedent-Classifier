Interested in the Reverend Ridgeway’s work, the deceased, over a short period of time, contributed approximately $20,000 toward his personal comfort and ministry. Sometime later, the friendship of the deceased and the Reverend Ridgeway having ended, the deceased claimed that he had taken from her approximately $20,000 and, through a mutual acquaintance, the deceased prevailed upon Paul Huizenga, a Dade County [Miami] deputy sheriff, to investigate her claim against the clergyman. Huizenga and his colleague, Thomas, then a deputy sheriff, after an investigation of the matter became convinced and so advised the deceased that she had no criminal action against the clergyman. However, the deceased persisted in her complaint and, during the early part of 1955, she engaged Huizenga, in a private capacity, to keep the clergyman under surveillance. A short time later Huizenga abandoned his work for deceased and turned her over to Thomas. From that time until the date of her death the deceased and Thomas were in close contact. On various occasions Thomas and the deceased communicated by telephone and, shortly before her death, she posted a $250 money order to Thomas for the services rendered by Thomas and Huizenga.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>Under the Commonwealth’s theory, it was this close association of the deceased and Thomas during the first six or seven months of 1955 which set in motion the chain of events and the interaction of a host of circumstances and characters which led directly to Mrs. Rossman’s death. It is the contention of the Commonwealth that Thomas, through his close association with the deceased, learned that she customarily carried about on her person or in her living quarters large sums of money and that Thomas conspired with DeMoss, his former colleague on the Tulsa, Oklahoma, police department, to obtain the aid of two persons with criminal records, Ellsworth and Wilson, to rob the deceased. Wilson’s complicity and role in the events which led to the deceased’s death and the part played therein by Ellsworth and Wilson are discussed at length in <em>Commonwealth v. Wilson, </em>supra. While the Commonwealth concedes that Ells-worth and Wilson actually robbed and killed the deceased, yet it contends that Thomas and DeMoss actively participated in a conspiracy to commit the robbery. It is our task to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of record to justify a finding that DeMoss took part in a conspiracy to rob the deceased.</p>
    <p id="b418-4" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[244,1700,1145,696]]]'>DeMoss had become acquainted with Wilson in April, 1945 when, as a Tulsa detective, he arrested Wilson in connection with the commission of a burglary. Even though he was the arresting officer, at Wilson’s trial DeMoss attested to Wilson’s good character and volunteered a recommendation to the trial court that Wilson be paroled in his custody. When this arrest was made, DeMoss was assisted by Thomas with whom he worked on the police force from January 1940 until April 1949, at which time Thomas moved to Miami and found employment as a deputy sheriff. Both DeMoss and Thomas knew Wilson and his criminal inclination.</p>

In the early part of <em>1955 </em>— when <em>Thomas began his close association with the deceased </em>— suddenly Thomas began to make telephone calls from Miami to the radio dispatcher’s room in the Tulsa police department wherein DeMoss worked and almost every Sunday for approximately six months prior to June 4, 1955 Thomas made such calls.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> DeMoss claimed that these calls were made because Thomas was “lonesome”.

Through the media of this documentary and oral evidence, inexorably step by step modern methods of crime detection have been able to demonstrate upon this record a series of events which brought together four persons, geographically widely separated, in a conspiracy to rob this elderly woman. The series of contacts established between DeMoss and the three other individuals and the timing and locale of such contacts inescapably bring DeMoss within the circle of guilt and responsibility for this crime. The relationship between Thomas and DeMoss, two police officers, and Ellsworth and Wilson, two persons with criminal records, cannot be explained upon the ground of coincidence; under this evidence a jury could justifiably find that such relationship arose from a calculated plan and continued because of an interdependence among these four individuals that each share a particular part in the task to be accomplished.</p>

DeMoss wanted to get employment in Miami, according to his testimony, and to this end he left Tulsa, without luggage and on a holiday with reservations made immediately prior to his departure.

Although the evidence clearly shows that he could have secured a reservation directly to Miami on the same plane on which he travelled he went not to Miami, but to Tampa. When he arrived in Tampa, Ellsworth and Wilson, those persons who had robbed and killed the deceased, were in Tampa. While DeMoss says he stayed in the airport for approximately three hours, oral testimony places him in a night club with these two persons whom he had once arrested and documentary evidence shows that he then talked ¡by phone to Thomas. Within a short time he is in Miami with Thomas staying, out of all the hotels in Miami, in the very same room and in the very same hotel in which Ellsworth had stayed when he met with Thomas the day before. All these events take place within 24 hours of the robbery and homicide. Under such a series of events the rental of a safe deposit box at the Miami hotel acquires considerable meaning.</p>
