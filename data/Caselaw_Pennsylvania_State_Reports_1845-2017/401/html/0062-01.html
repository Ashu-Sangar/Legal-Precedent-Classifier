Intille, Deacon </em>and <em>Atkinson, </em>p. 1, ante, is that, here, the appellant, Goldie Watson, a Philadelphia public school teacher, relied upon the constitutional guarantees of the First Amendment, instead of the Fifth, in justification of her refusal to answer certain questions propounded by a Sub-committee (known as the Velde Committee) of the Un-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> concerning membership in and association with the Communist Party. Except for the indicated difference in plea in refusing to answer the Committee’s inquiries, the material facts of this case are substantially the same as those in the cases of <em>Intille, Deacon </em>and <em>Atkinson, </em>cit., supra.</p>
    <p id="b82-7" data-blocks='[["BL_82.11",82,[260,1719,1150,371]],["BL_83.1",83,[100,369,1155,971]]]'>Mrs. Watson became a regular teacher in the Philadelphia public schools in 1931 with tenure, after 1937, under the Public School Code. On February 17, 1954, pursuant to a subpoena, she appeared before the Congressional Committee. She gave the Committee her name, address and a resume of her educational background and employment record as a teacher. When <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>asked whether she had ever been a member of the Communist Party and similar questions relating to past Communist affiliations on her part, she declined to answer and explained that such questions in her view were “in violation of her constitutional rights and that she particularly relied on the First Amendment.” Within <em>one </em>day (viz., on February 18, 1954) Dr. Louis P. Hoyer, Superintendent of the Philadelphia Public Schools, re-rated Mrs. Watson “unsatisfactory” as a professional employee of the School District and suspended her from her position as a teacher in an elementary school. Dr. Hoyer sent her a letter informing her that she had been rated “unsatisfactory” as a result of her refusal to answer questions propounded by the Committee. On March 9, 1954, the Board preferred charges of incompetency against Mrs. Watson as a ground for her dismissal on Dr. Hoyer’s recommendation.</p>

Dr. Hoyer stated at the hearing that he had rated Mrs. Watson “unsatisfactory” on the basis of an official rating card prepared and distributed by the Department of Public Instruction of the Commonwealth and that, as the basis of his re-rating, he had checked three items listed on the card in respect of which he had found her deficient, namely, (1) civic responsibility, (2) judgment, and (3) appreciation and ideals. He testified that in his opinion Mrs. Watson, by refusing to answer questions of ■the Committee concerning her subscription to subversive doctrines, had exhibited improper civic responsibility, poor judgment and a lack of appreciation and .ideals. He also testified, however, that school records <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>showed that Mrs. Watson had been a competent teacher during all of the twenty-three years she had continuously taught in the Philadelphia public schools.</p>

Nor was she asked any questions by the Board or the Superintendent at the hearing until she offered to and did testify. She explained that she had refused to answer questions at the Committee hearing because she felt that the Committee was conducting an inquisition with no legitimate legislative purpose, that the members of the Committee were using the hearings for purposes of personal political aggrandizement, that the Committee had no right to inquire into her associations and beliefs, and that her freedoms of speech and association guaranteed by the First Amendment would be violated if she were compelled to answer the Committee’s questions. Both Mrs. Watson and Dr. Hoyer testified that she had spoken frankly to him in his office in October of 1952 concerning her loyalty and her membership in a number of organizations and that, at the conclusion of the interview, Dr. Hoyer had told her that he was satisfied that she had answered all of his questions satisfactorily.</p>
    <p id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.6",84,[262,1711,1152,372]]]'>On June 29, 1954, the Board dismissed Mrs. Watson from her position as a teacher on the charge of incompetency for her failure to answer questions of the Committee. She appealed from the action of the Board to the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the Commonwealth who, on January 17, 1955, dismissed her appeal and affirmed the action of the Board.</p>

Atkinson, </em>Phila. C. P. No. 3, December Term 1954, No. 8315. The reasons so assigned in the <em>Atkinson </em>case were (1) that a refusal to answer questions propounded by the Congressional Committee relating to alleged Communist affiliations of the witness renders a teacher “incompetent” within the intent of the Public School Code, and (2) that a discharge on the ground of incompetency for refusal to answer the Committee’s questions does not violate a teacher’s rights under the Federal Constitution.</p>

S. 109</a>), her refusal to ansAver the Committee’s questions did not render her incompetent as a public school teacher. Just as in the <em>Intille, Deacon </em>and <em>Atkinson </em>cases, here, also, the appellant did not refuse to ansAver <em>any </em>question of her <em>administrative superior </em>(Dr. Hoyer) and her employer Board did not ask her any. All that Avas produced at the hearing before the Board to support the charge of ineompetency against the appellant was a transcript of the record of her appearance before the Committee Avlien she refused to answer certain questions on a plea of constitutional right under the First Amendment so to do. If the privilege claimed was not legally available to the wit<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>ness in the circumstances, that fact would not serve to prove her guilty of the charge of incompetency in her position as a Pennsylvania school teacher with tenure.</p>

But, even that eventuality would not render the witness liable to a State penalty for having refused to answer the Committee’s questions on a plea of a constitutional privilege. As matters transpired in Mrs. Watson’s case, her plea of the First Amendment would appear to have been properly interposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> But, even if the plea was not validly lodged, the most that could be said of the witness’s refusal to answer the Committee’s questions was that she acted on a mistaken belief as to what her constitutional rights were under the First Amendment. The record in this case does not furnish the slightest inference, nor does anyone venture to suggest, that Mrs. Watson’s plea of the First Amendment was made either in bad faith or frivolously. Such being the unquestioned situation, “Obviously the State could not draw unfavorable inferences as to [her] truthfulness, candor or [her] moral character in general if [her] refusal to answer was based on a belief that the United States Constitution prohibited the type of in<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>quiries which the Committee was making”: <em>Konigsberg v.

Her appearance before the Committee antedated by more than five years the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Barenblatt </em>where it was held (five to four), in circumstances quite similar to the present case, that the First Amendment did not justify Barenblatt’s refusal to answer questions of the same Congressional Committee concerning Communism. We have referred to the division in the Court in <em>Barenblatt </em>only to stress the fact that, where four of the nine well trained legal minds of the Supreme Court hold to the opinion that the First Amendment justified Barenblatt in his refusal to answer the Committee’s questions, surely a person untrained in the law cannot justly be thought to be incompetent for entertaining a like opinion and acting upon it.</p>

This did not constitute lawful ground for the Board’s abrogation of the appellant’s contract as a professional employee of the Public School District on a charge of incompetency. As recognized in <em>Slochower v.

Speaking for the court, Mr. Justice Chidsey said, “We are satisfied that his refusal to answer the inquiry of his <em>administrative superior </em>constituted incompetency within our definition of that term.” (Emphasis supplied.) And, on <em>certiorari, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States recognized, in affirming, <a href="/us/357/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="357 U.S. 399" data-case-ids="6163316" data-case-paths="/us/357/0399-01">357 U.

The Board’s charge against the appellant being incompetency in her capacity as a teacher, she called twelve well qualified witnesses, according to counsel’s offers of proof, to testify to her competency as a teacher and to her keen sense of civic responsibility, sound judgment, and appreciation and ideals of citizenship. An objection by counsel for the Board to each of the proffered witnesses was sustained ¡by the Board on the ground that their testimony would be irrelevant and immaterial to the charge which was based exclusively on her refusal to answer the Congressional Committee’s questions. Whether the excluded testimony of the witnesses offered by the appellant would have been credible or not, it would seem to have been both relevant and material to her refutation of any appropriate charge of incompetency.</p>

She was asked about her participation, if any, in a movement committed to destroying the American school system, but Mrs. Watson declined to answer. According to Mrs. Watson’s reasoning, she could attend a school of instruction on how to make plans for the assassination of the President of the United States, and she still would be free from inquiry as to whether, as a school teacher, she attended such a school. Counsel for the committee, Mr. Kunzig, asked her a second time: “Have you ever attended any 'Communist instruction school at any place?” And her answer was: “Mr. Kunzig, I refuse to answer, specifically on the basis of my rights as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.”</p>

Mrs. Watson: <em>Mr. Kun</em>zig, I <em>have intimated that I am not going to answer your questions. </em>. . <em>.” When directed to answer, she said: “I will not answer” ... “I refuse to answer.”</em>

      <em> </em>These questions and answers are, in the minutes, interspersed with repeated references to the fact that the witness was, during it all, constantly consulting with ‘her counsel. Finally, she “took the First.” “Mr. Kunzig: Have you ever attended any Communist instruction school at any place? Mrs. Watson: Mr. Kunzig, I refuse to answer, specifically on the basis of •my rights as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. ... I refuse to answer on the basis of the First Amendment.” Mr. Kunzig then asked that “the record show that in voice and tone the witness has emphasized the use of the words ‘First Amendment.’ ”</p>

I still take the risks and the dangers because this position is very sacred to me.” Following which, when asked if she had taken the loyalty oath, she said: “I will not answer that ques<a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>tion.” (She later stated that it was a matter of public record that she had taken it.)</p>

But she returns to the scene in person in answer to the charges of her Superintendent at the board hearing. Now she explains, at length, the reasons that prompted her so to act. Now especially does she mirror traits of attitude toward the sub-committee that lead undeviatingly to the conclusion that she is, as charged, unfit to teach in the Commonwealth’s public school system. This is she: “Since the inception of the Committee in 1938 under the Chairmanship of Martin Dies, I had been of the opinion that this wasn’t a legislative committee concerned with investigating and then presenting laws; rather that it was an inquisitorial committee and that it was violating the First Amendment to the Constitution.” Referring to visits made to her before the hearing by committee investigators and specifically to requests by the latter to identify other people as communists, she said: “I told them that I have had a rule for twenty-two and a half years, that when a pupil walks to my desk he says I; that nothing would make me cooperate with the Committee. <em>I gave them a breakdown of what I thought about the Committee and its violation of all Americans’ rights and its dangers particularly to Negro Americans, and that under no circumstances would I cooperate with them.” </em>She then says that she “tried to convince” Mr. Fuoss (a committee worker) “of what real Americanism was. . . . Never has this Committee gone into any community and talked about un-Americanism as it affected Negroes. And therefore to me it wasn’t a committee really concerned with un-Americanism; that it was a committee that was an inquisition; and that the individual members of the Committee used the Committee as a political football to gain glory and <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>prestige in America . . . All my life I have dedicated myself to Negro children. I have attempted to convince them that this was <em>a country in which we could have ultimate real freedom. . . . </em>And it would have been the lowest type of moral courage and morals for me to have permitted myself to become a stool-pigeon and an informer because I had been informed on. I wouldn’t do it. I could not have returned to my classroom under those circumstances. So that when I appeared before the Committee that was my other reason. . . . When I walked into that room I knew that no power, no power on God’s earth could make me become a part of something that I thought was wrong; could make me show my boys and girls that I held the Constitution in contempt. Because for me to have participated in that inquisitorial investigation, to me, would have been showing that I did not believe in the Constitution. . . . I invoked the First Amendment, but I recognize very clearly the position of those people who invoked the Fifth. . . . And I say to you, gentlemen, that if the First Amendment no longer means anything, if my right to test this Amendment is a crime, we have reached a terrible state in America. <em>Democracy is running down the drain. </em>And Negro Americans will be able to achieve nothing in such an atmosphere.”</p>
    <p id="b107-4" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[119,1744,1154,537]]]'>This speech, which the board had before it when it deliberated upon Mrs. Watson’s fate as a school teacher, is “too much”! At the very least, it is <em>enough, </em>in my estimation, to sustain a finding such as was arrived at. The District Superintendent, the Board, the Pennsylvania Superintendent of Public Instruction, the lower court — all are agreed that Mrs. Watson is “incompetent” within the meaning of Section 1122 of the Public School Cof*e. But the majority of my colleagues would return her to her job by ordering her reinstatement.</p>

Her notice of suspension reads in part as follows: “. . . The reason for your suspension is that you have shown a lack of fitness to be a teacher in that you have displayed <em>conduct </em>unbecoming your professional status as a teacher.” The Statement of Charges declared that: “. . . Her <em>conduct </em>before the Sub-Committee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities is incompatible with her status as a professional employe in the Philadelphia public schools. . . . She showed <em>by her conduct </em>a lack of professional fitness to be a teacher. <em>Her conduct </em>makes her incompetent to continue in the service of the Philadelphia public schools, . . .” Upon cross-examination of the Superintendent of Schools who suspended her and preferred the charges, Mrs. Watson’s attorney unsuccessfully attempted to show that her refusal to answer was the sole cause of her dismissal: “by me. dorfman : Q. Dr. IToyer, you testified that the only real reason you suspended her was because she refused to answer these questions on February 17; is that correct? A. On the basis of her <em>appearance </em>before the Committee <em>and her action </em>there, yes. . . . MR. dorfman : Q. I just want to narrow it down. This was the only reason; is that correct? A. Her <em>appearance </em>before that Committee <em>and her reaction </em>to the Committee was the basis for the charges.” In answer to an earlier question by Mr. Soken who asked: “Q. Doctor, are there any other respects in which you consider Mrs. Watson’s conduct before the Committee as constituting unprofessional conduct?”, the Superintendent replied: “Well, <em>I considered Mrs. Watson’s </em>behavior <em>before the Committee of Congress to border on insolence. </em>And that also entered into my consideration at the time this decision of mine was made.” The basis of the charges, then, encompasses far more than a school teacher’s legitimate exercise of a constitutional <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>privilege. She has told the world and the children entrusted to her care what she thought of this subcommittee and has assigned her reasons, which I consider palpably weak, for her refusal to testify. Are those who, under subpoena, go to Washington to testify before duly constituted congressional bodies but who, instead, put on a show of contempt for Congress, are they thereby to become “untouchables”? Due Process? She had it! She received notice of suspension. She was afforded a statement of charges. She was given time to prepare for a public hearing. She appeared at that hearing in person and through counsel. Her attorney exercised the right of cross-examination. .She testified, briefly, on direct. She then made a prolonged, uninterrupted statement that covers seven pages in the record before us. She appealed to the Pennsylvania Superintendent of Public Instruction. She appealed from there to the common pleas Court. She was anything but railroaded to her destination of discharge by the board. Her rights were at all times respected.</p>

Board of Higher Education of New York City, </em><a href="/citations/?q=350%20U.S.%20549" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="350 U.S. 549">supra,</a> to have (1) been correctly decided, but, (2) absolutely no pertinence, relevance or control visa-vis the instant case. It is distinguishable on many very important grounds: See <em>Nelson v. County of Los Angeles, </em><a href="/us/362/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="362 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6162232" data-case-paths="/us/362/0001-01">362 U.S. 1</a> (1960). The City Charter there provided for automatic, summary dismissal. By it a discharge from employment, the conditions existing, was inevitable, made mandatory and, therefore, lacking in an allowance of discretion to the proper supervisory officials and in adequate protective procedures.
