S. 399</a>. The error in that conclusion is patent. What the Board of Education sought to accomplish in these cases goes far beyond anything that was either decided or implied by the opinion for this court in Beilan’s case. His adjudged incompetency resided exclusively in the fact that he had refused to answer questions of his <em>administrative superior </em>(Superintendent Hoyer) concerning matters deemed to have bearing on his qualifications as a teacher in the public schools of Philadelphia, and not that he had refused to answer questions of a Congressional Committee. That such was the <em>ratio decidendi </em>in the <em>Beilan </em>case is not open to question. Speaking for this court, Mr. Justice Chidsey said, “The secretiveness [of Beilan] consisted of a deliberate and insubordinate refusal to answer the questions of <em>his administrative superior </em>in a vitally important matter pertaining to his fitness. <em>Such conduct </em>stamped him with <em>incompetence </em>as a professional employe in the public schools.” (Emphasis supplied). And, the Supreme <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>Court of the United States, in affirming, recognized that such was, indeed, the rationale of this court’s decision, saying in that regard, — “He [Beilan] did, however, undertake obligations of frankness, candor and cooperation in answering inquiries made of him by <em>his employing Board </em>examining into his fitness to serve it as a public school teacher.” (Emphasis supplied). Neither in this court nor in the Supreme Court was the fact that Beilan had pleaded the Fifth Amendment before the Committee availed of as ground for the decision.</p>

In the Board’s brief on these appeals, it is stated (p. 16) that “The present cases differ from the Beilan case in that the teacher’s refusal to answer questions occurred before a Congressional Committee rather than before his administrative superior.” The Board also recognizes (Brief p. 16) that this court did not pass upon Beilan’s refusal to answer the Congressional Committee as a ground for his dismissal and that “. . . the Beilan case in the Supreme Court of the United States did not involve a dismissal where there was a claim of privilege against self-incrimination . . .”.

      <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>It stands ont too clearly for any misunderstanding that the <em>only </em>thing for which the appellants were dismissed by the Board was that they had refused to answer certain questions of a Congressional Committee upon a proper plea of privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. This, the brief for the Board of Education acknowledges ivhere it states (p. 3), “The charges were based on the refusal of the appellants to answer questions concerning their alleged membership in and association with the Communist Party under a plea of the privilege of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution during appearances before the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives, Congress of the United States.” Confirmation of the real basis for the charges is to be found in the Board’s rejection of Mrs. Intille’s offer of proof of her good reputation “because the charge against her was based solely on her appearance before the Congressional Committee” and the Board’s further acknowledgment (Brief p. 41), that “The charge against Deacon was that he refused to answer the [Un-American Activities] Committee, and [that] this was the incompetency”, viz., the incompetency for which he was dismissed as a teacher.</p>

Such being the unmistakable legal situation revealed by each of these appeals, application of the principle recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Slochower v.

      <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>Slochower, an associate professor in a college operated by the City of New York, was summarily discharged because, while testifying before the Internal Security Sub-committee of the United States Senate, he refused to answer questions concerning his alleged membership in the Communist Party in years past on a plea of privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. The particular Section of the New York City Charter under which Professor Slochower was discharged provided that, whenever an employee of the City makes use of the privilege against self-incrimination to refuse answering a question relating to his official conduct, “his term or tenure of office or employment shall terminate and such office or employment shall be vacant . . .” etc. Slochower was entitled to tenure under New York’s Education Law and could be discharged only for cause after notice and hearing with right of appeal. The Supreme Court held that his summary dismissal as a teacher denied him due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and, accordingly, reversed his discharge.</p>
    <p id="b31-3" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[123,1553,1154,814]],["BL_32.1",32,[239,381,1151,983]]]'>Counsel for the appellee in the cases now before us argues that all that the <em>Slochower </em>case decided was that he had been denied procedural due process. But, that was not all that the <em>Slochower </em>case adjudicated, as we read it. True enough, his summary dismissal without notice and hearing denied him procedural rights protected by the due process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment; and it is also true that the Supreme Court’s judgment of reversal. remanded the case “for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.” It is clear, however, that the open order of remand was required in the circumstances. The Supreme Court recognized that “The State has broad powers in the selection and discharge of its employees and it may be that proper inquiry would show Sloe<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>hower’s continued employment to be inconsistent with a real interest of the State.” Necessarily, therefore, what might subsequently be developed at a proper hearing was not to be foreclosed by the attendant order reversing Slochower’s dismissal, not only because of the manner in which, but also the reason for which his discharge had been effected. The <em>Slochower </em>case decided that “to discharge an employee merely because he relied upon the Fifth Amendment plea of self-incrimination to avoid answering questions which he would be otherwise required to answer” constituted a denial of substantive due process. Such was, indeed, the appraisal of the dissenting justices as to the intended scope and effect of the majority’s holding in the <em>Slochower </em>case (see p. 561 of 350 U. S.). And, that is what we take to have been the ruling in <em>Slochower </em>on the merits of the ground assigned by the Board for summarily dismissing him.</p>

The distinction is plainly immaterial. Hearing or no hearing, the dismissals in the instant cases were for the same invalid reason for which Slochower had been discharged, namely, the refusal to answer upon a plea of privilege under the Fifth Amendment before the Congressional Committee. Incidentally, the hearings given the appellants did not meet the basic requirements of procedural due process; they were not “full” hearings. But, we make no point of that presently except to note, in passing, that the Board’s evident anxiety to keep from appearing to be finding the appellants guilty of disloyalty by inference, drawn from their refusal to answer the Congressional Committee’s questions, had so submerged the alleged deficiency, with which the appellants were actually charged (and for which they were dismissed), viz., incompetency, that the Board failed to realize at Mrs. Intille’s hearing that the proof she offered, which was rejected as irrelevant, had a direct bearing on the question of her competency. Also, counsel for the Board objected at Deacon’s hearing to the reception of <em>any </em>testimony from him, including even an explanation of how he had come to join the Communist Party at an earlier time.

Nelson, who had tenure, requested and was given a hearing before the Civil Service Commission, the result of which was the confirmation of his discharge. Globe was denied a hearing because, as a temporary employee, he was not entitled to one under the Civil Service rules, which he did not dispute. On appeal the discharges were affirmed by the California District Court of Appeal, as above cited.

Several distinctions are to be noted which may have been persuasive with the majority in the <em>Globe </em>decision. For example, Globe, as a temporary employee without tenure, was dischargeable for any reason at any time, and without notice or hearing. His letter of dismissal ascribed his discharge to insubordination for failure to comply with a specific order. In answering Globe’s contention that his discharge was based on his invocation before the Committee of his constitutional privileges, Mr. Justice Clark, speaking for the majority said, “But the record does not support even an inference in this regard, and <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>both the order and the statute upon which the discharge was based avoided it.” Also, the court expressly distinguished <em>Globe </em>from <em>Slochower </em>on the specific ground that California had made a “choice of securing such information by means of testimony before a federal body.” No such choice has ever been, nor could be, claimed under Pennsylvania’s Public School Code. The “ ‘built-in’ inference of guilt, derived solely from a Fifth Amendment claim”, which the Supreme Court said in <em>Globe </em>was present in the New York statute in <em>Slochower, </em>is exactly what the Board of Education sought to “build-in” in the present cases without the activation of statute.</p>

The Supreme Court rejected the contention, saying in the <em>Adamson </em>case (which was an avowed re-affirmation of the conclusion in the <em>Twining </em>and <em>Palko </em>cases), “It is settled law that the clause of the Fifth Amendment, protecting a person against being compelled to be a witness against himself, is not made effective by the Fourteenth Amendment as a protection against state action on the ground that freedom from testimonial compulsion is a right of national citizenship, or because it is a personal privilege or immunity secured by the Federal Constitution as one of the rights of man that are listed in the Bill of Rights.” (pp. 50-51).</p>

Consequently, while the State may restrict the privilege against self-incrimination in State actions without violating the Fourteenth Amendment, it may not, as was done in the cases now before us, impose a penalty upon a citizen’s pleading in a Federal proceeding his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. To hold otherwise would be to render the Constitution of the United States less than “the supreme Law of the Land” which Article VI declares it to be, and would allow a State to do what the United States itself cannot constitutionally do, namely, nullify the privileges of the Bill of Rights in Federal proceedings. As is well known, the rights conferred by Articles I to VIII, inclusive, which embrace what is popularly known as the Bill of Rights, were originally effective against the Federal government alone.

L. 1726, 65 PS §211 et seq. In a proceeding under that statute a teacher may be discharged if it is determined “by a fair preponderance of the evidence” that he is a disloyal or subversive person; and “If the appointing authority shall be comprised of three or more members, a vote of two-thirds of the members shall be necessary in order to discharge a person.” See Section 7 of the Act (65 PS §217). What the Board of Education has attempted to do in these cases is to avoid the requirement of the Pennsylvania Loyalty Act that disloyalty or subversion, as a ground for the discharge of a public school teacher, must be proven “by a fair preponderance of the evidence.” The Board’s action evidences a belief that it has found a way to dismiss, without any evidence at all, teachers whom it suspects of disloyalty or subversion. Anything in the <em>Beilan </em>case to the contrary is herewith overruled for the future.

Although here he distingushes <em>Beilan </em>from the present case, arguing that Beilan was propertly discharged whereas Deacon was not, yet in the <em>Beilan </em>case he pleaded as earnestly for Beilan as here he pleads for Deacon. This is what ,the present Majority Opinion writer said in his Dissenting Opinion in the <em>Beilan </em>case: “Here is a case of a long-time public school teacher [Beilan], entitled by statute to tenure, who is deprived of his professional status and livelihood becauase he pleaded the <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer questions of a congressional committee, touching his loyalty.

      <p id="Au4" data-blocks='[["BL_59.2",59,[117,2116,1153,264]]]'>The point of this quotation is to show that in the view of the Dissenting Opinion writer in <em>Beilan, </em>Beilan was discharged because of what he did before the Congressional Committee. The Majority Opinion in <em>Beilan </em>sustained Beilan’s dismissal and, therefore, becomes authority and should be authority for this Court today, if stare decisis is a guide for us to follow.</p>
