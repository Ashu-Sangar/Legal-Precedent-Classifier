The owner himself testified to a fair market value of $225,000.

Nor can it properly be said that the verdict Avas against the weight of the evidence. The value of the land appropriated was the only substantial issue that the jury had to resolve. There Avas no dispute as to the extent of the property taken nor its location, condition, topographical characteristics or the plaintiff’s right to recover its fair worth. In arriving at a just determination of the fair market value, the jury had as criteria the customarily widely disparate opinions of the real estate experts who testified for the respective sides. It was the province of the jury to weigh the credibility of the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>valuation witnesses’ testimony and to determine wliat the land taken was fairly worth at the time of the condemnation.

The real estate experts produced by the county were admittedly well qualified to render their opinions of the property’s fair market value. In fact, the trial judge specifically recognized that one of the county’s two real estate experts had “good qualifications” and that the other was “well qualified.” It was not proper for the court en banc to act upon an unwarranted assumption that these witnesses were not as. credible as the witnesses produced by the plaintiff. Yet that is exactly what the court did by presuming to appraise the relative <em>credibility </em>of the opinion witnesses. In the existing disparity between the experts as to the fair market value of the property, only the <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>jury could competently determine which of such testimony was worthy of being reckoned with, and to what extent, as a guide to a just finding.

In other words, the remarks, thus belatedly attributed to counsel for defendant (who categorically denies ever having uttered them), were not made a matter of record either at the time of their alleged utterance or at any other time during the course of the trial, but first came into the case in the plaintiff’s 8th reason for a new trial which was as follows: “8. The Defendant’s Counsel in his opening remarks to the Jury stated * * * And you must remember ‘this is Taxpayers money * * * you are giving away Taxpayers money.’ ” Just what the deletions, which the asterisks indicate, were does not appear.

Specifically, it is incumbent upon complaining counsel to except promptly to offending remarks, when made, and move forthwith for the withdrawal of a juror. If the motion is denied, counsel is then in position to assign for error on appeal the court’s refusal so to act and thus have the alleged impropriety of the excepted-to remarks or comments passed upon by the appellate court. If complaining counsel wishes, however, not to have the trial continued and, consequently, refrains from moving the court for the withdrawal of a juror, but excepts none the less to the opposing counsel’s remarks, he should thereupon request the court to instruct the jury to disregard the alleged improper matter. The court’s refusal so to do, if excepted to, would likewise be reviewable on appeal as a ground for a new trial.</p>

Counsel for the appellee freely concedes that, if the record in this case as made at trial was all there was before us, he would have no standing whatsoever to urge the alleged improper remarks of counsel as justification for the new trial order. He urges, hoAvever, that this case is different since the court en banc, subsequent to verdict, constituted the alleged remarks, as set forth in the plaintiff’s 8th reason for a new trial, a part of the record. For that action, there was no authoritative precedent and, certainly, no justification. If the well-founded rule, which prescribes the manner in which improper remarks of counsel at trial must be brought upon the record if they are to be made the basis of a subsequent charge of trial error, were to be extended by permitting a trial court, after verdict, to augment or amend the record in crucial part on the basis of a disputed issue of fact between counsel, the rule itself would soon be abrogated, trial records would have no permanence and counsel would be at the mercy of the trial judge.</p>

The self-serving averments of disappointed counsel after verdict in an ex parte motion filed cannot be permitted to effect such a drastic and unwarranted condemnation.

West Chester Borough, </em><a href="/pa/220/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="220 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1005831" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0490-01">220 Pa. 490</a>, 499, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%201042" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="69 A. 1042">69 Atl. 1042</a>, a condemnation case, where the appellant, by specific assignment of error complained “of the affirmance of defendant’s thirteenth point for charge, by which the jury were instructed that plaintiff would not be entitled to have his damages increased because of delay in settlement, ‘if the jury find his demand was so exorbitant and unreasonable as to make payment of his reasonable damages impossible.’ ” In affirming, we declared that— “No fault can be found with this instruction as a sound proposition of law. The evidence showed that in the action of trespass brought in 1904 by appellant against the defendant, he laid his damages at the sum of $20,000, and in the testimony in the present case the same amount is claimed. The jury found the actual damages to have been $2,800. Such a discrepancy <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>might well be <em>deemed </em>sufficient <em>to </em>warrant the jury in refusing to allow any additional sum for the delay in making settlement.”</p>
    <p id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[257,547,1144,706]]]'>The foregoing ruling is peculiarly pertinent to the situation now before us. Here, the owner, as a witness at the trial, testified to a value of $225,000 for the property taken.. On cross-examination, he said, — “I priced my ground at $225,000 and I have no apology to offer.” And, his direct examination reveals that that was his price “as of November 8, 1956” — the date of the taking. The jury awarded him $76,000. Adapting the language of this court in the <em>James </em>case, supra, “Such a discrepancy might well be deemed sufficient to warrant the jury in refusing to allow any additional sum for the delay in making settlement.” The portion of the charge complained of was, therefore, not error.</p>

    <p id="b587-4" data-blocks='[["BL_587.5",587,[108,719,1156,1696]]]'>The case of (Jacob) <em>Hoffman v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/250/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="250 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1016957" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0001-01">250 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20322" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="95 A. 322">95 Atl. 322</a>, which the appellee cites and from which his brief quotes extensively, does not derogate in any way from the principle approved in the <em>James </em>and <em>Wayne </em>cases, supra. The appellee cites the <em>Hoffman </em>case for the proposition that it was error for the trial court to permit the jury to consider the withholding of the detention money for the reason that there was no evidence in the record to support a conclusion that damages for delay in payment should not be included in the verdict. Of course, where there is no evidence that the property owner was exorbitant or unreasonable in his price for his property, the law does not presume him to have been so <em>(Wayne v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em>supra), and there is nothing in such regard to submit to the jury. And that was the situation in the <em>Hoffman </em>case. There, the owner did not take the witness stand to testify to anything. Nor did his own valuation of his property otherwise appear in <em>evidence. </em>Obviously, he could not be found to have been exorbitant or unreasonable in his demands because of the valuations placed upon it by the expert witnesses he produced at trial. That the fact that the owner in the <em>Hoffman </em>case did not testify to Ms property valuation was crucial to the ruling was recognized in a case, growing out of the same condemnation, which came here later, (Benjamin) <em>Hofman v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/261/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="261 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1042249" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0473-01">261 Pa. 473</a>, 474, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20674" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="104 A. 674">104 Atl. 674</a>, where it was pointed out that “He [the owner] was not called as a witness in the case, and there was, therefore, nothing from him to indicate what sum he had claimed.”</p>

      <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>There could hardly be a clearer case than the present for submitting to the jury the question as to whether the owner was entitled in the circumstances to ’damages for delay in the payment of the compensation due him for his property.
