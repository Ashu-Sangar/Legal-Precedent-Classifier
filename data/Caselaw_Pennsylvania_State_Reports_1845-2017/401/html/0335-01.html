Reever, Administratrix of the Estate of Walter A. Reever. Walter A. Reever was the driver of the automobile in which plaintiffs were riding as passengers. The additional defendant filed an answer denying liability and any obligation for contribution because defendant had given Reever’s Estate (Walter A. Reever and/or the Estate of Walter A. Reever) a general release. Defendant filed a reply averring that the release was limited to a settlement of defendant’s <em>property </em>damage claim, by virtue of a prior written letter sent to de<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>fendant by Reever’s insurance carrier. The lower Court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the additional defendant. Defendant the Independent Oil Company, appealed.</p>

Its specific, as well as its very broad language, clearly releases the additional defendant from “any and all actions . . . claims . . . for damages ... or any other thing whatsoever on account of or in any way growing out of any and all known <em>and unknown personal injuries </em>and death and property damage resulting . . . from an occurrence or accident that happened on or about the 4th day of November, 1955, at or near Harrisburg, Pa.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
